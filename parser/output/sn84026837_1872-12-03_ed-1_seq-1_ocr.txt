/ ♦ 4 ♦ VOL. Ii XXXII.—NO. 210. WILMINGTON, DEL., TUESDAY, DEC. 3, 1872. PRICE 1 CENT. DAILY GAZETTE. t e and ''ï* in ells the and b. Who shall lbs Democratic Klpclors vote for has become a question,since the death of Horace Greeley. The New York Tribunk suggests that they vole for Gen. Grant. This would be misrepreeenling the men who elected them._ But w« presume the Sûtes, which like belawate failed to choose Democratic Electors, have very little right to dictate to those in which the Dem ocratic ticket was succeaaful* We presume it was this view cf the question which led the Democratic National Committee to decline to suggestions a to whom the several Electoral Colleges should cast their votes f >r. u KEEP COOL. I Our leader of last week, we understand, caused 1 , " , , n Radical camp. This we auticipated, ana therefore ere not at all alarmed. The Wu mington Republican and Smyrna Times evidently •ee in ear suggestion tome thing practical, and are somewhat excited at the idee thrown out that Del aware Democrat« know how to protect themselves. Well, gentlemen, wo mean business; hut don't get uervous We are not in favor of your disfi cbisement, and will do all we cau to protect you and all others in every just right. But we do mean, if our advice can prevail, to stop tho evil practices and frauds of your party, and to secure to the white men of Delaware, and the public offi ce« of the State, just protection from evil disposed and malignant partisans, who would annoy and prosecute them uuder Federal laws enacted and executed for partisan purjioae*. We mean, too, that a stop shall be put to migratory voting, uud to take from Radical Othell/s their occupation ol transferring from one county and one election K tectnet to auother hordes of negroes who really ave no abiding place in the State, as party exig enciai seem to require. Your party has offended against common decency aud outruged public jus t oe and individual rights in the late canvass and ought not to complain of the enactment of just laws by the Ueneral Assembly to prevent their repetition hereafter. Nothiug that is wrong uud will not oomrosud itself to the public approval is desired by any Democrat. All we want is protec tion from trauds aud the evil practice* of your party. This we demand as a right, uud doubt not we shall obtain by proper legislation. Against the enactment of such laws your protests are vuin, as will also the threats of streets blowers, who evince the spirit of cowards by supposing they can fright en somebody else. You ought to have protested as good citizens agaiust tho vile of \ d* which were attempted and pructiaed by your partv in this State as elsewhere iu the late cauvaos. You ought to have protested against making the Fe t erai courts auxilliury to tho design ot your putty ' in intimidatuig elect um officers uud others. Bui you justified and still excuse all the unholy prac tices of unscrupulous Radicals aud thereby become particeps ettminis. Repent in çackplp.th «-d util es of the evils past, and aid ogr efforts to provide ft rptnpdv agaplat {he^ repetition hereafter This i| your bouudeu duty as jourualisls aud goml citi seus, but if you lack the moral courage to do right, then we cau only say your ravings will prove impotent.
