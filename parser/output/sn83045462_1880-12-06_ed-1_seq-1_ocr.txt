THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE PrUoir.c<llz+r>s of '?>, & na'? ami How* of R?p resmtatirr.*: t I congratulate you on the continued and mj creaslngprosperlty of our country. By the favor | of Divine Providence we have been blessed, : Ourii g the pa^t year, with health, with abundi ant harvests, with prontable employment for ! all our people and with contentment at home, and with peace and friendship with other . nations. 'l he occurrence of the twenty-fourth election j of chief magistrate has afforded another onporI tunity to the people of the United states to exi h?blt to the world a significant example ot the peaceful and safe transmission or the power and authority of government from the public servants whose terms of ofiice are about to expire to their newly-chosen successors. This example cannot fall to Impress profoundly thoughtful people of other countries wltb tlie > advantages which republican institutions afj ford. Tne Immediate, general and cheerful ac quiescence of all good citizens In the result of the election gives grattrying assurance to our conn try, and to Its friends throughout the world, that a government bas-donttie free consent of an inte llgent and patriotic people possesses elements of strength, stability and permanency not found in any other form of government. Continued opposition to the full and free enjo\ mcnt of the rights of eltl/.enship, conferred j upon the colored people ty the recent amendi ments to the Constitution, still prevails in several of the late slaveholding states. It has. perhaps. not been manifest'-d In t lie recent ejection to any laige extent In acts of violence or i Intimidation. It has. however, bv* fraudulent practices In connection with the ballots, with t he n gulatlons a.-> t o t he places and mau ner of : vo'lng, and with counting, returning, and cani vasslng the votes cast, been successful in dei featlng theexercise of the right preservative of | all lights, the light of suffrage, which the Coui st it tit Ion expressly confers upon our ent'ran; cbised citizen^. i It is the desire of the good people of the whole country that sectionalism as a factor In our politics should disappear. They prefer that no : section of the country should be united In solid i opposition to any other section. The disposition to refuse a prompt and hearty obcdl enee i to the equal-rights amendments to the Constitution, lsaP that now stands in the way of a complete obliteration of sectional lines in our political contests As long an either of these amendments Is flagrantly violated or disre! garded. it Is safe to assume that tiie people who plactd them in the Constitution, as embodying Hit* legitimate r. -ults of the war for the i uion. ?:cd who fceiieve them to b*1 wise and necessary : will continue to act together, and to insist that ; they shall be obejed. The paramount piestlon i still is. as to the enioyment ot the right by ' every am< rlean citizen who has the requisite qualification, to freely cast his vote ml to have li honestly counted. With this question rightly settltd, theeountiy wilt be relle. d oi the contentions of the pant; bygones will ii.deed bo byi genes; ami political ai.d party issues with respect to economy and efivleu y of administration. internal improvements, the tariff, d )m->3t tic taxation, education, finance and other important subieets, will then receive their full share of attention; bur resistance to and nullification or 1 he rcsuMs of the war. will unite together In resolute purpose for their support all who maintain the authority o: the government i and the perpetuity of the union, and who adequately appreciate the value cf the victt ry achieved. This deterinlnation proceeds from no hostile sentiment cr feellncto anvpartof the people of our country, or to any cf their lnterists. The inviolability of the amendments rests upon the tundarnental principle of our government. They are the sclemu expression I or the will or the people or t he L'nli ed states. The sentiment that the constitutional rights or all our citizens must be maintained, does not , grow weaker. It will continue to control the government or the country. Happily the history or the late election shows that in many par's of the country where opposition to the fifteen! n amendment has heretofore prevailed, it is diminishing, and is likely to cease altogetbir. ir firm ar.d well-considered action is taken oy < ongress. i trust the House of H?oresentatives and the Senate, which have tiie right to Judge cf the elections, returns, and quilificatlons of their own members, will see to it that every case of violation of the letter or spirit of the fifteenth amendment is thoroughly investigated, and that no benetilt from such violation shall accrue to any person or par v. It will be the duty ot the Executive, with s iifleient appropriations for the purpose, to prosecute unsparir.^ly all who have b >en enga"-\1 in depriving chizens of the rights guaranteed ! to thtm by the constitution. it Is not. however, to be forgotten that th l best and surest guarantee or the prim ir rights or cir.zet.3bip is to be round la tha' Capacity for self-protect ion which can belong or.:-,- to a people whose right to universal sun r ire is supported by universal education. Tin mean^ at the command <?f the local and state whorl ties are. in many cases, wholly inadequate to t irni.-h free instruction to ah who neeu it. This is -specially trr.e where, before emancipation. rhe cduca'loncr tl;. people was neglected or prevented. in the Interest of slavery. Firmly convinced that the subject of popular education deserves the earnest attention of the people of ! the whole country, with a view to wise and comprehensive action by the government of tte United state?. I respectfully recommend that congress, by suitable legislation and with proper saffguara-, supplement the loeal educa tlor.al tunas in the several states where the grave duties and responsibilities of citizenship lave been devolved on uneducated people, bj devoting to the purpose grants of the public lanas, and, if necessary, bv appropriations from the Treasury of the t nited suites. Whatever government enn fairly do to promote free popular education ought to be dune. Wherever . general education l.s found, peace, virtue and social ordei prevail, and ci vil and religious liberty are secure. in my roimer annual messages. I have a* iced the attention cf Con ;ress' o th urgent necessity of areiOTi.iaticnof thecivii-servl.-.svstemorthe government. Mj v.- coi rnit \ the dangers of patronage, or appointments tor personal or partisan considerations, have been strengthened by my observation and experience In the Kxecutive od.ee, aLd i bcheve these d ing-rs threaten the stability of the government. Abuses so serious in their nature cannot be permanently tolerated. They tend to become more alarming with the enlargement of admlmarative service, as the growth ot the country in pop'datlon increases the number of officers and placemen employed. The reasons are imperative for the adoption of liNed rules tor the regulation or appoint ments prorr,otions, and removals, es'abiiMh'n;' a uniform method, having exclusively lu view in every instance, the attainment ot the best qualifications tor the position In question, such a method alone is consistent with the equal il,'ht of all citizens, and the most economical and eU.clent administration of the publi'- bu^i ness. competitive examinations, in aid ot Impartial appointments and promotions, have been eonau? t? d for some years past in several of the executive departments, and by my direction this sjstem has been adopted In the custom-houses and post offices of the larger cities or the country. in the elly or New York over two thousand positions In tae civil service have been subject, in their appointments ana tenure or pia^e to the operation or published rules for this pur**'~e during1 he past two years. The results of these priii Meal trials have be n very satisfactory, and have confirmed my opinion In favor of ^ :^o'!n or ^."cyon. All are subjected to h . ' tiie r(*?>uU la free from preI luaice by pei ->onal ravor or partisan influence I It Secures toi the position applied tor. the best . aljt.i atlon- attainable amonij th<* omoetln" i applicants, it is un effectual protection from the pn ssure ot Importunity which, under any eourse pursued, largely exacts tne time vltaV?rtnoii ?.r aPP?,nUl g o'tioers, to tie ir nfrf ^'(rrt i ? ',1auhi*rge ot other oni :i;tl du l*.. pr venting tiie abuse or the .ser\i\> for the mete muherance of private or partvrDurposes, ai d leaMng the employe of the govern mcnt. ined from the ohheations hnt>o?Vi hv p trorage. to defend sohiy^^rS? rl I t' ltl- ti and advancement, and with this eon j -tant ince ntive to exert lot and improvement 1 lie-e Invaluable results have been attained ! in a high decree In the oilier where the rules j for appointment by comjietliive examination I have wen a [piled. ; A method whl< h has so approved it self t>y experimental tests at points where such tes i ma) fairly be considered conclusive, should be e.xt. nded to all subordinate positions under thgovernment. I believe that a strong and grow lr g public sentiment demands immediate measures for securing and enrorclng the highest passible efficiency ir. the civil service, and us proj te t'on tw?m rcy-ognlzed abuses, and that the experience referred to has demonstrated the j feasibility of such measures. The examinations In the custom-houses and po-t ofiices have been held under many embarI rassments and without provision for compensation for the extra labor performed bytneofflj cers who have conducted them, and whose commendable interest in tne Improvement ot the public service has Induced this devotion of time and labor without pecuulary reward. A con| tlnuanee or these labors gratuitously ought not to be expejted, and without an appropriation , by^congress for compensation, it lsnotpracti, cable to extend the system of examinations | eritrai!) thrcugbout the civil service. It is also highly Important that all such examinations should be conducted upon a uniform system and under general supervision. Section 1753 of the Revised Statutes authorizes the Prisldent to prescribe the regulations for ad mission to the civil seivice of the United States, and for this purpose to employ suitable persons to conduct the requisite inquiries with rererenee to "the fitness of each candidate, in respect tc age. health, character, knowledge and ability, for the branch of service into which he seeks ti enter;'' but the law is practically inoperative for v ant of the requisite appropriation. 1 therefore recommend au appropriation 01 $25,000 per annum to meet the expenses of a commission, to be appointed by t he President in accordance with the terms of this section whose dutj It shall be to devise a just, uniform, and efficient system of competitive ex ami n a Hons, and to supervise the application of the same throughout the entire civil service of the govei nment. I am persuaded that the facilities which such a commission w 11 afford for testing the tltne>s of those who apply tor office wiil not only be as welcome a relief to members of Con gress as it will be to the President and heads of departments, but that it will also greatly tenc to remove the causes of embarrassment whlcu now inevitably and constantly attend the conflicting claims of patronage between the leglsla tlve and executive departments. The mosl effectual cheek upon the pernicious competition of influence and official favoritism, in the bestowal of office, will be the substitution of at open competition of merit between the appll cants, in which every one eau make his owe record with the assurance that his success wli depend upon tills alone. I al<o recommend such legislation as. wlill< leaving every officer as free .as any other cltiz?*r to express his pclltleal opinions and to use hi; means for their advancement, shall also enable him to feel as Fare as any private clti/.en it refusing all demands upon his salary for politi cal purposes. A law wldch should thus guarantee true liberty and justice to all who are engaged In the public service, and likewise eon tain slrlngent provisions against the use oi official authority to coerce the political action of private e'ti/.ens or of official subordinates, h grt atly to tc desired. The most serious obstacle, however, to an improvement of the civil service, and especially to a reform in the method of appointment, and re moval, has been found to be the practice, undei what is known as the spoils system, by whfet the appointing power has been so largely encroached upon t>y members of Congress. The tirst step in the reform or the civil ser.lce must be a complete divorce between Congress and the Executive in the matter of appointments, The cornrptlng doctrine that "to*the victors be long the spoils" iInseparable from eongresslonal patronage as the established rule and practice of parties in power. It comes to br understood by applicants for office, and by the P? opie generally, that Representatives and Seuators are entitled to dl-^ourse the patroua^e oi their respective districts and states. 1! is not necessary to recite at length the evils resuitlu" from this Invasion of the Executive functions! 1 he true principles of government on tin subject of appointments to office, as stated in the national conventions of fbe leading parties oi the country, ha\e aguln and again been approved by the American people, and have no', been called in question In any quarter. These authentic expressions of public opinion upon this all Important subject are the statement ot principles that belong1 to the constitutional structure of the government. "I nder the constitution, the President and heads of departments are to make nominations for cilice. The Senate is to advise and consent to appointments, and the ilouse of Representatives is to accuse and piosecute faithless officers. The best Interest of the public service demands that these distinctions be respecitvithat Senators and Representatives, who be judges and accusers, should not dictate appointments to office. To this end the co-operationof the legislative department of the government is required, alike by tne necessities of the case and by public opinion. Members of Congress w ill not be relieved from'the demands made upon them with reference to appointments to office until, by legislative enactment, the pernicious practice is condemned and for bidden. It is therefore recommended that an act be pasted deflning the relations of members of Congress with respect to appointment fa o:1i :c by tne President, and i also recommend that the provisions of section i7<>7, and of the sections following, of the Revised Statutes, com prising the ten ure-of-office act. or March i i?;7 be i epealed. Relieving that to reform the system and methods oi the civil service in our country is one of the highest and most imperative duties of statesmanship, and that it can be permanently done oni.\ by the co-operation of the Legislative Executive Departments oft he Government,! again commend the whole subject to your considerate attention. it is the rece>gni.'*a duty and purpose of tti" people of the United States to suppress pjlvg amy where it now exists in our territories and to prevent Its extension. Faithful and zealous eftort1- have been made by the t nltcd s*at es au thcrltles in Utah to enforce the laws against it. Experience has shown that the legislation upon this subject, to be effective, requires extensive modification and amendment. The longer action is delayed, the more difficult it will be to accomplish what is desired. Prompt and decided measures are necessary. The Mormon sectarian organization which upholds polvgamy has the w hole power c>r making and executing the local legislation of the territory. By it.-> con trol e?r the grand an t p. tit juries, it possesses large influence over tin administration of justice. Exercising, as the head- of this sect do, the local political power of the territory, they are able to make effective their hostllltv to the law of Congress on the subject of polygamy, and, in fact, do prevent its enforcement. Polygamy v. ill not be abolished if ilie enforcement oi the law depends on those who practice and uphold the crime. It can only be suppressed br taking away the pel It lea! power of the sect which encourages and sustains it. The power of congr< ss to enact suitable laws to protect the territories is ample. It is not a case for halt-way measures, t he political powe r of the Mormon sect is increasing: it controls now one of our wcathlest and ma->t populous territories, I i extending steadily into other territories. Wherever it gees it establishes polygamy anu sectarian political power. The sanctity or marriage and the family relation are the cornerstone of our American society and civilization. Religious liberty aLd the separation or church and state are among the elementary ideas o; free institutions. To re-establish the interests and princlph-s which polygamy and Mormomsm have imperriilcd, anu to fully reopen to intelll gent and Urinous lmmgrantsot allcrecdsthat part of our domain which has been, iu a great degree, closed to general immigration by intolerant and Immoral institutions, it is recommended that the government or the territory or t tah be reorganized. 1 recommend that Congress provide for the government ot I tah by a govcrner and judges, or commissioners appointed by the President and coc'irme'd by the senate?a government ana'.agous to the provisional government established tor the territory northwest of the oillo by the ordinance oi I7--7. if, however, it is deemed best to continue the existing form ot local government. I recommend thai the right to vote, hold oiiice*, and sit. on juries In the territory or Utah, be confined to those who neither practice ntir uphold polygamy, if tborough measures are adopted.it is believed that within a few years the evils which now attllct l tail will be eradicated, and that this te rritory will in good time become one ot tike most prosperous aud attractive of the new states of the Union. our relations with all foreign countries have been those of undisturbed peace, and have presented no occasion for concern as to their continued maintenance. My anticipation eit an early rep!} rrom the British government to the demand or indemnitv to our fishermen for the imurles suffered by that industry at Fortune Bay, in January 1-7which I expressed in my last annual message! was disappointed. This answer was receivet OLly in the latter part or April in the present year, and, when received, exhibited a railure o: accord between the two governments, as to rhe measure or the Inshore-fishing privilege sex;ured to our fishermen by the Treaty of Washington ot so serious a character that l made it the subject of a communication to Congress in which I recommended the adoption of the measures which seemed to me proper to be taken by this government In maintenance or t he rights accorded to our fishermen under the treaty, and towards securing an indemnity for the injury these lnte;rests had suffered, a bill to carry out these recommendations was unler consideration by the House or Representatives at the time of the adjournment or Congress in June last. Y?'.' k'.'J a few weeks I have received a communication from Her Majesty's government, J.? eonslueratlon ot the subject, both i(aJ- oJi1 for the injuries at Fortune i'lt.'.u'he Interpretation of the treaty In Tin .,Lprevt0U9 correspondence had shown h7,?n W,^?ove/n^nla t0 be at variance. Upon topics the disposition towards a nil wt>nt ,s manifested by a recognli ? an Indemnity for the transortune Bay, leaving the measure of Vn lecPnt ? fllrtller conference, and by f?, ?2hh5, v or this governmont, pre* Prpvlotis correspondence, that the conflicting interests or the shore fishery of the Provincial sea-coasts, and the vessel nsbery or our fishermen, should be made tbe subject of conference and concurrent arrangement between the two governments. I sincerely hope that tbe basis may be found for a speedy adjustment of tbe very serious divergence of views in tbe Interpretation ot tbe . fishery clauses of the Treaty of Washington. which, as the correspondence between the two J governments stood at the close of the last ses; fcion ot Congress, seemed to be irreconcilable. ! In the important exhibition of arts and inI dustries, which was held last year at Sydney. ; New South Wales, as well as in that now in I progress at Melbourne, tbe United States have i been efficiently and honorably represented. * * We have concluded and ratified a convention with the French republic for the settlement of claims of the clt l/ens of either country against the other. * * * A congress to coii. slder means for the protection of industrial i propeity has recently been in session in Paris, | to which 1 have appointed the ministers of the i i nlted states In France and In Belgium as dele< gates. The international commission upon I weights and measures also continues its work i in Pari?, l invite fr.vour attention to the neces, slty of an appropriation be made in time to j enable this government to comply with Its obligations under the metrical convention. our friendly relations with the German Em plre continue without Interruption. At the recent International Exhibition of Fish and Fisheries at Berlin, the participation of the United States, notwithstanding the haste with which the commission was forced to make Its preparations, was extremely successful and meritorious, winning for private exhibitors numerous awards cf a high class, and tor the country at large the principal prize of honor offered by Ills Majesty the Emperor. There have been some questions raised between t he two governments as to the proper effect and Interpretation of our treaties or naturalization, but recent dispatches from our Minister at Berlin show that lavorable progress is making toward an understanding, in accordance with the views of this government. * * During t he last summer several vessels belonging to the merchant maiine of this country, sailing in neutral waters of the West Indies, were fired at, boarded, and searched by an armed cruiser of the Spanish government. The circumstances, as reported, Involve not only a i private Injury to the persons concerned, but also seemed too little observant or the friendly i relations existing for a century between this j country and Spain. The wiODg was brought to the attention of the Spanish government in a serious protest and remonstrance, and the matter 13 undergoing Investigation by the royal [ authorities, with a view to such explanation or ! reparation as may be called for by the facts. j i 'J lie commission sitting in this city for the I adjudication of claims of our citizens against i the government of Spain, is, i hope, approaching the termination of its labors. The claims against tbe United Scales under the Florida treaty with Spain were submitted to congress for its action at the late session, ar.d I again Invite your attention to this long; standing question, with a view to a !lnal disposition or the matter. At the invitation of the Spanish government a conference has recentiy been held at the city of Madrid to consider the subject of protection by foreign powers of native Moorsin the empire or Morocco. The minister of the United States in Spain was directed to take part in the dellb eratlons of this conference, the result of which is a convention signed on behair of all the powers represented. The instrument will be laid before the Senate for its consideration. * * The consular treaty concluded with Belgium has not yet been oitielally promulgated, owing to the alteration of a word In the text by the Senate of the United States, which occasioned a delay, durir g which tbe time allowed for ratitlcation expired. The Senate will be asked to extend the period for ratification. The attempt to negotiate a treaty of extra- : diilon with Denmark failed on account ot the objection of the Danish government to the | usual clause providing that each nation should ! pay the expense of the arrest of the persons j whose extradition it asks. The provision made by Congress, at its last j session, for the expense of the commission ! which had been appointed to enter upon negotiation* with the imperial government of China, on subjects of great interest to the relations or the two countries, enabled the commissioners to proceed at once upon their mission. The Imp. rial government was prepared to give prompt and respectful attention to the matters brought under negotiation, and the conferences proceeded with such rspidlty and success that on the 17th of November last t wo treaties were signed at Pekin, one relating to the IntrodueUon of Chinese into this country and one relating to commerce. Mr. Trescot. one of the commissioners, is now on his way home bringing the treaties, and It is expected that they will be received in season to be laid b -fore the senate early in January. Our minister in Japan has negotiated a convt ntion for the reciprocal relief of shipwreck' ! seamen. I take occasion to urge once more upon < ongif ss the propriety of making proI vision for the eroction of suitable tire-proor I buildings at the Japanese capital for the use of : t he American legation, and t he court house and jail connected with it. The Japanese gover.u! ment, with great generosity and courtesy, has j offered for t his purpose an eligible piece of land, j In my last annual messase I invited the at1 tentlon of Congress to the subject of the lndemj nlty funds received some years ago from China and Japan. I r?new t he recommendations then I made.rhatrwhaievc r portions of these funds are 1 due to American citizens should be promptlv I paid, and the residue returned to the nations, ! respectively, to which they justly and equita i biv belong. i | The extradition treaty with the kingdom of : the Netherlands, which has been for some time I in course of negotiation, has, during the past j year, been concluded and duly ratified, i illations of friendship and amity have been t established between the government of the l nlted states and that of lloumania. We have se nt a diplomatic representative to Bucharest, j and have received at thi-s capital the special I envoy, who has been charged by his Koyal I Highness, Irlnee Charles, to announce the < ; independent sovereignty of Itourna&ia. We j hope tor a speedy development of commercial j j relations b?Hw<en the two countries. In my last annual message I expressed the i 1 hope that the prevalence" or quiet on the border ' between this country and Mexico would soon bf come so assured as to justify the modification cf the orders then in force, to our military commanders. in regard to crossing the frontier, i w tthout eneou raging such disturbances as would endanger the peace of t he two countries. Events moved in accordance with th?se expectations and the ciders were accordingly withdrawn, to the entire satisfaction of our own citizens and the Mexican government, subsequently t hepeace of the border was again disturbed bv a savage foray, under the command ot the Chief \ ietorio, but. by the combined and harmon'ous action of the military forces of both countries, his band has been broken up and substantial! v destroyed. Thereto reason to believe that the obstacles w hich have so long prevented rafid and convenient communication between the United States and Mexico by railways, are on the point or disappearing, and that several important enterprises of this character will soon b -set on foot which cannot fall to contribute largely to the prosperity of both countries. I New envoys from Guatemala, Colombia, Bolivia. \ enezuela, and Nicaragua have recently arrived at this capital. The relations between this government and that of the United States of Colombia have engaged public attention during the past year, mainly by reason of the project ol an inter-oceanic canal across the Isthmus ot Panama, to be built by private capital under a concession from the Colombian government for that purpose. * The views which 1 expressed in a special message to congress in March last, in relation to this project. I deem it my duty again to press upon your attention, subsequent consideration has but confirmed the opinion '-thai it is the right and duty or the l nlted States to assert and maintain such supervision and authority over any Incer-oceanlc : canal across i he Isthmus that connects North and South America as w ill protect our national mi e rest.7' The w ar between tbe republic of Chili on th? one hand, and the allied republics of Peru and Bolivia ou the other, still continues. This government lias not felt calleo upon to inter reie in a contest that Is within the belligerent rights of the partiesaslndependenistat.es. We nave, however, always held ourselves in readiness to aid in accommodating their difference ?. ? .6 at different times reminded both beljgjents our willingness to render such se*r our good ofiices, in this direction, were rew.ac^pPJ^d by all the belligerents, and it & y would prove efficacious; but I regret to announce that the measures, which "^ministers of the United States at Santiago yljirw-ra authorized to take,with the viAv to bring about a peace, were not successful. In the course of the war some questions have arisen encctlng neutral rights; m all of thesp the ministers or the United States have iIK their instructions, acted with promptnera an/i energy in protection of American Interests The relations of the l nlted States with th-? ""P'reof Brazil continue to be most conlLii and their commercial intercourse steadUvtn' crcasef, to their mutual advantage. y U~ The internal disorders with which the Artrp* tine Republic has for sometime past beerf af flicted, and which have more or leSilm>ne^i Its external trade, are understood to have berni brought to a close. * * ? 06611 In bamoa, tho government of King M^lletoe under the support aij(i recognition of t he consular representatives of the United stat' s. Groat | Britain and Germany, seems to liave riven Seaee and tranquility to the islan.ls. While it oes not appear desirable to adopt as a whole the scheme of tripartite local government, which has been proposed, the common interesta of the three great treaty powere require harmony in their relations to the native trame of government, and this may be tk-st secured by a simple diplomatic agreement between them, it would Do well if the consular jurisdiction of our representative at Apia were increased in extent and importance so as 10 guard American interests in the surrounulnir and outlying islands of Oceanica. The obelisk, generously presented bv the Khedive of hgypt to the city of New York, has safely arrived In this country, and will soon be erected In that metropolis. A commission for the liquidation of the FgypTlan debt has latelv concluded its work, and this government at the earnest solicitation of the Khedive, has acceded to the provisions adopted bv it which will be laid before ?"orgress for Its information. A commission for the revision of the Judicial code of the reform tribunal of Egvpr is now in session in Cairo. Mr. Farman, consul general and J. M.
