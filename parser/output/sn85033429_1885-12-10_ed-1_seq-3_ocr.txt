HERALD AND TRIBUNE. PUBLISHED EVERT THURSDAY BY THE HERALD ANDTRIBUNECO. At $1 a Year, in Advance. JONESBORO, TENN., DEC. 10, 1883. Louis J. Jennings, the American edi tor, is a member-elect of the new British Parliament. The Mormons threaten bloodshed un less the prosecution of the Edmunds law is abandoned entirely. . Canon Faruab says one of the respon sibilities of this nation is to "strangle the growth of mammon worship." If Congress went about it earnestly it might give the country a presidential succession law as a Christmas gift. The new Civil Service Commission an ' nounccs itself ready for work. Well, the work is ready for it. Let the merry wheel go round. Mexico begins to feel natural once more. After an astonishing number of weeks of peace, it Is having a first-class, old-fashioned revolution The new Legislature elected in Dakota on the 3d of November will have thirty members in the Senate aud ninety-eight members in the House. Only two or three are Democrats. After hearing from the Atlanta local option election the Democratic Nashville American concludes that "old John Bar leycorn has broken the color line in poli tics" In that locality. , The totul vote of Nebraska this year reaches 120,847, a fulling off of 7355 from the vote of lust year. The Republican nluniltv is about 1000 lurjrer than H was in the presidential poll. The public debt Increased more than f4,000,000 during the month of Nov ember. A Democratic administration seems to believe that this country is big enough to owe everything. TiiEitEniust be at least twenty-two men of sense among tho Democrats in Congress. It will take only that number, acting with the Republicans, to kick the tariff linkers down the back stairs. The Prohibition movement in Georgia is a menace to the political solidity of the South. For that reason, if thero were no others, its growth is full of promise to the cause of intelligence and progress. The best way to fill a vacancy in the vice-presidency, nccording to the Louis ville Courier-Journal, is to reconvene the Electoral College which elected tho de ceased and have It choose his successor. Pkehioent Cleveland's reasons for not attending the Hendricks funeral ore satisfactory to himself, at all evicts, and that is the main thing. There has been a great deal of unnecessary fuss over this matter. Tiieue Is an cx-vice-Presidcnt alive, It seems, whom everybody has forgotten for many years David ' R. Atchison, of Missouri, who, in 1853, was chosen by tho Senate to fill the placo of vice-Presi dent Wm. R. King. Notwithstanding all reports to tho contrary, tho Cleveland Leader asserts that there is every reason to believe that the Republican members of the Ohio Legislature will be solidly in favor of Sherman's re-election. Ohio's registry law has been pronounc ed unconstitutional. It follows from this that tho fellows who enacted tho law meant well enough, but didn't know how. Less politics nnd more hard senso arc long felt wants in Ohio. Commenting on thcdcclslon of.tho State Supreme Court declaring the registry law unconstitutional, the Cincinnati Commer cial remarks despairingly that "pretty nearly everything seems to be unconsti tutional in Ohio just now except forgery. " The New Orleans ricayum warns Democratic Congressmen from the South thnt any tampering with the tariff, tho effect of which will check Industrial in terests in that section, will bo fraught with danger to the man who at temps It. Tub Democratic Exccutivo and Legis lature of Texas show so much iucompo tenco in governing the State that tho Leg islaturo has to be constantly called to gether In extra session. A second special session of the present body is contem plated. One of tho devices of the Democratic county boards in Virginia to lessen tho Republican vote was to mix tho returns. In Northampton county 1530 votes were given to II. C. Wood for attorney general when he was the Republican candidate for lieutenant governor. I Indian Commissioner Atkins, In Ills report recently published, urges that the civilization of the Indian is possible, and that it wilt be brought about by agrlcul- ; turo. An instructive fact Is the Increase of over 18,000 acres In tho land tilled by tho Indians during tho past year. OiUKCTon IIolman, of Indiana, having returned from an expensive junketing " trip through the West at Government ex pense, anuouueca that Congress must practice tho most rigid economy. Wo in fer from this that Holman will lead in the investigation of Dormau B. Eaton's bill for slxty-flvo cents' worth of glngor pop used In reforming tho corrupt civil service last summer. General S. B. Buckner, who sur rendercd'to Grant at Fort Donclson, mid then befriended his conqueror when tho latter was stricken by disease and debt, la a candidate for tho Democratic nomina tion for governor of Kentucky. If he gets it he will receive moro Republican votes than any Democratic enndidnto has polled In Kentucky In an ago. The funoral of vIco-Prcsldont Hen dricks has again shown, as like occur rences have before, how coherent and deep is our national life and how little party and State lines stand between public appreciation and a blameless character and an upright life. The best of a man's acts aud career remain for example when the worst of his politics ceases to be of practical barm. Secretary Esdicott'b anuual report is oue of the least interesting papers that has ever issued from the War Depart ment. It contains no recommendations, save one tao appointment of an assistant to relieve him of the duties which his predecessors have found no difficulty in performing. Tho document is merely a rehash of tho reports of the generals of the army and the various bureau officers. THE 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. A Document of Great Length, Contain ing Many Recommendations and Soma Vary Positive Opinions. The President's missage was read to congress Tuesday. It is of such great length as to make it Impossible to pub lish the full text in tho Herald and Thiuune, and we have only room for a few words on the subject this week. The following summary of the main points from tho Knoxville Journal give a good idea of the matter presented. We shall give an extended synopsis of the document next week: The main points of the message, in the order given, is first, tho tariff question. The President insists that with the pres ent demands upon the treasury, the ques tion of free trade and protection are not questions for general discussion. He thinks some reduction should be made in the tariff, but thinks that tho idea of pro tection should not be lost sight of. His position on the silver coinatre ques tion is clear and unequivocal. He is in favor of the sus)cnsion of silver coinage and gives reasons at length. It must be admitted that ho presents his views on tli in question with much force, and sup ports his position with plausible if not strong nrgumcnts. He shows that ho re gards this as the most important question in his message, by devoting more space to It than any other. His vigorous remarks touching our nlfti'uc spot, Mormanism, will command universal approval. He reiterates what he has heretofore declared on the subject of civil service reform and commits him self to a further trial of the civil service laws as thev now stand, the nractical on crations of which depend largely upon the rulings of the commission which has their execution in charge.
