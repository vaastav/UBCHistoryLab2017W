It is asserted that i t the conference which has been culled f ir tho settlement of tho difficulty, a luw treaty will be proposed, omitting all re ference to tlie neutralization of the Black Sea.

The ((iiestion is of easy solution, a question that in some measure has been answered in the late eleetioiis,where the party in power have been weighed in the lialance and found wanting. They discover that power is about to depart from them; they have- become alarmed at thi.- growingjintelligeiice of Uhe peo ple, anil Uiey tremble at tho prospect be fore them. Their failure to intimidate wholo communities of brave and intelli gent voters by the parade of military force, they find this has had an effect contrary to their expectations. Will they profit by the experience of the past ami cca.se making inroads upon the rights and liberties of the people? If Tennessee should be reconstructed for the pui-pi.se of retaining power in the hands of the Radical party, the gn at State of New York, the States of Ken tucky, Missouri ami other Democratic States may expect like treatment; as these States are regarded equally disloy al. It is to be hoped that tho Radicid party will reflect upon the probable con sequences of an attempt to subvert the Government by turning it into a great military d"spotisni, coutroih d bv one de partment alone, the Congress, instead of the Executive ami Judicial as checks up on each other, as designed by our fore lathers of blessed memory.

Might Cossimkraiii.k surprise is expressed in "Washington ut tho election of Governor .'ance to the United States Senate by t''e Legislature of North Carolina, to nuc'-ed Senator Abott. A careful exam ination of the Thirty-ninth and Fortieth Con '.Tresses, and of the first session of the Forty-second, show that his political (disabilities for participation in the re bellion have never been removed, and it is tho general opinion that Congress will certainly refuse to relieve him now, and 1 is ndinission to tho Senate, i.., therefore regarded here by Republican Senators I-; very doubtful. It ii supposed that t friends of ex-Governor Vance will urgn in his favor thut he opposed seces sion until tho State of North Carolina vent out of the Union, and that during Vw war he was elected Governor by the people of that State on a platform op posed to the Confederate) Administration.

In Minnesota, for instance, at a public meeting in Ohnstead county which gave nearly fifteen hundred Radi cal majority two years ago, a prominent Republican was interrupted in his at tempt to give the usual li.:Ury of his party uud claim for it the credit of hav i'.vr saved the country, &c, by a sturdy uid fanner who wunted to know some thing about the tariff. The speaker re plied that lie did uot propose t discuss that question just liov. That in fact he had not given it serious consideration, and proceeded in the customary vein. He was again interrupted by tho asser tion that his audience knew all they want ed to know about the Republican party. But they did want to know something about the tariff, and was udmoni hed that if he couldn't instruct them on that point, he had better go home and send onie one to thoni who could. The revo lution in thai district was complete. It went Revenue Rel'cnn by about v. thous and majority. They expei t to secure the Speakership of the next House by the assistance ot tlie Democrats, who will they think, vote with them rather than lend their aid to ward the election of a high tariff man. "While we have no idea that this move ment will result in the formation of an independent party ut presort, it is help ing to cripple und break down Radical ism. Now is the time for Democrats to stick together. Many of these malcon tents, when I hey find that the mountuin won't go to them will do the next best thiug and come to the mountain. There can be but two great parties in the coun try; and as the National Democratic par ty is daily gait; i rig strength and influence, and the Radical parly daily losing both, it is not piubublo that the firmer will break itself up for the purpose of giving ascendancy to a new movement. "While tho dominant party is undergoing dis integration, let the Democrats bo firm and watchful, and the day may not bo fur distant wheu we will again, North South, East and "West, live once more under a Constitutional form of Government.
