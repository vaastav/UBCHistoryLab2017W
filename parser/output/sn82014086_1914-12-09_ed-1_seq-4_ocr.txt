President' Wilson in his second an nual message personally delivered to uongTess maintains the commendable habit of brevity. He -puts what he has to say In such form that it is not mads tiresome by its length, when read or listened to. In outlining- the program for the short session he has coma directly to the point. concerning various Questions of much importance And characteristic of his past lnolina tlons has told congress iost where he stands and what he expects it to do. Tinder the heBef that having toeen started they should he finished by this congress, he urges the passage of the two measures concerning the de velopment of our natural resources, with proper safeguards, and the en couragement of greater power devel opment from the rivers of the country. Extraordinary efforts are urged in vjew of tha extraordinary circum stances which prevail. And for the same reason attention is directed to the necessity of congress meeting the opportunity furnished toy new mar kets through the entrance Into gov ernment ownership 'of steamships, even though "it may seem a reversal of the natural OTder of things." The president also takes a ftrra stand in behalf of the bill for giving In creased self government to the FhH Ippines, for a survey of the coast of Alaska as an aid to the development of that territory and the confirmation of the convention for safety at sea. Reserving for the last he wisely de clares for government economy with out shaping any direct policy for its attainment and declares that "we have not been negligent of national de fense" as If in refutation of the claims being advanced in behalf of an inves tigation of our preparedness for war. "When In reference to our naval ipol icy he declares "there is no new need to discuss if there is serious doubt whether such will bo the view taken by congress. It is well that the cres- dent, in presenting the various ques tions has urged congress to "face them . without partisan feeling like men who have forgotten everything but a com mon duty. MEN AS

Many are the instance where fires have occurred In the very way "an-, ticipated, meaning: that wfcUe the danger has beea recognized lite or nothing: has been done to prevait it. Disastrous results have even foil-owed where ' warning has . been given, toy officials having the promer authority and all because there is a disposi tion to Ignore proper precautions. By a recent decision of the appel late division of the supreme court in 'ew, York state such a failure toa comes a risk of the owner,, to the ex tent' that he is held responsible for the cost of putting out ouch a fire. The, Greenwood Cemetery; association, owner, of a factory trofidiJigr which was 'burned "asc January, must pay the fire department of New York $1,500 for the eervieee which the aaaociai ttona negligence made necessary, -the estimate being that of the fire com misaioiW, In the action the conten tion was that the responsibility for. the spread of the fire beyond tha base ment rested with tbVassoclation sines it had failed to comply -with the or der of the bureau of fire prevention to install automatic sprinklers after the danger the situation had been point ed out. . This is a step which is tooand to prove of much Importance . la every state in, the country. Buildings where fire danger exists deserve to receive immediate attention, not only for the Interest of the owners, tout fop the occupants -and the neighbors. This added obligation is (bound to give in creased attention thereto, it is just what is needed to bring about a great er realization of responsibility. GJOLiTTl SHEDS NEW LIGHT. ' A saw light 'and one of much im portance has been shed by ex-Premier Giolittl upon the present war in Europe by his statement to the Italian chamber of deputies relative to the claim of Austria that Its move against Servia was one of last resort follow ing the assassinations. It discloses added reason for Italy's action in withdrawing from the triple alliance and it indicates that the assassina tions were simply tha pretense for action which had been under consid eration for soma time. According . to the former premier, Austria, almost a year before, sought the attitude of Italy upon plans being formulated in Vienna to attack Servia. It was hoped to secure the consent of Italy to such a more, but more se rious consideration was given to the meaning of an such action, or at tack and Italy refused to nave any thing to do with It. Giolittl hit the nail on the head when he declared that Austria had no cause and said: "It is an action she accom plishes on her own account. It is not defensive because nobody thinks of at tacking her. It is necessary to de clare this to Austria in the most for mal manner, hoping that Germany will act to dissuade Austria from a very dangerous adventure." Thus it was apparent to Italy that not only was it an unwise move, but it was not called to act. since the triple alliance called for aid only in case of attack. Moreover it ' indicates that Austria was simply waiting for an excuse to leap upon and crush Servia, the growth of which was the cause of much ipent up enmity; THE 

MANN LAW. Ever since the Mann white slave act was put Into operation, there has been a number of arrests made there under because of the greater severity of action under the federal law than under the state laws, which though capable of handling the cases have not proved of sufficient terror to pre-r vent them. The federal law was enacted for the purpose of placing a check upon the interstate traffic in women and in that direction alone it has been found to be an effective means of reaching those engaged In such a business. More frequently, however, has it been In voked for the regulation of private morals and a conspicuous case of this kind is now before the country, with the law toeing called upon to do some thing for which it was not Intended. If the existence of the law can have its good effect upon such cases well and good. ' The country will profit therefrom, but it is not a case of white slavery such as the law was intended to cover. It is not a case of Interstate traffic in women which the law was expected to prevent. Advantage has been taken of this piece of legislation to extort -blackmail, since it Is one and not both parties who are considered as violators of the law, and by such use of the law there is no telling how extensive have been the operations la this direc tion. For what the tew can do as a reg ulator of morals there might toe ap preciation even though it exceeded its original purpose, but when it comes to aiding in the commission of other crimes, it is time to think that it needs an overhauling. EDITORIAL NOTES. Wars are terrible things, tout sc are the elements. "Now that the police of Chicago are tinder fire, the New York department can extend its sympathy. President Wilson has lengthened his message perceptibly, but it is still within the limit of reason. - Until we get the Petrograd side of it there is reason to believe that the German retreat was strategical.

FAMOUS TRIALS TRIAL OF, OR. BUCHANAN. When Dr. Bobert W. Buchanan was arrested in New York on June 6. 18&2 lor the poisolnng of his wife, it was the beginning of a long litigation toe fore the authorities could so complete ly connect him with the crime as to convince the jury of his guilt. This was not possible until April 26 of the following year, and mora than two years elapsed before he was finally brought to justice. ur. Buchanan was a JNova scotian. who had been living in Jfew York for 13 years herore the murder was com mitted. While a practising physician there he married Annie Patterson, in 1883, and procured a divorce from her in 1S80. Shortly afterward he mar ried Mrs. Anna B. Sutherland, but be fore doing so he prevailed upon her to win to him the various property she possessed. After living together nearly two years, in April, 182, Qfrs. Buchanan was taken suddenly ill and two physi cians were caued upon to prescribe tor ner, tout she died on April 22. 1892 The body was embalmed and interred two days latter, where it remained nn til July 5, 1S92. when it was removed to the Carnegie Laboratory in Xew lorn tor examination. The death, owing to the peculiar actions of Dr. Buchanan, was looked upon as irregular, and at the examina tion unmistakable signs of the Dres- ence of morphine were found in the stomach. When the specialists made their report Dr. Buchanan was accused or poisoning his wile, and he was ar rested, charged with murder. Three days later he was indicted. The. trial was begun on March 23 1S93, and continued until April 26. It was not until March 3$. -when Assist ant '.District Attorney CrBeirne pre sented the case to the court that it was made evident that its character was more than of the usual interest. ana inac it Dore a very close resem blance to the wife poisoning case of Catf-lyle Harris, which bad been Of re cent occurrence. During the trial considerable testi mony was produced resardins- Bu chanan's comments on the stupidity of Carlyle Harris, and also the pleasure ne expressed at ms wire's death, and how after ' he had administered the last dose to her he left the house and did not return- until after her death. Several days were consumed in the expert testimony as to the evidence or poison m tne stomach. -On April 20, Buchanan took the stand in his own defense. He was exceptionally nerv ous during the ordeal. The taking of evidence was concluded on April 91. It required several day for a summing up of tha case and the Jury returned a vertnet or guilty on April 26. enortiy erterwara a motion was made for a new trial. Which waa de nled, and on Aug. 14. 1898. Buchanan waa sentenced to die during the week Deginning Oct. . An appeal was taken to the Court of - Appeals and was argued before that court on Jan. sl 1893, toot it merely confirmed the con viction of the lower court. Then the prisoner was resentenced to die April 24, but a petition for a atay on a writ of error was presented to the United States entweme- court on April it. Later Chief Justiee Poller denied the stay and preparations were made for the execution. Mrs. Buchanan, the first wife of tha doctor, and whom bo remarried after the deatn of his second wife, made an an teal for mercy to Gov. Morton, and the Governor respited Buchanan for a week.

THE WAR PRIMER By National Geographic Society Suez Canal -"From the morning history, the West has sought to break into the Cast by way of Suez. Some where during the years lScO-1300 B. C, the Egyptians, under Seti I and Barneses IL joined the Nile by way of Lake Timsah to the Red Sea, thus opening a waterway, the archetype of the present canal, from the -Medi terranean, over the Suez Isthmus, to the Orient. This canal was choked by sand in the course of ages. Nacho, about 0o B. C. began a canal from ancient Bubastls, and Darius Hystaa pis, one hundred years later, complet ed the work, once more bringing the Bed Sea and Nile together. Although nearly choked up toy the beginning- of the Christian era. it was navigable to a degree as late aa the Battle of Aetium, and soma of Cleopatra's ships escaped this way to the Bed Sea. "Trajan restored the canal. Tt fell into disuse and choked up again. Amru, the Islamic conqueror - of Egypt, restored it for tha last time in the 7th century, connecting Cairo with the Red (See. Napoleon caused the old route to be surveyed, but was forced to drop the project. After him. Ddetterniich, the great reactionary Prime Minister of Austria-Hungary stimulated a Sues commiaion in '1847. Nothing, however, came of tt. "As the world well knows, tha Sues Canal was built by the man who fail ed to touild the Panama Canal Count Ferdinand de Lesseps.

"In 1869, ten vessels passed through the Sues Canal. In 1612, B.8T8 ships steamed through, of 2fl,78,H9 net tonnage, and paying- for thia privilege around 23.O0,000.
