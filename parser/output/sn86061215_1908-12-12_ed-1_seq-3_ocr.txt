v. r. SATURDAY, December 12, 1908. Tri-Weekly Courier. BY .HE COURIER PRINTING CO. Founded August 8, 1848. Member qf the Leo Newspaper Syndlcafa, A. W. LEB .President 3.1. F. PC WELL THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. The extreme length of the presi dent's last message to congress is due largely to reiteration of former state ments made by the president, and not because of the treatment o£ new questions hot previously discussed by the executive in his public utterances and messages. It may be taken as review of the president's position on the questions which have come to bo called the "Roosevelt policies." The Chicago Tribune believes that the present message will not fail of the criticism which has greeted most of the presidential utterances, that it will be complained of as too long, as reiterative and as platitudinous, bu' the Tribune holds that the message represents an advance of the presi dent's main position which will be found more significant in the retro spect than it does perhaps now. The Tribune says ot the message: It is a document which will be read by a nation of ninety millions, and will convey to the collective mind Ideas which will fructify widely. It is, in other words, an utterance of great moment, which will have a per vasive and lasting effect upon the so cial and political present and future of the republic. President Roosevelt, as he himself has said, does not try to compel, but to lead public opinion, and his practical statemanship has kept him from getting too far away from those he leads. His messages, and. very notably his latest message, are remarkable expressions of the newer convictions and aspirations of the American people. They are es says in political democracy, formulat ing the better purposes and aspira tions of-oui people, and leading us on to our next stage of development. The sophisticated and the cynic may sneer at its truisms, but in public documents and as militant expres sions of practical political policy these truisms are dynamic facts to be dealt with. SI The president's reference to the in- f'compatibility of the Democratic par­ ty's positions on centralization and on the trust problem is more specific than ever. They are "twin denuncia tions" as he declares, which nullify each other. It is well at this time t.o have it driven home, even at the ex- flon iense of reiteration., that centraliza in business has taken place in large measure and must bp met, in BO far as ntfeds to be controlled in the public interest, by the central government. It is well also to have it recognized that combination and concentration are an .inevitable eco nomic tendency, to be accepted ami taken advantage of, not wildly and disastrously tilted against. It is well also that certain interests of the na lion which transcend state lines like the conservation of our national resources— must be dealt with by the national government and from the national point of view. The Tribune takes the view that the president does wall to repeat for cibly these important facts of our economic and political present, and to remind the American people that the national power was created by the •founders of this nation for the ex press purpose of meeting all nat'onai needs as they should develop, A

The report Jfshows that for every ton of coal pro-(HtU(Hps jyear from fires alone was 50 per cent iof the value of new buildings eon- jstructed in that year, and that enough natural gas Is escaping into the atmos phere to light all the cities of the United States of more than 1,000 population. It is asserted in the report that ap proximately $1,000,000 a day is being wasted in coal mining and other min eral production. At the present rate of waste it is estimated that the coal supply will be exhausted before th-.i middle of the next century. The same Is held to be true of high grade iron ores, petroleum, natural gas and high grade phosphate rock. There seems to be a need for the creation of a permanent conservation commission, with powers delegated to It by congress and'with appropriations to carry on the work as recommend ed by the committee in its report. The governors of the thirty states present at the session of the congress might profitably give thought to this ques tion as well. The investigations upon which th? report was made may not have been thorough enough to definitely approxi mate the available supply and the de gree of waste, and the figures given the report as to the extent of the waste and the predictions as to the early exhaustion of the supply should not be considered in any other light than that of an estimate. The sub ject is of such importance, however, that the country can well afford '.o take every means to get at the bottom •.« of the matter and make jpl^ns for.the ''s future ajaMt'lngly.- MR, 

WILKINS. Mr. Wi I kins had a dollar, so lie said lie guessed he'd pay A little sum he'd borrowed from a gentleman named Gray Then Gray he took that dollar, apd he said "It seems to'me I'd better pay that little-debt owe to McAfee Then McAfee the dollar paid upon a bill to Smart^^^ By Smart 'twas paid to Thompson, and by Thompson paid to And so that coin kept rolling as a very busy ''plunk," Until it paid indebtedness amounting in the chunk To more than forty dollars, and it may be rolling yet, And all because this Wilkins thought he'd better pay a debt. For when a dollar's started On its debt-destroying way, There hardly is a limit To the sums that it will pay. Mr. Wilkins knew a kindness that he might have done for Gray But he wasn't feeling kindly, so he thought it wouldn't "pay." Then Gray, not being grateful, said, "It really seems to me I've done sufficient favors for that, Wasted McAfee. Then McAfee felt ugly, and he took a whack at Smart, Who passed it on to Thompson,-who passed it on to Hart.:, And so no act of kindness was done through all that day But many an act that rankled in a most unpleasant way And many a soul was longing for the help to fit its need. And all because this Wilkins didn't do a kindly deed. For a dollar or a kindness, Rule is still the same, I say If you wish to see it rolling. Better start it on its wav. GET TO WORK ON TIME. Every time A was five minutes late, also lost five min utes waiting for liim. Then 0 lost another five minutes waiting for B, and so on through the entire shop, until A's few minutes' lateness were multiplied into hours and days lost for the firm in the course of a year. All of which leads up to the saving that promptness and punctuality are the very essence and keynote of good business, and the lack of them the cause of most failures. Without, punctuality a business is like an army without proper discipline. .Every business house has its regular hours for working. All commencing together at the same time means machine work. Every time you are late morning and noon, the business is not getting what it is paying for, because it loses the effective altogether machine work. 1 1 OPPORTUNITY. MILTON'S ANNIVERSARY.

He was passionately fond of" books as a boy. pursuing his with ai, Educed half a ton has been wasted, that! foundation for the disease of the eyes is the waste of structural materials last I wl.jch was Master of human destinies am I Fame, love and fortune on my footsteps wait.

Condemned to failure, penury and woe, Seek me in vain, and uselessly implore 1 answer not, and I return no more." excess that laid the gnallv to inflict the pen- altv of blindness. Milton is best known by his "Para dise Lost." which Drydeivcalls: "One of the greatest, most, noble and most sublime poemtj which either the age or nation has produced," and he places Milton on the same footing with Homer, Virgil and Tasso. To this is added the testimony of Hume, the English historian, who said: "It was during a state of poverty, blindness, disgrace, danger and old age that Milton composed bis wonder ful poem, which not only surpassed all the performances of his contemporar ies, but all the compositions which had flowed from his pen during the. vigor of his age and the height of his pros perity. Milton has been dead three hun dred years and time has not dimmed th« luster of his fame. There is something alluring about that plan of globe girdling proposed by the Rev. Mr. Shredanovich of But ler, Pa. The plan, as stated in the news dispatches, is for the traveler to lift himself above the earth to a point where he will stand still, while the earth, rotating on its axis, brings his objective point to him. Perhaps the Rev. Mr. Shredovich's explanation makes it clearer: "We will hoist our selves above the earth," he says, "and await the coming of the desired place, then we will lower ourselves where we desire to be. In this way." lie adds, "we may go from America to Europe in less than twelve hours. My «J". -T. OTTUMWA 4 Ingalls. secret is how to stand super earth and not be trailed by the earth's attrac tions." There may be one or two things, however, that Mr. Shredanovich has overlooked. If he failed to mount enough he might get wiped off the map when Pike's peak went swooping by, and if he got too high there's a cbancc that he might bump into one of the Wright brothers aviating around up there in'the clouds. Then, too, there is the problem of making a safe landing. The old earth goes some making its daily record and it might rip something when the traveler dropped down out of the etherial void. The Waterloo Courier publishes a summary of the improvements in that city during this year, giving $2,075,146 as the total expenditure. Under the classification of public improvements $228,878 is given as the cost of the paving work. $145,000 of the sewer work, and $130,S!3 for new bridges and maintenance. Two hundred and eighty-seven new homes were built during the year' and these, with other private improvements, brought an ex penditure of $1,031,273. Waterloo claims a population of from 22,000 to 23,000 and has taken up the cry ot "50,000 in 1920." Perhaps John D. is really beginning to worry about that twenty-nine mil lion fine. He has cut his' restaurant tips down to five cents. Don't count the M-1L Sundays. Remembev, there are only thirteen days left for the Christmas shopping, the Sundays on the calendar don't count. Buy some of them anyway. mm OOUBCEnS James m.n„ a wave of" religiouT Sunday School Lesson and Young People's Meetings What the Church Folks Are Thinking Abou and Doing—Religious News From Every" where.

These times are ready to speak that word.

As the Orient Builds. Anybody who has traveled through the East, and especially through In dia, can appreciate somewhat. the magnificence of Solomon's temple. There is no architecture to equal the Taj Mahal no masonry to equal the Pyramids, in all this western world. I have seen oriental palaces and tombs and mosques and temples which reveal a richness of architec tural imagination, a sumptuousneas of scheme, such as our western builders seem never to approach in their wild est flights. Not the Vatican itself, not any of the cathedrals of Europe and America that I have seen, conveys to ray mind so good an impression of what Solomon's temple must.' have been like, or contained, as does the staielv marble, "Temple ot Heo.ven" in Peking. For seven years Solomon's work men wrought, "and there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house." From the under ground quarries—still shown to visi tors—the finished stone was borne to the building and there fitted in place. r£he And now there are only twelve days! the temple and its embellishments is left before Santa Clans is due to put fairly bewildering to the present day in his arrival. reader.

A' Churchman Who Was Not Good. There has always been a deal of scorn expressed for conspicuous churchmen whose zeal for personal righteousness does not equal their ar dor for the concerns of organized re ligion. "Hypocrite" is the mildest word that critics find to describe this type. Perhaps some persons suppose that this sort of man has come into existence along with our modern swollen fortunes. Yet even the great King Solomon was such a one. David's son is best known for the temple he built. This was his chief gift to his kingdom. The splendor of that creation is the shining event of his reign. To the end of time Solo mon will be known as the man who elected wisdom (although he did not always employ it) and as' the build er of the glorious first temple of the Jews. His own conduct was not so beautiful: he was an easy-loving oppressive, self-indulgent king, who brought heavy woes upon his subjects and, despite the great temple which bore his name, he led them into idol atry house of the Lord?" mood I leave Solomon, where we like church best to contemplate him, on his knees. in prayer. This course of Old Testa ment studies ends for a season with this lesson and we do not pursue the analysis of king's character to its lamentable end. A man is at his highest when he is praying for others and Solomon's prayer of dedication, comprehending even the heathen, is a revelation of the spiritual possibilities inherent in the man. Had he and his people been true to that ideal the temple would not have become de cadent. nor the nation broken up.

Prov. 4:1-9. BY 

WILLIAM T- ELLIS. A man may be known by liis books as by his friends. His choice of books eveals his character as truly as his choice of companions. The careless thinker, the one of Indiscriminate tastes, the low minded and the vicious are shown to be such by the literature to which they turn with greatest pleasure. But the man who has a lik ing for good reading can no more help proyi'ig himself cultured than the flower can help revealing its beauty. A taste for good books is an auehor that will hold the spirit safe in many of life's storms.. If young people could understand that the best books are also the most interesting,- a deal of- trash would quickly go out of print. The "popular" books that stream from the modern press are really not half so entertain ing and absorbing as the great stories that have stood the test of time. Iu truth, the reading public will not let a stupid book live. Sheer interest is one of the standards that, must, be con formed to by any book that is to have e, permanent value. A real pleasure is conferred upon a person, as well as a genuine service done to the cause of good literature, when he is made to understand that the greenest past ures for all who would browse in the printed page are those provided by the masters of the art of writing. The good book and the goody goody book are not the same thing The book that has value is the one that, reflects real life, and every page of which reflects real life, and every page of which breathes sanity and wholesome.leas. The morbid, senti mental and sanctimonious volume is really a b:ul book, for it violates the eternal canon of life and art. The best book always sets forth, in fair proportion and in living colors, "things as they are." That so much of the "popular" literature of religion lias not done so has been a reproach upon the wisdom of Christian writers and publishers and teachers. This is a newspaper-reading age and many persons bemoan this fact. Yet. how conies it to pass that this is also the greatest book-reading age of the world, with more public libra ries—and these better patronized— than the scholars of an earlier genera tion would have deemed possible? From a study of life as it is mir rored in the pages of the daily news paper it is a short and easy step to the study of life as it is more fully, discriminatingly and entertaingly set forth in the great works of literature The great public libraries report that the most, popular books among their readers are works of fiction. There are several good reasons for this and among these must be in cluded the desire on tho part of mul titudes of persons to find escape in the world of books from the irksome ness and unloveliness of the real world in- which they live. A book is a refuge for the weary, the dis couraged and the dissatisfied. In its realm all turns out well, and things are seen in proportion. What a com fort are books, even surer than the comfort of living friends. One needs only scant imagination to picture the multitudes of heartsore men and wom en who this day will turn to the book of inspiration to find the comfort which the world has withheld. One can better afford not to read the best-selling book of the month than to miss those classics which bear the seal of the approval of the centuries. And if one feels that, the latest books may not be omitted, then, at least, the wise rule may be adopted to read one old book for every new one. ,j T» aivasleu one's speech, to elevstn L. ?-fni *Zv-it±? )$. •y*?fi£Azi'iir. -tv ,» ^ji-ji-&X*ot*-v.•&&&.S»irt£iL Chas.
