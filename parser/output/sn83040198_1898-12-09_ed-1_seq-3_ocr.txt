President Mc kinley sent the following message to the Fifty-fifth congress after he had been informed by committees that the senate and house awaited ny com munication he wished to make to them:o To the Senate and House of Representatives: Notwithstanding the added burdens rendered necessary by the war, our people re j Dice in a very satisfactory and steadily increasing de gree of prosperity evidenced by- the largest volume of business ever recorded. Every man ufacture has been productive, agricultural pur suits have yielded abundant returns, labor in the fields of industry is better rewarded, rev enue legislation passed by the present congress has increased the treasury a receipts to the amount estimated by its authorities, - the finances of the government have b"en suc cessfully administrated and its credit advanced to the first rank, while0its currency has been maintained at the world's highest standard. Military service under a common flag and tor a righteous cause has strengthened the national spirit and servedto cement more closely than ever the fraternal boads between every section of theQ country. A review of the relation of the United States to other powers, always appropriaic. is this year of primary im portance in view of the momentous issues which have arisen, demanding in one instance the ultimate determination by arms and in volving far-reaching consequenc?s which will require the earnest attention of the congress. The Coban Insurrection. , In my last annual message very full consid eration was given to the question of the dnty of the government of the United States toward Spain and the Cuban insurrection as being by far the most important problem with which we were then called upon to dcaL i The considera tions then advanced, and the exposition of the views therein expressed, disclosed my sense of the extreme gravity of the situation. Setting aside, as logically unfounded or practically in admissible, the recognition, of "the Cuban in surgents as belligerents, the recognitlan of the Independence or Cuba, neutral interventicn to end the war by imposing i a rational compromise between the contestants,, in tervention in favor of one or the other party and lorcible annexation of j the island. I concluicd it was honestly due to oar friendly relations with Spain that she should le given a reasonable chance to realiz; her ex pectations of reform to which she had bacome irrevocably committed.; Within a few weeks previous. y she had announced comprehensive plans, which it was confidently asserted wou'.d be efficacious to remedy the evil so deeply affecting our own country. so: injurious to the true interests of the mother country as well as to those of Cuba, and so repusrnant to the uni versal sentiment of humanity. The ensuing month brought little sign of real progress toward the pacification of Cuba. c The auton omous administration set up iu the capital and some of the principal cities, appeared not to gain the favor of the inhabitants nor to be able to extend their influence to large extent of territory held by the insurgents wt.(e the military arm, obviously ' unable to cope with the still active rebellion, continue many of the most objectionable and offensive policies of the government that hai preceded it. No tangible relief was afforded the vast numbers of unhappy reconcentrados despite the reiter ated professions made in that regard and the amount appropriated by Spain to that end. The proffered expedient of zones of cultivation proved illusory; indeed.no less practical nor moroo delusive promises of succor could well have been tendered to the ex hausted and destitute people, stripped of all that made Ufa and home dear and herded in a strange region among c unsympathetic strangers hardly less necessitous than them selves. By the end of December the mortality among them had frightfully increased. Con servative 'estimates from SpaniKh- sources placed the deaths among these distress' d peo ple at over 40 per cent, from the time Gen. Weyler's decree of reconcentratioa was en forced. With the acquiescence of the Spanish authorities a scheme was adopted for relief by charitable contributions raised in this coun try and distributed under the direction of the consul general and the several con suls, by . noble and earnest inJivUual effort through the organized agencies of the American Red Cross. Thousands of lives were thus saved, but many thouunis more were in accessible to such forms of aid0 Tae-war con tinued on the old footinz without comprehend, sive plan, developing only the same spasmodic encounters barren of strategic result that had marked the course of 'that earlier ten years' re 9 hellion as well as the present insurrectiou from its start. No alternative save physical ex haustion of either combatant, and therewithal the practical ruin of the island, lay 1 ln' sl?ht. but how far distant no one could venture to o conjecture. The Destruction of "the Battleship .Maine. At this Juncture, on the 13th of February last, occurred the destruction of the battleship Maine, while rightfully lving in the harbor of Havana on a mission of international courtesy and good will a catastrophe the suspicious nature and horror of which stirrer! the nat.on's heart profoundly.

All those things carried conviction to the mosj thoughtful, even before the findidg of the naval court, that a crisis in our relations with Spain and toward Cuba were at hand. So strong was this belief that it needed but a brief executive suggestion to the congress to receive immediate answer to the duty of making instant provision for tha possible and perhaps specially proba ble emergency ot war. and the remarkable, al most unique spectacle was presented of a unan imous vote ot both houses on the 9th ot March, appropriating 5.0JJ.O0j "for the national de fense and for each and every purpose connected therewith, to b3 expanded at the adiscretion of the president. - That this act of provision came none too soon -was disclosed when the application of the funds was undertaken.

After the Instruc tion reached. Gen.

Gen. Woodford thereuoon demanded his passport and quitted Madrid the same day. " Declaration of War.

Not until Admiral Cervcra took ref usre in the harbor of Santiago de Cuba, about May 9, was it practicable to plan a systematic military at tach upon the AntUleau possessions of Spain. Several demonstrations 'jecurred on the coast of Cuba and PortorRlee in preparation for the larger event On-May'' 13" the North -Atlantic squadron shelled Satt Juan de Porto Rico On May 30 Comouodore Schley's squadron bombard ed forts guarding the mouth of Santiago harbor.

Gen. Miles had previously been assigned to ortraniz? aa expedition for that purpose. On July 27 he entered Ponce, one of the most im portant ports In the Island, from which he directed the operations of the capture ot the island. The last scene of the war was en acted at Man Hi, its startipj place. On August 15. after a brief assault upon the works by the land forces, in which the squadron assisted. 'the capital surrendered unconditionally. HoaolSTt Coverture for Peace. The annihilation of Admiral Cervera's fliet. followed by the capitulation of Santiago, hav ing brought to the Spanish government a real izinst sense of the hopelessness ot continuing a struggle now becoming wholly unequal, it made overtures of peaca through the French ambassador. Accordiuglyon the afternoon ot August 12, M. Cambon, as the plenipotentiary of Spain, and the secretary of state, as the plenipotentiary of the United States, signed a protocol. Immediately upon the conclusion of the pro tocol, X Issued oclasuiUoa of August 12. suspending hostiWtles on the part ot the United States. The necessary orders to that end were at once given by telegraph. The blockade ot the ports of Cuba and San Jnan de Porto Rico was in like manner raised. On August 13. the muster out of luO.uOO volunteers, or as near that number as was found to b3 practicable. : was ordered. The military committees to superin tend the evacuation of Cuba, Porto Rico and the adjacent islands were forthwith appointed. The Peace Commission. Pursuant to the" fifth article ot the protocol. I appointed William R. Day. lately secretary of state: Cushman K. Davis, William P. Frye and George Gray, senators of the United States, and Whitelaw Reid. to be the peace commis sioners on the part of the United States. Pro ceeding In due season to Paris they there met on the 1st of October five commissioners similarly appointed on the part of Spain. The negotiations have made hopeful progress, so ; that I trust soon to be able to lay a definite : treaty of peace before the senate, with a re- view of the steps leading to its signature. Military Governments for a Time. I do not discuss at this time the government or the future of the new possessions which will come to us the result of war with Spain. c Such a discussion will be appropriate after the treaty of paaoe shall be ratified. In the mean time and until congress has legislated other wise, it will be my duty to continue the mili tary governments which have existed since our occupation and give its people security in life and property and encouragement under a just and beneficent rule Xlve Nicaragua Canal Commission. r The Nicaragua canal commission, under the championship of Rsar Admiral John G. Walker, appointed July 24, 1837. act of June 4 of that year, has nearly completed its labors, and the results of its exhaustive inquiry into the proper route, the feasibility, and the cost of construction of an inter-oceanic canal by' a Nicarasuan route will be laid before you. In the performance of its task the commissi:! re ceived all possible courtesy and assistance from the governments of Nicaragua and Costa Rica, which thus testified their appreciation of the importance ot giving a speedy aad practical outcome to the great project cthat has for so many years engrossed the attention of the re spective -countries. :' o Th Pari Expmition.

The provisions for strengthening the re sources ot the treasury in connection with the war has given increased confidence in the pur pose and power of the government to maintain the present standard, and has established more firmly than ever the national credit at home and abroad. I renew so much of my recommendation ot December. 1897, as follows: "That when any of the United States notes are presented for redemption in gold such notes shall be kept and set apart and only paid out in exchange for gold. This is an obvious duty. If the holder of the United States note prefers the gold and gets it from the government, he should not receive back from the government a United States note without paying gold in exchange for it. The reason for this is made all the more apparent when the government issues an issue- bearing debt to provide gold for the redemp tion of United States notes a non-interest- bearing debt Surely it should not pay them out again except on demand and for gold If they are put out In any other way they may re turn again, to be followed by another bond is sue to redeem them, another interesting-bear ing debt to redeem a non-interest bearing debt. This recommendation was made in the belief that such provisions of law would insure to a greater degree the safety of the present stand ard and better protect our currency from the dangers to which it is subjected from a dis turbance in the general business conditions of the country. In my judgment the present condition of the treasury amply justifies the immediate enact ment ot -the legislation reeommenaed one year ago. under which a portion of the gold hold ings should be placed in a trust fund from which greenbacks should be redeemed -upon presentation, but when once redeemed should not thereafter be paid out except for gold It is not to be inferred that o'her legislation relating to our currency is not required. On the contrary, there is an obvious demand for it. The importance of adequate provision which will insure to our future a money stand ard related as our money standard now and to that of our commercial rivals is generally recogcized. Tho companion proposition that our domes tic paper currency shall be kept safe and yet be so related to the needs of our industries and internal commerce as to be adequate and re sponsive to such needs Is a proposition scarce ly less important. The sutject, in all Its parts. is commended to the wise consideration of the congress. The annexation of Hawaii and the changed relation of the United States to Cuba. Porto Rico and the Philippines resulting from the war. compel the prompt adoption of a maritime policy by frequent steamship communication. encourag3d by the United States under the American flag, with the newly acquired islands. Spain furnished to its colonies, at an annual cost of about " uOO.lOJ. steamship lines communicating with a portion of the world's markets as well ss with traiTe centers of the home government. The United States will not undertake to do less. It is our duty to fur nish the people of Hawaii with facilities under national control for their export and import trade. It will be conceded that the present situation calls for legislation which shall be prompt, durable and liberal. The purs which American merchant vessels and their seamen performed in the war with Spain dsionstratcs that this service, furnish ing both pickets aad the second line of de fedse. is a national necessity nrd should be en couraged .in every constitutional way. -Details and methods for the accomplishment of this purpose are d-scussed ia the report of the secretary of the treasury to which the at tention of congress is respectfully invited. o Investigation of fellow Fever. In my last annual ms-a?e I recommended hat congress authorize the appointment of a commission for the purpose of making syste matic investigations with reference to thi cause and provocation of yellow fever. Thi: matter has acquired an increased importance as a result of the military occupation of the island of Cuba and the commercial intercourse between this island and the United States which we have every reason to expect. Tho sanitary problems connected with our new re lations with the island ot Cuba and the acquisi tion of Porto Rico arc no less important than those relating to finance, commerce and administration. It is my earnest de sire that these problems may be con sidered by ccompotent experts and c tha; everything may be done which the, most recent advances in sanitary science can offer for- the protection of th? health of our soldiers in those islands and of our citizens who are exoosed to the dangers of tlcfictioa;from the importatio:v. of yellow fever. I therefore renew my ret-om- inenaation that the authority of congress n-.ay be given and a suitable appropriation mud 2 to proviae ror a commi.ssuoa or exports, to t-r ap- pointed for the purpose indicated. Increase of ih Army. Under the act of ccbngress approve 1 April 25. 1E93, authorizing tha president in his discretion. upon a declaration of war by coazress. or a declaration by congress that war exists. I ui rected the increase of the regular, army to the maximum of CiOeo. authorizod0in sai l act. Thera are now la the regular army 5 r.btJ J offi cers and men. In said act it was provided 'that at the end cf any war in which the Cnitpa States may become involved the army shall be reduced to a p?ace basis by the transfer in the same arm of the servic ; or absorption by promo tion or honorable diseiarse ender sucn reyuia tionsas the secretary of war may establish of sa pernumerary commissione 1 officers aad thelron- orable discharge or tr:asfer of sa ernumeriry cniisted men, and nothing contained in this act shall be'eonstrued as authorizing the perma nent increase of the command or enlisted force of the regular army beyoiid that now nrrt-vided by the law in force prior to the passage of this act except as to the increase of 3 majirs pro vided for in section 1 hereof. . The Importance ot legislation for thc;rer- manent increase of the armv is therefore mani fest, and the recommendation of the secretary of war for that purpose has my unqualified ap proval There can be no question that at this time and probably for some time in the future. 100,000 men will be none too many to meet the5 necessities of the situation. At all events whether that number shall be required per maneatly or not, the power should be riven to the president to enlist that force if. in hts dis cretion, it should be neces-ary: and the further discretion should be given him to recruit with in the above limit from the inhabitants of the islands with the governram; of which we are charged. It is my purpose to muster oui the entire vol unteer army a soon as the coagrvss shall pro vide for the increase of the regular establish ment. This will be only an act of justice and will be. much appreciated by the brave men who left their homes and employments to helpthe country in its emergency. 0 Pacific Kailroada. In my- last annual msssag-e I stated: "The Union Pacific railway, main Jinc, was sold under the dacrcra of the United States court for tne district or eoraska the 1st aiid 2d of No vernber of this year. The? amount h government consisted of the principal of the subsidy boads. i 2 .".-236. 5 1 '2 and the accrued In terest thereon. 3I.21I.511.07. making the total indebtedness ES.41&22175. The .hid at the sale covered the first mortgage lien and the entire mortgage claim of the government, principal and interest" o This left the Kansas Pacific case uncon cluded. By a decree of the court in that case an upset price for the property was fixed ata sum which would yield to the government only 2.500,000 upon its lien. The 'sale at the in stance of the government was postponed fir-t to December J.5. lKf7.,and later, upon the appli cation of the United States? was postponed to February IS. 1893. Having satisfied myself that the interests of the government required that an effort should be made to obtain a larger sum. I directed the secretary of treasury, under the act passed March 3. 18S7. to pay out of the treasury to the persons entitled to receive the same, the amounts dne upon all prior mortgages upon the middle and eastern divisions of said rail road out of any money In the treasury not oth erwise appropriated, o Whereupon, the attorney general prepared a petition to be presented to the court offering to redeem said prior liens in such manner as the coart mirht direct and praying that there upon the United States might be held to ba subrogated to all the right of said prior lien holders and that a receiver might be appointed to take possession of th5 mortgaged premises and maintain and ape rate the same until the " court or congress otherwise directed. Thereupon the reorganiza tion committee agreed that If said petition was withdrawn and the sale allowed to proceed on February 18. they would bid a sum at the sale which would realize to the gov ernment the entire principal of Its debt. M.3J3, Ooa Believing that no better price could be obtained and appreciating the difficulties un der which the government would labor if it should become the purchaser ot the road at the sale, in the absence of any authority by congress to take charge ot and operate the road, I directed that upon the guaranty of a minimum bid which should give the government the principal ot its debt, the sale should proceed. By this transaction the government secured an advance ot t3.So3 000 over and above the sum which the court had fixed as the upset price and which the reor ganization committee had declared was the maximum which they would pay for the prop erty. It Is a gratifying fact tnat the result of these proceedings against the Union Pacific system and the Kansas Pacific line is that the govern ment has received on account of its subsidy claim the sum of tt4,7ai,S23 7a, an increase of : 18,997. 163. 73 over the sum which the reorgan ization committee originally agreed to bid for the joint property, the government receiving its whole claim, principal and interest, in Union Pacific and the principal of its debt on the Kansas Pacific railroad Steps had been taken to foreclose the gov ernment's lien upon the Central Pacific Railroad company, but before action was commenced 'congress passed an act approved July 7, 1S9, creating a commission consisting of the secre tary of the treasury, the attorney general and the secretary of tha interior and their succes sors In office with full powjr to settle the indebtedness to the government growing out of the issue of bonds in aid of construction of the Central Pacific and Western Pacific railroads. subject to the approval of the president. No report has yet been made to me by the com mission thus created. Whatever action is held looking to a settlement of the indebtedness in accordance with the act referred to will b: duly submitted to congress. Departmeut of Justice Bulldlnc. I deem it my duty to call to the attention ot congress the condition of the present building occupied by the department of justice. The business of that department has increased greatly since It was established in its present quarters. The building now occupied by it is neither large enough nor of suitable arrange ment for the proper accommodation of the business ot the department- The su pervising architect has pronounced it unsafe and unsuited for the use to which it is put. The attorney general In his report states that the library ot the department is on the fourth fioor and that all the space allotted to it is so crowded with books as to dangerously overload the structure. The first floor Is occupied by the court of claims. Tae building is of an old and clelapi- dated appearance, unsuited to the dignity which should atrach to this important department. A proper regard for the safety, comfort and con venience of the officers and employes would justify tie expenditure of a liberal sum of money m the erection of a new building of commodious proportions and handsome appearance upon the very advantageous sites already secured for that purpose. including the ground occu pied by the present structure a&l adjoining vacant to that, comprising in all a frontage of 201 feet on Pennsylvania avenue and a depth ot 1"0 feet. In this connection I may likewise refer to the inadequate accommodations pro vided for the supreme court In the capitol and suggest the wisdom of making provision for the erection ot a separate building for the court and its officers and library upon available ground near the capitoL The Postal Service. n The postal service of the country advances wi'c: extraordinary growth. Within 20 years both the revenues and the expenditures of the post office department have multiplied three fold. Ia the last ten years they have nearly doubled. Our postal business grows much more rapidly than our population. It now involves an expenditure of 100.0u0.000 a year, numbers 73.000 post offices and enrolls 200,001 employes. This remarkable extension of a service tshlch is an accurate index ot the public conditions presents gratifying evidence of the advance ment of education, ot the increase of commu nication and business activity and of the Im provement of mail facilities, leading to their constantly-augmenting use. The war with Spain laid new and exceptional labors in the post office department- The mus tering of the military and naval forces of the United States required special mail arrange ments Tof every camp and every campaign. The communication between home and camp was naturally eag?r and expectant. In some cf tbg. larger rp!aces of rendezvous as many os 00,000 letters a day required handling. tins cneccssity was met by the prompt detail of sxporienced men from the tavtiisnea loroe snd by directing all the instrumentalities of the railway mall aad post office service so far as necessary to this new need. Congress prised an act empDwerlng the posiicasier general to cstaDltsn oOlccs or branches-at' every military camp er station. and under this authority tha postal machinery was speedily put into effective ODeration. Under the same authority when our forces moved poa Cuba, Porto Rico and the Philip pines, they were attended and followed by the postal service. Though the act of congress authorized the appointment ot postmasters wuere necessary, it was early determined that the public interests would ba best subserved not by new d islgnations but by the detail of expe rienced men familiar with every branch of the serv.ee aad this policy was steadi.y followed. When the; territory which was the theater of corflict came into our possession it became necessary to re-establish mail facilities for thi resident population e as well as to pro vide them tor our forces " ot occupation and " the' former c requirement was c met through the extension and application of the latter obligation, I gave the requisite authority and the same general principles was applied to this as to other branches of civil ad ministration under military occupation. The details are more particularly given in the r port of the postmaster general. It is pleasing to be able to say that the serv ice In the territory which has come under our control Is already materially improved. 0 Venezuela Dlpa:e w th limit Britain. The arbitral tribunal appointed under tb 2 treaty of February, 1b97, between Great Brit ain and Venezuela to determine the bouncary line between the latter aad Che colony of Brit ish Guiana Is. to convene at Paris dur ing the present month It is a source of much gratification to this government to see the friendly resort of arbitration applied to ths settlement of this controversy, not alone because of tne earnest part we have had Jn bringing abaut the result, but also be cause the two members named on behalf of Venezuela. Mr. Chief Justice Fuller and Mr. Justice Brewer, chosen from our highest court, appropriately testify the continuing interest we teel In the definitive adjustment of the question according to the strictest rule of jus tice. . . : -Naval Secretary Recommendations TTrred- The following recommendations of the secre tary of the navv relative to the increase of the navy have my earnest approval: 1.

The total receipts from publio lands during the fiscal year amounted to i.j;7.99i.l9. an increase ot 413J. 03191 over the preceding year. The lands embraced in the 11 forest reservations which were suspended by tho act of Jane 4. 1897, agaia beca-ns subject to the operations of the procla mations ot February Si. 17. creating th-m. which added an estimated amount of 19.91.36 acres to the area embraced la thrj re serves previously created In addition thereto two new reserves were created during the year the Pine Mountain and Zaca Lake reserves la California, embracing 1.641.591 acres, and tha Prcscott reserve in Arizona, embracing 1.4J acres, while the Pecos river in New Mexico has been changed and enlarged to Include 120,000 additional vcres, At the close of the year 33 forestry reserva tions, not including those ot the Afonao forest and fish culture reserve la Alaskv had ben created by executive proclam uioa under sec-. lion 24 of the act of March 3, lil. embracing an estimated area of 4 l.7ii. 4T4 acres. The depart ment ot the interior has inaugurated a forest, system, made possible by ths a;t of July. 149i for a graded force of officers ia control ot the reserves. This system has onlv bsea la full operation since August, but good results have already been secured ia many se.-tioas. The reports received iniicate that tho system of patrol has not only prevented destructive fires from gaining headway but has diminished th3 number ot fires. Th Indians. The special attention of the conrrss Is called to that part of the report of the secretary of the Interior in relation to the five civilized tribes. It is noteworthy that the general con dition of the Indians shows marked progress. But one outbreak of a serious character oc curred during the year and that among the Chippewa Indians of Minnesota, who happily have been suppressed. W&ile it has not yet been practicable to enforce all the provisions of the act ot June 23, lifter tor the protection of -the people of the Indian territory and for other purposes," it Is having a salutary effect upon the nations composing the live tribea The Dawes commission reports that the most ratifying results and rreater advance toward the attainment ot the objects of the govern ment have been secure! in the past year than in any previous year. I c&nnot too strongly In dorse the recommendation of the commission and ot the secretary ot the interior tor the necessity of providing for the education of the S0.00O white children resident in the Indian, territory- The Department of As rim! tare. The department ot agriculture has been active in the past year. lcplorcrs have been sent to many of the countries ot the rat-tern and western hemispheres for seeds and plants that may be useful to the United States and with the further view of opening up markets for our surplus products. The forestry division of the department is siring special at tention to the treeless regions of our country and is Introducing species specially adapted to semi-arid regions. Forest fires which seriously Interfere with production especially in irrigat ed regions are being studied that the losses from this cause may be avoided. The depart ment Is inquiring into the use and abuse of water In many states ot the west and collating Information regard lu& the laws of the states, the decisions of the courts and tha customs of the people in this regard so that uniformity may bo secured. Kxperiznent etation are to become m-re effective every year. The annual appropriation of 7.0.0u0 by congrs ss is supplemented by 4C.0JO from the states. Nation-wide experiments have ben conducted: to ascertain the suitable ness as to soil and climate and states for grow ing sugar beets.The number of sugar factories has been doubled in the past two years aad the ability of the United States to produce its own suifar from this source has been clearly demon strated. Anniversary of Fonndlnir of Washlnstoe. c In the year 19JJ will occur the centennial an niversary of the founding of the city of Wash ington for the permanent capital ot the govern ment of the United States by authority of aa act of congress approved July 16. 171 Ia May. I , the archives and general offices of the fed eral government were removed to this place. On the 17th or November. 1800, the national congress met here for the first time and assumed exclusive control of the federal dis trict and city. This interesting event assume all the more significance when we recall tho circumstances attending the choosin? of tho site, th- naming of the capitol In honor of tho father of his country and the interest taken by him in the adoption of plans for Its future de velopment on a magnificent s.-ale. These orig inal plans have been wrought out with a con stant progress and a signal success even be yond anything their f ramers could have fore seen. The people of the country are Justly proud of the distinctive beauty and govern ment cf the capital and of the rare Instruments of science and education which here find their natural home. A movement lately inaugurated by the citi zens to have the anniversary celebrated aith fitting ceremonies. Including perhaps the es tablishment ot a handsome permanent me morial to mark so historical an occasion and to give it more than local recognition, has met with general favor on the part of the rublic. I recommend to congress the granting ot aa appropriation for this purpose and the ap pointment of a committee from Us respective, bodies. - It might also be advisable to author ize the president to appoint a committee from the country at larse. which, acting wiih tho congressional and District of Columbia com mittee, can complete the plans for aa appro priate national, celebration, Ihe Allen Contract Uw. The alien contract law Is shown by experi ence to need some amendment. A measure pro viding better protection for seamen Is pro posed:, the rightful application ot the eisht hour law for the benefit of labor and of the principle ot arbitration are suggested tor con sideration and I commend these subjects to tho caret ull attention of congress. rparlmBUl Keporta. .
