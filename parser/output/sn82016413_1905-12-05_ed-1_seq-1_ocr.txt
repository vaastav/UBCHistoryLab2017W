"Tlio Labor Committee of tlio Plant ers' Assocldtlon," said Mr. Cooke, "So It was decided by tlio planters this morning, will draft a letter containing full details of tliclr recommendation, to bo submitted to this Doard at Its next meeting. "This letter will state Just what tlio planters aro prepared toAlo." Commissioner Craig said ho hail heard that Portuguese were now dim cult to obtain, but lie favored Portu guese and always bail. He thought It 'Was about time the planters did some thing. Ha said that they had delayed tho mutter of getting white labor long enough. Commissioner Cooke reported to the Hoard that Mr. Krncst Wodchouse had found It would be Impossible for him to go as tho Hoard's representative to gelt he labor. "It has been suggested," said Mr. Cooke, "that 8c retary Atkinson l.o xent; that, of course, Is a question for the Oovernor. I canT think of u.iy Letter man to rend. ! "Of course, whoever goes, bo will need an Al man from hero to pass on the class of laborfers; and he will also' need some one to look after tho slilp- incut of the !alorers, for it cannot bu uxpectcd. If Mr, Atkinson goes, that he will stay six or eight months on the work." t "I don't think It will be necessary! for Mr. Atkinson to resign as Secre tary," said Mr, Cooke, replying to a question In this regard.' "The Gover nor might think, however, that Mr, At kinson has done his chare of work in this connection. "Thep lanters this morning appoint ed a committee to wait on the Gover nor and ascertain If Mr, Atkinson could be considered." "What's the matter with Frank Mc- 8t m Iter?" Inquired Commissioner CrnMie. "Homo think Mr. MeStockcr a good man," raid Mr, Cooke, "but I doubt If lio'd go." Couko said tho agent who went could only bo given general Instructions. He would go, probably, to London, to ar rango for a tteamer. The chcapctt way, would, If tho line Is completed In time, bo to bring the laborers here by tho Tchauntcpcc routo. This would cost about 85 per cgaplta. Arou tho Horn would mean 100 each, "Wo must be sure to provide that under no circumstances aro the labor ers brought hero across the continent' ho added, Craig said lis had word from a Por tuguese wtio had shipped Portuguese hero before ami who wanted tho con trai t. Crabbu reported that a r. llruy stood ready to supply scvornl thousand Norwegians and Suedes from Oregon. Washington and tho DaUotas. Hi would call on tho Hoard with his propo sltton. Craig Insisted that the planter! plans should bo deflnlto before thl Hoard went ahead. Cardou suggested that tlio Instruc tions would como from the planters. Craig declared that ho would talc no Instructions from snyono, the plant r or anyono edsc. Cooke drow attention to the fact thai the laborers could not ha engaged to come hero for any particular planta tion; that would be contract. Dili man could chooso his own plantation when he got here. Craig said photos of houses, etc, should l)Q taken to the Azores for ' blbltlon. "Ilcfcr them to the Plnkhum reporf " raid Cooke, "That's all right," said Craig, "Plnlc lam's report would cover the wliol thing." The Hoard adjourned st 2:35 p. in.

Loan Act Petitions Says Governor Are Not Kept Secret GIVES OUT ALL CORRESPONDENCE IN MATTER Two Poi Mills On Alameda "There Is nothing Bccret about the matter," said Governor Carter this morning when his attention was called to tho following statement In tho Me Candlcss petition: "A number of peti tions from various parts of tho Terri tory have been sent to the Governor asking him to reconsider his determi nation. Just how many, or how nu merously signed, wo are not able to say precisely, as Oovornor Carter has given little publicity to them." The (locrnor when requested, Im mediately had all the documents In tho matter placed In tho reporter's hands. The correspondence was not very vo-lumlnoiis. One petition came from voters of Mnlcnwao, Maul, asking that the new court house to bo erected tbcro ba lo cnted nt Pala, ns that place was moiu centrally located. The Oovernor an swered in n latter to II. A. Haldwln, who was ono of tho petitioners, that ho quite agreed with the petitioners that the court uouso at Mnkawao was not favorably situated and that I'ul.i s'ns more centrally located.

Copp, ono of the petitioners, an swered that tho loan act made the ap propriation nvallablo only for Pala, lie alro usked Copp If the petition meant that the signers would rather havci no new court house at all than having one at Pala. Copp uaswervd 'hat It was even so. Tho Governor then wroto II. A. Haldwln telling of tlio Conn currcstion deuce and asked him to llnd out what the sentiment nf tho voters war.

Another matter was called to tho at tention or tho Oovernor by Wllmott Vredenburg, who said ho had seen In the papers that a bill had passed ap propriating $7500 for a road from Pu- ako to the Kawaihae road. ROUS EVELT FOR iRICAN HAWAII AND FAiR DEAL WASHINGTON, Dec. 5. President Roosevelt's message was read today In both Houses of Congress He urges Immediate steps (or the fortification of Hawaii, and says It It hard to overestimate the Importance of the Islands. Hawaii Is too heavily taxed and the tax taws should be enacted setting aside for a period of say, twenty years, seventy.flve per cent of the Internal revenu and the customs receipts from Hawaii, to be spread as a fund for education, public buildings, military and naval defenses. The President holds that the nation must develop the Territory on American lines and no laws permitted admitting Chinese or a servile class. The country cannot concede the admission to Hawaii of a class denied admis sion to other States and Territories. Hawaii shall never become a Territory In which a governing class of rich plantera exists by means of coolie labor. The Territory mutt have the same basis for stable citizenship as the Contl nent. The message favors the national regulation of all Interstate business and a modification of the Philippine tariff. Drastic meaturea against corrupt In surance operators' Is urged and the regulation of railroad rates. No immedi ate change In general revenue laws It considered necessary, which Is the President's response to the tariff agitation.

"In many cases we will be able to open government lands near the plan tations, which will be cut up Into lot! which the laborers ran live on and work on the plantation.
