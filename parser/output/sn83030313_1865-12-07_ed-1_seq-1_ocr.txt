RADICALS EXCEEDINGLY GLOOMY. TQEIR ANTAGONISM TO THE PRESIDENT. I ' NEW YORK CUStOM HOUSE RUMORS. *c. fcc. &c. Washington, Dec. 0, 1866. THB FR0CBRDIN08 OF CONORHH8. The resolution introduced In thn Senate to-day by Mr. Bumper indicates that this actlvo movnr in reform has caught the spirit of complaints ma>lo for Bome time past by over zeaions Washingtonians, to the efTect that per sons of disloyal antecedents have succecded in obtain ng * employment in the several government departments. It will bo noted that the resolution in question is an in quiry as to whether all persons omployod in tho Treasury Department have taken the oath required by law, an>l also as to tho fact of the existence of certa'n offices therein not authorized to ho created. It is altogother probable that in so vast a workshop as tho Treasury |)o partment a few hundred out of tho thro thousand employes may represent ^>yal principals of a leas pretending and bolligarent character than those so signally espoused by the Massachusetts mombcr. The Senatorial inquiry was probably instituted to punish such portion of the Treasury clerical forces as did not avail themselves of the privilege recently extended of visiting their repectlvo States to vote for tho candidates or the radical tickets. There seemed to be a sort of toning down in the radical sentiment of the House to-day, and in tho division upon ?Be or two suggestive resolutions the opposition found itself helped to a majority by a respectable reinforccmont from the republican ranks. After looking over tho President's Message m print, and studying it carefully, quite a number of Mr. Htevens' men-at-arms have come to believe that the President means business, and their hearts fall them. < Among the resolutions hffered to-day tn tho House was ?ne to give the Freedmen's Aid Commission permission to held a meeting in the House on the night of January 13th ?est, which was tabled ; not because the proposition camo from the Mends of freedmen, but to throw cold water upon all applications of this nature. Messrs. Stevens, Ray Bond and others, who, It was fondly hoped, would favor tt, vAled against it. Mr. Ingersoll, of Illinois, offered a resolution to the effect that Ja the completion of the Washing ton National Monument honors to the momory of the late President Lincoln should be Incorporated with those to the Father of his Country. Whether or not this was a movement In behalf of the sleepy National Monu ment Association did not fully appear to the House, and they tabled it, although apparently dirpoeed to honor the memory of our martyr President In tiny reasonable way. Mr. Garfield, of Ohio, sent up a resolution requesting the President, If compatible, he., to enlighten the House to reference to a decree made by a person significantly termed "the French agent In Mexico," establishing slavsry or peonage tn that republic. The General's reso lution was appropriately referred. Having lately suc ceeded so handsomely in removing the eyesore of ?la very or peonage from our own body politic, it is but Psral that we shoiijd wish to see It removed from those our sister republics. Mr. Famsworth, of Illinois, wbe Is one of the most un fortunate with resolutions, threw In a very wordy one, oalllac for an amendment of the constitution to establish ?agro suffrage. It contained the usual arguments against distinction of oolor, but fell dead on the House. They were not prepared for It Just then Long John Went worth introduced a bill for the relief ef Mary Lincoln, and moved Its reference to a committee of one from each State. Objections were made, where upon Mr. Wentworth feelingly explained himself. He re marked that if the house knew bis motives, he was sure Be objections would be made. Inasmuch as the ex planation appeared to come from the big heart con tained In the mammoth body of the Chicago member, the abjections were withdrawn. The disposition of the nation's representatives certainly is in favor of consoling Mrs. Liriboln In her widowhood, if a pecuniary considera lion can do it. Thus far the Senatorial boat has steered tolerably wide ?f the shoals that Involve vexed questions of policy and privilege. For a few moments during this afternoon's ssstion It appeared as If It were about entering upon a rough sea of debate, tho pretext therefor arising from a motion of 8enator Doollttle to refer to the Ju4Mtory Committee that part of the President's Message touching apon the admittance of Southern members and the re construction of those States. Mr. Pumncrwas quick to remind the formerthat in the event of the 8enate con curring In the House resolution to appoint a joint com mittee to determine the qualifications of Southern members elect to hold seats In either branch of Con gress, the President's views on the subject would morit suitably refer to the committee. Mr. Doolittle, so far from coinciding, gave Ites his opinion that the Joint re Solution Introduced by the House should also go to the Judiciary Committee, and suggested to the member from the "Hub" that It was a matter not to be disposed of In m day. , TBS N1W

TBB RADICALS AND TBI BBMAOB. As a rale the President's Message has been remarkably wall received ; but a few radicals and soreheads are still ??gaged re- reading it In the vain hope of extracting a measure of oon eolation from its psrusal, or some quasi endorsement of their hereeles from its enunciations. Many of this class have abandoned their old habit of dogmatising loudly Is lobbies, and Mopted the Inquisi torial style of conversation. Their chief anxiety now Is Is learn its probable street on parties. They are more aaxtoes to be popular than to be right, and, like true weather eoeha, are varied by every breese rts adiournment of Congress till Bonder was deter mined more by a general lie ire of the members to gain I lime for c mm aiion iuU agreement among thenjbelvea | than from any nuc ?saitiet of legislat.on or Ute pubiie servicj.

The scnwUion to-day has been the President's Mc^sa^e. The effect of that document open the public mind has be 011 08 inspiriting as the action of the House yesterday, under the whip and spur of Tha'd Stevens, was depress ing. Confidence ban once more taken the pluce of gloom. The effect has been magical and oh marked as were the brilliant victories during tho war upon the pub lic mind. Last night sadness was pictured upon tbe ciunteiiances of all except the extreme radicals. A number of prominent republicans publicly manifested their regret in having voted for Stevens' reso lution hi tbe Bouse. A member of the New York delegation stated to bis friends that he would give thousands of dollars if he could recall his vote. What is true of that member is also truo of many more. Tbe whip of the party caucus was held over their heads by Stevens, and under the previous ques tion, without any debate, the whole republican side of the House was driven like cattle to the shambles, simply aUtho will of a few scheming men. It is not to be won dered at that the sober second thought arousss remorse of the bitterest kind. These men rejoice that tbe Presi dent has remained firm, but they had not the pluck nor the manliness to remain firm themselves; but, for the sako of receiving some petty place on committees, they bartered away their country's interest and nation's honor. Such is the character of the men who claim to be conservative republicans. Such is tbe consistency of those men of tho party who have been proclaim ing from the stump in the Recent canvass their approval of Mr. Johnson's course. They arrive in Washington and see the radical lash raised by Stevens, and cow be fore it with greater fear than the late slaves ever did before the lash of tho overseer. The radicals, of course, wore Jubilant last night. Why should they not be? Did not Sumner and Stevens see the men of their party, who had asserted over and over again that tb*)r did not represent the views of the party, all make haste and bow down and worship them? Did they not see R#vmond and all bis pre U>ndg4 conservative associates wallow in their own mire at the feet of those they had repudiated? j Surely this triumph was worthy of a Jubilee on tbe part of Stevens and Sumner. But their rejoicings have ? jd denly turned into lamentations? their Joy into wrath? , their wrath Into mourning. Those who rejoiced over tbe pcoceedlngs of the House yesterday are to-night gloomy over tho Message Those 'who were de pressed by the proceodings yesterday are Jubilant tonight. The tables have been turned. Tbe democrats, too, (oln in the rejoicing There are a few men in that party ? those who desired to see the President turn bis back upon tho republican party and come over to them? who profess not to be satisfied ; but the' bulk of the members of that party here and all the republicans, except the extreme men, manifest a de cided approval. It must be admitted that in pursuing this cautious course the President has retained a hold upon the party which elected Mm that will, If wisely followed up. make him master of ths situ ation. If those republlcsn# who profess to approve the Message now stand up, as they promised, the radicals will be compelled to back down or there wiU he a split in the part;. . The rad csls have been declaring that the party In Cougross would act together and be harmoni ous; but it ?us quite evident thst ths harmony which they calculated upon meant the hearty co operation of all in their extreme views. Hut the tables are turnod, and it Is exceedingly doubtful if the republicans can bo all whipped Into any more extreme measures. I,et us see whether they expect harmony now. The President's Messtfgo has commenced the work of disintegration. Time alone can work out the result. 

A*TA?0MSN or THS MSSSAIIf A SO THR SADirAL". The extreme radicals cstne here with the determina tion of treating ths Southern States as out of th* I'nlon This was Hie theory u|?on whiih they ba-ed their action at the private caucus*-* on Friday and Saturday, both at Stevens ?nd Pomeroy's rooms liwa- at tho*- private meetings that their plan* ot operation were m-trVed out. It was there that they decided to secure the pa?<ago of the Joint resolution appointing a Joint commute- on reconstruction. While they pretended to provide that the credentials of Southern members should be sent to that oominittoe, their real plan was, as soon as the Senate contented to the Joint committee, to pass a reso lution declaring that there were no Southern States to be represented, and dispone of the, credentials of Southern members In that form. The Orst |>art of the programme was carried out through the caucus on .Saturday night, while the other portion is only held in the background, ?waiting the action of the Senate on who first. This, then, leaves no doubt that their intentions were to treat the 8ottfhera States as having lost all their rights as such by the rebellion, and were only to be treated as conquered territory, or some unexplored re- , glon, subject to #11 the manipulations bv Oongreea In re ?ard to every local interest, as in thoee instances. This act is undeniable. Their programme eras in a fair way or being sucoessful when tbe Meassge or President John son makes Its appearance, and Instead ef arguing that the States are really out, he proclaim that a State oen neither secede, commit treason nor shield treason in Its citizens. He then in aobsunco argues that the Southern Stalee are as much In tbe Union as thsv ever wer% and It was only necessary for them to reorganise their Tttate governments, elect their Senators and Representatives, to be entitled to a representation In Congreee Hi* argu ment on this point leads to tbe conclusion that tbey have Just as much right In Congrws an Kew Tort or Pennsvl vanla. He Informs the members of Congress that to'ey are judges of tbe election rntarns and q salifications of members. Bnt tbe letter and spirit of his state ment on this point plainly means that they am the Judges ot the right of the Southern mem bers to their seats Just ss tbey are tbe Jttdtea and are to decide whether James Brooks or WllHsm K Dodge hi ensiled to represent tho Eighth UengreMonnl district of New York, which is contested, and no niore. There in nothing in the expression which will justify the inference thai they have a right to say whether the Southern Stall's have a right to be represented. This is clearly dented In the Mersaue, a* the President bu re peatedly denied it in private conversations. The public can see from this llio reason why the President has manifested a strong desire thai do objectionable men shall bu elected in the ^outh, and that as mu< b should be done them as possible towards removing all obstacle*. When Horace Maynard, of Tennessee, tried to obtain the floor iu Congress yesterday to present his creden tlals Mr. Stevens at once protested. and told him that he wax an onlH.der, and liud uo business there. The Clerk ruled at ouca that ho could not reeognixe him. Yet .Mr. Mavuurd held a .certificate ol' election, sign-d by Governor Brownlow, who has two re ognlzed ax tile legal Governor of the State. This actiou gave fist; to a rumor, which was extensively circulated last night, that the radicals intended to declare Tennesson out ot the Union, and if Johnson did not do their bid ding they would impeach him on the ground that he could not be President, not being a resident of a State in the I'atou. These facta go to show tbe direct antagonism between the radicals and the Prealdout. Thus far the action of the entire republican party in the House has been ou the radical side; but if the protestations of tnauym' this party are to tie believed this will not be the result any longer. An ellort was made to secure an endorsement by Uu' Senate of the House's re solution this morn.ng; but they failed to wield that body as they did the Hou.-e. Sumner coultl not crack his wh p so skilfully as Mevens did In tbe House. Sumner manifested a* strong dispos^ou as Stevens, but his energies had been expended in a ditlerent direction. He came into the Semite with a great pile of bills ahd resolutions which he hail bjcu preparing. At the appropriate time he 'arose In his place, and, with the air of a king? to all appear ances, like Alexander Selkirk on his Island, imagining himself lord of all he surveyed ? In a hoarse, guttural voice, and aping great power and majesty, commenced pieseiitn.' his resolutions one after the, other In a stylo tha: he evidently considered would create the Impress. on on all before him that he was ttoe great "1 Am" of the Senate. He continued to present his bills and resolu tions in this imperious manner until a general thler went around the Senate at the ridiculous tl it lire which be preseutod, much to the oha g' iii of the aforesaid Senator. Seeing this he stopped his work before the pile ou his table had beeu materially reduced, leaving the balance for some future day. The real extent that lie intends to go iu behalf of his colored brethren iu the South is not, therefore, knn vn. Hut the extent to which he has gone lucre; iss the <fl sgust and hastens the reaction against the radicals which uow seems inevitable. 

AMI1HIH BLAST HJCAIIY. Those who are conversant with affairs at the White House assert to day that there is something yet In store fir the radicals, which will materially change their tone in a few days. What thai something is, is a<! yet a mystery. There is no doubt, however, that something hits t n pired about the New York Cus i t >m House which has caus d a squirming among the New York Congrcssm u. At any rate ihey are mani festing great uneasiness, and it is reported to-night that theie has been a complete change In tho aspect . of things In regard to that appointment. This m ty be tho point significantly referred to, or it tnay be something else. Time will tell. At any rate the im pression Is general that tho i>erson who will receive that appointment must be a known endorser of President Johnson's position and no pretender, but in earnest In that direction. In tho meantime Stevens' re-><lutlon lianas fire in tho Senate, anil the longer it is postponed the poorer chance it has lor |?itsing. ihal reaolnHoil should it become the law, makes tho Zonule a tilth wheel to the House ? a minority body to the House of Repre sentatives ? a satellite doiug the bldd ng of the popular branch ? clearly unconstitutional. It is cui.un that it cannrtt pass without modification, If al all. 1.' it can be delayed a week th> re is no iioss'ltle chance for its en dorsement by the S-'iuic. Tin- radicals, however, very plainly do not intend to yi .?? up the contest yet. This was made eviit nt by tuo speech of Giiie ial Barlow at the S'reuane tonight. While ho compli mented the President and p.-ai>>od his declarations that Ueasou ou lil to bo ni.i.it uilmnoutr, he had not h word to say about tho reorga I ion policy laid down iu (he Message, bat went off Int. o the harmony of the majority <d Congress. B t, ( iii> ro rumor aliout the Custom lfoiuu In New York c. aU>s such a tfhttering, what will ii.be when tin- President manifests a dispo sition to place men vi ho ilioioiiglilv approve his pol.ey In all the offices*, under hi- gilt. He lms res rved his strength In this re\jie. i , or this occasion. His powder is ?dry and ready for us ?. Then; are thousands that he can remove even without the Senate's confirmation. The r 'piiMn-ans in four, rev, if they are wise, will learn a lesson from the posdion of Hr. Lincoln It Is well known thai a majority of both houses were against him, yet he carried his polntR in spite of them. Tho people stood by him and triumphantly re-elected him in tho face of the opposition of a majority of both houses.

QUALIFICATION OK CiKNKKAI. HOCHSKAIT. General ltousseau, of Ky. , appeared, qualilled and took bis seat. The House adjourned till Monday. THE EIGHT HOUR LABOR MOVEMENT. n?n Meeting of Workiaguien at Cooper Institute^ The largo hnll of tho Cooper Institnto was crowded last eveping by the workingmcn of this city, assembled todis cuss tho right hour labor question. The Intelligent working clnssos turned out in great force, almost all the trades being represented on the occasion. The move ment in furtherance of which the meeting wau called is attracting general attention, and the citizens most inter ested are adopting a mode of action which bids fair to Hectire to them the boon they so ardently desire. The organization is perfect in every particular, and the greatest harmony ami accord of action marks all their proceedings. Tho assemblage last evening wan imposing in numbers and iu the appearance and conduct of those composing it. The female relatives of the worklivtmen wore present iu large numbers, the Indies' Protective Association being also well represented, and for whom the front row of seats was reserved. An excellent band of music aided further attractions to the proceed m ; ;. The business of We meeting was opened by the ap pointment as chairman of Mr. Miotic. Htkvknk, who ad dressed the meeting at length. He said that the idea of gathering in the advocacy of the* question t?m had to consider the assemblage beforo him would a Ipw years ago have scouted ris Utopian. They were tail alono in the light. They were supported by j eminent members of the bar, tho pulpit anil tko press. Home able shakers were present, who would address them, and he would then-fore conclude. ? f Mr. Knwiv Jamkh was then introduced. He s^id it was better that this movement should bo carried ot?t ly the worklngmcn themselves. The orgunUntlon aid the object they desired t<> accomplish ?>y it hud hla most niirdlal good wish ?nd co-operation. He tnist?rt that they would keep it free from politics, and fruto all po litical parties and cliques. If they d'd this, nnl storked to the end In the same spirit which h.KI tn.irKtxl their proceedings hitherto, they were certain of sue coat TIkv movement will inakn Itsolf felt, thougtid of recent origin lu this country. It was a strug gle between capital and ialtor. They hnd had Hrit sh capitalists among them lately. Fie would bo glad to see ? British capital invested iti works of benefit. Hut these men camo heralded a* with trumpets afld acclaim, as if they had come to perform some philanthropic objert. Hut what did they oome fort To Invost thoir capital, and to receive four and Ave |s>r cent upon it, whon they co'.ild get only three per c ut at heme. One would have thought that tliey Cine ns commissioners to pay for tho depredations Inflicted upon American commerce l>y rebel l?l valuers li tied out in British ports. (Applause.) Tho Britinh capitalist wa-, In himself, unexceptionable; but ?till, as a capitalist, he wa? not quite amenable to the laws which should bind the capitalist and the laborer together. The most corrupt of all arlelo-r^'ien wan the erlt-tbcracy of mere wealth. Wealth, when employed ax capital in labor, should exercise equity and Justice toward the men whose fill and sinew produce that wealth. (Cheer*.) He differed with those who said they should trust to legislation to secure their object. They were bound to take care that there was no legislation against them; but legislation for the operative to fix for him the hours of labor, or tho maximum or minimum amount of wnrea, was a snare and a fare. (Applause.) rhey did not require to resort to legislation. They should trust to their own energies ? their own dignified and manly co-operation for success. They should elect uo man to the Legislature whoae sympathies were not with them; for the question of abridgement of la'ior was theirs only, and to that abridgement they were entitled by right and Justice. This was not a question of legislation , for the whole matter was In their own hand". It waa for them to work out their own salvation This was their work, and they alone must do it. They had |^ie srmpathlee of all true men ; but action was /or them selves l!AMr Come, blight improvement, on the ear of time, And rule the spacious world from rlime to climft.; A list of vice presld nts and secretaries waa then read and adopted. A series of resolutions in accordnnco with the spirit of the movement was next read, und, being submitted, was adopted by acclamation. ? Dr. Roaptao* was the next speaker. Ho thought fhat employers should prefer to have a good day's work done In eight hours than to have It no hotter done in ten. Let two shppe start 00 a coutest? one to work its em ploy e* ten hours, the other eight, and the result would prove tMt the eight hour men would turn out aa much and better work than the ten hour laborers. The dlfDcuItjr which stood in the way of operatives in Eng land. preventing all their efforts to succeed H abridging the hours of labor, was that they could not bring the ballot bo* to tiear Here they could, and they should ex ercise the great power that would aid them in attaining their ob(ert He did not agree with the speaker who said that they a*e U-d Bu legi-iatton In the matter. They did re quire log's!#' on, and they should return to the Legisla ture men lio would anpport them in this movement, (theera) r?>e la'swing classes required eight hours for sleep an t eight b<?ir< for socal and Intellectual enjoy ment and culture, and they would freely give eight hours to remunerative labor At present it was Impossible for tli" ialMtring man, the mechanic and the artisan to pav that attention to the education and culture of their young children and to the well being of their families which th-?e great duties required. It was impo?<able for tltam to develop their own talent and abilities winlo |po many hourx of the day jrere devoted 'to labor The organita tlon was in perfect working order, and he hoped that it would ?i>eedlly succeed iu securing tho desired object Mr. Kbai. next s|>oke. He said the great opponents of tho movement were men who could to a great extent control their own time as to business. There was a fear expressed that there was to be a contest bet Keen capital and labor That was not so. They had inscribed on their banner the sentiment that the Interests of capital and lalior were identical. unc argument against the eight hour movement was that in order to keep all things ernial, the rat* of wai<e* must be reduced, nut be denied that If labor were governed bv the supply and demand, then, when there was a surplus of work, wages increased. Working under the leu hour system a day, they worked sixty hours a week. If they labored hut eight hours a day, that would tie forty -eight hours a we?k That was a reduction of twelve hours, and thia gave employment to additional numbers of workmen. If one butMlred thousand laborers were employed at eight Murs, that would give labor to twenty five thousand additional men. Tho laboring classes bore the brunt of taxation, and this was a fact that operators seemed to lo?e rttght of. Thskpeaker, in plain and convincing argument, advocated the right of the workingman to an abridge * tnent of the hours of labor In con<ilualon he called upon them to combine and organixe for the purpose of agitat ing the question, and, aa their resolution said, let it go into every home, to every fireside. Make it a grand or ganixatmn Look to the Interest of all and each. t ut all differences and bickering* aside. Cultivate the high instincts of your nature Reek the cause and effect of thaae things, and when the final result la aocompllehcd there will be those in after fears who will bias* them for their notion In this grant matter (Applause ) Mr. Kaaa addressed Abe meeting in the German Ian gw?? _ The object of the movement wan advocated by other speakers, who treated the subject ably and practically The proceed i age were then brought to a close, and the Immense aaaemblage quietly diapered ?ipleslen of a Steamboat Boiler.
