A large batch o! prisoners from Chattanooga, numbering two thousand one hundred and thirty, passed through Indianapolis, on Monday, en route for Rock Island. Twelve hundred more were expeoted there yesterday. A number of rebel officers to the amount of one hundred and thirty, mostly captured from Major General Breckinridge's division, also passed through Indianapolis on their way to Johnson's Island.

Eastern Tennessee, so desperately struggled 1 for, Is now, and wo ntay well hope ! definitely, safe. General Longstreet, if he i is still within the limits of that State, is anxious only about the safest way to get out of i it. Ilurnsitle's noble struggle, which the whole j country has watched with such intense interest, ! terminated successfully upon the arrival of i General Sherman with reinforcements on the j -1th instant, and the retreat of Longstreet on the same night. Longstreet's line of retreat is up the valley of the Holston, which he may follow into Virginia, liis infantry und transportation follow the valley on tlie south side of the river, which thus covers his left. Ilis left is also covered by his cavalry on the north side of the river and by the Clinch Mountains, the gaps in which his cavalry will hold or obstruct. General Foster wa3 at Tazewell, on Longstreet's flank, on the 6th, and his cavalry on that day bad a fight with the enemy's cavalry in one of the passes. His despatch indicates - his iutentioa to use his cuvalry to the utmost, I and if be does so he will doubtless inflict I severe punishment on the enemy. Sherman's ' cavalry is reported to be on the south side of the ; Ilolstoo; and, though the country is broken and 1 bad for cavalry, it is not improbable that this | energetic officer may be able to hold the ene1 my's infantry until his own can come up, when ! we may reasonably anticipate the destruction or capture of Longstreet's entire force. On Monday the President announced the retreat of Longstrect by proclamation, and I called upon the people "to render special homage and gratitude to Almighty God for i this trreai advancement of the national cause." From these words we may gather the importance that the President attaches to this success, and we think that bo does not overrate it Hy Longstreet's failure we see the rebellion compelled to relinquish its final hold upon the last grand outpost by which it might have retained control over the interior and held the upper country thut forma so grand a part of the .Southern States. Now it is restricted to the belt that follows the line of the Atlantic from Richmond to Mobile, shut up between the mountains and the sea, ttaukod on the one band hy the Alleghany and Cumberland Mountains, that bristle with Northern bayonets, and on the other l?y the ocean, that teems with Northern gunboats. Its present territory is represented by the three points of Richmond, Charleston and Mobile. Such a country is inevitably weak at every point, and, while it hardly possesses a sufficient depth for natural cohesion, it will doubtless soon be demonstrated that it pos^ sesses but little power of resistance. f Rkcri'itinu in Nkw York.?We cannot con' ccive why nny difficulty should be experienced in this city in filling up the ranks of our armies. To us it appears that there is nothing so easy. I There are plenty of men and means; but the , mode of management adopted, or rather allowc ed to be practised, tends to prevent rather than i. encourage enlistment. The men who should >, swell our forces from this city are continually o being driven away In'o Jersey and Brooklyn ' by the manner in which the recruiting officers 0 are treated by the Board of Supervisors. It 1 is stated that there are substitute brokers who control the matter; but it was supposed that * their improper influence would cease to exist , immediately after the lute charter election, o Yet we still have daily delegations of recruitr, ing o(boors catling upon ns and complaining d that they cannot obtain the money for the men ' whom tbey enlist. Thia Is all wrong; and Mr. r Orison Blunt, who is chairman of the Board of 0 Supervisors, and who has a high reputation for honesty ami patriotism*, should look into the > matter and see it righted. Prksimcnt Lincoln's FoaTHcflirao Tijin or jn Restoration.?We arc promised the President's )f Message to-day, and wo arc told that its disie tlnguishing feature will be his plan for the g reclamation of the rebellious States. It is also r reported (hat he will start from the compreJ henshro idea that, under his emancipation pro* d clumation. slavery is abolished iu the desigd nated States. 11 tLis be so, then our Presilt dent's annual Message of 18(13 w 11 l> the most important document of the kind in the history c of the country; for it will involve iu the re;p to ration of the Union a reconstruction of the l? government, the final shaping of which no ]. humsn imagination can conjecture.

HEKALD, W Rwuki. Panic Abkoao?'Tmt Rath Dxskkt in(i tiih; Sim*.- A letter Irum one of oil London correspondents recently published gives some important information regard ing the present aspect of rebel a flair abroad. The rebel agents, it appeare, abandon ing all hope of inducing the British government to allow the rams to depart, have sold them to the Admira'ty. Convinced tint their can e i: hopeless, they have wisely determined to pie vide for the nselves whilst there is yet time, t'icy can never ag >in return to this country. Tb< amount which they bare received is not staled but it must be a good round sum, sulli out l? keep them in clover for the rest of their lives It is a question whether any share will bore served for the urcli traitor whom they a'know le 1 re ns niast r. When he reaches Knglind, if he ever does get tliTo, it will probably h I > A.id his minions (urn their backs upon him, and lone him to drag out in poverty the rein undct of a despise 1 existence. But what will the English holders of rebel bon Is, wiio hiivo furnished the money to bu 1<1 these vdw'h, say to alt this* They weiil into th.> speculation fro n interested motivtw and not from anyrbal sympathy with the ranse T.iey believed the assurances of the rebel agent* and of their own bribed journals that the re be'lion was going to succeed, and they staked 11only upon it. Now thoy seo their monoy going into the pockets of a set of unprincipled adventurers, and the confede racy itself going to the dogs, /'y the time the news of Grant's successes iu Ten nessee reaches them the rebel bonds will be worth just so much waste papor, with no prospect of their ever recovering a cent of the money which has been received from the British government. We can imagine the revulsion of feeling which this collapse of the rebel bubble will occas on at toe other side. Nothing is so gatliug to an Englishman as to be tricked out of his money. His belief in his own suporior intelligence is so great that he does not admit the possbility of his being duped. When he finds that the rebel agents have been too smart for him, and that be has lost his self-esteem as well as his cash, his anger will know no bounds. Ills eyes will then be opened to the shallow contrivances by which he has been bamboozled, and he will abuse tlio Southerners worse than be ever did the Yankees. If the rebel agents are wise they will make early tracks from British soil. It will soon prove uncomfortably lwvf C..r tlw.m Braoo Do>v' Foit.?General Grant has given (ho finishing blow to Bragg, who lias been superseded by Hardee. Bragg has been an unlucky braggart from the beginning of the war. When he planted bis batteries at Pensa cola for the reduction ol Fort Pickens, be declared that, regardless of expense, men or gun powder, Pickens should be reduced to the rebel flag. But, instead of taking Pickens he was compelled to clear out of Pensacoln and abandon the town and its defences to "the Yankees/' Bragg, with a considerable army next invaded Kentucky, and from the centre ol that State issued a flaming proclamation to the people of the Northwestern States to join hie victorious banner and tho Southern con federacy; but his onward march at Fsrryvilh was turned into a disgraceful flight over tb< mountains of Kentucky into Tennessee. Nex he undertook an advance upon Nashville, bu was met half way by Itosocrana, and sent of again, soundly thrashed for his presumption Next he was turned out of his fortifications a Tulhihoma and Shelbyville, driven over th< Tennessee river, turned out of Chattanooga and pursued into the plains of Georgia. There Generals Longstreet and D. H. Bill, with theii veteran legions from Virginia, and twenty thou sand Georgia militia, coming to his rescue Bragg wheeled about to destroy the Unioi army; but he only succeeded in pushing it bad into a position from which it has recoiled wit! the most disastrous consequences to Bragg him self.

Now, the office lieutenant general is actually in existence, the person of General Scott, and thcrefoi there is no need of its revival. But it is Btatc that the rank is to be "revived,'' so that it nil be conferred upon General Grant, in the hop no doubt, that such a high military poeitic will switch him off the Presidential track.

KJDM ESDAY, DEUEMBEK V, >- Kkhml, It appears from tho Richr mon 1 K upiii t-r that the supplies of subsistence 1 , (Indian corn) for tin- rebut armies, including - the army ol hue, are now chiefly drawn from ? Georgia and Alabama?two Stales which, dowu to the outbreak of the rebellion, inainly de- | poiulud for their provisions upon TennetMe, u i Kentucky and the Nortliweat, and upon Texas. ' i But during tho last be .won the fertile fields of 1 Georgia and Alabama, heretofore entirely do- A , voted to cotton, have been almost exclusively devoted to Inditn com, and the result is a r , Corn crop in th-se two Stales believed to bo *' i sufficient to supply the rebol armies east of the 1 M ssissippi till tho next summer. At al! evonts, upon Alabama, Georgia and North Carolina i, the rebellion now depends for its subsistence c C through the winter. Virginia, in some portions, u lias beep reuuoed to a desert, in other portions J1 lias been exhausted; Tennessee, Kentucky, the great Northwest and aU the Stales west of the ? Mississippi are utterly cut off' liom Jeff'. Davis, u mid even Mississippi, extensively planted iu 1 i corn last spring, has, by tho contending armies t within her borders ainue May last, been almost t impoveriBbed. The cutting of the remaining r railroad lines, therefore, between Virginia and t i Georgia, in compelling Jeff. Davis to ovacuato Richmond, will leave his mockery of a govern- ' I mont witiiout a local habitation or a name. Is t it uecessarv to wait till serine to achieve this i work? Thin is the question which, from policy i and humanity, we would urge-upon the attention of the administration. 0 . t Ghkkiuls Burnsiok am) Hookkr.?In holding " Kuoxville against the superior army of Long- " street, until relieved by reinforcements from * 1 below, General Durnside has done that good t service to the national cause which may be i classed with the most important victorias of ? the war.

If in their failures t> they lost thousands of men to no purpose, in 'l > their successes they have saved thousands of a > men who otherwise would have been sacrificed. "Honor to whom honor is due." tl Important IX Hk.ard to a lis* Prisonrrr?SowrniiNC I' for Blockaps Rck.vxrs to Pokdkr on ?An important c mutter relative to tho disposition of aliens captured vio " lating the blockade Is now agitating tho War and Navy 11 cepartments at Washington. Until recently aliens have ' violated the liloekade with impunity, always claiming 8 tholr discharge alter capture upon taking o&th that they t> wore subjects of foroigu Powers. Upou being discharged D many of these parlies have made their way directly back to Havana or Nassau, and reshipped in other blockade 0 runners Tin.a some of them have violated the blockade * I from two to eight times, as is the case with a large |K>r P ( tion of the crew of tho prize stoumer Uanshoe. The 1 government has found it necessary to distinguish, in the 1 face of these facts, between neutral aliens and uggrossive ' 1 alieus, and It is probable that all prisonors hereafter cap- r< tured violating the blockade, who may he kuown to have ' prevl msly committed the same ofTouce, will bo sent to f Fort Larayette, Fort Warren and othor strongholds, no 0 matter what the evidences may be regArdlng their na- r ' tlvity. In that case it will be found exceedingly dllUcult * > to procure men enough to man the numerous steamers ' , now engaged in the Illicit trade. TQe Banshee's crew are 1 , now awaiting the final set tlemont of this grave question 0 at Washington, before United states Marshal Murray can 1 ' dispose of them.

To day aod Thursday of ihli week baa l>?en not apart iv Mr. Webb for tbe reception on board or the royal tallan Irou-ctud frigate lte d'llafta, of sucb of the public a are Interested Id not ouly a beautiful ship, but the nost ecu going iron clad frigule ever built la this counry. The ship lies at the uow liremeu docks at lioboiteD, ud will bo open for visitors from nine A M. until sunset, ifier Thursday do visitors will be allowed on board. The l<e d'ltalia, built by W H. Wobb for tbo oyal Italian Davy, will shortly loavs our waters for or uow boine beuoath tbe auuuy sklos of the KssL lorn of AmonoDu parentage, sho goo*,out to the world a joiiuBioiil of the lugeuulty and cieallve genius of Amu ica, and we may be proud of her as a model ship, and as he llrst regular sea goiug iron clad frigate built In this ounlrj. Her beauty or form, her symmetry of ouMino ud the grace of her every feature not ouly olicite tbo iigbesi coinmenduttoo of our own people aud that of all oreign olllcl.ils who hive seen her, but the Italian olll era who have been son! out bore to take her to Italy re dollgbled with bor, and m every quartor talk of her n language indicative of tboir high appreciati >n of our alcnisutidof tboir own gralitlcalion In being possessors >f sucb a Alio spocimeu of naval architecture. Tbe ship has some remarkable features, which were ligpisye.! in a receul trial trfp?her speed excoedtng by ar what was oipectod?.bowing that our private shipluilders in Ibis country, when untrammelled by old fogyjin, stupidity and conceit of certain officials In the Navy lepartmeut, can build the faslost vessels afloat. Her teerogo was tbe tbemoof univurstl sad unlimited praise, be men at tbe helm controlling It wltb perfect ease, while be large ship obeyed It witb a rapidity and oertaioty quite n contrast wltb some vessels we could name. Tbe amount of room which has been devoted to tbe use if ber battery is frco from obstructions, and will enable he orew te have a^iple accommodation lor the free use { tbelr guus In action. Tho ports are unusually high hove water, so that iu aseiwiy she will bo dry on dock nd not flood ber battery witb waves, tier draught of ruler is remarkably light, tho ship drawing only twentyUree feet six Inches, with all her equipments on board, bis of itsolf Is a groat desideratum, and Is in marlcod ontrast with vessels of bor louuage in the navies of ranee and Kagland as well as our own. Mr. Webb has shown bis energy and skill in this snip, od in tbe midst of a terriblo civil war, when labor and raa arial were not readily procured, when \ thousand druwooka have boon encountered, bo has completed within tie specified time one of "tbe most beautiful ships of war Host. Wo can learn from this a lesson, and the Navy lopartmeut should heed it. The well known ability of tbe constructor to carry out ha desires of the Italian Minister of Marlue, as well as bis ecuuiary responsibility, was undoubtedly tbe prime suae or his nhtatiiinir Lhasa conlritcts silt nmlii nil hup a&ncl&t troubles be liu never given the Italian authorises any opportunity to distrust hint. In tbe midst of our uly riots tbe Italians wore alarmed lost their ships bould be destroyed; but tbe manner In wblcb Mr. Webb uarded them against attack obtained for bun a new condones iu tbe eyos of the Italians. In point of workmanship the He d'ltalia stands o it promineut. Not a thing lias boon neglected to make her launch, strong, beautiful and seaworthy, liar armor dating has been secured la tbe most Arm manner, while bo bull which benrs it is a wonder of strength. There is one thing wbich wo must all regret, if rumor HI truthful; aud that is, that orders btve been rocelved or the Ret!alantuomo, an old lasnioiied sailing ship of tbe ina, with a small auxiliary engine, to keep In close c >m any with the iroo clad. It sfflnd have been ordered therwlse. The Re d'ltalia should hare been allowed to nake the ruu across the Atlantic as quickly as she could, aid wo feel coulldeut that sbo would have surprised ho world; but, as orders stand, she Is condemned 0 poke along at less than half speed, so that the Id sblp-of the-Une, which, to do ber utmost, cannot uake much speed, can be kept in sight. This order, 10 doubt, is the result of the recent failure of he Krench and Knglish iron-clads to keep at sea In tad weather, and the Italians do not wish to loso heir officers and men In the event of tbe barest poedililty of tbe ship foundering. But no one need fear that. 1 plan of her midship section gives her the most beautlul and easy posture in tbe water, end she win no doubt irova a most famous see boat. It has been stated that Mr. Webb is about to build >tber iron'clad vessels for tha Italian navy, In addition to iie two be now has on haad. We enjoy the facilities Cpr :or roc ting the statement and-saylng that be bos no such ntention, nor have tbe Italians at present any dealre to ncrease their Iron clad navy by having them constructed lutside thalr own navy yard*. They have the men, noons and yards la which to build them, and they have dready built some of the Dnest vessels In their navy. Die representative of their navy now in this port must lot by any means be considered a sample, however. She was oum oy id* N en pom ana nvtru years ago, and boors the advent or the present style of war Teste?*. There la no doubt but the Coiled Slates government irould only be too glad to obtain tho He d'ltalla and fie de bulgl de 1'ortogallo, but the Italians, on the other tiand, would bo but too sorry to part with them.
