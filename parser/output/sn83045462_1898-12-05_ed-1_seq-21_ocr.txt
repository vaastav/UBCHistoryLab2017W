That there is existing no such con fli'lon of the L nited States finances, reve nues or credit as to Justify the proposition that the shifting of the burden of gold re demption of outstanding currency from the government to the banks is so Important as to necessitate of it self radical < hanges and concessions in national banking !aws rela tive to the Issue of notes, which changes and concessions would not be considered wise if Ihe interests of the community, ir respective of government tinances. were alone considered Second. That if. from considerations of general public policy, irrespective of gov ernmental finances, bank note Issues se cured only by commercial assets of banks seem unwise, tl at the resources, credit and financial conditions of the United States ure such that by means of revenue laws and other amendments to law suggested by the President In his lasi anr.ual message, a safer ratio between Its outstanding circu lation and go d reserve can be attained, the stability of the present gold .--tandard insured, and the currency maintained upon a sound basis without contraction. Function of Hanks. The controller then says: I' must b remembered, in connection with the discussion of hanges In (lie present banking laws, that by far the most im portant function of the national banks is that of an acting middleman between the depositors and borrowers of a community, and that its note-issuing functions are sec ondary In importance and usefulness under the present or any proposed system of bank note Issues. It is especia iy important, therefore, in proposing changes in the laws governing the notc-lss ilag pow. rs of national banks, that the effects of such changes upon the re'ation of th:* bank to lis depositors an 1 borrowers bo carer'utly studied. It Is the l>eiief of the controller that Hie proposed preference of the note holder ov r the depositor, which is a fundamental ua-i< or i I these p,a is not on.y inheren y wrong and unjustified by any grounds of l?uMie policy, bat that its practical elTeci upon the present relation of depositors to hanks In the *ma!!?r con munlties of the I nited States would be so revolutionary as to bring about the most Injurious condi "ons In the geiie-ai business of the coun'rv tZr,*?:?"" ifVUy d,sc??es the claim that there Is sn inherent moral righ. irr - spectlve of pub'k policy, to prefer a note S" ? holder in the disin bu Ion of tl. assets of an insolvent i.ank and (Fenies tnar such rii?ht exists After roa^l.ing this conclusion he a.-ks . . rjl'i no '"hercnf mora! right to es bwh a preference ..f the oou-hofd ing credi ors of an insolvent bank a ays.nst the deposit-holtilng creditor^ in the .llstr' bution of the assets of an insolvent bank, the question arises, does public policy de mand.

The note-issuing b ink* of r-tnada are but thirty-eight In number, with a combined circulation of i al>ont $rW.?*HU?oO.,# Summary of Vlevrs. The controller calls attention, as a sum mary of his views upon the proposed plans, | to these propositions: "1. As a fundamental proposition, any bank note system depending for security upon the commercial assets of banks and sanctioned by government should be in herently fair in its relation to the depos it-holding creditors and the note-holding creditors of an insolvent bank. **2. No system Is inherently fair which creates a preference of the note holder over f I the deposit holder in the distribution of the I assets of an insolvent bank. in none of the older countries, to the ??uceoss of whose uncovered note systems we .ire referred as tending to justify ths ex !>. riment in this country, is the note holder i>> the law preferred over the deposit holder | in case of insolvency of banks of issue. ' Canada, with its thirty-eight central banks of issue, as compared with .">.??? >o scattered national banks in this country, furnishes the on'v exception to this rule. I ' [ The necessity of the preference under j any such system in this country to give security and credit to the notes demon- | strates that it is the depositors of the j country, and not the banks, upon whom the groat weigh? of the guarantee of the note issue must fall. ?T,. a fairer system would provide that when a receiver took charge of an in I solvent bank he should not first pay into j the general redemption fund held by the government an amount derived from the I assets of the bank sufficient to pay the 1 n<>te holders In full before flaying anything: i j to depositors, but he should pay into the I fund that pro rata share of the proceeds j derived from the assets which should go to ! | the note holders, not as preferred creditors, but as creditors in the same class as de- I positors. ! "The tax upon the solvent banks for the | currency privilege should not. then, be lim ited to not exceeding 1 per cent per annum of their annual note issue, or in any other amount, but should be made sufficiency large to provide for the deficit, whatever ii should prove to be. "0. Tf under such a system, owing to cans- s to which we have referred, the tax upon the solvent banks would be so large as to render the issue of such currency unprofitable and unattractive t<> the hanks, it would be a demonstration of the radical difference in the environment and condition of our banking system as compared with the more centralized and older system of Europe. It would be a demonstration of th^ fact that under the proposed legisla tion. while the banks -would t;ikf- the profit* upon the circulation, the depositors would take the bulk of the losses. A <ira\e injustice. ' It would be a conclusive demonstration of what we believe to be the fact that, under our banking system as at present organized, the absolute safety of notes se cured only by commercial assets and is sue 1 to the ex*- r.t proposed in these plans can be secured only by resort to a grave injustice upon depositors, which cannot be justified upon any grounds of public pol icy. ? 7. Such a system of uncovered notes as this proposed, providing for a preference of the note holders over other creditors, would interfere radically with the more important functions of national banks to which the note-issuing function is secondary and sub ordinate. " This would be against public policy and would operate against banking in the small er communities, and in the western, south ern and central portions of our country. "ft. The government of the United States is not In such straits, in connection with its present currency system, as to compel it to enter into a plan of currency changes by which it in effect sells extended and valuable currency privileges to the national hanks of ihe country In exchange for as sistance from them in meeting its present governmental currency obligations payable in told. "0 Tf the present conditions of govern mental currency demand reforms, to secure which will entail cost, 'it Is better for the government, as the representative of all tin- people, and under all the circumstances ? "iinected with our banking system, to pay an ascertained and exact cost direct than to endear ? to evade it by granting exten sive currency privileges to banks which of necessity must reimburse themselves from the community and the depositor class for any cost which they incur in assuming the burden of gold redemption or maintaining the credit of their notes." Elasticity in Currency. The controller then discusses the ques tion of the elasticity needed in bank cur rency. commenting upon the great elasticity of the check and draft circulation of the country. in this connection, and as embodying his recommendations on this branch of his re port, he says: First. The existing bank note system, bas^fi upon deposit of government bonds as security, should not now be abandoned. Second. For the purpose of allowing elas ticity to l?ank note issues to protect the banks and the community in time of panic, a small amount of uncovered notes, in ad dition to th* secured notea, should be au thorized by law under th? following llmi \ a lions: They should be subjected to so heavy a tax that they could not be issued in r rmal times for the purpose of profit, but c.<?uld be available in times of emergency. The tax should be so large upon the solvent issuing banks as to provide a fund which. In connection with the pro rata share of -h. assets of ah insolvent bank, would he sufficient to redeem the notes in full with out necessitating any preference of note h? Iders over depositors of any insolvent Is suing bank. The tax should be so large as t ? force this currency into retirement as ? m as the emergency passes. Such a currency could be used only to lessen the evil effects of the too rapid liqui dation of credits which are collapsing under a financial panic, but could not be profitably used as a basis of business speculation and inflation. It should be to the business com munity what the clearing-house certificates ir?. to our cities in times of panic?a rem edy for an emergency, not an instrument of current business Amendment SuKKeNteil. The controller, under the head of "Limi tation of loans." urges an amendment to section 520o of the national banking law by which he will be given power to enforce a personal penalty for infractions of the law prohibiting excessive loans, something which the law does not at present give. He then recommends an amendment which will allow the banks of larger communities to have more nearly the privilege of loan ing a given percent of their assets to one individual, which now belongs, under strict compliance with the present law. to the banks of the smaller communities. lie then says: The greater ratio borne by banking re >ourc?s to bauklug capital in the larger communities, as compared with the like ratio In smaller communities, is responsible for the defective ami unequal working of the present provision. The average ratio of resources to the av erage capital of the 47 national banks in the city of New York Is as 18 is to 1: of tho 17 national banks in Chicago as 10.2 is to 1; of the 6 national banks in St. Louis as 7.3 is to I; of the 2&S national banks in other reserve cities as fl.G Is to 1; while in '..255 country banks tho ratio is but as 4.7 !s to 1. Th?j law limiting loans to 10 per cent of the capital, when applied to the 3,255 banks of the smaller commuuitio# of the country, a; a whole, would allow the loaning of U.U per cent of vMr total assets to one individual. As compared with this, the bank* of the city of New York, on the av erage. could not loan over fifty-six one hur'tredths of 1 per cent of their total as set* to any one individual; the banks of Chicago not over ninety-eight one-hun dredths per cent of their total asset*; the banks of St. Louis not over 1.4 per cent of their total assets; the banks of other re serve cities not over 1.51 of their total ?13 In other words, the proportion of their assets which the country banks of the United States can lean, in strict compliance with section r>20>). to one individual, is sixty-three one-hundredths of 1 per cent greater than in '2.77 reserve cities, seventy four one-hundredths of 1 per cent greater thnn in St. Louis, over twice as great as in Chicago, and nearly tour times as great as In the city of New York. Tills provision as it stands at presein constitutes an incentive to the making of loans the larger in proportion to the total assets of banks in smaller communities, where, as a rule, large loans which are safe are the most difficult to secure: while in the larger business centers of the coun try, where commercial conditions create a certain demand both from banks and bor rowers for large and safe loans, its efTect is the reverse to such an extent as to be injurious. Personal Penalty He then says; The failure of the present law to provide the power to apply a personal penalty for the making of excessive loans sometimes embarrasses the ccn'roller in endeavcrli.g to check tender.cies toward recklessness in loaning, which point to the ultimate rain of a hanking institution. As before stated, the present provision, when properly altered, should allow the b^nks of larger communities to have more nearly the privilege of loaning a given p r cent of their to'a' assets to one individual, which now belongs under a stri-t compli ance with the present provision, to the Ivnks of the smaller communl ies. I' rom 'his privilege they are now debarred by The desired results can be obtained, in our judgment, by adding, after the words, in section r>'Jt)0. "shall at no time exceed one-tenth part of the amount of the cap ital stock of such association actua'lv paid in" th? f-Hewing words; "Provided. That the restriction of this srcMon as to the amount of total liabilities to any association, of any person, or of any company, corporation, or firm for mono* borrowed, shall not apply where a Iran in excess of one-tenth part of the capital stock shall be less than 2 per cent of the to'al nssets of said hank At (he time of making said loan. Said loan shall l>e at all times protected by collateral security equal to or greater in value than the excess in the amount of sa'd loan over one-tenth of the capital stock." The strict and personal penalty enforce able by the controller should then be pro vided for infractions of the amended sec tion by the officers of banks, to enab'e the controller to successfu'Iy enforce general and strict compliance with its terms. The penalty clause will enable the con troller not only to limit the size, but to enforce the securing of excessive loans. Insolvent Bnnka. fnder the head of insolvent banks the controller discusses in deta'l his ruling of May 8. 189H. reversing the former position of the office in refusing to revise an assess ment against s'ockholuers when an ertor in the first assessment became manifest. He states that in eight banks a revision of the first assessment has been made. In three cases he has made a second assess ment against stockholders in the interest of depositors, and in five cases he will make returns to stockholders of suii'.s illegally collected from them. He states that in the administration of insolvent hanks in the intirest of creditors he has effected annual savings approximat ing $100,000. Domestic Branch DmiWlnis. Under this head the controller, while recommending that domestic branch bank ing should be legalized in communities of less than 2.000 inhabitants, many of which are now unable to support independent banks, opposes the granting of any more liberal privileges of branch banking than these, on grounds of public policy. He states that: Su h privileges would place the larger banks of the great cities in competition with the banks of smaller communities, and would probably result in a rapid centrali zation of the banking business of the coun try in the hands of a constantly lessening number of institutions. Theoretical advan tages aro claimed for such results, but in our judgment they would be injurious to the best interests of our country. Such a system would increase the diffi culties in the way of the small borrower, though lessening them for the large bor rower. It would tend to separate the bor rower from the lender, as It would of ne cessity remove the central lending power from the small borrowers of small com munities. It may be claimed that the agents in charge of the branch banks would possess the same powers of loaning as the officers of the smaller banks now possess; but such arguments ignore the prevailing tendencies of modern corporate management whicn magnify of necessity central responsibility, and constantly tend to subordinate to rigid systems the activities and responsibilities of agents up' in detached duty. l-'oreiKii ami i olonial Branch Ilank ln?s. In connection with this branch of his re port the controller discusses at length the necessity for the establishment of nlerna tional and intercolonial branch banking. He shows the disadvantages, as compared with foreign trade, under which American export and import trade now labors as a result of inferior banking facilities, and shows that these same disadvantages arc a serious hindrance to the adjustment of our trade relations to the new advantages af forded by territorial expansion. In this connection he discusses the Ha waiian and Porto Rican banking and trade situations. He says: The foundation for the greater growth of trade between the United States and her colonies must be speedily and firmly laid in proper banking laws, which will result ill enabling her merchants to do business with the people of the colonies without the disadvantages existing at present. Our present national banking laws do not authorize the . establishment of American international or American Intercolonial banks, nor could any national bank estab lish a branch in a territory or colony such as Porto Rico or Hawaii, even if our pres ent laws unchanged were extended over it. While it is questionable whether Congress should legalize the establishing of foreign or colonial branches by national batiks transacting business under the present law, that it should at least pa s laws au.hom ing, under proptr res retions, the gemral incorporation of banks organized to carry on international and intercolonial banking, as distinguished from domestic banking, ad mits of no reasonable doubt. Unless some such legislation Is provided the American exporter and importer, In his trade with America's own colonies, will be compelled to endure all the disadvantages under which, in all South American mar kets and in many other markets of the world, he now iahors in his competition with foreigners enjoying superior banking facilities. Involves Difficult (tueatlonii. His recommendations in connection with this branch of his report are made as fol lows: The determination of the relation of any new banking system to the existing banks and domestic credits of Porto Rico, differ ing as they do from those of this country, involves many difficult questions; and legal provisions for the appointment of a com mission especially charged with the exami nation of the conditions of domestic bank ing and finance on the islands, and with the recommendation of the proper forni of laws In connection therewith, is respect fully urged upon Congress. In view of the conditions and necessities of our trade with our new territories of Porto Rico and Hawaii, and with ether South American countries, as well as with those other territories over which our coun try must exercise a more or l*ss extended measure of control, the controller earnestly recommends the passage of laws authoriz ing the incorporation of banks organized for the purpose of carrying on international and intercolonial branch banking.

CANAL Interest in Proposed Sale by State of Maryland. PROSPECTIVE LOSS OF WATERWAY Reasons Advanced Against Action at This Time. THE SITUATION DISCUSSED The residents of the District of Colum bia and in the counties of Maryland through which the Chesapeake and Ohio canal passes are taking lively interest, it is understood. In the proposed sale of that waterway. When the subject was first broached by the board of public works of Maryland a few weeks ago thtre app?ared to be a general sentiment that it would be advisable to dispose of its holdings in the corporation, especially as the canal has never, with the exception of a couple of years, about a quarter of a century ago, paid the state any interest, but within the past few days a decided change of opinion has taken place, and it is understood the board of public works will be asked to withdraw its proposition to sell the state's interest to the highest bidder. Among the reasons advanced as to why the state should not relinquish its hold on the canal is that there are a targe number of persons who would be injuriously affect ed if the operations of the canal are stop ped. A geiTtleman who takes a great in terest in the matter said: Inmim' Misunderstood. "The real issue of the proposed sale of the state's interest in the Ch-sapeake and Ohio canal, and the real ground ot the ob jection to the sale, seem to be strangely misunderstood by the stale officials of Maryland and many who have discussed the matter. The question is not whether the canal shall be maintained as a canal or whether it shall be converted into a railroad, but whether the state will sell it? holding to the Baltimore and Ohio and have neither canal or railroad, or hold on to Its interest and insure the continual e of the canal or olse have a railroad con structed on its towpath. "The object of the purchase has been said to be a removal of a threat to the Baltimore and Ohio. Why should the state bestir itself to remove a threat to the Bal timore and Ohio? What public interests will be served by making that road the only outlet to the coal mines of Maryland and' the Elk Garden? "The bituminous coal mines of this part of the United States are controlled by three railroads, namely, the Baltimore a d Ohio, the Pennsylvania and the Norfolk and Western. What is to prevent these three companies from forming a combine and levying tribute upon the factories and commerce of Baltimore and other cities, just as tribute is levied upon every hearth stone by the anthracite coal combine? The existence of the canal or of an indepen dent road on its towpath is an absolute guarantee, as far as Baltimore is con cerned, against any such calamity. Shall the state of Maryland enter into any ar rangement to remove the obstacles to a combine? %<> Special Favor*. "The people of Maryland and those of Washington and Alexandria, who voted large sums years ago for the construction of the canal, need not look to the Baltimore and Ohio road for any special favors. The Baltimore and Ohio is no longer a Balti more or a Maryland enterprise. The ma jority of its stock, as reorganized. !s held in other cities. For five years to come i ct one Baltimore man will have a single vote in electing directors of the company. Kvery share of its stock will be voted by cltiz ns of New York, members of a voting syndi cate or pool which has already been ap pointed. The dominating influence in this voting trust, outside of New York, will be Chicago. New York at one end, Chicago at the other and Baltimore a way station. "What is the state to gain by ths ;;alc to the Baltimore and Ohio? Suppose the generosity and patriotism ol' that company should r rompt It to pay a half million cf dollars for the state's interest, the sum so received would, under the constitution, have to go toward payment of the tate debt, saving in that manner $15,(Mjo a y?ar In interest. The destruction and abandon ment of the canal would so decrease the value of property along nearly two hundred miles that reduced assessment would de crease the receipts Into the state's treasury fully that much each year, and probably double that much, and so the state would, in fact, be getting nothing In dollars and cents for its property. But it would be depriving the people ot a large portion of the state of their only avenue to market, and taking the daily bread from hundreds of families. The state expended ten mil lion dollars to give this great advantage to the people, and it is to be abandoned in order 'to remove a threat from the Balti more and Ohio.' Matter of Deserts. "In what manner has the Baltimore and Ohio deserved thi? kindly consideration from the state? By withholding the interest on the state's stock in the Washington branch? By falling to pay over to the Washington branch nearly a million dollars, which it admits that it owes and one-third of which belongs to the state? "The canal Is in the hands of the Balti more anil Ohio until May 1. 11)01. It must continue Its operation as a canal until that lime or the attorney general of the slate can make a motion for the immediate sale of the work for violation of the terms of the decree. On May 1. 11*01, the decree for sale must be enforced if the state asks It. With the state's interest in the hands of the Baltimore and Ohio the threat of the sale will be removed, and we may reasona bly look for a discontinuance of business on the canal the day after the sale Is made. And, as has been said by some well-inform ed persons, it will become a frog pond. "The Baltimore and Ohio will have no ob ject in diverting any coal from its own lines or operating the canal at a loss. It will not build a track on the towpath, because It already has-a double track within a stone's throw from almost any part of the line west of Tuscarora, near Washington. It is. therefore, certain that the only object the Baltimore and Ohio can have In the pur chase is to remove the threat of a competing line. Competing? Line Needed. The people want the competing line more than they want the sum the Balti more and Ohio may offer. Treasurer Shryock's statement, which was recently published, shows that the state does not need the money, but even now the revenues are so large that the present small tax rate should be reduced. "It Is apparent that the Baltimore and Ohio is the only possible purchaser at this time. By buying the stock it would get the canal and remove the threat. Any other purchaser would only be buying a lawsuit, and then might not get the canal. "The state has held on for sixty years, and it can hold on for three years longer. Then, if desirable, the canal Itself can be sold, and there might be many bidders. At this time the West Virginia Central and the Western Maryland roads are satisfied with Baltimore and Ohio arrangements, but long before XttOl a break may come. Fatnre Possibilities. ??The Western Maryland may want its own entrance to the mines, and so insure a sup ply of coal to eastern points over Its own road as far as Baltimore. The West Vir ginia Central may want an outlet to tide water before then. The Pennsylvania may want to bid for It, and build a line to short en the distance from Washington and the south to Pittsburg and the west. The pro posed canal from the lakes to the Ohio river may have taken shape and a water outlet to Washington and Baltimore may be needed. Then a canal fTom. Pittsburg to Cumber land would allow the passage of a boat from Chicago or Duluth to Washington. "With all these possibilities in the future It would be criminal for the state to enter Into any arrangement with the Baltimore and Ohio for th*-destruction of the canal. A sale to the BaUlipore and Ohio means Its destruction and ftdt the continuance of a waterway. "There hive hwli many references to .the offer Governor fcr"*11 made for th? Ml* of the canal stocks. But the object of that proposed sale was to substitute a railroad for the canal, not the destruction of the canal and of all chance for a railroad.'* 

WHAT ENGLISHMEN EXPECT. Frank Statement Regardinfr tlie Anglo-American Rapprochement. A London dispatch of yesterday's date says: The practical conclusion of the peace negotiations at Paris is hailed here with considerable satisfaction, and the news papers daily discuss the so-called "im perial" future of the United States, coupled with the fervent hope that the TTnited States will adopt a colonial "open door" policy. The Saturday Review is very candid about what it describes as "the slobbering cant and hypocritical blazoning of doubtful af fection" between the United States and Great Britain, and says: "Let us be frank and say outright that we expect mutual gain in material interests from this rap prochement. The American commissioners at Paris are making their bargain, whether they realfze it or not, under the protecting naval strength of England, and we shall expect a material quid pro quo for this as sistance. We expect the United States to (leal generously with Canada in the matter of tariffs, and we expect to be remembered when the United States comes into posses sion of the, Philippine Islands, and above all, we expect her assistance on the day, wbich is quickly approaching, when the future of China comes up for settlement, for the young imperialist has entered upon a path where it will require a stro ig friend, and a lasting friendship between the two nations can be secured, not by frothy sentimentality on public platforms, but by reciprocal ad vantages In solid, material Interests." The foregoing opinion is certainly out spoken enough, but every American moving in business circles here knows this^ voices the expectations of the average English man. The question of the Sulu Islands again is viewed through the spectacles of British commerce, the Pall Mall Gazette remark ing: "Let the United States acquire the Sulus if they want them; but let us have the 'open door* there for our trade. Th** Sulus are the connecting link between North Bor neo and the Philippines, and we have as much interest in these islands as the Amer icans will have." EARLY AGREEME\T EXPECTED. Peace Treaty With Spnin Will Be Signed Till* Week. A P&ris dispatch of yesterday says: The United States and Spanish peace commis sions held private sessions today. After ward representatives of both bodies pre dicted confidently that the treaty would be signed within a week unless unforeseen complications arise. The Americans declare there is no foun dation for the reports circulated in the Uni ted States and cabled back here that Pres ident McKinley has forwarded to the Amer ican commissioners instructions to Insist unyieldingly upon a coaling base in the Carolines, and that the Spaniards are en deavoring to renew their opposition to a cession of the Philippines. Both commissions recognize that the lat ter question is sett'.ed. At Madrid yesterday the Official Gazette published an announcement that the draw ing for the redemption of the Cuban bonds would occur on December lo. The speculation in the Cuban and Philip pine debts on the bourse has seriously dis pleased the cabinet. The rise in those se curities is attributed to the report that the government will devote the indemnity re ceived from the United States to the co lonial Indebtedness, regarding which no de cisive resolutions have been taken by min isters. An official dispatch from the Visayas Is lands. in the Philippines, announces that the insurgents are>edoubling their attacks upon Hoi-o. The government advices say: "The rebels have now their guns trained on the city and fire on the defenses nightly. Our troops maintain a spirited defense, and have killed large numbers of the enemy." M MEROIS ARRESTS OF ( ARLISTS. Kiflefi Found Hidden t nderurouiMl at Bilbao, Spain, LONDON, December 5.?The Daily Mail publishes the following dispatch from Biar ritz: "The censorship is so severe that the Spanish newspapers are prohibited from contradicting Carlist news published abroad. There have been numerous arrests of Carlists at Barcelona and elsewhere in Catalonia. The Carlist general Isasi and several colleagues have disappeared." The Madrid correspondent of the Stand ard aaya: "The conservative party and Senor Silvela. through their organs, have suddenly made peremptory bids tor power. Senor Sagasta treats the matter calmly, riuiculing the smallness of Senor Silvela's following, and declining to hasten the assembling of the cortes to be convened in January, or the conclusion of the peace negotiations." A dispatch from Bilbao. Spain, says: The local papers report the discovery here of Hi'ti rifles, carefully hidden underground. A number of Carlists have been arrested on the charge of being connected therewith. Police Will Interfere. Mr. Louis H. Perley of 631 North Carolina avenue, who complained against the play ing of foot ball on the spaed on North Caro lina avenue between Oth and 7th streets, has been informed by the District Com missioners that the police authorities will stop the practice.
