In response to a sereitsde on the night of his election as United States Senator, ex-Governor Vance, of North Carolina, said: I was reared a Whig; a party devoted to the Union; as a Whig I fought dis union, and stood by the Union even until in the South generally, feeling it self aggrieved, Unionism became very unpopular. I still adhered to it until my State, in her sovereign iapaelty, attempted to dissever .r eomnection with that Union. I then qeeted to go with my State, my kith and kin. JaYr ing joined the army I determined to serve the new cause with the same un swerving seal with which I had served that of the Union. I was called upon to support acts which had not before and did not then meet with my approv al, for the general good. I served as your Governor; I clung with you to the cause,and did not surrender my author ity until the last hungry, ragged Con federate had laid down his arms. After the war, terms, upon conditions, were held out to the people of the Bouth. I would not accept terms that would sep arate me from you and the brave boys who went at your bidding. The longest road has a turn. I did not wish to rise until I could rise with you. Thank God that time has arrived. We go up now. We may go down agal, but we will go down together; and I will have with me good company-the best and bravest hearts in the land. Because our party has been triumphant there are some who urge retaliation. This should not be so. The best antidote for tyranny, the strongest weapon against it, is the enactment of Just and whole some laws. Now that we have the government of North Carolina in our hands, we should not aim to avenge ourselves for the overriding of civil liberty among us, but we should so ar range that it cannot happen again should see to it that no executive or other authority can again attempt to destroy our liberties. From the obtain ing of magna charta to the present day no attempt to override or abridge it has been made that has not more firmly re establish liberty. May it be so here. It is true that in the last five years we have felt what it is to be without trial by jury, to have arrests among us with* out warrant, and the freedom of the press abridged. All the people under stand it now. It behooves us now to build up the great principles of civil liberty on the eternal rock of our great country. Let anger, revenge, and re taliation be ignored, and let the laws on your statute book bear the impress of a free people determined legitimate ly to maintain their freedom. In my place in the Senate I shall endeavor to serve my great State and my country with honor. That I shall be admitted to seve you scarcely admits of a doubt. The President's message, it is said, will foreshadow amnesty, and the recent elections show the handwriting on the wall. There are many great statesmen among the dominant party in Congress, representing large constituencies,amnong whom a tremendous revolution in sen timent on these questions has taken place. Those ment and the great Amner ican people, who, after a long war of blood and carnage, resulting in the freedom of the African, will no longer tolerate the enslavement of the Anglo Saxon. Every law, both State and national, shouldl be respected and obey edl by all our people; bitterntess and vituperation should cease, and men, no lollnger enieavoring to desttroy each other, should earnestly engender kind ly fteeling among all classes of our cit izens. To bring about thes, dtesirable ends will le the earnest task of my life, in Congress and elsewhere. I thank you, fellow-citizens, for your conmpli ment.
