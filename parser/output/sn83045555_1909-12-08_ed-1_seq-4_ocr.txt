ISIS provided 1 that American fishermen wcro allowed to take fish inshore that is Inside a line parallel with tho coast and three I miles from shore on parts of the coast I of Newfoundland and Labrador also to dry and cure fish on unsettled parts of those whores and to enter harbors for shelter wood and water But the treaty has always been a source ot difference between the two countries In 1S77 the United States paid 5500008 according to a decision by an arbitra tion commission for certain privileges exercised by American fishermen If tho submission of the case to the per I manent Hague court settles the con troversy for ever that court will there I by establish Its usefulness and demon strate that war is no longer a neces sary evil but one that can be avoided Tho message pays a great deal of at tention to foreign countries and af I fairs It suggests the probability of a j special message on Liberia This rcpub r Slic was founded in 1S21 on the west coast of Africa by American negroes In 1810 the National Colonization So I ciety camo into existence with the aim of encouraging tho emigration of free negroes to Africa and in 1819 Congress Appropriated J100000 to carry back slaves captured at sea Thus Liberia was founded But it has never bean 1 prosperous The country has asked tha L United States for assistance and this cannot very well be refused But In what form can help be rendered con sistently The status of the Spitzbergen Islands is another foreign question to whIch the message calls attention That group of Islands situated about 400 jI miles north of North Cape though I known for centuries by explorers whal ers and hunters has been practically H nomans land Russians have made efforts at colonizing But tho islands aro valuable on account of mineral deposits I posits as well as for fishing and whal ing purposes and a conference Is about t to be held for the purpose of establish ing an International status To this con ference the United States has been Invited Ono of the Imnortank nnrts nf the message relates to Latin America Con gress Is asked for a liberal appropria tion for representation at Buenos Ayres I next July at the fourth PanAmerican i congress and the agricultural exhibi tion to be held at the same place fiom t May to November next year Attention Is called to the fact that American capital Is being InvesteJ In S r foreign countries n1 that ijierefoie American citizens and Interests must be protected abroad This leads to the following Important definition of our PuiAnierican policy With the changed circumstances of tho United States and of the republics l to the south of us most of which havo I great natural resources stable govern ment and progressive Ideals tho appre 1 hension of which gave rise to the Mon roe doctrine may be said to have near I ly disappeared and neither the doctrine as It exists nor any other doctrine of American policy should be permitted to operate for the perpetuation of Irrc uponMhlc government tho escape ot Just obligations or the insidious allega tion of dominating ambitions on the 1 part ot tho United States Beside the fundamental doctrines of our pan American policy there havo grown up a realization of political Interests com 4 munity of Institutions and Ideals and ti a flourishing commerce All theso bonds will be greatly strengthened as a time goes on and Increased faculties such as the great bank soon to bo es I tafbllshed In Latin America supply the means for building up the collossal intercontinental commerce of tho fu ture Special attention la paid to NJcura Ec and the Zelaya government Iii se I I verely arraigned The Important point Is made that the two Americans who were killed by Zelayaa orders wino I officers In the Insurgent army and were entitled to the rights of prisoners of i war This fact cannot but count against the resident of Nicaragua Tho Message discusses our fur eastern C policy which Is ono of respect for tho 4 Integrity of China and equal opportuni l ties for all Our relations with Japan are said to be cordial which can only mean that Japan too Is in harmony with our far eastern policy I Turning to domestic attain the Mes sage recommends tho subdivision of I 1 the State department for the purpose 1 I i of better specialization of the enormous business This ill a splendid rcconi incnUatfon As the country is growing I S Its business demands some such ar rangement Tho Message then takes up the ques tion of economy In expenditures Tho ordinary expenditures for tIle current fiscal year ending June 30 1010 will exceed wo are told tho estimated re ceipts by 34075620 If to this deficit Is added tho sum to 1 > e disbursed for the Panama canal amounting to 39000000 and 1000000 to be paid on the public debt tile deficit of culinary receipts and expenditures will be Increased to a total deficit of 71075620 This deficit the secretary proposes to meet by the proceeds of bonds Issued to pay the cost of constructing tho Panama canal By cutting down the expenditures of I every government department the cs tlmatea for the expenses of the govern ment for the next fiscal year ending Juno 30 1911 are less than the appro priations for this current fiscal year by 42S1S000 It Is thought that the ex penditures for the next fiscal year end ing Juno 30 1911 and excluding pay ments on account of the Panama canal will leave a surplus of 33931000 The Message adds The secretary of the treasury points out what should be carefully noted in respect to thlfi reduction In govern mental expenses for the next fiscal year that the economics arc of two kinds first thero Is a Raving In the permanent administration of the de partments bureaus and offices of the government and second there Is a present reduction In expenses by a postponement of projects and improve ments that ultimately will have to be carried out but which are now delayed with the hope that additional revenue In the future will permit their execution without srocurlng a deficit A great saving Is made in the mili tary expenses It Is stated that not less than 45000000i will be saved on this account The naval expenses alone are 38000000 less than the corre sponding estimates for last year The President emphasizes the necessi ty of a change In tho Judicial proced ure with a view to reducing Its expense to private litigants In civil cases and facilitatingtho dispatch of business in both civil and criminal cases lIe ex presses the view that much of the law less violence and cruelty exhibited In I ynchlngs directly duo to the uncer tainties and Injustice growing out of ho delays In trials judgment1 and tho executions thereof by our courts lIe suggests In this connection that the Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court could bo confined almost wholly to statutory and constitutional questions He rec ommends the appointment of a commTs lon with authority to examine the law and equity procedure of tho federal courts of first Instance the law of ap peals from those courts to tho courts of appeals and > to the supreme court and the costs imposed In such proced ure upon the private litigants and upon ho public treasury and make recom mendations with a view to simplifying and expediting the procedure as far as possible and making It as Inexpensive as may be to tho litigants of little means Another recommendation fls directed against the abuso of Injunc tions The Message lecommends tho estab Ishmcnt of postal savings banks tha passage of a ship subsidy bill the ad mission of Now Mexico and Arizona the appointment of a governor and an executive council for Alaska legisla ion against the white slave trade the establishment of a national bureau of health publicity with regard to cam paign funds the conservation of our national resources the observance of the fiftieth anniversary of the emancipation ot tho negroes and closes with the assurance urance that the country Is enjoying a high state of prosperity The Message of President Taft Is a comprehensive clear and statesmanlike document Everyone who cares to keep posted on the affairs of the country should read It thoughtfully NO 

DAXITES IN TirE CHURCH A clipping from a iccent number of a Plttsburg paper has reached this of ice It purports to be tho complete story of a famous Mormon preacher once a member of the Avenging Angels who at a ripe old ago has turned counterfeiter The story is not very clear Wo have written for fur her partlculttrsi The central figure Is described as a famous Mormon preacher although it Is safe to say that nobody In these parts ever heard of his fame lIe Is also said to havo come west In 1819 with the famous prophets band whatever that means and to be a fam ous huntel The item states that Ills name Is Lee and refers to the Moun tain Meadow massacre and the ques tion naturally arises whether the au thor of It In his befuddled condition does not confound the alleged counter feiter with the famous villain of the Mountain Meadow drama who paid the penalty for his crime over thirty years ago That Is generally as near as antIMonnon writers ever come to the truth The author of the Item claims that the alleged counterfeiter now 71 years old was once a member of the Aveng Ing Angels and the remark Is pertinent that ho must have entered It the same year he was born for that organiza tion also known as Danltes was formed In 1838 and died an Ignominious death shortly after Its birth Alto gether the counterfeiter must have been a remarkable child The reference to the Danltes re minds us that a strange misunder standing exists In tho minds of non Mormons regarding that band They generally suppose It to have been a Mormon institution sanctioned by the Church By anliMormon wrltcru It has even been represented as a body guard to tho Prophet Jo seph Tho truth Is that It was an abortive attempt at forming a secret organization to fight tho Church as Wl1l as all law and order Luther used to say that where the Almighty builds Ills church satan Is tune to build his chapel and this truth Is well Illus trated In the attempt to launch that organization The organization known an Danltea and Destroying Angels was the con ception of Dr Sampson Avard at Far West Mo Ho was an unscrupulous fanatic who was expelled from the Church as soon his vile schemed be camo known to the Prophet Avard was secretly laying plans to become a lcadcrof the Church At a time wUeli t r persecution raged In wild torrents and hearts were bleeding under the hands of oppression Avard found an oppor tunity of preaching the unChristian doctrlno of retaliation to some willing ears Ills aim was to overthrow the Church and set himself up as a wordly ruler He persuaded some of the Saints to believe that he had the sanction of Sidney RIgdon for his plans And by false pretenses ho brought nomo to gether In a secret organization which was named tho Danltcs He tried to organize companies of fifties and tens and place each under the command of an officer He taught them that they I i were to go out and despoil the outlying settlements and that they might lie and steal with impunity Many of his followers revolted at this and left Mm and as soon as his wickedness became known to Presidency of the Church ho was expelled and afterwards sought companionship among the enemies of the Church This Is the famous Danltc organ ization It never was a Church Insti tution Thomas B Malsh at one time 1 made nn affidavit stating that the Lat terday Saints have a company con sisting of all that are considered true Mormons called Danltcs and Orson Hyde partly corroborated this false hood But both repented and sought forgiveness Thoro never was a Uanlte organi zation In the Church and It Is high time that the misunderstanding bo removed The story Is one of the peculiar falsehoods that live on though everybody knows It Is not true It Is like the stbry regarding Luther women and wine or tho fable of a pope having cursed Halleys comet Some yarns obtain currency though based on fiction because thero are peo ple who wish they were ture and the Danltc fable as a Mormon insti tution is one of them BAD

NEWS OF YESTERDAY I THE ONLY TIME THAT JAY GOULD GOT BOILING MAD By E J Edwards This dally series of anecdotes and I nchlents that throw new Interesting and frequently dramatic light on famous events and personalities of time past havo been collected by Edwards during nearly forty years ool more or less Inti mate acquaintance with many of the co untrys leaders since tho Civil War Each anecdote or Incident le fresh from Mr E dwardss notebook and either In whole 01 In part It constitutes New News of Yesterday garnered from the men who made tho news the history or from cq ually authoritative sources As Im portant contributions the Human Int crest sort American history theta articles have a distinctive value all the Ir own Great as were hIs financial conquests probably the greatest of all of Jay Goulds victories was that which he gained over his temper said an old friend of the family to me at tho time of the little wizards death In 1892 In Its natural state lila was a most unruly temper Unmasterod It would undoubtedly have led him Into all sorts of embarrassing situations and to my mind seriously Imperiled the success of his alms In Ufo But more than once I have heard Russell Sage say and he certainly knows that Mr Gould was the most even tempered man with whom ho had ever been brought Into business association Indeed BO complete was Mr Goulds mastery over his temper that I can recall only one time when It ever got the better of him Then curiously enough Mr Gould got boiling mad In behalf of a good friend and business associate and had not seIne of his closest friends been ablo Anally to re strain him there Is no telling to what lengths ho would have let his fury carry him Ono day there came to Mr Goulds cars a report that to this his friend and business associate a second friend and Ibiwlncss associate was acting so disloyally that there was grave danger of an unfortunate domestic disturbance Conduct of this sort was the ono thing that Mr Gould could not forgot or forgive and Instantly the bounds that ho had kept for so many years on his temper burst and his rage became truly terrifying His one thought then was to drive tho alleged disloyal friend out of rep utable busIness and social associations To this end and while his fury was at Its height ho had prepared a bit ter vitriolic article which purported to bo a narrative of various private episodes In this spans life This article ho exultantly told several of his friends when the completed innnuscrilpt vas handed to him he was going to havo published tho next day In the Now York newspaper that he then owned Ill tako tho full responsibility for Its pub lication ho declared and added that Jus would bo only too glad xto dp 110 feilie tilt auto that lImo publication 1 votes and

only after very long and very earnest efforts on the part of Mr Gould conlldants that they were at all ablo to swerve him In the slightest from the plan of action that he had mapped out In the heat of his anger But Ilnally Mr Gould was reluctantly dissuaded from making tho printed at tack by the fctatement of ono of hIs friends that while the article would probably drive the man Into obscurity as Mr Gould hoped it would it also would probablycause tho public to feel great resentment in the end to the bringer of such unwelcome news In which antmus would unquestionably be discerned S That was something which Mr Gould had not taken Into account Nor had ho thought what the effect of such an article might be on his financial sqhernes His sole Idea was to help a good friend who ho believed was fac ing a most serIous danger Later on when his angel hud cooled and he had regained his usual control of his temper ho admitted that he probably would havo done the wrong thing had ho persisted in having tho article pub lished and from that time on to the day of his death ho was more than ever convinced of tho great danger there Is In doing anything in the heat of passion Copyright 1009 by E J
