He 5jj BY ANDRE TIIEU1UET. HKliHKLOT and I were college chums, but after we struggled to gether through our baehots we lost tilit of one another until we met, 2o 3 ears later, at a college banquet. It was a commonplace function of the hackneyed type; much tremendous handshaking and boisterous recogni tion, remarks ujou one another' looks and fortunes, the usual solemn little oration from the chairman, followed by the customary toasts and the Until burst of student reminiscences, glossed, of eourse, by the enchantment distance lends to the period of 3011th and san guine hopes. Jtut a surprise awaited me in old Iler belot. lie absolutely astounded me. 1 remembered him ns a reserved, timid young fellow, very slight and trim, ox uctly the kind of 011th to make his way up In the oflice where his people placed him. Now there stood before jue a sturdy, manly fellow, with bronzed face and throat, keen eyes and a loud, jolly voice that blurted out whatever came upjxrinost. With his close-cut hnir, his rough suit, his broad, grizzly beard and his assured, free-and-easy manners, there was not a remnant of the clerk about him. "Why," I exclaimed, "what's the moaning of It? Are you not In Uie of fice it ill r "No. no. mv tlear fellow." he an swered; "I am just an honest farmer I have a little place at Chanteralne, about a mile and a half from here, n nice enough little place, too, where I sow "wheat and manufacture n small vine, that you shall taste when you Mill come and ee me. 'What!" cried I, "is It possible that you, son and grandson of men of the robe, you, supposed to be the very type f clerks, nnd born to make your way in the world ns one, have given up your catura'i career?" p nodded affirmatively, smiling and twinkling with evident enjoyment of inv surprise. "Hut," 1 osked, "tell me how it came about?" "My dear fellow," he answered, sen tentiouslv, "little causes have n way occasionally of producing big effects; two peaches did so for tno. "Two icnche s?" I cried, bow ilderrd "Yes. neither more nor loss. And ns It seem In Interest you. I will tell you nil nbout It If you will walk out tot hon teraino w ith me nfter we have had some coffee." T, thla I arrrrrd. nnd It was ns we sauntered niong the canal that sultry August afternoon, cigar In mouth, that he told me his story. v vim nr aware." ho brirnn. "office life In our family is bred In the bone 7 father, a clerk nil his life, thought It Incomparably the best of lives, nnd when, directly nfter I had mugged through my baccnlaureat, he shoved me ..., 4i. in cc where he nan n ierm himself. I made no objection. My Idea mmn the matter were not vrry pro ,,m,n.fl!. nnd I was finite ready to be liee that what hnd been good enough for Mm and his father before Mm ...... 1.. frnid enontrh for me. It was ure, at least, however slow. At first I was, of course, only a' aupernumeraiy, but being a neaxiy, hard-working sort of chap, and hafit.g early Imbibed proper notions of the re peat a clerk owes his superiors I was soon noticed by trie cnieis ano goi a rise. This was when I was 25. I real!' think the head man in our department had a fancy for me. At any rate, he kept me always In his own room, and the other chaps In the office oil envied me my luck nnd chaffed me nbout the rosy future when I was to be top of the tree. Hut I soon gave them reason to change their opinion of me. I rnar- rltd, and, not only that, I married a girl who was pretty, loving, sweet, but who had no money. Now, this is the sort of thing business men despise. To them marringe is entirely a business transaction. 'The husband can pro vide the breakfast. they sny, 'but the wife ought to provide the dinner.' "Well, when we first married It was fully ns much as we could do between tis to provide supper. l-.veryone said I was a fool, nnd that I hnd made 0 mcs of my life. Hut we contrived to make end meet. She was ns good ns gold, our wants were few, and, though we had to economize and be called fools for our pains, yet society condescended not absolutely to cut us. "My chief was n rich man and fond of making a show, lie often enter Inined; sometimes at great, heavy din ners, and occasionally he inited the chief residents and the families of the government officials to a dance. "It wos to one of these latter enter talnments that we were asked nbout a year after our marriage, and, my wife rot beinir In n fit stnte of health to accent, I would have given n great deal to stay at homo cozily with her Hut I dared not do It. for the chief did not oerinlt lils Invitations to be slighted. "So, reluctantly enough, I donned my dress clothes, the w ife running me over with her eve before I started to see that everything wos correct and giv ing me little pats and pulls, especially the how of 111 v white tie. "'It's going to be a regulnr grand ball.' she said, 'so mind you keep your eyes open and see everything, for my benefit. I shall expect to be told who is there and till about the toilettes and the supper. Oh, 1 forgot, there Is to be n grand supper. They sny he ha sent to Che vet for oil kinds of delicacies fruits and things worth their weight In gold, reaches, mv dear, at three francs n piece! Oh, those peaches! 1 do want one so badly. Do you know, I think if you were very, very nice, you w ould manage to snuggle one to me!' "I cried out nt this, and represented to her that It was as much as 11 man's reputation wos worth to be seen slip ping fruit off the table into his pocket; and that If I were caught doing such a thing we should be cut. Hut the more I talked the more she Insisted upon the gratification of her whim. 'Why, It is just the very easiest thing in the whole world. All you have to do is to take one for yourself nnd bring it to mo. In the midt of all thoc people coming nnd going you w on't be noticed. Now, don't you shrug our shoulders, sir. I dnresny it is ery childish of me, but 1 do long for it. l'ver since I heard about those peaches I have wanted one, just dread fully. Promise me, dear, you'll bring me one promise mo, darling.' .Vow, what was I to say to her? How could I refuse her, loving her ns 1 did? At nny rate, nt last I murmured out some kind of a promise and then hastened to start. Hut just when 1 was the net of closing the outside door she called me. I looked round od . ,j two great blue eyes fixed on me, eves that absolutely gleamed with desire, and she called out: "'You've promised, haven't you, ear?' "The ball w as a grand affair. Flow era In profusion, pretty toilettes, good mu le. The profot, the local justice, the officers of the garrison, everyone who was anyone wns there. The chief cer tainly had spared nothing to make it success, nnd his wife and daughter did the honors exceedingly well. Vt supper time I followed the pro cession with n thumping heart, nnd the first thing I saw, in the place of honor on the long table, were Lhcvcts fa mous peaches. And magnificent they certainly w ere. I hoy w ere piled up In n basket shaped dish of Lunevllle china, ench separate fruit resting In its own little nest of fresh vine leaves, skillfully ar ranged to display Its attractions, the rosy flush of one velvety cheek contrast ing with the greeny white of a neigh bor. The very look of them was enough; one could see they were delicious, per fumed, pink-flcshcd. I gnzed tenderly at them from ndia creet distance1, nnd then began to think of the happy little erics that would greet ino If I could contrive to take just one home. I'veryono wna ndmlring them, and the more I looked, the more determined I wns to get one, or per haps n couple. Hut how? That wan the point, for It wiiH evident the sonants were keeping guard over them. I'very now nnd then 1 caught the master of the house giv ing 11 little nod, and then the butler would delicately remote a peach, open it with n silver knife, and hnnd the split fruit, on a Sevres plate, to the in dividual who was. allowed the honor o eating one. "I wntohed this little game until T began to tremble lest the whole pyra mid should vanish. Hut my fears, were not renlicd. Por some reason or t her cither because the host signified hi pleasure that no more should b dis penscd, or because some guovfs were too modest to accept the 'mil, to My relief 1 saw six beauties still retii:ilne( when the band struck tip fresh chord and the company filed back to the lmll itxun to dance. "I went too, but only ns u feint had purposely left my hat In the sup ner-room, n tall one that had nee 11 both ering me nil the evening. I went bad for It very soon, the servant, who all knew me, iiot, of course, watching me They were very buay too, carrying avvuy the used platea ami glasses, aim it so fell out that, for one minute. I wna the only occupant of the room. I here was no time to lone, however, una, glancing furtively to right and left. 1 approached the dish, stretencu out mv arm. snntched two peaches, and, In the twinkling of an eye. had them In my hat, my handkerchief stntTed well between them. Then, assuming an air of calm dignity, I stalked oui of the room, holding the otwn side of the l.ai against my chest, and keeping It steady with my right hnnd. which wna hidden in the Umoin ot iny wnisiconi. It reullv was a fine posture, the sort or thing one sees in statues of front men. "It wns my intention to make my w ay cautiously through the bnllroom. nnd then, without unV form 01 icnveiiiiving, to slip out of the house and carry home my Ixioty in triumph. "Hut 1 counted w ithout my host or, rnther. without the Jiohi a .uiugiiicr. The cotillon had just Wgun. the gnat room w as surrounded by n double row ; against the- wall black coals ,nd dow n-vis, theiVa row of scuts lor me iian- cis, who now filled the m'dd.e of the room and were dancing n. w nit. To get nwnv, 1 nal to cros mi- hmu.i through the wnltzers. I tried to do so without being noticed, in n inorni fright that some one would come bump ing against 1110 nnd jolt out the penchea. I could feel them rolling nbout Inside mv hat, nnd the blood in my head, face and cars felt like liquid fire. 1 really Buffered ngoniea of terror, but I found myself at hist safely landed on the other side of the circle, just ns n new figure was being started. A lady wns set in the center of n ring of men who were to dance round her, with their backs turned to her. Sho was to hold a hat In her hand, and place it on the head of the man she chose ns her part ner to waltz. I arrived just ns this maneuver began, and the very moment the daughter of the house, who was dancing with one of the olT.cial.s of the prefecture, net eyes on me, she said: "'A bat, a hat! just what we wanted!' "I was jH trificd-I stared at her, but could not move. "'Oh, M. llcrbelot.' she said, 'you have just come at the right moment. Please give us your hat.' "Ami before I could utter a word, sdie Koi.od it out of mv hands so suddenly that peaches, handkerchief, vine leaves all rolled out together o-i the polished floor. You can imagine the scene; the idles trving to laugh, all eyes turned me, the penchea lying at my feet, the chief's displeased frown; the older .eople round the wall whimpering nnd t.ointing. Mv legs tottered under me, and 1 would have given this world to sefl the lltwr open to swallow me. "At lase some one spoke: 'Pleaso ick your poaches up. M. TIerbdot.' It wns the young lady who had snatcho l my hat nnd caused the catnst rophe. There w as 11 depth of sari asm in her oice, and she vvu.s screw in;r up her mouth to avoid laughing aloud. "Her words noti-d like a signal: n bonis of laughter rang from every orner of the room; the very f.ervanU . . . . . 1 . , . 1 .1 1 1.. grasM-d Uicir siues ns 1 i nom m their amusement; whilst I pale, hag gard, trembling from head to foot, ilevv out of the house to rush home and pour out the story to my wife. Next day It was the talk of the town. When 1 went to the oflice -very fellow n it came up In turn to say: 'flood morning; nnd, I say, Herbelot. Pickup those peaches.' l'.ven in the street the oys followed me and called after me: Peaches, peaches. The long and short of it was that I had to give up my place; a week later I sent In my resignation. "An uncle of my wife was fanning some land of his own nenr the town where I wns born, and I wrote nsking him to take me as n kind of auxiliary He agreed to this; nnd that is how we ame to Chanteralne. There's not much more to tell you. I buckled to, got up at daybreak, and worked ns hard as a nig- g-cr. me nie suiteu mo, nuer nil, nciier than the old oflice, ami before very long I developed into n regular farmer. The farm Itself prospered io much to my old uncle's satisfaction that he left it to us ot his death. Since then I hav bought more land round the old place, and now you shall 8ee for yourself the results." Hy this time we were at Chanteralne. First we passed through the orchard under trees bending beneath the weight of apples, pears, plum.s. beyond it a field sloped to n clear attfam, on the farther side of which rose a vine-clad hill, where grope were now swelling and thrushea warbling. Loft of us, the noise of a winnowing machine showed where the barn stood, nnd, ofter wc passed through the well-stocked kitchen garden, we saw the hous, the whlto ftont of which was covered with peach espaliers In-nrlng a fine crop of ripening fiuit. "Ah!" said llcrbelot, "you see, we go in for peaches here. I owe them ail my luck, and but for them should hava been to this ilny a wretched little clerk, shaking in my shoes every time my chief was out of humor. Poor fellows, there ore too many of them, without me, Jut dragging on a miserable existence en their pittance of a salary, afraid of having children for fenr they will never be able to cither feed them or give them a start in life. Hut here, thank Heaven, I am my own master, aud children aro welcome; there's plenty of our own corn to feed us all."

DENOUNCED 1JY DIPLOMATS. Ex-Mlnlstor Taylor's Attack Upon tho Prosidont. The Chief r.vrrulhf'i Cuban l'olley Incense the Former llr iireeii t tlve of the lulled States In Hlalu Murpr laliiit Outburst. Special Washington Correspondence. The sensational attacks made by Px Minister Taylor upon the president's Cuban policy as outlined in his message creates considerable surprise and a good deal of unfavorable comment here. This la especially true among those accustomed to diplomatic usages and to those who recall Mr. Taylor's ow n record upon this question. While it is not possible at present to obtain access to the oflicial records covering Mr. Taylor's report's and statements during the closing yeur of his service as minister, there is sufficient, even in his published record, to create much surprise nnd much adverse criticism upon his course since the closing of his oflicial connection with the state de partment and the administration which he now so savagely attacks. Mr. Taylor, it will be remembered. was United Stntes minister to Spain under the Cleveland administration and was continued in that oflice for nearly or quite six months of the term of Pros ident McKinley. While the usual volume covering the foreign relations of tho United States and concerning t lie operations of the fiscal year just ended has tiot yet been complied, a careful study of Mr. Taylor's communications to the government and to his own ad ministration during the preceding years fails to discover a single word Indicating the existence during his oflicial term of this new-found zeal which he now exhibits, with the im plied assumption that it is based upon the knowledge which he gathered dur ing his official career in which ho was so remarkably silent upon this very subject. In diplomatic circles no hesi tation is made in an expression of the sentiment that public, and especially violent discussion in the matters of tlii" kind based upon, or assuming to bo based upon, information reaching him In an official and confidential capacity, Is exceedingly ill-timed and inappropri ate, while the further fact that the work of his own administration was far less effective in producing the results w liich ho now demands than that of tho administration which ho now attack", adds to the surprise and criticism with which his words arc received. It will bo remembered that during the term of the administration which he rep resented in Spain the Cuban pris ons were filled with American oitiens, nnd little, if anything was accomplished in obtaining their release. Tho moment the present ndminist ra t ion came into pow or. audits v iews and demands w ere communicated to the Spanish government, a marked change in this particular was developed, nnd ns a result the president was able to announce in the message which Mr. Taylor now so severely criticises, that nil of the citizens of the United States who were detained in Cuban prisons nt the close of the administration which Mr. Taylor represented, are now at lib erty. While a part of t his was accom plished during the months In w Inch Mr. Taylor continued to represent the gov ernment under the administration of President McKinley, It was a result of the new ami vigorous policy of this ad ministration and in marked contrast with that of tho administration repre sented by him during most of his oflicial term. Mr. Taylor, it will bo remembered, was honored with the confidence of this administration for nearly half a year nfter it assumed charge of tho govern ment by his retention as minister ami by n cordial and frank communication of. its plans and views to him in his oflicial capacity. No hesitation is made by those authorized to speak In saving lliat during all thut time ho failed to de velop by any utterance on his part any of tho remarkable zeal in behalf of the extreme measures which he now coun sels tho people of the United States to demand of that administration which has in nine months of its work released all those American citizens who were Imprisoned in Cuba during the term of his own odtnlnltrntion. Ilus action with reference to our own cilienshm been accompanied bv other demands upon tho Spanish government with ref erence to tlte Cubans themselves, which thov have immediately followed by a change of policy nnd n promise of com plete nutonomy nnd which It seems only reasonable, to give at least sufficient time to test. W hether Mr. Taylor's ex treme and sensational utterances are intended to bring public attention to himself In his lecturing enterprises op his business ambitions and official od- vnncement in his own state, they have at least resulted In severe and open criticisms from his former associates and others conversant with the usage nmong those honored by confidence on the part of tho government.

The President llemalna Firm on fua (old Stnndnrtl. That part of the president's rues sage which deals with the currency problem is a clear presentation of our present financial condition, a plain statement of the danger nnd embar rassments under which the mitiou'a treasury now labors, and a strong ar gument In favor of reform in our monetary laws. Perhaps the feature of this part of the message which will be received with greatest approval by the commer cial and financial world is the presi dent's unequivocal, positive and reiter ated declaration that this Is a gold standard nation, that all our money must be maintained at a par w ith gold, and that it will be so maintained under all circumstances. After reviewing the history of our monetary legislation since the war he takes up the existing situation, and says: "The evil of the present system Is found in the groat, ct.st to the govern ment of maintaluing the parity of our different forms of money; that Is, keeping all of them nt par with gold And again he says: "We have f 900,000, 0O0 of currency which the government by solemn ciiuctment has undertaken to keep at par with gold." And still again he declares: "The government. without anv fixed trold revenue. Is pledged to maintain gold redemption, which It has sdeadily and faithfully done, and which under the authority now given it will continue to do. After showing the hick of wisdom, the folly, of selling bond, nnd thereby adding to our interest-bearing d bt for tho purpose of redeeming over and over again a noninteresl-boarlr.g debt in the shape of United State- notes, the president makes tho proposal here tofore predicted in these columns. Ho urges that when United State notes nre redeemed by the government in gold they should be sot apart, and only yaid out, if at all, in exchange for gold, and bo ravs that Ihh is an obvious duty. The president also concurs with the set retarv of the treasury in rec ommending that national banks bo al lowed to issue notes to the face value of the bonds which they have deposit ed for circulation and recommends that national Kinks bo allowed to or ganize on a capital of $25,000, In order to benefit localities rot now sufficiently supplied with currency. The president makes a very strong point when ho .says that it f in time of business tranquillity nnd freedom from distrust that we should reform our monetary laws, nnd that we shouldi not wait until danger again threatens before we take up in congress this very grave ami Important question. To this there will bo no dissenting voice, and it is in accordance with the posi tion which this newspaper has assumed for many weeks. Taken all In nil, the president has made good his pledge that he would not neglect the question of currency reform, and after what lie. has said In hi message the country will look to congress for a speedy relief from pres ent evils in our monetary system.

DRYANISM STILL MENACES. ' Note of Wnrnliitr 'Which ItrMili- llcnnw Mi mi I (I lleeil. Congressman Dinglcy sou nils a note of needed warning whom he points to the elections in Kentucky and Nebraska as proofs that Ilryaiiism is not dead. In Nebraska, almost above nil states In the union, the logic of events ought to have convinced the voters of the foil)' of the free silver doctrine. It Is many vears since wheat brought such prices ns now nreolTcrcd for it; it is long slice ns many mortgages were paid olT in four months as in and between August and November, P'.'T; it is hmg since as many new hounoh ano iiu win- in course of ( net ion on the fannsof Ne braska as now ; it is long si nee there was such a demand for land ns now is ob servable. Silver has gone down while whejt has gone up, nnd prosperity has returned while a sound currency pre vailed. Vet tho Nebraska farmer has not recanted his populism. It mny bo, nnd we are afraid that It is, true that silver is but the mask of P.rvanlsm. It may bo that, while the silver question Is made the subject of open debate, the more revolutionary principles of the Chicago piatiorm are the hidden springs of populistlc notion. It may bo that the desire to confiscate railways, to half repudiate the debts of states and cities by payment of creditors In 50-ocnt dollar, and to make tie federal judiciary the tool of a mob that will control a populistlc presideut were the. moving forces in Nebraska. The socialistic leaven is nt work se trctly and, we fear, strongly. It is true that none would suuer inure acutely than the farmers of the west were the crudities of Hryanism to be enacted In the form of law, but "all mi tt nscious of their oom, the little vic tims play." .lust as thousands of wage earners '"swiped the tarilT" in glevful hfiste in l'2,und repented In four. ears of doleful leisure, so now, w e fear, there is a desire to "swij-e the corporations."

FALLACY OF StLVERITES Wbnt the Meslennlmntlun of Oar Currency Would Da. One cf our Puropcku consul ha re ported that In Paris a syndicate has been formeilwitji a capital of two mil lion Mexican dollars to establish a large factory of shoes, boots, tc In Mexico. The work of construction will be commenced at once, and the object of the syndicate is to send an Immense quantity of shoes of cheap quality to the American and Kuropean markets. Commenting on this item, a free silver organ says: "There Is no occasion for them to stop at 'cheap shoes; they can make th best with equal protlt to themselves. "It l.i a sinKular thlnjc that our financiers willfully shut their eyes to the prospective ruin of all our manufucturlnir Industries by Mexico. "So many of our newspapers ar.d flnan clfrs pretend to ace no morn In this silver question than no of making our oM!r Hons payable In a (lrprecl.at-l currency. "That Is not the Issue at all. "This dlfferonca In exchange, making a Mexican prlco of 12.Z2 tor our cold dollar, will In tlmruin tvery producer In th United States. "The question Is one of competition only. And tho only reason why Mexico and other silver countries have not supplanted our manufactories before this to an extent of their extinction Is solely due to tho lack of education to that n.d In silver countries. "In all else they ure our musters, and can at will drive out of the open market every thliiK manufacturt d by fculd nations." All of which is bosh. Tup difference in exchange has nothing to do with tho subject at all. The root of the matter is, that in Mexico the wage rat? isniucu, lower than In the' United States or in Kurope. There arc thousands of people in the United Statis w ho do not under stand why :i "dollar" In Mexico is not as valuable as a "dollar" in the Unitcdi States, and until they recognize the dif ference between value and price they will fall into confusion. Tho fall in the world's price of silver since the early '10's has carried down with it tho purchasing power of tho Mexican dollar. Mcichanls there havo put up their prices to correspond w ith itM depreciation, while, the rate of w ages has.net risen in tho same degree. This is because of the ignorance of tho masses of tho Mexican people. There suit is that Mexican laborers nre work ing for much lower wages, in reality, than they w ere a dozen years ago. The laborer gets a Mexican dollar for his day's work, and who received a Mexi can dollar for the same amount of work ten 3 ears ago, recrivc.s about .10 cent Icfs actual wages than he did then. This ignorance on tho part of tho peo ple of that country is the secret of tho probabhv profits of tie syndicate men tioned. It can hire labor much cheaper than in Kuropo. or the United States, There is nothing in the "rate of ex change" to make money for them. It is simply a question of the cost of labor. Were the United States so foolis.h as to adopt free, coinage, tho drop in tho purchasing power of our dollar would come at a bound, instead of being spread over "t years.
