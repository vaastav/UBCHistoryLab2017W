Tuesday, Dec. 7,1915. President Wilson's Annual Message to YOB ASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 7— "The Americas for the Ameri cans." This la the new doctrine for the United States, for all of the Americans and for the world, enunciat ed today by Ire-dent Wil son. "National ade quacy and secur ity" were the keynotes of his opening niessage to congress, read by him at a Joint session of the senate and house. Pan-Americanism, a partner ship of the American against Eu ropean aggression, in common causes of independence, political liberty, eoenomlc development and adjustments of the world war, 18 the president's conception of the modern development of the Monroe Doctrine. Upon Ibis broad foundation the president based his plea for pre paredness, a preparedness apply ing not only to the army and navy, but to all national tune tlons, industrial, commercial, of transportation—in a word, na tional adequacy. To Insure Peace. Marshaling of the nation's re sources, not for war, but to in sure psace, in a union of the American to maintain, secure from European Interference, American ideas and ideals, was the paramount thought pounded lu»me by the president. The address, of about 2,000 words, was the longest ever made to congress by the president. Scathing, scorching denuncia tion of hyphenated Americans "who preach and practice disloy alty," was a feature. Among the president's specific recommendations were: Secretary of War Garrison's army reorganisation plan. Secretary of the Navy Daniels' navy building program. A naval advisory council of de fense. Laws to deal with foreign plots and conspirators. Government ship purchase. Increased taxes without a bond issue- Rural credits legislation. Conservation measures. Philippine and Porto Rican "Independence." Investigation of railroad regu lation and future development. In dedication of the new era of pnn-Americanism and its bearing upon necessity for United States "self-sufficiency and _curlty" the president graphically pictured the present and future effects of the war. "There was a time when the United States looked u|>oii itself as in .some sort the guardian of the republics to the south of her," said the president. "Every thoughtful man of America niu_t welcome the altered circum stances of the new days In whose light we now stand, when there Is no claim of guardianship or thought of wards, but Instead a full and honorable association as partners in tlie Interest of all America. We still mean always to make a common cause of na tional independence and political liberty In America. Hut the pur pose is now better under*tood." Citing Mexican affairs as an example of the new doctrine, the president continued: "Her fortunes are in her own hands. But at least we have proved that we will not take ad vantage of her In her distress and undertake to impose upon her a government of our own choosing. We will aid and befriend Mexico, but we will not coerce her; and our course ought to be sufficient proof to all America that we seek

It's a pleasure to sell a medi cine when customers come in aft erward and tell you how much good it has done them. Druggists everywhere can tell of this experience in their sale of Ml-o-na, the well-known stomach remedy. And that U the reason why they are always glad to sell and recommend Ml-o-na. It does the work and ends all stomach distress just like the Mi-o-na peo ple say it will. As a result of this success most every druggist goes a step further and sells Mi o-na on a positive guarantee that unless It helps the purchaser he can have his money back. That may seem rash, but customers have aald so many good words in Mi-o-na's favor that very few packages are likely to be re turned. Anyone who has dyspepsia, whose food does not digest well, and who has to take thought aa to what he can eat, and when, can leave 50 cents deposit at any drug store and take home a box of Ml -o na and if the remedy does not regulate his digestion and help his dyspepsia he can with draw his money. This shows great faith In the merit of Ml-o-na. It is really a most unusual medicine and the rapid increase of sales since It was introduced In Tacoma shows that It does aU that it Is claimed to do —relieves dyspepsia, regu lates digestion and enables those who use it to eat just what tbey want with no fear of trouble after.

"It presents them as in a very, deep and true sense, a unit in world affairs, spiritual parUiern.i standing together because tlilnK ing together, quick with common sympathies and common ideals. Separated, they are subject to all the cross-currents of the confused politics of a world of hostile riv alries; united in spirit and pur pose they cannot he disappointed of their peaceful destiny. "This is Pan-Aniericaiiisni. It has none of the spirit of empire in it. It Is the em- Itodiiuent, the effectual em iMiillinent, of tlie spirit of law and inde|ieiidence and liberty and mutual service." The president then outlined his plea for national defense. "Great democracies are not belligerent," he said. "They do not seek or desire war. We in sist upon security in prosecuting our self chosen lines of national development. IWe do more than that. Wo demand it also lor others. We have set America aside as a whole for the uses of the independent nations and political freemen. Against Aggression. "We regard war merely as a means of asserting the rights of a people against aggression We will not maintain a standing army except for uses which are as ne cessary in times of peace as in times of war. But we do believe In a body of free citizens ready and sufficient to take care of themselves and the governments which they have set up to serve them. "But war has never been a mere matter of men and guns. If our citizens are ever to fight effectively upon a sudden sum mons, they must know how mod ern fighting is done. And the government must be their serv ant; must supply thorn with the training they need totake care of themselves and of it. The mili tary arm of their government they must properly use to make their Independence secure—and not their own independence mere ly, but the rights also of those with whom they have made com mon cause, should they also he put in jeopardy. They must be fitted to play the great role of

Outlines Plan. , "It is with these ideals in mind that the plans of the department of war for more adequate nation al defense were conceived which will be laid before you, and which I urge you to sanction and put Into effect as soon as they can be properly scrutinized and dis cussed." The navy building five year program, endorsed in detail, was said by the president to Involve "only a shortening of the time within which plans long matured shall be carried out." Trade and shipping Is another problem of national adequacy, the president declared, urging the government ship purchase bill. He did not recommend any specific appropriation. "It is of capital Importance," he declared, "not only that the United States should be Its own

"They must move constantly back and forth between iho Americas. They are the only shuttles that can weave the deli cate lalirlc of sympathy, compre hension, confidence and mutual dependance in which we wish lo clothe our policy of America for Americans." Legislation for "slterHtion and reform of the Philippines govern ment and public justice to the people of I'orto Rico," were urged by the president. Revenue Needs. Turning to revenue needs, the president said if the present "war" tax and sugar duties w.re discontinued and the nntional de fense program euueted. the 1917 treasury deficit would aggregate $-97.1100,000. The first year's cost of the preparedness program, lie said, would be $91,.00,0(10. Ry re taining the present "war tax" and sugar duties he estimated addi tional revenues of $112,000,000 annually must be provided to cover the national defense ex pense. Disapproving of a bond Issue, the president said: "I for one do not believe the people approve postponing pay ment of their bills. "We should ha following an Almost universal example of modern governments were we to draw the greater port or ev_n the whole of the revenues we need from Income taxes." Lowering of present limits of] income taxes and increases, step by step, of our taxes on larger Incomes, was suggested. Mentions New Taxes. New Internal taxes mentioned by the president "which can just ly bo resorted to without hamp ering the industries of the country or putting any too great chnrge upon Individual expendi ture" were: Gasoline and naphtha, 1 cent per gallon,, yielding $10,000, --000. Horsepower of automobile and internal explosion enginos, 50 cents |>er horsepower, yielding $15,000,000. Stamp tax on hank checks, $15,000,000. Pig iron, 25 cents a ton, yielding $10,000,000. Fabricated iron und steel, 50 cents a ton, yielding $10,000,000. Returning to necessity for laws to deal with foreign plots and conspiracies, the president declared: "I am sorry to say the greatest threats aguinst our national peace have Ik-cm ut tered within our own bor ders. There are citizens of the lulled States, I blush to admit, Ixirn finder for eign flags, but welcomed un der our naturalization laws to the full and free oppor tunity of America, who have {toured the poison of dis loyalty into the very arteries of our national life, wlio THE

"Their number is not great as compared with the whole num ber of those sturdy hosts by which our nation has been en- riched in recent generations out of virile foreign stocks, but it is great enough to have brought deep disgrace upon us and to have made It necessary that we should promptly make use of processes of law by which we may be purged of their corrupt New to America. "America never witnessed anything like this before. It never dreamed It possible th.it men sworn Into its own citizen ship, men drawn out of grout free stocks such us supplied some of tho best and strongest olemonts of that little but now heroic nation that in a high day of old staked its very life to free Itself from every entan glement that had, darkened the fortunes of the oiler nations and set up a new standard here —that man of such origins md such free choices of allegiance would ever turn In malign re action against tlie government and people who had welcomed and nurtured them and seek to make this proud country once more a hotbed of European pas sion. "But the ugly and incredible thing has actually come about and we are without adequuto federal laws to deal with it. I urge you to enact such laws at the earliest possible moment and feel that In doing so 1 am urg ing you to do nothing less thun aave the honor and self respect of the nation. Such creatures of passion, disloyalty and anarchy must be crushed out." Another recommendation was for steps to moholize United States economic resources in time of national necessity.

"We should put* into early operation some provision for i■uriil credits, the president as serted, without specifying any particular plans. The transpor tation problem is an exceeding ly serious and pressing one. The regulation of the railroads by fodcral commission has had ad mirable results," he continued. The question is whether there Is anything we can do in the very process of regulation for bettering the conditions under which the railroads are operated and for muking men more use ful servants of the country."
