Mr. McCumber announced his intention of forwarding the telegram to the President as the commander-in-chief of the army, tie said that he and Senator Hansbrough and the House members of the North Dakota congressional delegation had made representations concerning the coal car shortage to the Interstate commerce commission, and that he had been assured that the subject would receive consideration at the meetings which the commission will hold In Minneapolis next week. - \ FOR 

INCREASE OF PAY' ? Sentiment in Congress as to Government Employes. SEVERAL BILLS INTRODUCED Report oi a Special MesEage by the President. SHORT SESSION A DRAWEACX Measure Affecting Force of Big Frintery?Views of One of Department Workers. w Several bills have been introduced during the present session of Congress providing for an increase of pay to all employes of | me guvernmrni, ana tne indications are ! that the general subject will receive more attention at the Capitol this winter than in many years heretofore. The remarkable prosperity of the country together with the fact that many railroads and other corporations?influenced by prevailing conditions ?have voluntarily raised the salaries of w, n<*o niuugia me pi upuaiLioil before both branches of the national legislature with such force that consideration is certain and action possible. During the past week several members of the House of Representatives have taken occasion >o comment on the report that President Roosevelt- Is to send to Congress, during the present session, a message urging that all employes of the United States governm-ent, including the army, the navy and the Marine Corps, be granted an increase of per cent in pay. So far, nothing has been officially given out at the White House which would indicate that such is a fact, but the President is said to be considering the matter very earnestly. Sentiment in Congress. ji is very apparent, .nowever, tnat mere is considerable sentiment in Congress for an increase of some kind to government employes. Representative Southwlck of New York was the first member of the House to introduce a salary increase measure. He put his bill in more than a week ago, believing that the present condition' of the finances of the United States and the general prosperity of people in all walks of life justified congressional action on the subject. It provided for a 10 per cent in I crease to government employes.. Several ' days later Representative Livingstone ot Georgia, a member of the House appropriations committee and one of the strongest men on the minority side of the chamber, commented favorably on the report he had heard that the President would send a salary increase message to Congress. Mr. Livingstone is understood to be preparing a bill on the subject for introduction in the near future. In fact, he would probably have introduced it during the past week. were it not for the fact that he desires to know, before fixing any certain percentage of Increase in his measure, just how much it would cost the government per annum, for, say. a 10 or a 20 per cent raise to ail government employes. Representative Jones of Washington last Friday introduced a bHI providing for a 20 per cent increase to government employe. In addition to the bills referred to several havfi been introduced providing for an increase in all grades of the military and naval establishments. More Generous Compensation. The introduction of the bills is indicative of a growing sentiment in Congress in favor of more generous compensation to government employes. Some members of thfl T-TniiR?? nnnnsp thf? nrnnnsl Mr?n tr? itIvp an Increase all along the line, believing that some government positions are at present overcapitalized, while tho3e constituting the rank and file of the working force of the departments are underpaid. It is said to be not at all Improbable that the whole proposition may be before Congress during the present session, although the time for due consideration of the matter is somewhat limited, and If such does happen, those who believe It would not be just to increase the government force en masse will ask for a comprehensive readjustment of salaries. Short Session a Disadvantage. The fact that this is the short session will work to the disadvantage of the salary Increase proposition. Congress having little enough time as lt^ls to finish absolutely necessary business. But, at any rate, the proposition will receive an impetus this year that will carry it over Into the next Congress, should nothing be done at the present session. Many members of Congress are thoroughly convinced of the justice of the claim, made by friends of government employes, that the latter have had absolutely no benefit from the general prosperity of the times. The large sum that would be added to the public pay roll were the general Increase provided for will doubtless keep some gentlemen at both ends of the Capitol lukewarm on the proposition, but at the same time the friends of the increase plan think that the sentiment throughout the country is In favor of having government servants share in the good standing of the government, and believe that even those now opposed to the plan can be brought to time if present conditions continue. At Government Printing Office. The hill nrcnar.il frvr ? W ?.... r- - ?w? |/a vovltkUiiVU w V.VHgress by Mr. James L. Feeney, president of the bookbinders' union of this city, which provides for a general Increase of 20 per cent In the salaries of the bookbinders, compositors and pressmen employed at the government printing office, was generally discussed and approved among local artisans last night. The rate of pay per hour is increased to the amount that was paid about thirty years ago?sixty cents. That would make the per diem pay of the classes of workmen named $4.80 for eight hours' work. * . ~ "*"*T ! 1 11 - Auruiut-i o vi vv uamiigiuu wurKinKmen s associations -were loud In their pratee of Representative Henry M. Coudrey of Missouri. who has taken charge of the measure, It Is said. In discussing the bill Mr. Feeney explained that, considering the . Increased rents and higher prices of all household necessities In the District, It Is only justice that the bill should become law. "I talked with several prominent members of the House," Mr. Feeney stated, "and In every instance they promised to vote for the Increase and lend it their best Influence. About 80 per cent of the members of the bookbinders 'unior are married men and have families to support, and in view of the general advance of the prices of foodstuffs and other necessaries of life In the past five years it has become a veritable struggle for life with many of them. I know that during the last year many bookbinders and printers have resigned their government places to get higher wages in other cities in private establishments. Now that Congress has been generous enough to Increase the salary of the public printer, we believe he will come to the assistance of his faithful employes and approve the Coudrey bill. We believe the Increase of his salary was just, as the pay of the head of the great printery has for years been inadequate. We do not appreltend any opposition to the bill Increasing the pay of the workers in the big beehive." i vvwimvu ivi vviv ui ct uvui "If the President should send that muchtalked-of special message to Congress asking a 20 per cent increase In the pay of all government employes here In Washington, and Congress should see fit to pass upon it favorably, there would be more rejoicing in Washington than was ever known before," a department worker remarked last evening. "It would be a time of processions, firework displays and celebrations that would lay in the shade any Inaugural event that ever happened. .? " #v- ' "What % 20 p?r Mat Increase in pay would mean to government employes, especially those In the departments here, car scarcely be conceived by anyone outside ol the realm. The cost of living has increased at this capital even to a larger extent thai at other pfcices. That the government ba; been so slow in recognizing this fact has long puzzled the public in general, especially in view of the fact that the -wajtes 01 employes of .nearly every corporation havt been increased within the last year. Amount of Appropriations. "The appropriations made by Congress for salaries of government employes for th< fiscal year ending June 30. 1907. amounted to approximately f2^,."i<K),(XK), and, assuming that the appropriations for the coming year are no greater?but they undoubtedlj will he?that would mean the enactment oi a law Increasing the salaries 20 per ceni would cause the government to disboirst an extra sum amounting to nearly $4,300,(XX among Its employes. " I he average salary paid to departmen clerks is $1,200 per year. Taking that flg ure as an average, of course, nearly two thirds of the government's force rcceiv< lesp. The contemplated increase Would giv the clerk who is now receiving $75 pe month a salary of $!*! per month; a $1,2? clerk would find In his pay envelope $13 each month, and the favored clerk wh> now draws $130 would receive each montl just $30 more. Think of it! Enough t( pay his house rent. Clerk and Money Soon Farted. -i'A $1,20J clerk and his money are sooi parted?especially if he Is married and ha; a family. Say he rents a small house a $26. I can't say where he will find a hou? In a respectable locality or otherwise ii Washington that he can rent for the sum but let the figure go; his gas bill is $3.00 fuel $8, groceries $30, milk $2, car fare $2 making the actual expense $71. Thii doesn't allow" for any incidentals like ? daily paper, having coal put in, his laundr; bill, and a thousand and one other pett] expense Incidental to housekeeping; there is nothing left for ciothes for himself am family unless he goes hungry awhile; noth Ing to pay doctors; no J2 left oVer for t treat to the theater once in a long while and not even the price of a magazine lef to give him a few moments of entertain ment at home. * "If he was given a 20 per cent Increase think what that $20 each month woult mean to him. If necessary he could hire f servunt and not have a scrubwoman an< cook for a wife. He could tana his wif? to the theater occasionally pud allow hei a new gowns once in a while. In fact, 11 nt: iitiu utrtrn eAiaiiug un iuk) a. munin mt Increase would afford him some of tiie little luxuries of life which we all crave a! time.**. If he be a good financier he m>gh possibly lay aside J.~> e.ich month as a reserve fund to be used in case of s.cknesj or some other emergency. Something of a Trap. "The departmental service here is something of a trap. It is an almost exceptional rule that a clerk runs just one month behind his expenses, scarce y ever doing a cash business, but having accounts at groceries, drygoods ,and furnlteure houses, the milkman. Iceman and coal ut-iiir-!. i nus is uue 10 me raci mar almost invariably the newly appointed clcrk Uvea beyond his income (or the first^six months or so of his residence in the capital. 'He generally comes from a small town where tllf> a month would seem a fortune, and is far more than he ever dreamed of earning. He also knows more or le^s intimately the representatives from his district, and at home he has been accustomed to meeting him on the same social footing. This pace he tries to keep up when lie reaches Washington, the result being that in a short tim; the little sum of money he has been saving for years, and which he brought along with him?usually a few hundred dollarsis gone. He has been living at an expense far greater than his income, and he is in debt to a number of business houses for clothes, etc., and to monay lenders for advances. The sad part of it is he never catches up. - "It may be ayked why he v.iil live beyond his means. The truth is he never intended to do it?like many others?until It was done."
