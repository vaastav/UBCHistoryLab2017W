GEORGE F. HENSHALL EDITOR. TUESDAY DECEMBER 14, iK9- By "taking it all back" Delegate Kuhio has probably forestalled a Republican political movement that would have ended his term. As the matter stands he is still the choice of a great majority of the party. President Taft's regular message to Congress, published nearly in full in The Star today, contains nothing sensational. There are no Rooscveltian phrases, no startling recommendations, no roasts of any body. The document is calm, judicial, even dry. Yet there are some interesting recommendations in it and its comparative brevity will en courage many to read it. The President has nothing to say! about Hawaii or the Philippines, excepting his references to military and naval matters, with which the public is already familiar. The San Francisco Chronicle sees in California and Hawaii cotton experiments a chance for California to become a manufacturing State. It says: The time for a beginning is propitious. In "days past California has had cotton -mills that did not do well. But there was no cheap fuel, little cheap power, and that at a distance Jvom railways and the market; and a comparatively small consuming population. Now things have vitally changed. Oil fuel is abundant and cheap. Long-distance transmission of electricity made by water power is one of the items of progress. The State and the whole Coast is settling up. We can .get before long an ample supply of cotton within our own economic sphere, and we can manufacture it at a -. profit. On the Pacific Slope is population enough to sustain the textile end of the industry the" manufacturing and selling end. Then why not cotton? ' This has been and is a cattle State, a gold State, a wheat State, a commercial State, a wine and fruit State, an oil "State, and it may as well become a manufacturing State. In. this connection we also note that cotton is promised as an export from California's ten-million-dollar trade preserve; the Territory of Hawaii. Experiments have proved the high value of the product there ; and now one of the eight islands of the Ha waiian group is to be given up to the crop entirely. In time the exports of cotton from Honolulu, joined with the Imperial valley supply, may work marked economic changes in this State. 0 0 e o I 0 e
