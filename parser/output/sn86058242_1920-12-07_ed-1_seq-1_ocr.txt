HIGH MARK CANDIES FOR HOLIDAYS Tf you are a woman and you have been waiting as long: as possible be fore buying that box of 151 Hopo ctgars for your husband's Christmas present in the hope that prices would como "own. ycu arc uoomca to disappoint ment.

MIi: MI I.I. 

THKV DllOP. These are the opinions of Mel Mop nette. proprietor of the Smoke Shop at Sta: and Ilohman streets anil Met should know. 'Tcoplc are asking every day when the prices of smokes I and candy wl'.l drop," said Mr. Mon- nette this morning. "I tell them ail that I don't know but from my knowl edge of conditions it will probably b a long time." "T"u know," continued the smk" shopper." the quality of cipars today Is way below what It used to be. Th- prices have been increased while the quality was lowered. The ciar y,,u smoke today Is much inferior to the same brand which you bought several years ago at a lower price. As I hav--it doped out, the manufacturers wilt first tape up the quality of the cigar and bring it up to the old standard then as costs come down they may cut the prices.' DOES CT litl'EtT ( ITS, Mr. Monnctte looks for little cut in prices of clgarrts at present but be lieves the manufacturers will use the old plan of bringing out new brands at tho pre-war rates thus gradually shoving the present standard brand! into the background. In support of this theory he points to a number o: new brands which have appeared on the market recently at tho old price oi fifteen cents for twenty. Xtuyers of Christmas candy will re ceive no benefit from the sharply de clining sugar prices, according to rc- tail dealers. They say th-it the swo ts now offered for holiday sate were pur j chased under the top-price scale or on the- first break in a fairly level market fclld stand them an actual outlay from 5(, to 100 per cent in exc.-s of what current prices from the wholesaler should be. It is freely predicted, how ev -r( that wtih the waning of the holiday ru-.li an Immediate drop in rrtail prices will bring candy to almost a prewar level. Candy prices for Christmas will rang, based on present prices, from 35 cents to 11.60 a pound, according to the grade bought and tho manner in which it is put up for the trade. last year candy was ranging from C" cents to 1.60 at 1 he sarin Cme and j durinc; the highest price period, wt.cn j sng.ir was sellm,; alf r .m "0toSecnt3 j a pound, prices were even higher. For the usual Christmas trade the majority of candy cornea from what it termed "loose os bulk" candy bought by the retailers in pat".? ir.d barr.-i.-. find in this line the de.lin already hf:s ur.de bself felt and pvc: v.l: ;.

This they attribute more to the high cost of bo's, ribbons and other material used in packing than te sugar prices. l.lttle difference ts shown in this line, the wholesale pricey ranging from M cents a pound to $1. 5 5. The retpil price on the same arti- cle will be from 71 cents lo Jt.Se a-- cording to the grade of candy and the package in which U is contained. "Tho candy man is hard hit this year." said one of the large manufac turers. "The goods we are selling to day are made from materials bought on the peak prices ami most of us are now actually putting out our goods at a logs. For Instance, candy made to- I flay is mostly from sugar bought at C and 30 cents a fund and we are forced to sell at prices based on from 12 to "0-cent sugar in order that tli" public may b satif-fied. This is a heavy loss to the manufacturer." From the standpoint of the Jobber the usual answer w;i.-: "Yes. we are selling at a loss. Wo now have our stoeU f-r th" Christmas trade and '. was bought at a time when sugar priors were hgh. We ar helping the I manufacturer and taking a lejsjs on j candy, and the retail trade should help I us bear this loss. -One rrtison for th ; j high randy price is the refusal e.f the retail denier to bear his pre.port in-i- ate loss along with us. He buys at I our loss and sells at a profit." iiiiTAii.i'.iis ni;v rnnriTiiFJiiMi. From the retailer comes the rebut tal: "That is not true. It is a!! welt and good for the jobber and whole saler to say he is selling nt a loss aim that we are not bearing our propor- . tionate part of the less. However, he . , . docs not stop to explain, when show- tat th(j fcrs at the big decline is not on the market an! run not reach tlie trad before after the first of the year. The goods we are offering now were bought at high prices and Pet price existing today." Gk A. It.

SERVICE WAS.H1NC.TO.N". hoc. 7. Calling at tention to the fact that the CnltcJ States Is the "sample democracy ol the w 01 Id," and as such is constantly under world scrutiny. President Wood row Wilson in bi- last congressional message today urged upon congress the duty of making this nation the champion of right and justice iu the world affairs. Only by rectifying wrongs within our borders and championing the right wherever it is in danger, the presi dent pointed out, can the V. Si. fulfill its destiny and keep faith with the fathers of the republic. The president's message made no mention of the league of nations nor any International aspect in particular. i It w as a thort message and more than half of it was de-voted to domestic al fairs. At the last moment President 'Wilson yielded to the wishes of hi-s physician and did not attempt to go to the capitol and deliver the message in person be fore a joint session of the two houses. Instead, a few minutes before noon the message was transmitted to eacn house separately and there was read to the members. President Wilson began his message with a quotation from Lincoln : "Let us have faith that right makei might and in that faith let us dare 13 do our duty as we understand It." The simple faith expressed tn Lin coin's words formed? the gist of tho entire document. There was no refer ence to the tumultuous closing days of his own administration, r.or the in coming republican adminlitratlon 0.1 March 4. This one phrase, the president said, marks out America's duty in both for eign and dometslc affairs. I5y this faith alone, the president Jaid, "can the world be lifted cut of its present state of confusion and despair."' The president himself summed up his message In its final paragraph: "1 have not so much laid before you a series of recommendations," he said, "as I have sought to utter a confes sion of faith, cf the faith in which t was bred and which it Is my solcmi purpose to stand by until tny last fighting day. I believe this to be the faith of America, the faith of the fu ture, and of all the Ictory whic i await final action in days to come, whether in America or elsewhere." The first half e.f the presidential message was devoted to evpreusions of his faith and the urging- upon congressJ its duty to make America indeed the triumphal force for right and justice. Then, turning to domestic affairs, the president recommended to congress the following: The passage of a budget bill to stabilise the. government's finances. Stricter economy in governmental expenditures in ordrr that the burden of taxation bo 1 ghtened and the na tional debt decreased. Kevision and simplification of th? taxation system, which he declared, has become "an immediate necessity." The granting of a louu to the ".struggling government of Armenia." Granting to the Philippines their In dependence, "after they have sure-ceded in maintaining a stable govern ment." The message in part was: 

"GENTLEMEN OF TIIE CONGHESS: When I addressed myself to per forming the duty laid upon the presi dent by the constitution to present 11 you an p.jinual report of the slate ot the Union, I found my thought dom iated by an Immortal sentence of Abraham- Lincoln's: "'Let us have faith that right makes might, and in that faith let us dare to do our duty as wo understand it. "A sentence Immortal because it embodies in a form of niter simplicity and purity the essential taith of the ration, the faith In which it was con ceived, and the faith in which it has grown to glory and power. With that faith n.md the birth of a nation found- ed upon it came the hope into the I (Continued on pag eight )

THIEVES E ITouse breakers, who have been op erating in Hammond and West Ham mond during the last few- weeks were on the J,-b early lart nUkt. Attorney w. J. VNhinery and family were away from their home. 35 troit street, yesterday evening until S o'cle-ck. Wlven they returned they found that tiie place, had been ran sacked. The burglar had gained en trance through the basement, breaking threugh two doors. The loss, as near as could ba ascertained, consist.. I of a new suit of clothes belonging to Mr. Whinery, a gold watch belonging lo Mrs. Whlncry. three gold pins, two small savings banks and a Z calibre revolver. The total value l. placed a: ISO. In West Hammond the home of Dr. A. I Hickman. 10 Waltham street, was visited. There the loot is esti mated at close to $250. It consisted of ail of Mrs. Hickman's jewelry, two table cloths and a fur cap. In the Jewelry were four e.r five diamond rinys. two or three broaches and the ssme number of stickpins. The thief got in through a window. Dave Akin reported tj the police that his coal office at 150th street and Calumet avenue was entered and ran sacked. The only article of value taken was an American adding machine worth $45. The same p'aee was rob bed of a watch and alarm clock six weeks ago. Saturday Gust HanUenrlsser moved to 475 Morton avenue. Saturday. .Be cause the gas was not connected he and the family went to Chicago over Sunday to stay with friends. When they returned to Hammond yesterday they found that burglar.-i had been busy In their new home. Entering through tho cellar the thieves had found $100 In paper money and they also took a new rug worth $150, an overcoat worth $60 and a revolver. Several house holders have reported rrowlers around their homes at night, but in each case the Intruders have retreated on finding that the people in the house had been aroused. y. S. HOUSE SALE ALL BUT ENDED The sale of U. S. government house? In Hammond has been practically com pleted by Frank R. Martin of Woods. Martin & Co.. the sales representative of the V. S. housing corporation. The sales now exceed $600,000.00 and there are only about 1-alf a dozen houses eft for sale tolether with some cut lots which were not built on. The magnitude of this operation may be appreciated when it is known tiiat 174 renters have been replaced by over 100 owners and that a large subdivision of houses has completely chanced hands in the brief period of four months. The measure of the housing demand in Hammond may also be taken by noting the fact that the sale of two thirds of a million of dollars of houses has not perceptibly slacked the de mand. M51V HIGH lilt A DE DISTRICT The result has been that where the Lyndora addition was once referred to slightingly It Is now regarded as one of the best residential districts on the east side. The residents there are American citizens of the better class and the spirit of neighborhood im provement Is deeply Inculcate- in the minds of the new purchaser. The sale of these houses ! unques tionably the largest real estate opera tion of the year in Hammond and in foot the Calumet district.
