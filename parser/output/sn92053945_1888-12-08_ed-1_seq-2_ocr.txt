Blaine, Jr ,has finally decided to go upon the stage as a means of livelihood, having been dropped by the Blaine family and no longer living with her husband. Of course, this is a 5tir concerning which the public has no interest, as it is a purely personal af fair, but it is hard to retrain from com men tine upon the injustice of condemn ing to a life of toil and privation a young woman against whom there is no charge except that sbe has incurred the enmity of her mother-in-law. Young Blaine position in th? whole matter ra simply contemptible snd he cannot be regarded with too much scorn. Whatever bis father may be as a politician, he would never have acted thus as a husband and a man. 4 li 1 11 A Hod Hone For Harrlwon.

Nobody ever knew of a tougher town than Newton, Kan., was in the early days of its existence. Nobody knows of a more lovely or more peaceable city than that same place today. In the spring of 1871 the terminus of the Santa Fe railroad was at Emporia, It was determined to build to a point seventy-five miles further west The object was to catch the Texas cattle trade. On the 14th of April. 1871, the wnter reached the banks of Band creek. Two men were found camped there. There was not a foot of lumber in what is now Harvey comity, Kan. These men were the pioneers of the town that Capt John bebastian alterward named Newton. Six weeks later there was a population of nearly 2,000. The history of the town for its first eight months is a story of lawlessness and blood that has never been equaled on this continent. Other places, mining camps and cattle towns, have kept up the music of the pistol a greater length of time, but for downright cusscdness and cold killing fiew ton wears the belt. As soon as it became known that Newton was to be the end of the railroad for a year, and that it was to be a cattle shipping point, whisky sellers, gam blers and thieves nocked there by hundreds. Of course many respectable men, seeking legitimate business, went there, too, but the great majority of the new comers were dangerous. PREACHING IN A GAMBLING DE!t. They migrated there for the purpose of robbing the cowboys and cattlemen. For mouths it was a never endinir battle between these law breakers on the oue side and the men who knew no law on the other. From first to last thirty-six were killed with their boots on. At least a dozen gambling houses bad places on tbe main street, keeping their doors wide open day time and night time. Sunday and all tbe time. One of them, the "Gold Room." was capable of holdine 500 or 600 people. Every known kind of gambling was practiced. A si-rht was seen in this place one Sunday night that is not often wit nessed. A Methodist preacher went to the boss of tbe place, "Doc" Thayer, and re quested permission to hold divine services. it was granted, and with every gambling: table running, tbe bar sending out its liquid hell, that preacher, the Kev. Mr. Hahn stood up and told the story of the Man of rsazareth. Before he had finished his sermon a quarrel arose at one of the card tables and a man was shot. A detailed account of the killing and murders is not intended. If gang of cowboys rode into town the smallest provocation would set their guns going, and going to till. A bond election was held. Several special constables were appointed for election day. One of them wis a Texan named Martin. At the polls there was a quarrel between a bi irishman, who went by the name of McClus key, but whose real name was Arthur De- laney, and the special constable, Martin. The result of that quarrel was the death of eight men and one woman, and the wounding of just an equal number. After the election was over McCluskey and Martin met in the lone Star saloon and renewed the quarrel. A proposition was made and accepted to go out on the street and settle it with the fist Both men laid off their belts and startsd for the street Martin, however, had a run hid den in his boot, and just as the door was reached he went down after it, intending to kill the Irishman; but McCluskey was too quick for him, and, taking the gun away from him, shot him dead. McCluskey eave nimseu up anu was acquitted, aLartin had of Inends, and they vowed vegeance on ms slayer. TOE BIO KILLING. The death of Martin led to what has al ways been known as the "big killing" in Newton. There were three dance halls across the railroad track in what was known as "Hyde Park." In one of them the "big toiling" occurred. McCluskey was a hanger on at one of them. Martin's friends swore they would kill him and all that took bis part. Martin's friends got the worst of the fight. It was known by both sides that the fracas was likely to happen on a certain night. Toe engagement took place accord ing to programme, McCluskey was killed early in tho fray, two holes through his necit ana enoagn lead scattered around through his body to make any one who digs him up after a while imagine that he has struck a paying lead mine. A man on the McCluskey side shot nine of the long horn crowd and did it in a novel way. Knowing that the fight would occur, this man, Riley Dy name, went prepared to make himself felt He had four six shooters on him. At the first pop of a gun he deliberately walked up to a Texan and shot him in the eye; then running bis two arms between the arms and body of the dead man, be made a human bar ricade and shot at will from a safe ambush. After tbe fight ended he went out, mounted a horse and left The dead at the big killing were speedily disposed of, tbe wounded taken care of. B033 OF THE "SIDE TRACK." Mike Fitzpatrick kept a dive that be called the "Side Track." The unlucky chap that got in there found himself side tracked until his money was gone. Some of the decent people were bold enough to protest against some of his robberies, among others a prom inent merchant. Mike did not like any in terference with his business, and one morn ing he loaded himself a little fuller than usual with his vile whisky and started out to do a little slaughtering. The merchant was sought, but happened to bo out of the store. alike went up tbe street terrorizing every body and walked into a saloon. There he saw the city's police judso, George Halliday, and without the slightest provocation or a word of warning be shot him through the heart itie marshal, Jack Johnson, had been advised that Mike was on a ruiu and had started to capture bim. Hee- M i lie coming out of the saloon. Johnson took a rest for his Winchester rifle on tbe weii curb and shot him down.. This was Newton's last killing. In an hour after ward toe citizens had formed a league and the suspicious characters were notified to leave. Ttiey left Only a few incidents are mentioned ; only a few of the shootings de tailed. Tom Carson, a nephew of old Kit Carson, was sent for and came to take tbe marshalship of the town. He stayed three weeks. Tne toughs bad it in for bim, and to save his life he skipped. "W ild Bill" tJ. H. Hickox) tried to be marshal. He couldn't do it Marshal King was kUled iu the discharge of bis duties, and altogether it was the tough est town on record. The person who sees the lovely city today, the county seat of one of tbe best counties (Harvey) in the state, with its business, its opera houses, its street cars, gas and water works, and talks with its law abiding and wide awake cititens, little dreams of tbe scenes of blood witnessed in its infancy.

ADMISSION. I Regrettiug That the Question Bas Taken the PartUau Chute. New York, Dec, 8 In an interview yes terday Hon. IS. S. Cox said regarding the admission of territories into tbe Union: "The question of statehood for these mature ter ritories will be prominent at the shorr ses sion of the Fiftieth as well as in the Fifty first congress. How these affairs may be treated wbethr a deadlock will continue, or whether any compromise will be made by which something may be effected Is more or less of a party question. Tuis I greatly regret I regret it as a partisan, and I regret it more, having in view the future of my party, aad tbe growth and greatness of, our country, and especially that portion of it wast of the Misssissippi river. Any action, therefore, depends, so far as the remnant of this congress is concerned, on the complexion of tbe next house of representatives. If it be Democratic, tbe matter will be laid over un til tbe next congress. If it be Republican, the stress now being brought to bear upon these matters inclines me to believe that in the forthcoming session some action may be taken, at least with respect to Dakota. Dem ocrats, in that case, would be wise to antici pate the action, and thus save their credit. " Cox thinki south Dakota should be admit ted this session, and that at the next session one of the first proceedings of the Fifty -first congress sbou'd be to pass an enabling act for north Dnkota.

Porter Ashe has made up his mind that the most beautiful woman be ever saw lives in Richmond. Va. . This is significant, because he was a rival of Freddy Oebhard in the wooing of Mrs. Langtry at Long Branch last summer, and was tbe causa of the sentimental quarrel which ended in Freddy's angry departure alone for England. Ho was promptly fol lowed by the Lily, who brought him back amiably, and they are together again during the actress' present tour. That Ashe should unequivocally award the palm of unequaied loveliness to anybody else than Mrs. Langtry, after last aummar's devotion to her, indicates either resentment or outspoken honesty. "Is it really true, Mr. Ashe," ha was asked, "that you found such a wondrous beauty in Virginia f 'It is true enough," be replied. "Is she Amelie lUvesf I have heard it was she to whom you have awarded tbe palm." irNo. I have seen the authoress and she is certainly handsome. Bo are a great many Virginia girls. I don't believe there is a city In the Union that has suob a high average of beauty in its women as Richmond. My sis ter is visiting there and she wrote to me that if I would come she would show me the hand somest woman in tbe United States. I went not for tlut reason, mind you but I did see tbe young lady to whom she referred." "And her name was" "Bhe must be nameless. I fancy that she wouldn't care to be exploited as a professional beauty." Mr. Ashe's use of the term "professional beauty1 recalled Mrs. Langtry to my mind, and 1 said: "Wall, is she more beautiful than Mrs. Langtryr " Yes; there is no doubt at all about that," Clara Bella, estl A 

FLOATER'S DAY'S WORK. To tins; In Five Towns and PromiscnotHlr u to Politic;. MrDDLETOWX, N. Y., Dec. The story of the feat accomplished on Nov. 6 by tbe champion repeater and "floater, in voting at tbe polls of notes than five different towns, three in Chenango county and two in Cortland county, bas not yet been f ullv told. It now appears that in order to make tbe rounds of tbe five polling places be traveled something like thirty miles, every inch on foot ai.d between sunrise and sunset. The reward earned by this ex traordinary diligence in the ex ercise of the glorious right of suffrage is said to have averaged $3 a vote, or $15 all told; doubtless the biggest day's wages that tbts particular nater ever got in tbe course of bis life. He fell under the blandishments of tbe poll-workers of both parties, and, as it chanced, be divided his favors quite impar tially between tbe two presidential candi dates. His first ballot was for Harrison, his Second, third, and fourth tor Cleveland, and bis fifth for Harrison again. The champion floater is resting unmolested on his laurels, and his exploit is recounted as a good joke by the politicians of tbe country side. A SORT OF BOOMERANG. Saaee for the Goose Proves to Be "Ptseu1 for the Other fellow. Charleston, W. Va., Dec & The de cision by tbe supreme court in granting the Democratic application for a writ of man damus against tbe ccuuty court baa turned out to be a bad thing for the Democrats. Tbe object sought by the Democrats in get ting tbe decree was to throw out the vote of the Lewistoa precinct, which gave nine Re publican majority, ibis was done 1 burs- day. Yesterday the county court likewise threw out Coal burg precinct, which gave a Demo cratic majority of twenty, and Mctrinnis, Republican, for congress, is therefore one ahead. The Republicans last night were Jubilant, and predicted that before tbe last has been beard of .e mandamus busin McOinnis would have a iargur majority than was ever credited up to biuu SENATOR VEST AS A PROPHET. He Hakes Some Predictions an to What the Kepubltcas Will io. Washington City, Dec. 8. "You can look out now for the money to fly,' said Senator Vest Thursday. "Tbe Republicans have got everything and they will make appropriations rigbt and left. They will pasB tbe service pension bill, which will use up at least 1.0,000,000; the Blair educa tional bill, which will absorb about $7d,00u, 000; tbe direct tax bill, which will amount to nearly $'4),0',0,000t and tbe Lord knows bow many otber bills in the same line. They will prouably run tbe expenses of the gov ernment up to 1100,000,000 within two yeara Ibey will soon get nd of the surplus. That will not long be a standing menace to (ien. Harrison's administration as it bas been to Mr. Cleveland's. The Republicans will, no doubt, call in the SMOOu.OOO now out in the national banks, and that, with all the ex travagance of appropriations, will bring about well, 1 shall not continue the sub ject further. Wait and you will see." What Alger U "Laying For." Washington City, Dec. 8. Representa tive Cutcbeon, of Michigan, is a personal friend of Gen. Alger and is on confidential terra with him.

His chances for H2 are very good. Entrance Into the cabinet would Jeopardize them. If be were in Mr. Harri son's cabinet and a a-ond term for the president were proposed lien.

CANAL BILL. Much Opposition to lhe Senate Measure In the House. Washington City, Dec. 8. The Nicar agua canal lull was considered at length in tbe house ye-terday, and much opposition developed to the incorporation a proposed in tbe senate bill, tbe measure under debate. Amendment after amendment was proposed. all with tbe purpose of tieing up tbe com pany to very close quarters, and preventing any possibility of the canal costing the United folates anything, if some of them were not intended to make tbe measure intolerable to tbe company, which last was intimated in the debate by the friends of tbe bill. The usual claims that the whole thing was a stock-jobbing affair, that it was unconstitutional, that the government would finally have to pay for the work, etc.. were made by the opposition, and Holman's amendment, amended by Cobb, providing that under no circumstances shall the United States be held to any liability, and reserving the rUbt to repeal or altr the act and regu late the tolls, wns adopted without trouble.

Who Is Willing to Swap Her Lucre for a Title About an Overcoat and a Broken Match A Tonne Woman's Ietrnctlve Rae A Great Penchant for Husband Two People Who Doat on Matrimony. N'ew York, Dec. 8, The latest noble. man to come across the sea to pluck away the fairest flowers is Prince George ErutolT de Qourie, of Russia, and dame rumor bas been whispering that be was to wed Mrs. Henry Turnhull, a rich and beautiful di vorcee. A hitch in tbe interesting progress of this match seems to bave occurred somehow. He came near marrying lira Frank Leslie in London. Bhe rejected bim finally and he went to Parts and laid siege to the heart of Mrs. Grace TurnbulL She wanted time to think about it, but wben she came to Amer ica he followed her, arriving here in Octo ber last. He and Mrs. Turnbull were much in each other's society. Rumor has it that she bad accepted him. An overcoat was the cause of tbe breaking off of the match. During the last cold snap the prince ordered a new, seal-lined overcoat, to cose $500. The order was booked, but his highness was in formed that cash was necessary. He con fided to the exacting man of business that he was about to wed a very rich woman, and that tbe marriage settlement ould amount to about $15,000 per year for the husband's pin money. The furrier warmly congratulated his bigbnesi, and invited bis distinguished customer to a champagne luncheon. It was arranged that the coat should be started at once, and that tba prince should biing in a document signed by tbe fair divorcee, giving the details ol tbe marriage settlement, upon tbe strength of which credit would be given. Mrs. Turnbull naturally objected, and tbe match was broken off. A gentleman at the Hotel Brunswick, an everyday acquaintance of the prince, said: "The prince told me that the income of his fiancee t$so,tMr) was not quite enough, because he was fond of the theatre and races. He had telegraphed to bis mother, who sent a cablegram forbidding his marriage with Mrs. Turnbull, because the consent of tbe Metropolitan Greek church could not be obtained." The prince is still looking around and his friends are railing his attention to other American girls with wealth and several of them nould be satisfactory to his highness. If be can get an American wife rich enough and witling to marry him, tbe prince will no doubt be married before be returns to Russia. A MAIDEN IN A RAGE.
