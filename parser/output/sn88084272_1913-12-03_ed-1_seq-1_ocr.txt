VL That a crisis in Mexico has al- ' most been reached because of the numerous armies the rebels have In the field, is the general belief pre vailing in Washington. The state department continues its -watchfulness in the .campaign of the Mexican insurgent leaders. It is point ed out in official circles that at the present time the "Constitutionalists" appear to be in actual possession of more country and to have more nu merous armies in the field than Madero did when he received notice of the overthrow of Pofirio Dihz. Secretary Bryan has sent to the American legations and embassies abroad that part of president Wilson's message to congress relating to the Mexican policy, in pursuance of the Secretary McAdoo Says Panics Will Cease if Gov ernment Is Given Power. 

GOVEENMENT AID GIVEN TO FAEMERS WASHINGTON. D. O, Dec 3. Government intervention to avert financial panics is de fended by secretary McAdoo, of the treasury department, in his report to congress, submitted today. Mr. McAdoo details the treasury's offer to loan bank ot the country money to move the fall crops. -The gam of $46,590,000 out of $50,MM,e es timated to be needed, was apportioned among the states. "It was oaaontial." sse the secretary, "that the action of the department Should be non-partisan and non-political; the crops of Republicans, Demo crats and "Progressives" and all other classes of people had to be moved, and the earnest effort of the department was to have the benefits of this ac tion diffused as widely and impartially as possible." After praising the psychological value of these incidents, the report con tinues: "They demonstrate clearly that any Improvement in our financial system which will permanently establish con fidence will in itself be an immense gain, and if that improved financial system assures the Opportunity to se cure at ail times the necessary funds and credits to meet the exoandintr and legitimate needs of the commerce and j industry or tne country, it will be an achievement of enduring benefits. Show Value of Altruistic Agency. These incidents also show conclus ively the enormous value of an altru istic governmental agency in the finan cial affairs of the country- So long as the government has the power to Intervene in a beneficent and unselfish way. the danger of panic and of un just practices will be largely, if not wholly, destroyed. "This is one of the chief objects sought in the proposed reformation and reorganization of our ban kins: and cur rency system. The people of the coun try are to be congratliiit-Hl upon the early prospect of souni legislation on this vitally important subject." Of the new tariff act secretary Mc Adoo savs it has not been in force a sufficient length of time to make pos sible an accurate estimate of its ulti mate revenue producing powers. Asks Tax on Alcohol. He asks congress to impose a nomi nal tax of one percent proof gallon on all alcohol withdrawn fon denatura tion and legislation requiring every dealer in leaf tobacco to make an in ventory of stock January 1 of each year and make a report of his trans actions quarterly or monthly, and that every dealer be required 'to give bond. The present oleomargarine law Is de clared to be unsatisfactory and the gov ernment is said to lose more taxes from illicit practices in oleomargarine than through moonshine stills. The differ ence in the tax on colored and uncol ored "oleo" Is held responsible for the loss and congress is asked to impose a flat nominal tax without any differ ence for color with provision for In dividual stamped or original packages of certain sizes adequately marked and safeguarded. The law governing the sale of adulterated butter is declared to have brought about unfortunate con ditions through the difficulty of its just enforcement. Some of the Recommendations.

The seaport city of Tampico was to day officially declared the tem porary capital of the state of Tamauli pas. Gen. Antonio Kabago, the military governor, who was forced to abandon Ciudad Victoria and who was reported to have committed suicide, has gone to Tampico under orders from the federal government to re-establish his gov ernorship in the temporary capital. Will Attack Victoria. The war department, announced that Gen. Anzmendi and other federal offi cers who fled from Ciudad Victoria to Cerntos in the stale of San Luis Potosi, had been ordered to reorganize their farces and to inarch against Victoria. This task had first been entrusted to Gen Navarrete, who retreated to Mon terey after his failure to relieve the har'i pr.-ss d garrison of Victoria. Foreign Flags Protect Americans. Preparations for defence in case of TO THIS CONCLUSION 1 plan adopted months ago in keeping the .European governments aavisea. "Wilson's Plan Outlined. Foreseeing early collapse of the Huerta regime, president Wilson has already mapped out the course he will pursue as soon as the rebej forces have taken the City of Mexico. Under this plan the success ofthe revolutionists will be followed Immediately by over tures from the United States to Car ranza or whoever may be selected as temporary ruler of Mexico, for an im mediate cessation of hostilities. Through charge O'Shaughnessy president Wilson will propose a con ference of the leading men of Mexico business men as well as military lead ers. From this conference he expects to evolve a plan for the early estab lishment of a permanent government. If this plan is carried out by Car ranza and his followers there Is little doubt that the United States will be Heberlein Says the Federals Will Go From Ojinaga to Nuevo Leon. 

LEAVE CHIHUAHUA TO THE REBELS ELEVEN troop trains carried the 56(H) federal and irregular troops and 3500 refugees out of Chihuahua- on the Orient road Sunday en route to Faiomir and from there oyer land to Ojinaga, according to Carlos Heberlein, who arrived at the border Tuesday evening, with O. Hernandez, who brought the message of the for eign consuls to Villa. The federals, he .ald,: would go to Nuevo Leon from Ojinaga. Jir. rieoenein came in an au tomobile to Villa Ahumada and from there to Juarez on a rebel troop train. The refugees should reach the border this evening or Thursday. He says that conditions were normal in Chihuahua when he left there Sun day evening. Frederico Moye was the acting governor and there were 200 troops of the 6th federal regiment pa troling the streets to preserve order. In addition, there were 300 mounted-police patroling the outside districts. No one was being permitted to enter the town from the outside until Villa ar rived, and every effort was being made to prevent disorders, pending the for mal taking of the town by Villa, Heberlein says. Heberlein says that the only disorder was caused by some of the irregular troops trying to loot some of the stores before they left for Ojinaga. He says that Mercado's pur pose in evacuating Chihuahua was be cause he had had no money with which to pay the federal troops and he be lieved that he could control them bet ter out in the wilderness than in the city, where there was danger of loot ing and mutiny. His ultimate plan was to join the federal troops now holding Monterey, Nueva Leon, Heberlein says, although he expected to escort the refugees to the border at Ojinaga be fore atmpting any military move-, ments. "It will take three or more days to make the trip to Ojinaga by way of Faiomir." Mr. Heberlein said Wednes day. "The bridges are burned east of San Sostenes, where it will be neces sary for the ti'bops to detrain. From there to Faiomir is only a short dis tance and from Faiomir it is 112 kilom eters through La Mula pass to the border. But the country is the worst on the American continent; there is no water and the refugees were warned by Americans in Chihuahua not to at tempt to take their women and children across this desert, and many were left behind, as they would be protected by the foreign consuls. There were 5500 troops, including all of the forces in Chihuahua. It is not true that Orozco, Salazar. Caraveo and Rojas Trent to the west. They all went together, the last train leaving Chihuahua at 1 oclocH Sunday afternoon for San Sostenes. They carried two weeks' supplies with them on the trip, but there was no money. Of that I am positive, for there was very little money in the Chihua hua banks and none In the stores." Mr. Heberlein Is a mining engineer at Chihuahua and will return to Chihua hua after spending the holidays In the United States. DIAZ IS ON ACTIVE LIST OF MEXICO AHMY Mexico City, Mer, Dec 3. The war department today nublished an orrier transferring Gen. Porlirio Diaz from nt jtiu uBi iu me active use. xne order bears the date of September 20. local disturbances are being continued by the foreign colonies other than the American. Leaders of the American colony are inclined to believe that any move in that direction taken by them would be misconstrued by the Mexican government. In order to avoid being regarded as organized combatants, the Americans in case of necessity will take refuge beneath the protection of the various European flags. Oil Salesman Giro) Bond. H. S. Kidder, general traveling sales agent for the Waters Pierce oil com pany, was released on a bond of $2500 at San Luis Potosi. after submitting to trial by the federal authorities on a charge of sedition. Apparently the only evidence against Mr. Kidder was that while riding on the railroad he had talked with employes regarding prevailing conditions and frequently looked through his field glasses at the landscape. He was ar rested on Nov. 27. mm lhly ALL first to formally recognise -the new government, it is pointed out here. "Huerta Regime Crumbling.' The flight of Huerta's generals in northern Mexico, federal evacuation of Chihuahua and Guaymas and the re fusal of Mexican oil companies to fur nish fuel for the movement of federal troop trains, were pointed out by of ficials here today as suoh events to which president Wilson referred In his message to congress when he declared the Huerta regime was crumbling "by a little every day." Diplomatically there have been no developments. President Wilson's statement that this government would not, in his opinion, be obliged to alter its policy of "watchful waiting" was regarded as forecasting a period of passive observation -with every eye of the government exercising at the same time a close scrutiny on behalf of guarding foreigners and their prop erty. Some diplomatists were inclined to see in president Wilson's expression of hopefulness that when Huerta had been forced from power. In which or der would be restored, "by the concert and energy of such of Mexico's leaders as prefer the liberty of their people to their own ambitions," an answer to. the frequent inquiries in the foreign press as to whether chaos ana anarchy would result if Huerta retired. Not Advised of Peace Proposal. Diplomatic officials here had no ad- ; vices to support published reports that queen Wilhelmina, speaking for The I Hague tribunal, had addressed a peace officials were confident that the United States would be notified before any I such proposal was made. I Although the state and navy depart' I ments were without official advices ; OTer night, unofficial reports that sev en xeaerai generals in nortnern .Mex ico were ready to surrender to the "Constitutionalists," were read with keen interest. Mme. Schumann-Heine's Piano Is Too Large; Ties Up Railroad Prima Donna Ties Tip Trains Here "When She Insists Upon Ravins It Transferred to Her Train. Madame Schumann-Heink and her piano delayed train passage at the union station in El Paso Tuesday night "for 'over 45 mniutes. The diva requires her favorite piano constantly with her as she must have that and none other in order to warble to her satisfaction. Consequently, everytlme she changes cars, the unwieldly Instru ment has to be shifted from one baggage-train, to another.- .m i .--.vc-" The prima donna, who has closed a concert engagement in Tucson, had to change cars in El Paso on her way to warble for the San Antonians. The doors of the baggage car wore a shade too small for the piano, and it re quired the working force of all the baggage sllngers in the union station to get the instrument inside the car. Wagon, Filled With Tornilloy Uncovered in a Sewer Trench Long Buried Vehicle Is Believed to Have Been Swallowed up by Quick Hand Before River Changed. A big road wagon was discovered about 10 feet below the surface of the ground In the excavations for the new sewer line on Estrella and T. P. street in East El Paso Wednesday. Only the rear wheels n-n1 tbft i-enr- nart of the wagon have so far been uncovered. ! The wheels are apparently perfectly good, though the wagon bed Is consia- erably rotted. The wagon contains a l load or semirotted tornnio. The sup position among the workmen is that the wagonload of tornillo was being driven over from Mexico some years before the river changed, that it struck the quicksand and was swallowed up. The situation of the wagon is about 500 yards form the old river bed. It is headed for Texas.

Land Owner s Raise Crops Instead Of Prices "Now, and Prosperity Is Result In West L AND owners in tho arid west have t quit raising prices and gone to raising crops, declared F. H. Newell, chairman of the reclamation commission. Mr. Newell is heie on his annual swing around the circle of the northwest and west, completing hia 25th year as a "water crank,' a title he gives himself. To celebrate the event, he is taking Mrs. Newell witn him for the first, time, through the country to which he has devoted the best part of his life to developing. "The year 1913 has been the best year of any in the arid west," Mr. Newell said "Wednesday. "This is In spite of the fact that homeseekcrs have been few and the people of the west have had to develop their own resources instead of depending upon the homeseekers from the east to de velop the land and give them a fortune in increased values. "Instead of raising prices the land owners raised crops this year and the natural wealth of the communities was Increased. The west has had real crops, real land prices and real pros perity in spite of the boom conditions and the west is settling down to a normal existence in which men pro duce what they get Instead of reaping a harvest from the eastern homeseek ers. "It Is a healthy sign when the banks refuse to loan money on real estate for speculative rather than productive pur poses. This is being done throughout the -west and has become an absolute rule in Canada. The banks have all kinds of money for real production but will not loan on speculative real estate. 'This forces the nonproducer to get busy. In one place, a man went to a banker and asked him for money on which to live. Instead, the banker told him he would buy him two milk cows from which he could earn his living. This was done and the man soon had 1 hogs, chickens, fruit, and dairy cows. I 

VILLA DIEIN FIRE BOSTON, Mass, Dec. 3. Twenty seven men were killed in a fire which swept through the upper floors of the Arcadia hotel,' a lodging house in the south end of Boston early today. Others are minning. Scores were taken to hospitals. Nearly all the bodies were terribly burned, making identification impos sible. The v victims were men in poor circumstances. Caught in the crowded bunks on the top floor of the five story brick building, and in the small rooms on the fourth floor, they were helpless.

When the railroad, the reclamation ser vice and other large interSts were turning loose money there, the town boomed, the saloons got a great deal of the money and little thought or ef fort -was given to the development of the valley. But when the railroad and reclamation service completed their construction enterprises, the payrolls dropped off and Yuma discovered that the source of supnlv had been cut off. Ult then became necessary for the peo ple to turn to tne soil, one man wno had been carrying 320 acres on a shoe string went to his banker for more money to meet his payments. The bank declined to advance any more money but offered the man 20 of the 320 acres and took the rest. The man built him self a shack, went to work and Is now T RINIDAD, Colo., Dec. 3.

VICTIMS ARE NAKED. Practically all the men were naked. Many were rescued by the firemen and police. Some escaped by walking a shaky plank stretched to an adjoining building or by jumping across a five foot alley to neighboring roofs. The property loss is only $25,000. The Arcadia was located at the corner of Washington and Laconia streets. The lower floors were occupied by stores. NEWSBOY DISCOVERS FIRE. The fife apparently started in a hall way closet on the street floor. The flames swept up the wooden stairs and burned through the roof. According to Win. Walsh, the night clerk, there were 178 lodgers in the building when the fire was discovered by a passing newsboy After turning in an alarm he rushed into the building awakening the men with his shouts The top floor was one large room, filled with cots and bunks. On ths fourth floor, where the loss of life was heaviest, there were 30 tiny rooms, like cells, with two cots in each. A hallway' ran through the center.
