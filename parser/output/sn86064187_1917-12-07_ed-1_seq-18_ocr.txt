TN HIS recent message to congress President Wilson stated that in order "to push our great war f fi"l mi and justice to its rightrous turn lusion vsc mint rlrar avsav with a thorough hand all imrdnnrnn to success" and added, "the very embarrassing obstacle thai stands in our way is that we are at war with (icrnuuy.'ul not with her allies." He recommended that we declare war on Austria, and added, "the same logic would lead also to a declaration of war against Turkey and Bulgaria " Hut infemitially and for reasons not apparent lie advised against such action. The president is entirely right in slating that our failure hitherto to declare war on the allies of (iermatiy has been a very embarrassing obstacle to our success, and he is entirely right in advising a declaration of war against Austria. Incidentally, I wish to point out that this is precisely what I insisted upon in these columns two months ago, and what I had elsewhere advocated six months ago, and it w worth while remembering that the administration papers then assailed me for urging the rourse which, although there has not been the slightest change in the situation, the president now urges. There was no justification whatever for failure to declare war on Austria when we declared war on Germany and there is now no justification for failure to declare war on Bulgaria and Turkey when we declare; war on Austria. There is no use in making four bites of a chetry. There is no use in going to war a little, hut not much. The presi dent has sent a message pledging support to Rumania, hut it is worse than an empty form to send surh a message unless we forthwith declare war on Bulgaria. The president has appointed a Sunday for the special expression of sympathy with Armenia, but such expression of sympathy is utterly meaningless unless we go to war with Turkey. The Austro-Hungarian and Turkish empires must he broken up if we intend to make the world even moderately safe for democraoy. There must he a revived Poland, taking in all the Poles of Austria, Prussia and Russia; a greater Bohemia, taking in Moravia and the Slovaks ; a great Jugo slav commonwealth including Serbia', CroaTTa, Bosnia and Herzegovina, while the Rumanians in Hungary should be come part of Rumania and the Italians in Austria part of Italy. The Turk must he driven from Kurope and Christian and Arab freed. Only in this manner can we do justice to the subject peoples tyranniied over by the Germans, Magyars and Turks. Only in this way can we remove the menace of German aggression, which has become a haunting nightmare for all civilirations, especially in the case of small, well behaved, liberty-loving peoples. By declaring war on Oerrnany's allies we do not commit ourselves to asking anything that is n just for , our own allies. But by failing tn declare war on Germany's allies we are ourselves guilty of injustice to our own allies. (Copyright. 11", 1ha Kanaua City Star.)

GENERAL HOFFMAN. A PPOINTMENT to command a division in Prance is in itself a fine compliment to the military ability of Brigadier General Roy Hoffman, of this city, and a cause of gratification tohis many friends. General Pershing, no doubt, is selecting his commanders for overseas di visions, and that thorough fighting man can be relied upon to select them for filfiess, and no other reason. There is a big task to do out there, and the army needs demand that men in high places, as well as troopers in the ranks, be qualified to do it. Those who have known General Hoff man's close study of military matters, and his real for the cause he serves, will not question his fitness for the under taking.. It is also quite likely that he will he advanced in rank, as well as given a lafgrr and more important com mand, and that he will soon be Major General Hoffman. It has been the rule to place divisions in command of major generals, and probably no exception will be made in this instance. Such promotion will be a fitting reward to an officer and a gentleman, who will give his country the best he has, which is good. Ch.tr Up! Ion't worry, Hill. Wa re Hur tn win.
