A "Washington dispatch of the 7tli inst. says that comments on tho President's message among Senators and Congressmen of all shades of political belief appears to be that it is a very able docu ment. Opinions as to the correct ness of its conclusions vary, of course, according to party affilia tion and individual sentiment, but there is a general agreement that in clearness of style, dignity of tone and force and freshness of argument, it is far above the aver ago level of the annual presiden tial messages for a number of years, and that it indicates the possession by its author ot a much higher grade of ability than has heretofore been commonly attrib uted to him. There is some disap pointment among Pacific coast representatives at the absence of any hearty recommendation for lcjrislative action to restrict Chi nese immigration, especially as the President takes pains to suggest that Congress should carefully re gard the '"interests and suscepti bilities'" of the Chinese govern ment in legislating upon that sub ject. On the other band it is noticed with gratification that the message does say that legislation is necessary to carry the treaties into pffoct, and also that the Presi dent significantly (though not so openly as might be desired) refers to the evils of unrestricted Chinese immigration when he says that our government "views with concern the efforts to seek replenishment of the diminished population of the Sandwich islands from outward sources."' President Arthur's vigorous ut terances upon the Mormon ques tion have given unalloyed satisfac tion to tho Pacific coast people and all other opponents of polyg amy, and will probably have a de cided influence upon the result of pending contest in regard to ad mission of Campbell as an anti ATormon delegate. It is considered highly probable that the Republi can members of the house will solidly sustain speaker Keifer in the position taken by him to-day in favor of Campbell, and these combined will also, it is believed, bo re-in forced by Democratic members whose abhorrence of Morraonism will lead them to fore go the possible advantage of em barrassing the Republican speaker, which is apparently the purpose of the opposition led by ex-Speaker Randall, so that on the whole Campbell's admission seems to be pretty well assured. The message was generally re ceived with satisfaction and com mendation. Some disappointment was expressed that he did not more distinctly and definitely enunciate a policy. This feeling, however, seems confined to those who hope for the domination of a faction of the party. Republicans generally think that the President means to entirely ignore factions and to heal dissension, and are glad that he refrained from saying anything that would be seized upon by either faction. Western Republicans, especially those from silver-producing states, are not pleased at the recommendation to limit silver coinage, but they con sole themselves with the belief that Congress will not carry out that recommendation. The Canadian Globe of the 17th says President Arthur's first mes sage certainly does not err on the score of a lack of comprehensive ness, for its author surveys mankind from China to Peru, with most ex amplary jairuess. Canadians will be pleased to learn that United States troops have orders to avoid all communications with British Indians crossing the frontier in quest of sustenance. Mounted po lice ought at once to have similar magnanimous instructions extend ed them. Referring to the Pana ma canal, the President maintains the perfectly indefensiblo doctrine, that the building and control of the canal concerns the United States and not European powers. If this doctrino is insisted upon ard the United States attempts to enforce it -trouble is inevitable. None of the European nations can consent to any one power domina ting over so important a highway as this canal will be. NEW
