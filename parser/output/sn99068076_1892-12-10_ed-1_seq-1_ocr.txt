WASIIIXOTOX, Doc. 0.—President Harri son's message r$aris as follows: To the Senate and llouso of Keprescnta tives: In submitting my annual message to'congress I have great satisfaction In being able to say that the general condi tions affecting the commercial and indus trial interests of the United States are In the highest degree favorable. A compar ison of the'existins* conditions with those of the most favored period in the history of the country will,I believe, show that such a degree of prosperity and so general a diffusion of the comforts of life were never before enjoyed bv our people. The total wealth of the country in ISM was *16,159, 616,048. In 1890 it amounted to$02,MO,000, 000, an increase of 5587 per cent. The to tal mileage of railwavs in the United .. States in 18B0 was 30,(126 in 1890 it was 107,741, an increase of 448 pen cent and it is estimated that there will be about 4,000 miles of track added by tho close of the year 181)3, The official returns of the eleventh census and of he tenth cen sus for seventy-tive leading cities fur nished the basis for the following compar isons Interesting Comparisons. In 1880, the capital invested in manufac turing was *1,36,830,070. In 1890 the capi tal invested in manufacturing was $2,000, 785,884. In 1880 the number of employes was 1,181,383,in 1890 the number of employes was 2,271,184. In 1880 the wages earned were 9501,965,774. In 1890 the wages earned were $1,221,170.4*54. In 18*) the value of the product was $2,71 1.579,099. In 1890 the value of the products was 94,860,230,837. I am informed by the superintendent of the census that the omission of certain indus tries in 1850 which were included in 1890, accounts in part for the Remarkable in crease thus shown. But after making full allowances for differences of method and deducting the returns for all indus icTi tries no$ included in the census of 18S0 there remain in the reports from these seventy-five cities an increase in the apf all wages earned" of 9677,943,920 and'in the number of wage earners employed of 856, 039. The wage earnings not only show an inoreased aggregate, but an increased per capita from 9386 in 18S0 to $547 in 1890, or 41.71 per cent. The new industrial plants established since October fl, 1890, and up to October 22, 189:2, as partially reported In the American Economist, number 845 and the extension of existing plants, 108. The new capital invested amounts to 940, 449,050 and the number of additional em ployes to 87,275. The Textile World for July. 1892, states that during the first six months of the present calendar year 135 new factories were built, of which forty are cotton mills, forty-eight knitting mills, twenty-six woolen mills, fifteen silk mills, forty plush mills and two linen mills. Of the forty cotton mills, twenty-one have been built in the southern states. A. B. Shepherdson, of the New York Cotton exchange, estimates the number of work ing spindles in the United States on Sep tember 1,1892, at 185,000,000, an increase of 660,000 over the year 1S91. The consumption of cotton by American mills in 1891 was 2.896,003 bales and in t893, 2,584,000 bales, an increase of 188,000 bales. From the year 1869 to 1892, inclusive, there has been an increase in the consumption of cotton In Europe of 92 per cent, while during the same period the increase of consumption in the United Stutes has been about 150 per cent. The report of Ira Aj*er, special agent of the treasury department, shows nt date, September 30, 1892, there were thirty-two companies manufacturing tin and tin plate in the United States and fourteen companies building new works for such manufacture. The amount in vested in buildings and plants at the dose of the fiscal year June 30,1892, if estimated conditions were to be continued, is 95,000, 000 and the estimated rate of production 200,000,000 puonds per annum. The actual production for the quarter ending Septem oer80, 1892, was 10,025,275 pounds. The re port of Labor Commissioner Peck, of New York, shows that during the year 1891 in about (3,000 manufacturing estab lishments in that state em braced within the special inquiry made by him and rcpresentlngsixty-seven different industries there was a net' in crease over tlio year 1890 of $31,815,130.08 in the value of the product and of 90,377, 925.09 in the. amount of wages paid. The report of the commission of labor for the state of Massachusetts show that 375 in dnsteries in that state paid 9129.410,248 in wages during the year 1891 against 9120, 030ja08 in 1890, an increase of 93.335.9-i5 and that there was an increase of $9.932,400 in the amount of capital and of 7.SWtt in the number of persons employed in the same period. During the last six months of the year 1891 and the first six months of 1892, the total production of pig iron was 9,760,819 tons as against 0.200,'703 ions in the year 1890, which was the largest annual production ever obtained. For the same 12 months of 1891-92 the produc tion of bossemcr ingots was 3,878,581 tons, au increase of 3,891,710 gross tons over the previously unprecedented yearly production of 3,088,871 gross tons in 1800. The production of besseincr steel rails for the first six niontlus of 1892 was 772,430 gross tons us against 702,080 gross tous during the.last six months of the year of 1891. The total value of our foreign trade (export# and manufactures) during the last fiscal year was $1,837,080,610, an ..in crease of $120,263,604 over the previous fis cal year. The average annual value of of onr imports and exports of merchan dise for the ten fiscal years prior to 1891 was 91,557,822,019. it will hi observed that our foreign trade for 3892 exceeded this annual average value by $400,358,391, an increase of 27.47 per cent.. The signifi cance and value of this increase are shown by the fact that the excess in the trade oE 1S93 over 1891 was wholly in the value of exports, for there was a decrease in the value of imports of 917,513,254. The value of exports during the fiscal year 1892 x'eached the highest figure in the history of the government, amounting to 91,030,278,148, exceeding by 914,797,338 the exports of 1891, nud exceeding the value Of the Imports by 92.028,750.86. A compar ison of the value of our exports for 1892 with the annual average for the ten years prior to 1891 shows an excess of $205,142, 671, or of 34.05 per cent. The value of our imports of mercliandise for 1892, which was 9829,402.462, also exceeded the annual average value of the ten years prior to 1891 by 9135,215,040. During the fiscal year 1893 the value of imports free, of dutv amounted to 9457,999,058, the largest ag gregate in the history of our commerce. The value of imports of mei*chandise en tered free of duty in 1892 was 55.35 per cent of the total value of imports, as com pared with 48.85 per cent in 1891 and S3,66 per cent in 1890. ity. capital employed of 91,532.745,004 in the value of the product of 92,024,23't,1titt. in Published by 

TINAN. and reap in Ignorance of the aggregate production of the year, and is peculiarly subject to the depreciation which follow* overproduction, But while the fact I have stated is true as to the crops I have mentioned, the general average of prices has been such as to give to agriculture a fiar participation in the general pros perity. If any are discontented with their state here if any believe that wages or prices, the returns for honest toil, arc inadequate they should not fail to remember that there is no other country in the world where the conditions that seem to be hard would not be accepted as highly prosperous. The English agricul turist would be glad to exchange the re turns of his labor for those of the Amer ican farmer, and the Manchester work men their wages for those at Fall River. Protection a National Blessing. I believe that- the protective system which now for something like thirty years has prevailed in our legislation has been a mignty instv anient for the devel opment of our national wealth and a powerful agency in protecting the homes of our workingmen from the invasion of want. I have felt a most anxious inter est towards our working people's wages that not only give dally bread but supply a comfortable margin for tnoso home attractions and family comforts and enjoyments without which life is neither hopeful nor sweet. They are American citizens, a part of the great people for whom our constitution and government were framed and instituted, and it cannot be a perversion of that con stitution to so legislate as to preserve in their homes the comfort, independence, loyalty and sense of interest in the gov ernment which are essential to good citi zenship In paacc and which will bring them as 1861 to the defense of the flag when it is assailed. The New Fiscal Policy* It is not my purpose to renew the argu ment in favor of a protective tariff. The result of the recentelection must be ac cepted as having introduced a new fea sure. We must assume that the present tariff, constructed upon the lines of pro tection, is to he repealed and that there is to be substituted a tariff law con structed solely for revenue that no dutv is to be higher because the increase will keep open American mills or keep up the wages of American workmen, but in every case such a rate of duty is to be imposed as will bring the treasury of the United States the largest returns of revenue. The contention lias not been between schedules but between principles and it would be offensive to suggest that the prevailing party will not carry into leg islation the principles advocated by it and the pledges given to the people. Through With Tariff Tinkering. The tariff bills passed by the house of representatives at the last session were as I supposed, even in the opinion of their {y In our coastwise trade a most encourag ing development is in progress, there hav ing been in the last four years an increase of 10 per cent, In internal commerce the statistics show that no such period of prosperity has ever before existed. Wages High and Work Abundant. There never has been a time in our his tory when work was so abundant or when wages were ns high, whether measured by the currency in which they are paid or their power to supply the necessaries and comfort* of life. It is true that the market prices of cotton and wheat have been low. It is one of the unfavorable in cidents of agriculture that the farmer tannot produce upon order. He must sow romoters inadequate, and justified only the fact that thj senate and house of representatives were not in accord and that a general revision could not therefore be undertaken, I recommend that the whole subject of tariff revision be loft to the incoming congress. It is a matter of regret that this work must be delayed for at least three months, for the threat of great tariff changes introduces so much uncertainty that an amount not easily estimated of business inuction and of diminished production will necessai'ily result. It is possible also that the uncer tainty may result in decreased revenues from customs duties, for our merchants make cautious orders for foreign goods in view of the prospect of tariff reduction and the uncertainty as to when it will take effect. Those who have advocated a protective tariff can well afford to have their disastrous forecast of a change of policy disappointed. If a system of cus toms duties can be framed that will set the idle wheels and looms of Europe in motion and crowd our warehouses with foreign-made goods and at the same time keep our own mill's busy that will give us an increased participation in the "mar kets of the world" of a greater value than the home market that we surrender that will give increased work to foreign pro ducts to be consumed by our people with out diminishing the amount of work to be done here that will enable the American manufacturer to pay to his workmen from 50 to 300 per cent more in wages than is paid in the foreign mill and yet to com pete in our market and in for eign markets with the foreign producer that will further reduce the cost of articles of wear and food with out reducing the wages of those who pro duce them that can be celebrated after its effects have been realized, as its ex pectation has been in Europe, as well as in American cities, the authors and pro motors of it will be entitled to the highest praise. "We have had in our history sev eral experiences of the contrasted effects of a revenue and ofa protective tariff but this generation has not felt them and the experience of one generation is not highly instruetfve to the next. The friends of the protective system with undiminished confidence in the principles they have advocated will wait the result of the new experiment. The strained and too often disturbed relations existing between the employes and the employers in our great manufacturing establishments have not been favorable to a calm consideration by the. wage earners of the effect upon wages of the protective system. The facts that his wages were the highest paid in like callings in the world and that a maintenance of this rate of wages in the absence of protective duties upon the pro duct of his labor was impossible were ob scured by the passion evoked by these contests. He may now be able to review the question in the light of his personal experience under the operation of a tariff for revenue onlj*. If that experience shall demonstrate that the present rates of wages are. thereby maintained or in creased, either absolutely or in their pur chasing power, and that the aggregate volume of work to be done in this country is increased or even maintained that there arc more or as many days work in a year at as good or better" wages for the American workman as *has been tlio case under the protective system, every one will rejoice. A general 'process of 'wage reduction cannot be contemplated by any patriotic citizen without gravest appre hension. It may be, indeed I believe is possible for the American manufacturer to compete successfully with his foreign rival in many branches of produc tion without the defense of protective duties, if the pay-rolls arc equalized but the conflict that stands lietween tlio pro ducer and that result and the distress of our working people, when it is attained, are not pleasant to contemplate. The so ciety of the unemployed, now holding its frequent and threatening parades in the streets of foreign cities, should not be al lowed to acquire an American domicile. The reports of the heads of the several executive departments, which are here with submitted, have very naturallg in cluded^ resume of the whole work of the administration, with the transactions of the last fiscal year. The attention, not only of congress, but of the country is again invited to the methods of administration which have been pursued, and to the result which have been attained. Public revenues amounting to 91.414,079,292.28, have been collected and disbursed Without loss from misappropriation, without a single de falcation of such importance as to attract the public attention, and at a diminished per cent of cost for collection. The public business has been transacted not only with fidelity but progressively and with a view to giving to the people in the fullest poss ible degree the benefit of services estab lished and maintained for their protection and comfort. Our relations with other nations are now undismrbed by any ser ious controversy. Commercial Agreements. There have been negotiated and con cluded under section 3, of the tariff law commercial agreements relating to reci procal trade with the following^ountries: Brazil, Dominican Republic, Spain for Cuba and Puerto Rico, Gautcmala, Salva dor, the German empire, Crfreat Britain for certain West Indian colonies and British- Guinea, Nicaragua, Salvador, Great Britain, Honduras and Austria Hungary have been concluded since my last annual message. A treaty providing forthesrbJtration of the dispute between Great Britain and the United States as to the killing of seals In the Bering sea. was concluded on the 29th of February last. I recommend that power be given to the president by procla mation to prohibit the taking of seals in {the North Pacific by American vessels in I case as a result of the findir£s of Pi^iVSK tribunal of arbitration OP otherwise the restraints can be applied to the vessels of all countries. Canadian Relations. During the past year a suggestion was received through the British minister, that the Canadian government would liko to confer as to the possibility of enlarging upon terms of mutual advantage, the com mercial exchanges of Canada and of the United States and a conference was held at Washington with Mr. Blaine acting for this government. The conference de veloped'the fact that the Canadian gov ernment was only prepared to offer the United States in exchange for the con cessions asked the admission of natural products. Favored rates could not be given to the United States as against the mother country. This admission as fore-' seen necessarily terminated the confer-1 enee upon this question. Other topics of interest were considered in the confer ence and have resulted in the making of a convention for examining the Alaskan boundary, the waters of Passamaquoddy bajr adjacent to Eastport, Me., and on the initiation of an arrangement for the pro tection of fish life in the coterminous aud neighboring waters of our north bound ary, 1 The president then refers briefly to the Welland canal controversy, defending the course of the government, and suggests a radical revision of our trade relations with Canada. Land transportation inter change should be put upon a different basis. The construction of an American canal around the falls of Niagara is sug gested to secure our independence of Can adian canals aud the St. Lawrence river. The trouble with Chile is referred to as satisfactorily settled. Relations with that country are of the most friendly. Special reference is made to the friendly relations with Hawaii, the reparation made to Italy, the action of the Frontfh government in proclaiming a protectorate over certain districts of the west coast of Africa east of the San Pctro river, our at titude during the Garza uprising in Mex ico, our intercourse with Spain attention is called to harsh treatment of religions and educational establishments of Ameri cans in Turkey and confidence expressed that that government will right matters, interference with trading ventures of Americans in Asia Minor is noted and lack of consular representation in that re gion deplored. The president earnestly recommends that hearty snpport^be given the Nicara gua ship canal company. Speaking of the international monetary conference the president expresses the be lief that the free coinage of silver upon an agreed international ratio would greatly promote the interest of our people and equally those of other nations. It is too early to predict what results may be ac complished bv the conference* If any temporary delay intervenes he believes the commercial conditions will compel the now reluctant governments to unite with us in this movement to secure the enlarge ment of the volume of money for the transaction of the business of the world. The Treasury Department. The report of the secretary of the treas ury will attract special interest, in view of the many misleading statements that have been made as to the state of the pub lic revenues. Three preliminary facts should not only be stated but emphasized, before looking into details: First, that the public debt has been reduced since March 4, 1889, 9259,074.200 aud the annual interest charges 911.684,469 Second, that there have been paid out for pensions dur ing this administration tip to November 1.1892, 9432.504,178.70, an excess of 9114, 406,300.09 over the sum expended during the period from March 1,1883, io March 1, 1889, and, third, that under the existing tariff up to December 1, about 993,(XX),000 of revenue, which would have been col lected upon imported sugars if the duty had been maintained, has gone into the pockets of the people and not into the public treasurv as before. If there are any who still think that the surplus should have been kept out of circulation bv hoarding it in the treasury, or depositing' it in banks without interest while the gov ernment continued to pay the banks inter est on the bonds deposited as security for the deposits, or who think the ex tended pension legislation was a public robbery, or that the duties upon sugar should have been maintained, I am con tent to leave the argument where it now rests, while we wait to sec whether these criticisms will take the form of legisla tion. The president suggests that the retire ment of bonds in the future before matur ity should be a matter of convenience, not of compulsion. The War Department. The report of the secretary of war brings again to the attention of congress some important suggestions as to the re organization of the infantry and artillery arms of the service, which his predeces sor^ have before urged. Our army is small, but its organization should all the more be put upon the most approved mod ern basis. The work of the attorney-general is epecially commended and attention is drawn to the startling aggregate of the amount of the claims pending against the government in the court of claims. Postoffice Department. The report of the postmastcr«general shows a most gratifying increase and a most ellicient and progressive manage ment of the great business of that depart ment. The deficiency of the present nscal year, it is estimated, will be reduced to 91.752,423, which will not only be extin guished during the next fiscal vear, but a surplus of nearly 91,000.000 should be shown. In these calculations the pay ments to be made under the contracts for ocean mail service have not been included. The president sees in the policy of sub sidizing ocean mail lines the hope of our languishing merchant marine and com mends highly what has already been ac complished in that line. Department of the Navy. The report of the secretary of the navy exhibits great progress in the construc tion of our new navy. When the present secretary entered upon his duties onlv three modern steel vessels were in com mission. The vessels since put in com mission and t* be put in commission dur ing the winter will make a total of nine teen during his administration of the de partment. During the current year ten war vessels and three navy tugs have been launched. Two other 'large ships and a torpedo boat arc under contract and the work on them advanced and the four monitors are awaiting ouly the arri val of their armor which has oecn unex pectedly delayed, or they would have been before this in commission. As the result of a new process in the construction of armor plate our later ships will be clothed with defensive plates of higher resistance than ai*e found on any war vessel afloat. A torpedo has been adopted and the work of construction is now being carried on successfully. We are making what is believed to be a pro jectile superior to any before in use. A smokeless powder has been adopted and a slow burning powder for guns of large caliber. High explosives capable of use in shells fired from Heavy guns have been found and the manufacture of gun cotton has been developed and the question of supply is no longer a doubt. Department of the Interior. The work of the interior department, always very burdensome, has been larger than ever before, during the administra tion of Secretary Noble. The disability pension law, taking of the eleventh cen sus. the opening of vast areas of Indian lands to settlement, the organization of Oklahoma, and the negotiations for the cession of Indian lands furnish some of tho particulars of tlio increased work. Several important agreements for the cession of Indian lands negotiated by the commission appointed under the act of March 2,1889, are awaiting the act,of con gress. Perhaps the most important of these is that for the cession of the Chero kee strip. The agreement which has been made by tho commission is perhaps the most satisfactory that could have been reached. It will be noticed that it is con ditioned upon its ratification by congress before March 4,1893. The secretary of the interior, who has given the subject careful thought, recommends the ratifica tion of the agreement. It is certain that some action ny which this controversy shall be brought to an end and the lands opened to settlement is urgent. The form of government provided by congress on May 37,3884, for Alaska, was, in its frame and purpose temporary. The increase of population and development of some important mining and commer cial interests make it imnerati™ that th- THE

J| WHOLE NUMBER 558. law should be revised and better provision made for the arrest and punishment of criminals. The report of the secretary shows a very gratifying state of affairs as to the condi tion of the general laud office. The Pension Bureau. The report of the commissioner of pen sions, to which extended notice is given by the secretary of the interior in his re port will attract great attention. Judged by the aggregate amount of work done the last year has been the greatest in the history of the office. I believe that the organization of the office is efficient and that the work has been done with fidelity. The passage of what is known as the de bility act has as was foreseen, very largely increased the annual disburs ments to the disabled veterans of the civil war. The estimate for this fiscal year was 9144,930,000 and the amount was appropri ated. A deficiency amounting to 910,058, 021 must be provided for at tills session. The estimates for pensions for the fiscal ycarenclingJune30,1894, is9165,000,000. The pensions believes that if iiation and methods are commissioner of pensions believes that if the present legislation and methods are maintained and further additions to the pensions are not made, the maximum ex penditure for pensions will be reached June 30,1894, and will be at the highest point, 1188,000,000 per annum. I recommended in my last annual mes sage that a commission be appointed to deal with the Union Pacific railway ques tion and I renew that recommendation and suggest that the commission be given full power Department of Agriculture. The report of the secretary of agricul ture contains not only a most interesting statement of the- progressive and valu able work done under the administration of Secretary Rusk, but many suggestions for the enlarged usefulness of this depart ment. Quarantine Regulations. The subject of quarantine regulations, inspection and, control was brought sud denly to my attention by the arrival at our ports in August last of vessels in fected with cholera. Quarantine regula tions should be uniform in all our ports. Under the constitution they are plainly within the exclusive federal jurisdiction when and so far as congress shall legis late. In my opinion the whole subject should be taken under national control and adequate power given to the executive to protect people against plague inva sions. Further restriction of immigration is also suggested as a preventive of plague importation. World's Columbian Exposition. The report of the World's Columbian exposition has not been submitted. That of the board of management of the gov ernment exhibit has been received and is herewith transmitted. The work of con struction and of preparation of the open ing of the exposition in Ma}- next has pro gressed most satisfactorily and upon a scale of liberality and magnificence that will worthily sustain the honor of the United States. Needs a Liquor Law. The District of Columbia is left, by a decision of the supreme court of the 'dis trict, without any law regulating the liquor traffic. An old statute of the legislature of this district relating to tho licensing of various vocations has hitherto been treated by the commissioners as giving them power to grant or refuse licenses to sell intoxicating liquors and as subjecting those who sold without licenses to penal ties. In May last the supreme court of tho district held against this view of the powers of commissioners. It is of urgent importance therefore that congress shouhi supply, either by direct enactment or bv conferring discretionary powers upon the commissioners, proper limitations and re straints upon the liquor traffic in the dis trict. Legislation for Railroad Employes. In renewing the recommendation which I have made in three preceding annual messages that congress should legislate for the protection of railroad employes against the dangers incident to the old and inadequate methods of braking cad coupling where still in use upon freight business, I do so with the hope that tills congress may take action upon the sub jeet. The Civil Service. The. civil service commission ask for an appropriation for more clerical assistance, which I think should be given. 1 extended the classified service March 1, 3892, to in clude physicians, superintendents, assist ant superintendents, school teachers, and teachers in the Indian service, and have had under consideration the subject of some further extensions, but have not as yet fully determined the lines upon which the extension can most properly and use fully be made. A Plaint About Election Methods. I have in each three annual messages which it has been mv duty to submit to congress, called attention to the evils and dangers connected with our election methods and practices as they are related to the choice of officers of the national fovernnient. In my last annual message endeavored to invoke serious attention to the evils of unfair apportionments for congress. I cannot close this message without again calling attention to Ihcse grave and threatening evils. I had hoped that it was possible to secure a non-partisan in quiry by means of a commission into evils the existence of which is known to all and that out of this might grow legislation from which all thought of partisan ad vantage should be eliminated and only the higher thought appear of maintaining the freedom and puritv of the ballot ana the equality of the cfector, without the guaranty of which the government eculd never have been formed, and without the continuance of which it cannot continue to exist in peace and prosperity. It is time that the mutual charges of unfair ness and fraud between the great parties should cease and that the sincerity of those who profess a desire for pure and honest election should be brought to the test of their willingness to free our legislation and our election methods from everything that tends to impair the public confidence in the an nounced result. The necessity for an in quiry and for legislation by congress upon this subject is emphasized by the fact that tho tendency of the legislation in some states in recent years has been in some important particulars away from and not toward free and fair elections and equal apportionments. Is it not time that we should come to gether upon the high plane of patriotism while we devise methods that shall secure the right of any man qualified by law to east a free ballot and give to every such ballot an equal value in choosing our pub lic officers and in directing the policy of the government? Lawlessness is not less such, but more, where it usurps the func tions of the peace officer and of the courts. The frequent lynching* of colored people accused of crime is without the ex cuse which has sometimes been urged by mobs for a failure to pursue the appointed methods for the punishment of crime that the accused have an undue in fluence over court and juries. Such acts are a reproach to the eommunitv where they occur and so far as they can'be made the subject of federal jurisdiction the strongest repressive legislation is de manded. A jiublio sentiment that will sustain the officers of the law In resisting mobs and protecting accused persons in their custody should be promoted by every possible means. Tho officer who gives his life in the brave dis charge of his duty is worthy of special honor. No lesson needs to te so urgently impressed upon our people as this, that no worthy end or cause can be promoted by lawlessness. This exhibit oi the work of the executive departments is submitted to congress and to the public in the hope that there will be found in it a due sense of responsibility .and an earnest purpose to maintain the' national honor and to promote the happiness and pros perity of nil our people.

THE GOULD CHILDREN. George at the Head Now, but Edwin tho Hereditary Financier. Mr. Gould leaves six children, four sons and two daughters. George is the eldest son, and will likely take up tho management of the Gould properties where his father left off. George Gould is still a young man, being a little over 30. He was educated in the public schools, and at the age of 20 en tered his father's office in the Western Union building. In an incredibly short time he had mastered the mys teries of finance, and in the past year he has frequently startled Wall street with his operations. He married Miss Edith Kingdon. a well known and very beautiful actress, in the latter part of 1888. They have three children, two boys and a girl. They recently moved into their new city house at Fifth ave nue and Sixty-seventh street, which Jay Gould purchased for them for $305,000. Beside his town house, George Gould owns a log cabin in the Catslcills in the midst of a picturesque tract of 550 acres. There he has a game preserve, stocked with elk and deer, and a lake that is fairly alive with speckled trout, lie is a devoted sportsman. George also owns the Grand opera house in this city, which came into his fathers possession as one result of the Erie mil way deal. He has an ample fortune of his own, estimated at 31,000,000. Edwin Gould, the second son of .lay Gould, resembles his father more than any of the children. He is 29 years old and was married to Miss Sarah Cantine Slirady, the adopted daughter of i)r. George F. Slirady. General Grant's phy sician. on October 21 last. The mar riage was the culmination of a court ship that had begun less than a- year before. Edwin Gould went south with hjs bride and returned only two weeks ago, when he and his wife moved into the house at 1 East Forty-seventh street, formerly occupied l\v (Jeorge Gould. Edwin is dark and swarthy, like his father. He is inspector of rille practice in the Seventh.v-first regiment, and inherited about $1 .*500,000 from his mother's estate. This he has increased to about 93.500,000. Among financiers Edwin Gould is regarded as the coin ing man in the Gould family. Miss Helen Gould is the next youn^j' "est child. She is the eldest daughter, but has been "out", in society only about a year. She will hold an inter esting position in the public eyes now that her father is dead. Of the other three children Howard is the eldest. He is not yet of age. He is a whole-souled young fellow, hail fel low well met with his companions and is looked upon as the black sheep of the family, although he has never done anything to warrant the belief that he is undi ly wild. Harold, the youngest brother, is still In school, and Hannah, the youngest child of the family, is just budding into womanhood. All the children arc devoted to each other, and are never so happy as when gathered around the paternal fireside. It is not known what the plans of the family are. but Miss Helen Gould will probably continue be the mistress of her father's mansioi) for some time to come.

A Century's Supply of Ivory Heaped Up in the Interior of Africa. WASHINGTON* Dec. 8.—"The ivory trade shows a most remarkable in* crease," Commercial Agent Mohun writes from the Ktfngo to the state de partment. 4'Ivory it the most valuable article exported. It all comes from the High Kongo, both north and south of the river. Steamers bring it as far as Stanley pool, and from there to Mat adi (250 miles) native carriers bring it on their backs! I have seen in one day 500 carriers come into Matadi, each man man carrying a tusk averaging sixty five pounds in weight. When tusks* weigh 200 pounds, which not infre quently happens, four men carry them. Most of the ivory now coming down is known as 'dead ivory.' Some of tho elephants from which these tusks came were killed 100 years ago, anltlieking« of villages have been storing it, plac ing the last tusks brought in on top of the pile, and when they required some goods from the coast traders the tusks from the bottom layers wero taken. This system has prevailed for years, and it is estimated that there is enough ivory stored in the interior to supply the world for the next century. It is estimated, but upon whose author ity I cannot discover, that there aro still at least 200,000 elephants in Cen tral Africa. The only live, or new. ivory which now comes down is that procured by hunters attached to the different trading houses. I may add that live ivory commands a higher price than the dead. A state expedition vis ited a native king some months ago in the interior. lTpon leaving, the com manding officer presented the king with a uniform mat, cocked hat and sword. The king in return presented the oiUcer with lf»0 tusks of ivory, averaging 220 pounds each, and provided carriers to take them to the river. These people do not recognize the value, and laugh at the trader for buying. Some of these kings have stockades of ivory built around their dwellings," FALSE ARREST*XND SLANDER Two Suits Brought Against Mrs. Celia Snol! by a Former Maid. CHJCAOO, Dec. 8.—The trial of the two suits brought against Mrs. Celia Knell by Ilattie llliss, her former maid, one for $35,000. slander, and the other for a similar amount for false arrest, is set before Judge Hutchinson today. The defendant is a daughter-in law of Albert J. Snell, the west side millionaire who was murdered in his home during the night three years ago, the murderer never having been dis covered. A young man named Tascott belonging to a well-to-do family was suspected, but he disappeared on tho day after tho murder, never yet having been discovered, although hundreds of Taseotts have turned up in different parts of the country. There is a stand ing reward of $100,000 for his arrest. The present suit has its origin in the fact that a year ago Mrs. Snell caused the arrest of the maiden on a charge of larceny, and afterwards circulated the report that the maid had tried to poison her at the instance of another member of the family. Developments sensa tional in the extreme are promised dur ing the trial. 

OSBORNE ALL RIGHT. GU&YKNNK, Wyo.. Dec. 8.—The repub lican state central committee went to Prosecuting Attorney Davidson to have him draw up an information against Governor Osborne,charging him with usurpation of office. Davidson, who is a republican, found after exam ination that there was nothing criminal in the act, and would do nothing in the matter. The state canvassing board issued a circular letter to the chairmen of the respective committees asking them to have three men to be present at the oilicicial count of the vote on Thursday. None of them can be men who have been candidates. Osborne is thus excluded. Jackson Talks.

"llefore the Sullivan-Corbett tight,** said Jackson, "my manager offered to back me. win or lose, against Corbett. I am ready at any time to meet him. I have not issued a challenge, nor will I. Corbett knows my sentiments, and ho knows, too. that I mean business. What 1 have to say is this: The pub lie, if it so wills, can force Corbett to meet me. If the public wants to wor ship him as champion, let it do so. Tho public, 1 surmise, wants to see. the champion prepared to defend his titlo. Why should Corbett parade the country two years and not fight anyone in that time? It isn't reasonable or just. Ucrc 1 am ready to fight for the champion ship. Corbett says, *Petor. you're a nice fellow and I don't want 'to fight you. Hut Mitchell is a bad fellow and he therefore throws me over for hiui.' I cannot wait twoyears.but I will wait six, nine, ten or twelve months. There is still one good fight in me, and my next battle will be my last. "I certainly think that" I can defeat Corbett, else I would not seek a meet ing with him. As to that draw in Cal ifornia, if the officials had allowed the fight to continue I'm confident I would have outlasted him. There was 87,000 coming to us from that fight, and the club offered an additional purse of $10, 000 if we would meet again. Corbett refused, claiming that he was not cer tain of fair treatment. My money will be ready whenever Corbett signifies a willingness to meet ine. Prize fighting, with me, is not sentiment. It is my way of making a living." Meyer and McAutiffe May Meet. CHICAGO, Dec. 8.—Matters are shap ing themselves for an athletic show at the Second Ilegiment armory next Sat urday night, and the main event of the evening, the contest between Jack Mc Auliffe and Billy Meyer,, will probably furnish as rare a set-to as has ever been witnessed in the lake front armory.
