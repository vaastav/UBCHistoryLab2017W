The stock market passed throtiRli various periods of weakness nnd streiiRtlt nil throuRh the day. but tlio Importiint movement came late In the Afternoon, following the announcement of the recommendation of the Interstate Commerce Commission t'lillltiK for the Government operation of railroads as a war measure. 1'tlor to this news tho mutket had shown a heavy tone, with a number of stocks recording n crtimbllnK nwny of values to the lowest raiiKe leached In many ;.eurs, but the WashliiRton advices were responded to with n ipilck Infusion of streiiKth. I'nlted States Steel common .iruIii showed Its market leadership, ad vancing from Sa4 to S, and the copper stocks also moved up from tjio low levels which had been established in the early afternoon. As n mat ter ot course the most acute Interest was shown In the railway Issues, which were suddenly lit urficnt demand, with nearly evcrythlnp; In this croup moving up from 1 to 3 points, the udvances creatine; pronounced nervousness nmonu those committed to the short side. Hear traders made in-Rent efforts to cover shorts, but offciliiKS were boilRht In by prominent flnanciul Interests, leavlnp, a market supply so scant as to bo n course of general comment. AmonR the advances was u Jump of more than 2 points In St. Paul from its low of 35 to above 37. New York Central, which had sold down to B6V4. rose to 70 In n few min utes, and simTlnr advances were mado In Delaware and Hudson nnd Union Puclllc. The speculative element, which always favors bullish operations In ::ilc, made that stock active and strong, nnd It advanced more than 1 point also. Tho strength became most pronounced in tho final dealings, when nearly everything traded in sold at new high figures for the day. Liberty 3V&S were traded In at 98.fi! to OS.r.4, and the 4s from 97.62 to .17.31!. Dealings in these issuei were on a lnrger scale than has been noted for some time. Curb on Incorrigible Labor Element There Is one point In the President message to Congress that has left a most marked impression lit Wall street. This lias to do with tho necessity for checking 'unrestrained selllshness," which has been running "impudently rampant." ' Inferential!-, where price-fixing has been undertaken by the Gov ernment tho results have been at least partially satisfactory; hence tho determination of tho Chief Executive to curb further profiteering. Will all of tho essentials bo brought ut.der the restraint of governmental . price-fixing, and to what degree nnd to what extqnt will this bo cor rected by the application of restraining measures on the Incorrigible labor elements? Labor has been forcing prices up on Itself, as any one conversant with economics is aware. But Washington has been slow In forcing tho same obedience that It has demanded ot the manufacturer. Will Wash ington force the labor leaders to recognize that flowery words of alle giance and patriotism do not make up for the unpatriotic manifestations that- have characterized many of the labor disputes? In tho financial district It Is felt that If labor can be made to see the error of its ways one of tho greatest obstacles will have been overcome. There has been some selling tho last week of Bethlehem Steel on reports privately circulated that Washington had in contemplation the assumption of its Bussian munitions contracts at prices satisfactory to the United States Government and, Interentlally, less satisfactory to Bethlehem Steel. In Important quarters, however, it is felt that there Is not likely to bo any bevere reduction; but nt that a smaller prollt from the United States Government Is more secure than the promise of a larger prollt by tho Bolshevlkl. Speculative Element Should Be Pleased ' Instead of being disappointed, the speculative element In Marine pre ferred should be pleased at the action of the directors In declaring only $10 a share against the .arrearage. To pay off the dividend would mean the removal of the speculative possibilities of the stock. It Is unlikely tho accumulation will bo retired until after the war. But that does mean the back dividends will not be played to the limit in the market. One of the unfavorable features of tho recent market has been tho continued liquidation of investment values. There mo stocks today selling at prices below then scrapping value; so low. In fact, that they may be regarded as selling at Jess than their "nuisance value." Yet Investors are timid. They are under the restraint of the foreign news Mid Inability to gauge with accuracy the effect ot the war and excess profits taxes on the Income of tho individual. What Is more, the average trader's ex periences in the last year lmvit been of a nature that have robbed him of his confidence in market gossip. He finds It diflicult, for Instance, to bellevo what ho hears about Studebaker when he bought the same stock 150 olnts higher on the same type of talk. There Is good authority for the statement that the dividend on Sin clair Oil stock Is safe, provided the Interpretation of the war tax will permit adequate allowance for depreciation and exhaustion of oil reserves. The stock has suffered not only from poor distribution, but fears as to i the maintenance ot the dividend. tu .inti, no KI. Iisl Allls-riial Co. .
