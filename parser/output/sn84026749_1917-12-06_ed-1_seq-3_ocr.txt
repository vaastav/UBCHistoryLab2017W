D BULGARIA IS ALSO URGED The Wrong Place and the Wrong Time By T. E. POWERS s , With the Austrian mar declaration resolution favorably reported to the House todsy, openlnc debate clcarlj showed that sentiment in faor of in cludlns Bulgaria and Turkey among, the enemies of this country has not I cooled, despite President Wilsons recommendation. CofaETestman Miller Of Minnesota, adToc&tlntr immediate adoption of the Austrian resolution, ureed that Tur key and Bulgaria be. included. He scouted the Idea "that by withholding such action the United 'States might "weeh these countries from Ger many." Envoys' Presence JIensee "The presence of the Bulgarian and Turkish ministers In IVashlngton Is a, menace," Miller declared. "Many allied diplomats feel this. Informa tion of our affairs is daily reaching Berlin. How I shall not attempt to ay. "The Turkish Sultan belongs on the bosom of the German Kaiser." Miller shouted. "The Turks must live or die with Germanay. I hope they die with bsr.- Miller charged that failure of the Tnlted -States to supply Italy with srdnr'aad war materials was delayed for months because this country was not at War with Austria, and that much- of the Italian disaster may be charged against the United States. Repeatedly Applauded. "We cannot hope to separate Bul garia and Turkey from Germany and Austria except by force of arms," said Miller. "We must throw away these intel lectual theories and go In whole heartedly with our allies In common cause against all of the enemy." Miller, while emphatically demand ing war oh Bulgaria and Turkey, de clared he Is willing to await the Presidents decision. He was repeat edly applauded throughout his ad dress. Miller has just returned from the fighting front. To-Pretect Americans. Possible) intimation that the Ad ministration's; counsel against an Im mediate declaration against Bulgaria and Turkey Is In reality but a play for time until Americans In these countries can leave" was given by dongressman Flood, chairman or the Itouso Forehrn Belatlons Committee, who toolc the 'floor immediately after a mjLt number1 of Americans would be in ereat danger shtrald the United States declare war on Turkey at this time. If we are" to declare war. we must at least give thepi time tq get out." At the same time. Flood, enumerat ing reasons why war declarations should b withheld, declared the Gov ernment bad Information that. Ger many's lesser allies were weakening in their support. Flood here read to the House the United Press Interview of yesterday with Bulgarian Minister Panetaroff, in which the envoy asked that the President's message to Congress be transmitted to his country line Been At War. The state of war between the Uni ted States and Austria has been an actual fact for many months." the committee's report stated, and "very HtfJe -readjustment of affairs" be tween the two countries will there fore be Involved.

PAY INCREASE FOR fllFRKMRFfl 'i SAY CONGRESSIVIEN their Increase for one year, will lead the fight this year. Although owing to his position on the Appropriations Committee, Jin Byrns will not be quoted on' matters of policy with which the 'committee will nave to deal, he la known to have the same views now he had last year when he led the successful fight which brought widely divergent views to a common agreement. "Conditions have not changed from last year.i he said today, "except for the worse,!f anything.. It Is safe to say that. Congress -will 'enact some legislation looking to the betterment of the clerks' condition. "Whether the Increase will be the same granted last year or a little more, depends on developments In Congress. Personally, I realize that the most that can ba hoped for from Congress is 'little enough.) "I believe- that a distinction should ba made in, actual dollars between the clerk, who receives "$1,200 or under, and the 1.800 clerk. For Instance, a scale should be determined on that would assure the poorer paid clerk a greater actual money Increase than received byythe higher jald clerk. Under the S and 10 per cent scale the 1000 clerk gets ft D0, raise and the 1,R00 gets 90. When the cost of llvlng-heglns.to climb, ft. Is more dif ficult forthe' J800clerlc to retrench, and his sacrifices are greater than those of the 11,800 clerk." ,, To T-xsss.Oab4irBe.BIU. bill Introduced by Congress- (Continued from First Page.) larger program of the Federation of Federal Employes for Increases rang ing from 25 per cent for the poorer paid clerks, 'to S per cent for thbse receiving as high as $2,500 per year.
