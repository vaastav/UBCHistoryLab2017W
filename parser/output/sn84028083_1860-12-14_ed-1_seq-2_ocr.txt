KANSAS AND UTAH. my Confronted in Kansas by a revolutionary government, existing under what is culled the Topoka constitution. Its avowod object was to tubdue tbe territorial government by force, and to inaugurato what was called the Topcka govornmunt ic its stoud. To coomplish this object an cxtensivo military Organization was formed, and its command entrusted to tho most violent revolutionary leaders. Under those circumstances, it be came my imperativo duty tooxnrt the whole constitutions! power of the Executive to prevent the (tamos of civil war from again raging In Kansas, which, in tho excited iStuto or the public mind both North and South, might bavo extondud into the neighboring tttatct. ' The hostilo parties In Kansas had boon inflamed against each other by emissaries both from the North and the South, to a de gree ot malignity without parallel in our bistory. To prevent actual collision, and to assist the magistiatos in onforoing tho laws, strong detachmont of tho army was sta tioned in '.ho Territory, ready to aid the marshal and hit deputies when lawfully called upon, as a rouse comilatm In tho ex ecution of civil and criminal process. Still, the troubles in Kansas could not bavo beon permanently settled without an sdootion by tbo people. The ballot box is ' tbo surest arbiter of disputes among free men. Under this conviction, evory proper effort was omployod to induce tho hostile partiot to voto at the elootion of dulrgites to frame a State constitution, and after wards at tho oloction to deoido whothiii Kansas should be a slave or a froe State. The insurgent party refused to votoat either, lest this might bo considered e, recognition oa their part of tho Territorial govornment established by Congress. A bettor spirit, however, soomod soon after to provail, and the two parties met face (o face at tho third election, hold on the first Monday of Jan vary, 18CH, for mombors of tho legislature and State officers under the Lucoinptoii constitution, Tbo rosult wnt tho triumph of (ho anil alavery party at the polls. This decision of the br.llot box proved clearly that this party were in tho majority, and removed tho dan cer of olvil war. From that time wo have beard little or nothing of the Topoka gov ernment and all serious dungor ot revolu tionary troubles in Kunsut was then at an end. Tbe Locompton constitution, which had beon thus rccogn:zod at this diato election by tbe votes of both political parties in Kan sas, was transmitted to me with tho request that I should presont it to Congress. This I could not have rofused to do without vio lating my cloarcst and strongest convictions of duty. The constitution, and all the pro ceedings which prceodod and fidlowod its formation, woro fair and regular on thoir face. I then boliovod, and experience hut proved, tbut the interosts of the people til Kansas would have bouu best consulted by Its admission as a State into tho Union, es pecially as llio majority, within a btiuf period, could have amondod the constitution ac cording to thoir will and pleasure. It' fraud existed in all or any of theso proceedings, it was not for tho l'resident, but for Congress, to investigate and determine the question Of fraud and what ought to be Its conso ouenooi. If at the two first olootions, ilio majority refusod to voto, it cannot bo pre tended that this refusal to exorcise tlio elec tive franchise could invalidate un election fairly hold under lawful authority, even if tboy had uot subsequently voted at tho third elootion. It is true that the whole constitution had not boon submitted to tho people at I alwayt desired ; but tho prooo dents are numerous of tho admission of States into tbo Union without tucb tub mission. It would not comport with my prosont purposes to roviow tho proceedings of Con gross upon the Locompton constitution. It it sufficient to observe tbut tboir final action bat removod tho last vestige of serious revo lutionary troubles. The desperate band ro oenily assembled; undor a notorious outlaw, In tbo Southern portions of tho Territory, to resist tho execution of tho laws and to plunder peaceful citizent, will, I doubt not, be tpoedily tubduod and brought to justico. Had I treated the Lecotnpton Constitu tion at a nullity and rofused to tubmit it to Congrest, it it not difficult to Imagine, whilst recalling tho position of tho country at thai moment, whut would havo boon tho dis astrous contequonoos, both in and out of tbo Territory, from such n deruliction of doty on tho part of tbe Exocutlvo. feaoo hat alto been restored within the Territory of Utah, which ut the commence tnent of my administration wat in a statu of open rebullton.

Cost what it might, it wat nocotsary to bring them into suhjeo tion to the constitution and tho luws Sound Dolicv. therefore as well us humunity roqulrod that this object should, if possible, be accomplished without tho effusion of blood. This could only bo effected by send InaT a military foroo into :ho Territory Btiffl cienlly strong to convinca the pooplo that resistance wuuld be hopeless, untl at the same time to offer them a pardon for past effunoct on condition of liiunudiuto submis sion to the governmont. tins policy was Dortued wiiu omiuont success t and the only cause for rogret is tho heavy expoudi ture required to maroh a largo detachment of the army to that remote region, and to furnish It subsistence, Utub is now com paratively peaceful and quiet, and the mili tary force hut been withdrawn, oxoept tbut portion of it necessary to keep (ho Indium to check, and to protect the emigrant (rains toi to our I'uoiflo FINANCES. Io roy first annual message I promised fn employ ray boat exertions, io co operation with Coogrest, to roduoo the expenditures of the govorumont within tbo limiti of a wise ana Judicious eoonomy. An outflow ing" treasury bad produood hablis of prod fgalily and 'extravagance whioh could only La rradu.Ulv corrected. The work required both time and patience. I applied myself diligently to this task from tbe beginning, ud was aided by the able and energetic ffitrls of tbe beads of tho different Execu tive liopartmnuts. . The result of our labors 1 this irood cause did not appear In the $ uia totjsl pf our expenditures for tbe first two yoati.mainly In consequence of the exlraordi- nary ei pendituro necessarily incurred in tbe Uluh eipedlllhn, and the very largo amount or mo oonungoni expenses 01 congress mi ring this poriod. Tune greatly exueoded iiru pnj auu iiiiiviiu Ul mu muuioui , tut the year ending 80th Juno, 185a. while the pay and inilcago amounted to 1.490.214. tho contingent expenses rose to 92,093 309. 79, and for the year ending 30th June, 1859, whilst the pay and mitoago amounted to 8fl8 693 6i5.ih contingent expenses amount id to ) 1.431,1186 76. I am happy, however, to bo able to inform you that during the last fiscul year, onding on the 80ib June, 1SG0, tho total expenditures of tho govern ment in all its hranohet legislative, exocu live and judicial- exclusive of tho public debt, woro reduced to the sunt of 53,402.. 468 4c'l. This conclusively appears front the books of tho Treasury. In the year ending on tho 30tb June, 18&S, the total expendi ture, exclusive of (ho public debt, amounted to 71.001,129 77, nnd that for the year ending 30th June, 1859, to 00 310 22(1 13. Whilst tho books of (ha Treasury show an actual expuudituro of 909.643,474' 72 for tliu year ending on the 30th Juno, 1800, inclu ding $1,04(1.607,71 fr tho contingent ex penses of Congress. There must bo deducted from (hit amount tho sum of $1,200 0C9 20, with tho interest upon it of 160,000. ap propriated by tho act of ISih February. 1800, "for tho purpose nf supplying tho deficiency in tho revenues and defraying (ho expenses of th'o Post Oirioe Department for tho year ending (ho 30th of Juno, 1850." This sum. thoroforo. justly chaigonblo to tho year 18.r)9. must ho deducted trout (no sum ot ifjj.a-t.i,-474 82. in ordur to ascertain tho expendi ture of tho year, ending on tho 3'uh of Juno, 1800, which' loaves a balanco for tho ex pendituret of that year of 55,402 465 4fi. The interest on the public debt, including Troasury notes, for the same fiscul year ond ing on the 30th Juno, 1KG0, amounted to 3,178.314 62, which, added to tho above sum of S5 402,405 40, makes the aggregate of $53,579,780 08. It ought in justice to he observed tlint several of the estimates from all the depart ments for the year er.dinp; 30ih of June, 10GO, were reduced by Congress below what was nnd still is deemed compatible with the public interest. Allowing a lib eral margin of 2,500,000 for this reduc tion anil for other causes, it ms v be safely averted Hint the un of 6 1 ,000.000, or nt tho most 02,000,000, is amply suffi cient to administer the government and Io pay the interest on the public debt, un less contingent events should hereafter render extraordinary xpendilures neies sary. This result hns been attained In a con siderable degree by the cure exercised by the appropriate departments in entering into public contracts. 1 have myself never interfered with the award of any Much contract except in a single care with the Colonization Society, deeming it ad visable to cast tho whole responsibility in each case, on the proper head of the de partment, with the general instruction that these contracts should always be (rivrn.lo (he lowest and best bidder. It Iihs ever been my opinion thnl public contracts are not a legitimate source of patronage to be conferred upon personal favoiitep; but that in all such eases a pub lic officer is bottnd to act for the govern ment as a prudent individual would act Tot himself. AFRICAN SLAVE TRADE, ETC. It is with great satisfaction I communi cate the fact, that since the d.ite of my last annual Message, not a single slave has been imported into the United States in violation of the laws prohibiting the African slave trade. This statement is founded upon a thorough examination and investigation of the subject. Indeed, the spirit which prevailed some time since among a portion of our fellow citi zens in favor of this trade, seems to have entiiely subsided. 1 also congratulate yott upon the public sentiment which now exists against the crime of setting on foot military expedi tions within the limits of tho United Stales, to proceed from thence and make war upon the peoplo of unoffending States, wnb whom we are at peace, in tins re spect a happy change has been eflucted since the commencement of my adminis tration. I: surely ought to be the praver of every Christian and patriot that such expeditions may never again receive coun tenance in our country, or depart from our shores. It would be a useless repetition to do more than refer, with earnest commend ation, to my former recommendations in favor of the i'acino Uailroad of the grant ol power to the l'resident to employ the naval force in the vicinity, lor the protection of the lives nnd property of our fellow-citizens passing in transit over the different Central American routes against sudden and lawless outbreaks and depre dations; and also to proiecl American merchant vessels, their crews and car- trots, almost violent nnd unlawful pcirure and confiscation in the ports of Mexico and the South American republics, when these may be in a disturbed and revolu tionary condition. Ills my settled con viction that without such power we do not afford that protection to those engaged in the commerce of the country which they have a right (o demand. 

ELECTION OF MEMBERS OF CONGRESS. I ngain recommend to Congress the passage of n law in pursuance of the pro visions of the Constitution, Appointing a day certain, previous to the 4h of March, in each year of un odd cumber, for the cleotiun of representatives throughout u!l the States. A similar power has already been exercissd, with general approbation, in the appointment of the same day throughout the Union for holding (he election of electors for President and Vice President of the United Slates. My at tention was earnestly directed to this sub ject from the fact that the 35th Congress terminated on the 31 ol March, lUo!). without mukiug the necessary appropia tion for the service of the Post Office De partment. I was then forced to consider tho best remedy for this omUsion, nnd an immediate call of the present Congress was the natural resort. Upon inquiry, however, I ascertained that fifteen out of the Ihirty-lhreo Slates composing the Confederacy were without represenlnives, and that, consequently, these fifteen States would be disfranchised by such n call. These fifteen States will be in the same condition on the 4th of March next. Ten of them cannot elect representatives, no cording to existing State laws, until dif ferent periods, extending from the be ginning of August next until tbe months of October aod November. la my las', message I gave warning that, in a time of sudden and alarming danger, the ' salvation of our institutions may depend upon tbe power of the Pres ident to assemble full Congress, to meet the emergency. 

TARIFF. It if now. quite evident that the finan cial necessities of (he government will require a modification of the tariff during your present session, for the purpose of! increasing the revenue. In thit aspect, 1 desire to teiternle the recommendation contained in my last two annual messages, in favor of imposing specific, instead of ad valorem duties on all imported articles to which these can be properly applied. From long observation nnd experience I nra convinced that specific- duties are nec essary, both to protect (he revenue and to secure to our manufactuiing interests that amount of incidental encouragement which unavoidably results from a revenue tariff. As nn abstract proposition it may be admitted that ad valorem dmies would, in theory, be the most just nnd equal, lint if the t xperience of this and all other com mercial nations has demonstrated that such duties cannot be assessed and col lected without great frauds upon the rev enue, then it is the part of wisdom to lesort to specific duties. Indeed, from tho very caturo of ad valorem duty this must be the result. Under it the inevi table consequence Is that foreign goods will be entered it less than their true value. The treasury will, therefore, lose the duty on the difference betwven the real nnd fictitious value, and to thuextcDt we are defrauded. The temptations which ad valorem duties present to a dishonest importer are irresistible. His object is to pass his his goods through the Custom Homo at the very lowest valuation necessary to save them from confiscation. In this he too often succeeds, iu spite of the vigilance of the revenue officers. Hence the resort to false invoices, one for the purchaser and another for the Custom House, and oilier expedients to defraud the govern ment. The honest importer produces his invoice to the collector, staling the actual price nl which he purchsoJ tho articles abroad. Not bo the dishonest irr.porler and the agent of the foreign manufac turer. And here it may be observed that it voty large proportion of the manufac tures impor cd from abroad ate consigned for sale to commission merchants who are mere agents employed by tho manufac turers. In such cases no actual sale line been mado to Gx their value. The foreign manufacturer if he be dishonest prepares au invoice of the goods, not nt their actual value, but nt she very lowest rate neces sary :o escape detection. In liiis manner the dishonest importer and foreign man ufacturer enjoy a deciJed advantage over the honest merchant. They are thus en abled to undersell the fair tinder, and drive him from the market. In fact the operation of this system has already driven from the pursuit of honorable com merce many of that class of tegular and conscientious merchants, whose character, throughout tho world, is the pride of our country. The remedy of these evils is to be found in specific duties, so far as this may bo practicable. They dispense with any innuirv at tho Custom Hou-e into the actual cost or value of the article, and if pays the precise amount of duty previ ously fixed by law. They present no temptations to the appraisers of foreign goods, who receive but small salaries, and might by undervaluation in a few cases render themselves independent. Desides, specific duties best conform to tho requisition in the Constitution that "no prelerenco shall be given by any reg ulation of commerce or revenue to the ports of one Slate over those of another." Under our ad vulorcm system such pref erences are to sumo extent inevitable, and complaints have often been made that the spirit of this provision has been violated by a lower appraisement of the same ar ticles nt one port than at another. An impression, strangely enough, pre vails to some exlcnl that specific duties are necessarily protective duties. Nothing can be more fallacious. Ureal liritain glories in free trade, and yet her whole revenue from imports at the piesc-nt mo ment is collected under n system of spe cific duties. It is a striking fact in this connection that, in the cointmiroml treaty ot 23d January, 1M60, bulween Franco uud Knglund, onu of tbo ai tides provides that tho ad valorem duiius whiuh it imposes shall ba converted into spocifio duties within six months from its duto, and these are to be ascertains.! by making un avorajjo of the prices for six months previous to (but time. Tbo rovorso of tbo proposition would bo noaror.to tho truth, buuauso a much turgor amount of revenue would bo collocted by merely convorting tho ad valorem duties ol a taritt tutu equivalent speoino duties, io thisuxiont tho rovonuo would uo tuuruaseu, and in tbo same pioportiou tho specific duty might be increased. Specific duties would socuro to tho Amer ican manufacturer (be incidental protection to which ho is fairly entitled under a rov onuo laiilf, uud to this surely no poison would object. Tbe 1 1 amors ot the existing tariff havo gnno lurthor, und in u liberul spirit have disorimina'od iu favor of largo and useful branches of our manufactures, not by raising tbo rato of duty upou tho importation of similar articlos from abroad, but what Is tho tamo In effuct, by admitting artiolei I'i'co of duty which outer into the composition of their fubrics. Under tho piosout system it hut boon often remarked tbat thit incidental pro tection decreases when the manufacturer needs it most, and increases when ho needs it least, and constitutes u sliding tualu whioh always operates against him. Tho revenues of t ho country aro subject to similar fluctu ation. Instead of uppruacbing a steady standard, as would bo tho cudo under a svstom of spocifio duties, (hey sink and rise with the siuking and rising prices of articlos in foreign countries. U would not be difficult lor Congress to arrungo a tyttoin Ol specific duties which would afford additional stability both to revenue aud our manufac tures, and without injury or injustice to any interest ot the country, ims inigut bo ac complished br ascertaining tho avorogo valuu of any given nrticlo for a series of years at tho place of exportation, and by simply convorting the rate of nd valorem duty upon It which might be deemed neces sary lor rovonue purposes iuto tbe form of a speoifio duty, bucli an arrangement could not injure tho consumer. If he should pay a groator aiuouul of duty one yoar, this would be counterbalanced by a lessor amount the next, and In tbo end the aggregato would be the same. I desire to call your immediate attention to the prosont condition of tbo Treasury, to ably and eloarly presented by the (secretary in his report to Congress, and to recommend that measurot bo promptly adopted to en able it to ditcharge lit pressing obligationt. Tbe other reoommondntiont of the report are woll worthy of your favorablo consideration.

It is probable that Soulh Carolina, by her delegates in Convention assumblod, will declaro herself out of tho Union, and that othor Cotton States. may folio suit ; but no Stato can thus, of her own froo will, absolve hersolf from her Con stitutional obligations, and, until the rx porimciit shall hara beon tried and found successful, we shall enntinuo to regard all talk ubout it at "Idlo, Mr. R.iso to tho con trary notwithstanding.

Our Qoorgia friend is evldontly bottor versed in military tactics than tho political history of tho country. Ilia assortion that ''tho South Imported no slaves, aod were tho first to provont it," it tho exact reverse of tho truth. It is notorious thut the clause in tho original draft nf the Declaration ot Independence, roprobaling tho African Slave Trado, was stricken out in conplianco with tho wishot of South Carolina and Qoor gia, and that, in tho Convention whioh framed the Federal Constitution, these two Firo-eating Statos insisted on a continuance of that accursed Ira (Do as tho condition of tbuir taking part in tho Union.

Wo would not palliato the conduct of thoso Northern villaini who, for Southern gold, engage in tint piratical commerso but It it upon just such men that tho friondt of a Southern Confederacy will have to rely to effect their purposes.
