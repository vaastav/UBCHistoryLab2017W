4 ABILENE WEEKLY REFLECTOR, ABILENE, KANSAS, DECEMBER 10, 1896.-TWELVE PAGES. NATIONAL AFFAIRS, President Cleveland Sends His Message to OonifreBS. OUR FOREIGN RELATIONS REVIEWED. The Work of the Several Departments of the Uovernment Snmmurlzpd and Recom mendations Made The financial Question Trusts Washington, Dec. 7. The Fifty Fourth congress assera Med for the short session at noon to-day and noon after committees from the bouse and senate waited on the president and In formed him that they were ready to receive any communication he mi 'ht have to make and the president then sent the following communication: To the Congress of the United States: Ai representatives of the people in the legis lative branch of their government you have as sembled st a time when tbe strength and ex cellence of our free Institutions and the fitness of our citizens to enjoy popular rule have been again made manifest. A political contest In volving momentous consequences, fraught with feverish apprehension and creating ag gressiveness so Intense as to approach bitter ness and passion, has been waged throughout our land and determined by the decree of free and Independent suffrage, without disturbance of our tranquility or tbe least sign of weakness In our national structure. When we consider these lncldonts and contemplate the peaceful obedience and manly submission which have succeeded a heated clash of political opinions we discover abundant evidence of a determi nation on the part of our countrymen to abide by every verdict of the popular will and to be controlled at all times by an abiding faith la the agencies established for tbe direction of the affutrB of their government Thus our peo ple exhibit a patriotic disposition which en titles thorn to demand of those who undertake to make and oxecute their laws such faithful and unselfish service In their behalf as can only be prompted by a serious appreciation of tbe trust and confidence which the acceptance ' of public duty invites. In obedlonoo to a con stitutional requirement. I heroin submit to tbe congress certain Information concerning na tional affairs, with the suggestion of such leg islation ns In my judgment Is necessary and expedient. To secure brevity and avoid tlro Bome narration, I ahull omit many details con cerning matters within federal control which, though by no means unimportant, are more profitably discussed In departmental reports. I shnll also curtail this communication by omitting minute recital of many minor Inci dents connected with our foreign relations which have hlthorto found a place in executive messages, but are now contained in a report of tbe secretary of stute, which Is horowith sub mitted. The Armenian Question. At the outset of a reference to more impor tant mutters affecting our relations with foreign powers It would afford mo satisfaction if I could assure iho congress that the disturbed condition of Asiutlo Turkey had during the pustyear assumed a loss hideous and bloody aspect and that either as a cm- q notice of the awakening of the Turkish government to the demand b of human civilisation, or an the re sult of decisive notion on the part of the groat nations having the right by treaty to Interfere for the protection of those exposed to the rage of more bigotry and cruel fanaticism, the shocking foaiurcs of the situation had boon mitigated. Instead, however, or welcoming a softening deposition or protective interven tion, we have been afflicted by continued and not unfrequent reports of the wanton dost, ruc tion of home and the hloody butchery of men, womon and children, made martyrs to their profession of Christian faith. While none of Dur citizens In Turkey have thus far been killed or wounded, though often in the midst of dreadful see huh of danger, their safety in the future Is by no moans assured. Our gov ernment at home and our minister at Constan tinople have lurt nothing undone to protect our missionaries In Ottoman territory, who oonstl' tute nearly all the Individuals residing there who have a right to olalm our protection on the score of American oitijionHhlp. Several naval vessels uro stationed In the Med iterranean as a measure of caution and to fur nish all possible relief and refuge In case of emergency. We have made olulms against the Turkish government for the pillage and de struction of missionary property at Hurpool md Mamsli during uprisings at those pianos. The Insurrection In Culm, The Insurrection in Cuba still continues with 111 Its perplexities. It is difficult to perceive that any progress has thus fur been made to wards the pacification of the island or that the situation of affairs as depicted in my last an nual message has In the least Improved, If Spain still holds Havana and the seaports and ill considerable towns, the Insurgents still roam at will over at least two-thirds of the In land country, If the determination of Spain to put down the insurrection seems but to strengthen with the lapse of time and Is evidenced by hor unhesitating devotion of largely increased military and naval forces to thu task. hAin i wn , "u. sou to buiicve that the insurgents have gained In polrt of numbers, and character, and resuurce-t, and are uono the less inflexible In their resolve tint to succumb, without practi cally securing the great project for which they took up arms, If Hpain has not yet re-established her authority, neither have the Insur gents yet msdo good their title to be regarded as an Independent state. Indeed, as the con test has gone on, the pro tense that civil gov ernment exists on the island, except so far as fcpnln Is abl to maintain It, ha hwn or.iotl 4ally abandoned, Spain does kf p on foot such a government, more or less Imperfectly, In the targe towns and their Immediate suburbs. Hut, that exception being made, the entire country is either given over to an archy i or is subject to the mili tary occupation of one or the other party. It is reported, indeed, on reliable au tuority that, at the demand of the commander-in-chief of tho insurgent army, the putative Cuban government has now given up all at tempt to exercise its functions, leaving that government confessedly (what there is the best mason for supposing It always to have been In fact) a government merely on paper. Were the Spanish armies able to meet their antagonists In the open, or In pitched battle, prompt and decisive results might be looked for and the immense superiority of the Spanish forces In numbers, discipline and equipment, could hardly (ail to tell greatly to their advantage. But they are called upon to face a foe that shuns general engagements, that can choose and docs choose its own ground, that from tbe nature of the country li visible or Invisible at pleasure and that fights only from ambuscade and when all the advantages of position and numborsare on Its side. In ft country where all that is indispensable to life in the way of food, clothing and shelter is so easily obtain able especially by those born and bred on the soil it Is obvious that there is h unity a limit to the time during which hostilities of this sort may be prolonged. Meanwhile, as In all canes of protracted civil strife, the pas sions of the combatants grow more and more Inflamed and excesses on both sides become more frequent and more deplorable. They also are participated in by bands of marauders, who now in the name of one party and now In the name of the other as may best suit tbe occasion, harry the couutry at will and plunder its wreu-hed inhabitants for their own odvanluge. Such a condition of things would inevitably entail Immense detraction of property even if It were ihs policy of both parties to prevent it as fur as practicable. But while such seemed to be the original policy of the Spanish government, It bus now apparent ly abandoned it. and Parting upon the same theory as tbe insurgents, namely, that the ex igencies of the contest require the wholesale annihilation of property, that it may not prove of use and advantage to the enemy. It I to the same end that In pursuance of fen irai orders. Spanish gmdw us ate now being withdrawn from plantation and tbe rural pop ulation required to concentrate lutelf ta tbe towns. The sure result would seem to be that the industrial value of tbe island la fait di minishing and unless there la a speedy and radical change in existing conditions, It will soon disappear altogether. That value con sists very largely, of course, la its capacity to produce sugars, a capacity already much re duced by the Interruption to tillage, which have taken place during tho last two years. It is reliably asserted that should tbete In terruptions continue during the currant year, and practically extend, as It Is now threat ened, to the entire sugar producing territory of tbe is 'and, no much time and so much money will be required to restore the land to its normal productiveness that It Is extremly doubtful If capital can be Induoed to even make the attempt. The spectacle of the utter ruin of an adjoining country, by nature one of the most fertile and charming on the globe woul i engage the serious attention of the gov ernment and people of the United States under any circumstances. In point of fact, they have a concern with It which Is by no means of a wholly sentimental or phllamhroplo character. It lies so near to as as to be hardly separated from our territory. Our actual pecuniary interest in It is seoond only to that of the people and government of Spain, It it reasonably estimated that at least from W,Qto,i)Qo to )0,0 0,000 of American cap ital are invested In plantations and In railroad, mining and other buslnesi enterprises on the island, The volume of trade between tbe United States and Cuba, which In 1889 amount ed to about $04,000,000, rose in 1808 to about 10,u: 0,000, and la 1894, the year before the In surrection broke out, amounted to nearly W, 0Oi,0 o. Besides this large pecuniary stake In the fortunes of Cuba, the United States finds Itself Inextricably involved in the present con test in other wave, botb vexatious and costly. Many Cubans reside in this country and directly promote the Insurrection through the press by public meetings, by the purchase and shipment of arms, by tbe raising of funds and by other means which tho spirit of our institutions and the tenor of our laws do not permit to be made tbe subject of criminal prosecution. Some of them, though OubanB at heart and In all their feelings In Interests, have taken out papers as naturalized citizens of the United states, a proceeding resorted to with a view to possible protection hy this government and not unnatu rally regarded with much Indignation by the country of their origin. These inevitable entanglements of the United States with tbo rebellion in Cuba, the large American property interests affected 1 and considerations of philanthropy and hu manity In general have led to a vehement de mand In various quarters for some sort of pos itive Intervention on the pt.'t of the United States. It was at first proposed that belliger ent rights should bo accorded to tbe Insur gents -a proposition no longer urged because untimely and in practical operation clearly perilous and lnjurlons to our own interest", It has since been and Is now sometimes contended that the Independence of tho insurgents should recognized. But imperfect and restricted as the Spanish government nf the island may be, no other exists there, unloss the will of the mllltury officer In temporary command of a particular district can bo dignified specie of government, It is now suggested that the United States should buy tbe island, a suggestion possibly worthy of consideration if there were uny evidence of a desire or willingness on the part of Spain to en tertain such a proposal lb is urged, finally, that all other methods falling, tbe existing In ternecine strife In Cuba should be terminated by our Intervention, even at the cost of war between the United StateBand Spain, a war which its advocates confidently propheoy could be neitherlarge in Its proportions nor doubtful in its issue. Tho correctness of this forecast need be either affirmod nor denied. The United states aas nevortneiess toe onaracter to main tain as u nation, which plainly dictates that right and might should be tbe rule of its con duct It would seem that If Spain should offer to Cuba genuine autonomy, a measure of home rule which. while preserving the sovereignty of Spain would satisfy all rational requirements of her Spanish subjects, there hhould be no just reason why the pacification of the Island might not be b flouted on that ha 4s. It was in timated by this government to the government of .Spain some months ago tint if a satisfac tory measure of home rule were tendered the Cubiin Insurgents and would be ac cepted by them upon a guaranty of Its execution tho United States would en deavor to tlnd a way not objection able to Snain of furnishing such guaranty. It should be added that it cannot bo reasonably assumed that the hitherto expectant attitude of the United Ma ton will be indefinitely main tained. While we are anxious to a cord all due respect to the sovereignty or Spain, we cannot view the pending conflict In all its features, and properly apprehend our inevltt bio relations to It and Its pohmIijIo results with out considering that by the course of events wc may be drawn into such an unusual and unprecedented con Ution as will tlx a limit to our patient waiting for Spain to end the ootitost, either ulone and In her own way, or with our friendly co-operation When the Inability of Spain to deal success fully with the insurrection has become mani fest, and It Is demonstrated thai her sover eignty is extinct In Cuba for all purposes of Its rightful existence, and when a hopeless strug gle for Its re-establlshmoht has degenerated into a strife which means nothing more than the useless Baorlfloo of human life and then utter destruction of the very subject matter of the con filet, a situation will be presented in which our obligations to the sovereignty of Spain will be superseded by higher obligations which wo can hardly hesitate to recognize and discharge, The Venezuelan Hotmriary Question, The Venezuelan boundnry question has ceased to he a matter of difference between Great Britain and tho United Slates, their re spective governments having agreed upon the substantial provisions or a treaty between Great Britain and Venezuela submitting the wholo controversy to arbitration. The provi sions of the treaty are so eminently just and fair that the assent of Venezuolft thereto may confidently be anticipated. Government Revenues and Expenses, The secretary of the treasury reports that during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1896, the receipts of the government from all sources amounted to 419,17.1,4 KM During the same period 'Its expenditures were 4fH.687,6i4.48 The excess of expenditures over receipts thus amounted to l!5,:(H.,!8i,7a The ordinary ex penditures during the year were t4,0KB!HMl lm than during the preceding fiscal year. Of the reoelnts montloned there were derived from customs the sum of i(V),wi,7,i,rir, and from internal revenue, $140 830,615.66, The re ceipts from customs show an Increase of 803,131.2a over those from the same source for the tiscul year ended Juno 30, 1895, and the re ceipts from Internal tovenue an increase of 41.

The War Department. The report of the secretary of war exhibits satisfactory conditions tn tbe several branches of the public service Intrusted to Discharge. Tbe limit of our artillery force as fixed by law is constantly and readily maintained. The present discipline and morals of the army are excellent and marked progress and efficiency are apparent throughout Its entire organiza tion. With the exeeptlon of delicate duties in the suppression of slight Indian disturbances along our southwestern boundary In which the Mexican troops co-operated and tbe compul sory, but peaceful return with the consent of Great Britain of a band of Cree Indians from Montana to the British possessions, no active operation have been required of the army dur ing the past year. The organized militia numbers 112,8 men. The appropriations for Its support by the sev eral states approximate ?,80,0tt annually and MW.U00 is contributed by tbe general govern ment. Investigation shows these troops to be unusually well drilled and inspired wit much military interest, a in many Instances they are so deficient In proper arms and equipment that a sudden call to active duty would find them inadequately prepared for field service. I therefore recommend that prompt measures be taken to remedy this condition and that very encouragement be given to this deserv ing body of unpaid and voluntary citizen sol diers upon whose assistance we must largely rely In time of trouble. During the past year rapid progress has been made toward the completion of the scheme adopted for the erection and armament of for tifications along our sea coast, while equal progress has been made In providing tho mate rinl for submarine defense in connection with these works, This Improved situation is largely due to tho recent gouerous ro iponse of congress lo the recommendations of the war department. Thettorney-General's Dequrtinenti xiie utuiriiey-generai presents a ae tailed and interesting statement of the important work done under his supervision during the last fiscal year. The ownership and management by the government of penitentiaries for the confinement of the oonvlcted in tbe United States oourts of violations of federal laws, which for many years has been a Bubjeot of executive recommendation, has at last to a slight extent been realized hy the utiliza tion of the abandoned military prison at Fort Leavenworth as a United States penitentiary. ThtB is certainly a movement In the right di rection; but It ought to be at once supple mented by the rebuilding or extensive enlarge ment of this improvised prison and the con struction of at least one more, to be located In the southern states. The capacity of the Leavenworth penitentiary is so limited that the expense of Its maintenance, calculated at a per capita rate upon the number of prisoners it cun accommodate does not make as econom ical an exhibit as it would if it were larger and better adapted to prison purposes: but I am thoroughly con vinced that economy, humanity add a proper sense of responsibility and duty toward those whom wefjunlsh for violation of federal law dictate that the federal government have the entire control and management of the peniten tiaries where convicted violators are oonfined. It appears that since the transfer of the Fort Leavenworth military prison to Its new uses the work previously done by the prisoners con fined there, and for which expensive machin ery has been provided, has been discontinued. This work oonslsted of tho manufacture of articles for army use, now done elsewhere. On all grounds It Is exceeding y desirable that the convicts confined In thts penitentiary be al lowed to resume work of tbls description, The Post Omee Department. Our post offloe department Is in good condi tion and the exhibit made of its operations during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1H03, If allowance Is made for Imperfections In the laws applicable to it, is very satisfactory, The total receipts during the year wore SH 

MW.SOU. 40. The total expenditures were M'.'6,20fl.84, ex clusive of i,.iM,W8 a7, which was-earned by the Pacific railroad for transportation and credit on their debt to the government, There was an increase of receipts over the previous year of ffi.nlOSi.'il, or 7.1 per cont, and an increase of expenditures of ii,H3 ',lM.0!, or 4. i;t per oent. The deficit was tl.u7u.Hi6. 19 less than that of the preceding year. The chief expenditures of the postal service are regulated by law and are not In oontrol of the postmaster-general, All that he can accomplish by the most watch ful administration and economy Is to enforce prompt and thorough collection and account ing for publlo moneys and such uiinof savings In small expenditures and In letting those con tracts for post office supplies and star service which are not regulated by statute. The average revenue from each pound of first-class matter was 93 cents. From each pound of second -elans, mills (of the second Dlass W.a-tt.Q; was county free matter), From each pound of third-class, 13,1 cents. From each pound of fourth-class. l.6 cents The growth in weight of second-clans matter has been from wu,u ,u xj pounds in ism to ais.uuo,- m In I89, and to almost 3i9,t)o0,i)0i) in 1890, and it is quite evident this in creasing drawback Is far outstripping any possible growth of postal revenues. Our mall service should, of course, bo suoh as to meet the wants and eveti the conven iences of the people, at a direct charge upon them so light as perhaps to exclude the idea of our post offloe department bolng a money making oonocrn. but in the face of constantly recurring defioienoies In its revenue, and In view of the fact that we supply the best mull serv ice in the world, it seems to me it is quite time to correct the abuses that swell enor mously our annual deficit- It w? concede the publlo policy of carrying weekly newspapers free in the county of publication and even the policy of carrying at less than one-tetnh of their cost other bona fide newspapers and periodicals, there can bo no excuse for subjecting the serv loe to the further immense and increasing loss Involved In carrying at the nominal rate of one cent a pound the serial libraries, sometimes Including trashy and even harmful literature and other matter, wbioh under the loose inter pretation of a loose statute has been gradually liven seoond-olass rates, thus absorbing all profitable returns derived from first-class matter, which pays three or four times more than Its cost, and producing a large annual toss to be paid by general taxation, Experience and observation have demon strated that certain Improvements In the or ganization of the post office department must be served before we can gain the full benefit of the immense sums expended in its administra tion This Involves the following reforms, which I earnestly recommend: There should be a small addition to the existing inspector service, to be employed in the supervision of the carrier force, which now numbers 18.000 mon and performs its service practically without the surveillance exercised over all other branches of the postal or public service There should also be appointed a few Inspect ors who would assist the central offloe in nec essary Investigation concerning matters of post office leases, post office sites, allowance for rent, fuel and lights, and In organizing and securing the best results from the work of the 14,' 0) clerks now employed In first and second- class offices The Navy Department. The work of the navy department and its present ootid I Hons are fully exhibited in the I report of tbe secretary The conatructloa o' vessels for our navy has been energetically prosecuted by the uresetit odmtn In t ration upon the general lines previously adopted, the de partment having seen no necessity for radical changes in prior methods under which tbe work was found to be progressing in a manner highly satisfactory. It has bee a decided, however, to provide In every ship building con tract that the builder should pay all trial ex penses, and it has also been determined to pay no 8pf;3d premiums in futur contracts. On March 4, 1898, there were In commission but two armored vessels, tbe double-tur rated monitors Miantonomoh and Monterey. Since that date, of vessel theretofore authorised, there have been placed in their first commis sion three first-class and two second-class bat tleships, two armored crulBcrs, one harbor de fense ram and five double-turreted monitors, inoludlug Maine and Puritan, juit oomplete 1. Eight new unarmored cruisers and two new gunboats have also been commissioned The Iowa, another battleship, will be completed about March I, and at least four more gunboats will be ready for sea in tbe early spring. The war college has developed into an Insti tution which it is believed will be of great value to the navy In teaching the science of war, as well as la stimulating professional zeal in the navy, and It will be enpeolally use ful in the devising of plana for tho utilization. In case of necessity, of all the naval resources of the United States, Tbe naval militia, which was authorized a few years ago, as an experiment, has now de veloped Into a body of enterprising young men, active and energetic In; the discharge of their duties and promising great usefulness. Tbls establishment has nearly the same relation to our navy as the national guard in the differ ent states bears to our army, and constitutes a aource of supply to our naval forces, the im portance of which Is Immediately apparent The Interior Department. The report of the secretary of the interior presents a comprehensive and Interesting ex hibit of the numerous and Important affairs commltte:t to his supervision It is impossible In this communication to do more than briefly refer to a few of the subjeots concerning which the secretary gives full and Instructive Infor mation Our public lands, originally amount ing to JW,uoof000 aores have been so reduced that only about 0OO,iOO,iO aores still remain in government control, exoluding Alaska Tbe balance, being by far the most valuable por tion, niB ooea given away to sut tiers, to new State i and to railroads, or sold at a compara tively nominal sum. The total Indian population of the United States is i:;.'J3, according to a census mude In IH9a, exclusive of those within the state of New Vork and those comprising the five civilized tribes. Of this number there are approxi mately 8,i)0i) children of school age. During the year MM of these were enrolled in schools. The progress which has attended re cent efforts to extend Indian school facilities and the anticipation of continued liberal ap-. praprlations to that end, cannot fail to afford the utmost satisfaction to those who believe that the education of - In dian children is a prime factor in the accomplishment of Indian civilization. The condition of affairs among the five civilized tribes, who oocupy large traots of land in the Indian territory and who have governments of their own, has assumed such an aspect as to render it almost indispensable that there should be an entire ohange in the relations of these Indian to the general government. This seems to be necessary in furtherance of their own interests as well as for the protection of non-Indian residents in their territory. A commission organized and empowered under several recent laws is now negotiating with these Indians for the relinquishment of their oourtB and tbe division of their common lands In severalty. The reception of their first proffers of nego tiation was not encouraging, but through pa tience and such conduct on their part as dem onstrated that their Intentions were friendly and in the Interest of tho best prospect of suc cess has become more promising. The efforts should be to save the Indians from the conse quences of their own mistakes and Improvi dence and to secure to the real Indian his rights as against intruders and professed blends who profit by his retogresslon. Asa sincere friend of the Indian I am ex ceedingly anxious that these reforms should be accomplished with the consent and aid of the tribes and that no necessity may be pre sented for radical or drastic legislation. I hope, therefore, that the commission now con ducting negotiations will soon bo able to report that progress has been made toward a friendly adjustment of existing difficulties. It appears that a very valuablo deposit of gilgooito or asphaltum has been found on the reservation In Utah occupied bytheUnoom pahgre Ute Indians. Every consideration of oare for the public Interest and every sensible business reason dictate such management or disposal of tbls Important source of public revenue as will except It from the general rules und incidents attending the ordinary dis position of public lands, and secure to the gov ernment a fair share at least of its advantages In place of Its transfer for a nominal sum to Interested individuals. I indorse the recommendation made by the present secretary of the Interior, as well as his predecessor, that a permanent commission, consisting of three members, one of whom shall be an army officer, be oreuted to perform the duties now devolving upon the commis sioner and assistant commissioner of Indian affairs. The management of the bureau in volves such numerous diversities and the advantages of an uninterrupted policy are so apparent that I hope the change suggested will meet the approval of tbe congress. The Pension Roll. The diminution of our enormous pension roll and the decrease of pension expenditures which have been bo often foretold still fail In material realization. The number of pension ers on the rolls at the close of the fiscal year ended June 8), 1895, was 970,678. This Is the largest number ever reported. The amonnt paid exclusively for pensions during the year was 1138,214,761.91, a slight decrease from that of the preceding year, while the total expend itures on aooount of pensions, including the cost of malntalnence of the department and expenses attending pension distribution amounted to tll,'M. n0..i9, or within a very small fraction of one-third of the entire ex pense of supnortlng the government during the same year. The number of new pension certifi cates Issued was, 90.610. Of these 40,374 repre sent original allowances of claims and 16,878 increases of existing pensions. The number of persons receiving pensions from the United States, but residing lu foreign countries at the olose of the last fiscal year was 8,781, and the amount paid to them during the year was $582,735.38. The sum appropriated for the pay ment of pensions for the current fiscal year, ending June 30, 1897, la tHO.Oio.OM, and for the succeeding year It Is estimated that the same amount will be necessary. The commissioner of pensions reports that during the last fiscal year 339 indictments were found against violators of the pension lawa Upon these Indictments 67convlotlons resulted In my opinion, based upon such Btatements as these and much other informa tion and observations, the abuses which have been allowed to oreep Into our pension system have done incalculable harm In demoralizing our people and undermining good citizenship. I have endeavored within my sphere of official duty to protect our pension roll and make it what It should be, a roll of honor, containing the names of those disabled In their country's service and worthy of their country's affection and remembrance. The Pacific Railroads. The secretary oalls attention to the publlo Interests Involved in an adjustment of the ob ligations of the Pacific railroads to the govern ment I deem it to be an Important duty to es pecially present this subject to the consider ation of the congress. On January II, 1897, with tbe amount already matured, more than 113.000,000 of the principal of tbe subsidiary bond issued by the United States In aid of the construction of the Union Pacific railway, in eluding its Kansas line, and more than 16,000, Ouu of like bonds, Issued In aid of the Central Pacific railroad, Including those issued to the Wostern Pacific Railway Co., will have fallen due and been paid or must on that day be paid by the government With out any reference to the application of the sinking funds now In the treasury this will create aucb a default on the part of the companies to the government as will give It the right to at once institute proceedings to foreclose its mortgage Ilea In addition to this indebtedness which will be due January 1, 197. there will mature be twee a that date aad January 1. 1S99, the remaining principal of snob subsidy bonds which must also be met by the government These amount to more than mooo.OOU on account of the Union Pacific lines and exoeeds Kl.OJO.OOJ on account of the Central Pacific lines. The Agricultural Department. The department of agriculture is so inti mately related to t he welfare of our people and the prosperity of our nation that It hhould con stantly receive the care and encouragement of the government The secretary reports that the value of our exports of farm products dur ing the last fiscal year amounted to I Taooo.000. an increase of 117,000,000 over those of the year immediately preceding This statement Is not tbe less welcome be eause of tbe fact that notwithstanding such in crease, tbe proportion of exported agricultural products to our total exports of all description fell off during the year. Tbe benefits of an in crease In agricultural products being assured, the decrease In Its proportion to our total ex ports is more gratifying when we consider that tt Is coming to tbe fact that such total exports for the year Increased more than rf v'O.1 M The large and increasing exportation of onr agricultural products suggests tbe great use fulness of the organization lately established In tbe department for the purpose of getting to those engaged in tbe farming pursuits re liable Information concerning the condition, needs and advantages of different foreign markets, Inasmuch as the success of tbe farmer depends upon the advantageous sale of his products, and tnusmucb as foreign mar nets muit large jy oe tne destination or sucn products, It Is quite apparent that i knowledge of tbe conditions and wants ,that affect these markets ought to result in sowing more intelligently and reap ing with a better promise of profit. Such Information points out the way to a pru dent foresight in the selection and cultiva tion of crops and to a release from the bond age of unreasoning monotomy of protection, a glutted and depressed market and constantly recurring unprofitable toil. In my opinion tbe gratuitous distribution of seeds by the depart ment as at present conducted ought to be discontinued. Civil Service Reform. The progress made in civil service reform furnishes a cause for the utmost congratula tion. It has survived the doubts of its friends as well aB the rancor of its enemies, and has gained a permanent plaoe among the agencies destined to cleanse our politics and improve, economize and elevate the publlo service. There are now in the competitive olaBslfied service upwards of 81.00) places, More than half of these have been Included from time to time since March 4, 1893. A most radical and sweeping extension was made by executive order dated the 6th day of May, 1896, and If fourth-class postnmterships are not in cluded In the statement it may be said that practically all positions contemplated by the civil service law are nowclasslfied. Abundant reasons exist for Including these postmaster ships, based upon economy. Improved service and the peace and quiet of neighborhoods. If, however, obstacles prevent such aotlon at present, I earnestly hope that congress will, without increasing post office appropriations, so adjust them as to permit in proper cases of a consolidation of these post officeB to the end that through this process ihe result desired may to a limited extent be accomplished. The civil service rules as amended during the last year provide for a sensible and uni form method of promotion, basing eligibility to better positions upon demonstrated effi ciency and faithfulness. The absence of fixed rules on this subject has been an Infirmity In the system more and more apparent; its other benefits have been better appreciated. The advantages of civil service methods in their business aspects are too well understood to re quire argument Their application has be come a necessity to the executive work of the government But those who gain through the operation of these methods should be made to understand that tbe non-partisan scheme through which they receive their appointments de mands from them, by way of reciprocity non partisan and faithful performance of duties under every administration, and cheerful fidel ity to every chief. While they should been-.. oouraged to decently exercise their rights of citizenship and to support through their suf frage the political belief they honestly pro fess, the noisy, pestilent and partisan em ploye, who loves political turmoil and conten tion, or who renders lax and grudging service to an administration not rep resenting his political views, should be promptly and fearlessly deult with in such a way as to furnish a wirningto others who may be likewise dispose 1 The annual report of the commissioners will be-duly trans mitted and' I crmmmeiKi the important matter ih :y have in ch urge to the careful considera tion of congress f The Tariff. I desire to recur to tho statements else where made concerning the government re ceipts and expenditures for the turpose of venturing upon some nuggestlons touching our present tariff law and Its operations, This statute took effect on the :8th day of August, 1H91. Whatever may be its shortcomings as a comptete measure of tariff reform, it must be conceded that it has opened up the way to a freer and greater ex change of commodities between us and other countries and thus furnished a wider mar tet for our products and manufactures. Tho only entire fiscal year during which this law has been In force ended on tbe 30th day of June, 1896. In that yeur our Imports increased over those of the previous year more than IH,500,ujo while the value of tho domestic prod ucts exported and which found mar kets abroad was nearly '70,0 0,'MI more than during the preceding year. Those who insist that tho cost to our people of articles coming to them from abroad for their needful use should only be Increased through tariff changes to an extent necessary to meet the expenses of the government, as well as those who claim that tariff changes may be laid upon Ruch articles beyond the necessities of government revenue, and witn the additional purpose of bo increasing tbelr price in our markets as to give American manufacturers and producers . better and more profitable opportunities, must agree that our tariff laws are only primarily justified as sources of revenue to enable the government to meet the necessary exp'n-fe of its malntenonce. Con sidered as to Its sufficiency in this aspect the present law can by no means fall under just condemnation. During the only complete fis cal year of Its operation it has yielded nearly 18.000.0(10 more revenue than was received from tariff duties in the preceding year, There was nevertheless a deficit between our receipts and expenditures of a little more than fciS.uOO, 900 This, however, was not unexpected. The situation was suoh in December last, seven months before the close of the fiscal year, that the secretary of the treasury fore told a deficiency of 17.000,000. The great and increasing apprehension and timidity in busi ness circles and the depression in all activities Intervening since that time, resulting from causes perfectly well understood and entirely disconnected with our tariff law or operation, seriously checked the imports we would have otherwise reoeived and readily account for the difference between this estimate of the secre tary and the actual deficiency as well as for a continued deficit. I believe our present tariff law, if allowed a fair opportunity, will in the near future yield a revenue which, with reasonably economical expenditures, will overcome all difficulties. In the meantime no deficit that has occurred or may ocjur need excite or disturb u. To meet such deficit we have in the treasury, in addition to a gold reserve of $ lOO.uO J.ooo, a surplus of more than 4128,000,0.10 applicable to payment of expenses of the government, and which must, unless expended for that purpose, remain a useless hoard, or, if not extravagantly wasted.must in any event be perverted from the purpose of its exaction from our people, the payment therefore, of any deficiency tn the revenue from this fund is nothing more than Us proper and legitimate use. It is immeasur ably better to appropriate our surplus to the payment of justifiable expenses than to allow tt to become an invitation to reckless appro prlations and extravagant expenditures. I suppose it will not be denied that under tbe present lsv our people obtain the necessaries of a comfortable existence nt a cheaper rate than formerly. This Is a matter of supreme Importance since it la the palpable duty of every just government to make the burdens of taxation as light as possible. The people should not be required to relinquish this privilege of cheaper living except under tbe stress of their government's necessity made plainly manifest Oar Financial HaMio ds. This reference to the condition and pros pects of our revenues naturally suggests a allusion to tbe weakness and vices of our finan cial methods. They have been frequently pressed upon the attention of congress in pre vious executive communications and tbe in evitable danger of tbelr continued toleration pointed out Without now repeating these de tails I cannot refrain from again earnestly presenting the necessity of the prompt reform of a system opposed to every rule of sound finance and shown by experience to be fraught with tbe gravest pert! and perplexity. The 1 terrible civil war which shook the foundations of our government more than 80 years ago brought tn its train the destruction of property, the wasting of country's substances, and the estrangement of bretbern. These are now past and forgotten. Even the distressing loss of ,lfe the conflict entailed Is but a sacred memory, which fosters patriotic sentiment and keeps alive a tender regard lor those who nobly diod, and yet there remains with us to rn y. in full strength and activity as an inci dent of that tremendous struggle, a feature of its tin inclal necessity not onlv unsulted to pi'uttni circumstances, out manuestiy u ais lundug menace to business security and an ever present agent of monetary distress. , Becau e we may be enjoying a temporary re lief from Its depressing influence tblB should not luil us Into a false security nor lead us to forget tbe suddenness of- past visitation. I am more convinced than ever that we cannot have assured financial peace and safety until tho g)vernmeot obligations upon which gold may be demanded from the treasury are with drawn from circulation and collected. This might be done, as has been heretofore recom mended, by their exchange for long term bonds bearing a low rate of 1 mere t, or by their re demption with the proceeds of such bonds. Even if only the United Stiles notes known as greenbacks were thus retired, it is probuble thuttho treasury notes issued in payment of silver purchases under the act of July 14, 1890, now paid In gold when de landed, would not oreate much dUurbanoe, as they might from time to time, when received in the trea sury by redemption in gold or otherwiso be gradually and prudently replaced by silver coin. This plan of Issuing bonds for the purpose of redemption certainly appears to be the most effective and dlreot path to the needed reform. In default of this, however, it would be a step) "in the right direction if currency obligations are redeemable in gold whenever so redeemed should be cancelled instead of being reissued. This operation would be a slow remedy, but it would Improve present conditions. National banks should redeem tbelr own notes. They should be allowed to issue circu lation to the par value of bonds deposited as security for Its redemption and the tax on their circulation should be reduced to one fourth of one percent In considering projects for the retirement of United States notes and treasury notes Issued under the new law of 189U I am of the opinion we have placed too much stress upon the dan ger of contracting tbe currency and have cal culated too little upon the gold that would be added to our circulation If Invited to us by bet ter and safer financial methods. It is not so much contraction of our ourrenoy that should be avoided as its unequal distribution. This might be obviated and fear of harmful con traction at the same time removed by allowing the organization of smutl banks and in less populous communities than are now permitted and author, zing existing banks to establish branches In small communities under proper restrictions. The entire case may be presented by the statement that tho day of sensible and sound financial methohs will not dawn upon m uutil our gpvernment abandons the banking busi ness and the accumulation of funds, and con fines Its monetary operations to tbe receipts of money contributed by the people for Its support, and to the expenditure of suoh money for the people's benefit. Our business Inter ests and all good citizens long for rest from feverish agitation und the inauguration by Sjie government of a reformed financial policy which. will encourage enterprise and make certain the rewards of labor and Industry. Trusts and Monopolies, Another topic tn which our people rightfully take a deep Interest may bo here briefly con sidered. I refer to the expense of trusts and other huge aggregations of capital, the object of which Is to secure the monopoly of some particular branch of trade, Industry, or c om merce and to stifle wholesome competition, When these ure defended it is usually 011 the ground that though they increase profits they also reduce prices and th us mav benefit the public. It must be remomoered. however, that a reduotlon of prices to the people is not one of the real objects ot theso organizations, nor is their tendency necessarily In that direction. If it occurs 1 n a particular case it is only because it accords with the purposes or interests of those managing them. Suoh occasional results fall short of compen sating the palpable evils charged to the ac count of trusts and monopolies. Thoir ten dency is to crush out Individual independence and to hinder and to prevent the free use of human faculties and the full development of human character. Tnrough them tho farmer, the artisan and the small trader is In danger of dlslodgement from the proud position of be ing his own master, watchful of all that touches bis country's prosperity, in which he has an Individual Interest in all that affocts the advantages of business of which ho is a factor, to be relegated to the level of a mere appurte- ' nnnoe to a great machine, with little free will, with no duty but that of passive obedience and with little hope or opportunity of rising in the scale of responsible and helpful citizenship. to tne instinctive bellet that suoh Is the inevi table trend ot trusts and monopolies is due the wide-spread and deep-seated popular aversion In which they, are held and the not unreasona ble insistanoe that whatever may be their in cidental economic advantages, their general effect upon personal character, prospeots and usefulness can not be otherwise than Inturious. Though congress has attempted to deal with this matter by legislation, the laws passed for that purpose thus far have proved Ineffective, not because of any lack of disposition or at tempt to enforce them but simply because the laws themselves as Interpreted by the courts do not reach the difficulty. If the Insufficien cies of existing laws can be remedied by further legislation it should be done The fact must be recognized, however, that all federal legislation on this subject may fall short of Its purpose because of Inher ent obstacles, and also because of the oomplex character ot our governmental system, which, ' while making the federal authority supreme within Its sphere, has carefully limited that Bphere by meteB and bounds which cannot be transgressed. The decision of our highest court on this precise question renders it quite doubt ful whether the evils of trusts and monopolies can be adequately treated through federal ao tlon unless they seek directly and purposely tc Include in their objects transportation or In tercourse between states or between the United States and foreign countries. It does not follow, however, that this Is the limit of the remedy that may be applied. Even though It may be found that federal au thority la not broad enough to fully reach the case, there can be no doubt of the power ot the several states to sot effectively in tbe prem ises, and there should be no reason to doubt their willingness to judiciously exercise such power. In concluding thts communication its last words shall be an appeal to the congress for tbe most rigid economy In the expenditure of the money It holds in trust for tbe people. The way to perplexing extravagance is easy but a return to frugality Is difficult When, however, it is considered that those who bear the burdens of taxation have nc guaranty of honest oare, save in the fidelity of their public servants, tbe duty of all possible retrenchment Is plainly manifest When out differences are forgotten and onr con tests of political opinion are no longer re membered nothing Id tbe retrospect of out public service wttl be as fortunate and com forting as the recollection of offlcisl duty well performed and the memory of a constant de votion to the interests of our confiding fellow countrymen, Ohovib Ciivelamo.
