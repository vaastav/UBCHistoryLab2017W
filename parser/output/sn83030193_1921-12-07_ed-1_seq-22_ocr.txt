T THE IRISH FREE STATE. Ml: full text : t the agreement signed by tne urn sn an.i insii represeniauve:; uin.iMioi.um ( : plete assurance of Hie stable, enduring foundation of concession, compromise and good will upon winch the Irish Free State cm come into being. VVitli the same constitutional status as Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, the Irish Free State is to be part of the community of na tions known as the British Empire. It will have its own Parliament, make its own laws, establish its Own tariff system. Its obligations toward the British Government in peace or war will be only such as arc recognized in a fair and voluntary contract. The Ulster difliculty is avoided by establishing the Irish Free State first and leaving it to Ulster to de cide whether she will remain a part of it As for the much discussed oath of allegiance, members of the Irish Parliament will swear al legiance to the fYdKlitiitirin of the Irish Free State and to Ik "faithful to His Majesty King George .v. and his heirs and successors by law, in virtue of the common citizenship of Ireland with G.vat Britain and her adherence to and membership of the group of nations forming the British Commonwealth of Nations." In other words, a member of the 'Irish Parliament will pledge his allegiance to the Irish Constitution and his faith to the British King the latter only in virtue of and because of the former. Tims easily is' an "insurmountable obstacle" surmounted. The admirable spirit in which the agreement was fV. finally reached is in no way better shown than in ?. the Irish attitude toward one of the biggest British concessions the right of the Irish Free State to fix its own tariffs. The Dail Uireann delegates are reported to have v. riven assurances that the Irish Free Stale would be 't certain of its own volition to declare for free trade between Ireland and England. The most discordant note so far has been sounded characteristically enough by Lord Carson, the former Ulster, leader. 1t is unbelievable, however, that anything will prevent the Dail Eireann and the British Parliament 'from ratifying the agreement. . The win of a majority of the people on botli sides :of the Irish Sea to say nothing of the opinion of the world should prove a compelling force. ', The longed-for moment has come. A free Irc- iland is assured. THE CANADA ELECTIONS. . . J ESTERDAY'S elections in Canada turned nri- hl marilv on the tariff, issue. Canadian Conservatives have in general supported the same theories of economic philosophy which have been identified with Republicanism this side of the line. The Canadian Liberals arc in general vagreemenl with the tariff principles advocated by -the Democrats in the United Slates. Yesterday the Conservatives and the high pro tection policy in Canada went down to defeat. The Liberals and tariff reform won a decisive victory. Yesterday was a big day for tariff reform. A Republican President of the United States indorsed a "flexible," tariff which is the convenient way out . for the "die-hards" in Republican ranks. .Gradually the world is learning its lesson. Ob struction of trade is economically unsound. Politi cally it fosters ill will and international suspicion. Canada is to be congratulated on learning this lesson -more readily than we of the United States have been tble to acquire it. Bf. t 

MAIN O UrtMC 1J W . KV A rnillTTAl nf IVicVMrvill mannovre nr., rested for violation of the Sunday laws emphasizes the fact that basketball is a game that commands widespread interest. It is becoming popular as a winter sport in flie same way that baseball and football have won favor in summer and autumn. The secret lies in the development of the game itself. A generation ago basketball was a game for young ladies in bloomers, and it was as ladylike as could be desired. It provided mild exercise and little excitement. When high school boys took up the game, rules were relaxed so that it afforded considerable athletic competition, but not much of a man-to-man test. University, athletic club, semi-professional and professional teams have further relaxed the rules against roughness and the display of strength as well as skill. Basketball is now a he-man's game, - and as such it is winning public favor. GIVE IT A NEW LEASE. AGAIN Organized Labor has good cause to be thankful to Samuel Untermyer and the Jjockwood, investigators. Ji. a nasty iscandal - that .has, been .uncovered in the electrical union. Every member should be thankful that it has been exposed. Laxity of book keeping, prima-facie evidence of graft and a wrong ful development of the permit system arc matters that immediately concern every worker in the or ganization. For the public at large it is more significant thai Mr. Untermyer believes he could uncover a milk trust if he had the power. If the people have any thing to say about the matter, the Lockwood Com mittee will get renewed and extended power to make this investigation and perhaps follow up with revelations of 'buses in other lines of lood supply. The 'Lockwood Committee is not an expensive luxury. Thus far it has forced payment of lines in excess of its own expenses, not to-mention the vastly greater savings resulting from its exposures. Give it a new lease of life and extended powers. It is effective and New York needs the help it extends. The Journey's End Cnipjrtr'it. lust. i.Nw Vorti toning Worlll bj Pre I'ab. Co. By John Cassel HINTS TO TRANSLATORS. TTY COMPL1MENTS but yu'vc sot t d a darned sight better than you've done to date or let me do the doing." Stripped of much polite phrase, President Har ding's message to this overwhelmingly Republican Congress boils down to that. Between the lines and in some of them can be read a Presidential warning that certain old Re publican shibboleths must go into prompt retire ment if the country is to have any confidence in the present Congress when elections come round next November. Think of a Republican President suggesting, even with apologies, that a Republican Congress had maylv better quit monkeying with the tariff and give the Chief Executive power, with-the help of the Tariff Commission, to "proclaim duties" to meet special conditions! Think of his adding the reminder: "That wo must not be unmindful ol world conditions, that peoples arc struggling for In dustrial rehabilitation and that wc cannot dwell In industrial and commercial exclusion and At the same tlino do the Just thing In aid ' lug world reconstruction and readjustment." President Harding takes care not to be loo rough with the American valuation plan, but he points to "the danger of such a valuation, brought down to the level of our own production costs, making our tariffs prohibitive." Here again he1 delicately sug gests to Congress the advisability of authorizing "proclaimed American valuation" in Hie interest of flexibility. With similar tact the President points out how much better it will be if Congress not only leaves the funding of the foreign debt to the Treasury Department where it belongs but also keeps its hands off the question of terminating. commercial treaties under the existing shipping law until the executive branch of the Government presents a plan. Later on, when Congress has thought over these things it ought not to do, President Harding prom ises to tell, it more about one of the chief things it can and must do improve on a muddle of a tax law with which the President is known to be as little satisfied as anybody else. With the exception of this promise, a plea for starving Russia and the suggestion of an industrial court which deserves to be discussed by itself, the President's message resolves itself in the main into a sugar-coated hint that Congress might do less harm if it left everything possible to him. Only a little over a year ago Mr. Harding was earnestly assuring the country: "I would not want to bo your President unless you are going to give us a Republican Coneross to translate Republican promises Into legislative enactment." The country gave him the translators. Now the President is fearful of consequences unless they let him do the translating. What was it they called Woodrow Wilson?

Knot T runic Illlilit. nf Wnj, To Ibe 1'dltor cf The Kienlne World: Your remarks as to tho apparent tisclcssncss of trying to expedite foot passenger trafilc by insisting on peo ple keeping to tho right fits In well with my own thoughts. l"or some tlmo I have intended writing on the same subject. My own travelling takes mo over the "V and Hudson Tube, and as a comparatively new resident I have often wondered what tho elevated uromotcrs were thinking of when tliey arranged stairways as at warren Sttcct, so ujiit. people coming and going use the same stairs. The conditions are vllo In tho cxlremo and often lesult In people losing a train. To think of four-foot stairways under such conditions Is farcical. Ah for tho HudHon sub- way, conditions are more or less tho same. Tho stairways aro wider and In some Instances divided; but of what use aro thw if people coming uiid going lmpcdo each other? The corridor leading to the ISric depot (tho latter surely tho limit as a terminal) is as bad or worse, it is divided bv a rooe. tho widest space being given to the ru&li hours crowd. Hut granting tho widest spaco is so arranged, the speed of tho crowd Is governed by tnoso wno. inrough in ability or because they havo amplo time, saunter, oiten two or tnreo abreast, without keeping as near to the right as nosslble. Hprcad out over the entire wiatn ot tho corridor, thebe slow movers block tho way of those who are fHSt walk ers: stnnc even want to run. As a result lots ot people lose their trains simply bccauBO unthinking or selfish Idiots will not givo a clear runway on tho left. It pcoplo us they pass slower moverB would switch over to tho right they would leave room for those who must go raster sun. Isots of tcoplo having little time tako tho roped-off section meant for those bound in tho other dlrec tlon. This Is bad enough, but some of these, although moving faster than others, forget mat some aro anxious to go still faster, and as a result lmnedo this runway also, it seems to mo that half the people using tho trains lack all knowledge of right of way; a campaign to teach thorn IB badly neeuea, ana tuose wno will not tuko heed should be punished bv nomo one n authority. To assume that this sheep-like wandering Is duo to continental train ing is scaieelv correct. I believe In England only is the rulo of the road to tho left, and that applies to ve hicles only. Foot passengers always walk to tho r gilt: really a iirenostiT nut rule, as it brings people on the curb side, with trafilc coming behind them. ,s to London's subways, all save the older District and Metropolitan ar controlled ly elevators. Thoso entering .cannot com Into collision; with thoso leaving. The latt' r must take tho direction shown by tiu signs, or they will never get out. The Dis trict railways have scparato stalr wuys, and any attempt to mount tho hiuiih used by those descending will bo stopped. Iondon may bo sleepy In some things, but when It comes to handling city railway passenger!.. New York Is a long way behind. Indeed, it would appear that efforts are inado to im pede trafilc. The platforms aro full of pillars to block the way and ate rarely of sufficient width. Did tho builders forgot tha't New York was growing? T. A.

No doubt you wero puzzled by tho editor's caption "With a descriptive signature." To enlighten you I will answer your question. They arc not "women traf ilc cops," but the Women Police Ite- t-crves of the City of New York, by act of tin' Legislature of tho State of New York. They serve without pay, with Kodman Wanamakcr in command, as Special Deputy Ccmmls rloner. As Jeff McNutt says: "Thoro is lots of excitement, but can learn nothing." (Apologies to lildo Dud ley). "Ignorant," you can learn a lot con cerning your City Government by buying a copy of tho Charter of tho City of New York. GKOIUllO D. Dec. 2 1921.
