Th|E CHRISTMAS CALL. rOR the celebration of the holidays, The Call will on next Sunday issue its annual Christmas number. It is well known that with each suc ceeding year these editions improve, but this year the improvement will be more notable than ever. The Call of next Sunday will mark the highest attainment of journalism and prove one of the brightest holiday novelties of the year. A portion of the paper will of course be taken up with a review of the condition of our great industries and a forecast of the future that awaits them. In every case these will be written by experts, by men who are identified with the industries they describe, and who, therefore, write of them with the authority acquired from long experience in their management. The moral and the intellectual progress of the State will be given as much attention as the material progress. Two of the most notable articles of the number will treat of the growth and the prospects of our universities. President Kellogg will write of the State University, and President Jordan of Stanford. It is well known that these two Californian seats of learning have brighter prospects than any other uni versities in the Union. This is particularly true of Berkeley, whose projected range of buildings has become the center of interest to the architects of the world, and whose future home promises to be the stateliest ever erected for the uses of education and the advancement of learning. For the joy of the holidays there will be many article? of a light and sparkling character. The num ber will contain stories by such well known and popular writers as Anthony Hope, Bret Harte, Oc tave Thanet, John Strange Winter and Edward Ever ett Hale. These stories are in the best style of their respective authors, and will make the Christmas Call welcome to all who like the fellowship of rousing ro mance. Throughout the number from first to last every fea ture will be attractively illustrated in the best style of modern journalistic art. The pictorial richness of the edition will be, in fact, one of its notable excellences. No branch of newspaper making has advanced so rap idly of recent years as that of illustration, and the Christmas Call, by its half-tones and other styles of pictures, will show what modern art has accom plished in that direction. Finally, that no department of joyous art may be lacking to the number. The Call will contain a Christmas song, distinctively Californian, written by Miss Ina Coolbrith, and set to music by Oscar Weil. We can safely assert that this song, by reason of the beauty of its words and the sweetness of its music, will be one of the permanent contributions made to Christmas minstrelsy this season. By itself alone it will be sufficient to make this edition of The Call wel come into every cultured home and a delight to every artistic mind. TO 

STOP FAKE FIGHTING. TO the subject of "fake fighting" and how to stop it the sporting editors of the land have been de voting considerable space. There is only one way, and it is simple. Every prize-fight is a fake, every prize-fighter a confidence-man. The event and the calling are alike illegal. By stopping fights of every sort no mistake can be made. Then the fighters, their occupations gone, will quickly drift into the channels of life where they can be definitely restrained. Most of them will become vagrants and be easily suppressed. A few of the more courageous will turn highwaymen or bur glars, and in due time be within four walls. Here and there one with some dormant element of decency in him will go to work. There is no room for discussion, since in favor of the prize-ring, with its "Gentleman Jims" and its Simian Sharkeys, its frauds and its skullduggery, there is absolutely not a word to be said. A murderer who had killed four people was recently twice hanged owing to the breaking of the rope. Jus tice was trying to get in its work, although in not causing the rope to break twice more it fell short of perfection. The Salvation Army man who explains that he beat a boy for the purpose of driving the devil out of him seems to have mistaken the location of that devil. It was probably under his own blouse. While the School Directors are figuring out so beautifully that that money is not missing, they would add strength to their contentions by displaying the cash. OUR GREEK TRADE. rOR the fiscal year 1896-97 we imported from Greece as dutiable merchandise books, bicycle cement, chemicals and dyes, clothing, earthen ware, fish, currants, figs, raisins, fruits and nuts, al monds, honey, iron ore, leather, marble, metal, musi cal instruments, olive oil, paper, cheese, seeds, manu factured clothing, laces, soap, brandy and spirits, sponges, manufactures of straw, confectionery, still wines, bottled wines, manufactures of wood, carpets and wools — all to the value of $648,173, of which Zante currants amounted to $574,892, the importation being 28.465,611 pounds. Of non-dutiable goods Greece sent us art works, antiquities, gums, licorice root, mineral water, chemicals, fruits, household effects, ores, manganese, manufactures of zinc, oils and cliff stone, all to the value of $84,529, making a total im port trade from that country to this of $732,702. During the same fiscal year we exported to Greece books, medicines, clocks and watches, manufactures of cotton, fish, glucose, cartridges, hides, firearms, locks and hinges, machinery, stoves, manufactures of iron, ditto of lead, leather, illuminating oil, tallow, vegetables, and manufactures of wood, all amount ing to $109,923, to which add re-export of foreign merchandise amounting to $840, or a total export to Greece of $110,763. Therefore we imported from Greece $621,939 more than we exported to her, leaving that balance against us in the trade. As our principal import was Zante currants, so our principal export was petroleum, amounting to only 1,250,000 gallons, valued at $95,085. In Greece the petroleum importation is a Govern ment monopoly. The tariff on it was 50 drachmas on 100 okes. A drachma is 19.2 cents, or 100 lepta, and an oke is 2.34 pints. A note in the Greek tariff of 1885 says that the petroleum tariff is 50 lepta per oke; the duty, therefore, is 9.6 cents per 2.34 pints, or 32.8 cents per gallon. On our export of 1,250,000 gallons the total duty collected by Greece was $410,000. The duty collected by the United States on the 28,465,611 pounds of currants we imported amounted to $569,312, a gain to us in duties of $159,312. It is obvious from an inspection of these statistics that whatever reciprocal arrangements are made with Greece they will be for the benefit of our largest ex port, petroleum, and of her largest, the Zante cur rants. It further appears that if duty is taken off Zante currants, in such arrangement the interests of Califor nia raisin-growers will be sacrificed to promote those of the petroleum producers. Inasmuch as the petroleum industry is highly or ganized and is highly profitable, is not subject to the accidents which beset horticulture, nor to the varia tions in the market which affect vineyard products, and is an article of necessity and therefore assured al ways of a market, to sacrifice the California raisin for its benefit is a proposition that should meet with the most stubborn resistance. As we have shown, the Zante currant is a raisin made from a grape. Wherever it is admitted to a mar ket it competes with every other kind of raisin. Its disastrous competition, when it was free of duty, is sorrowfully remembered in this State. The record of those years is written in mortgages foreclosed, vine yards abandoned and every form of financial distress that can fall upon a horticultural community. No such necessity, no such misfortune, has ever fallen to the lot of the petroleum monopoly. It has known no competition, no failure of market, no abandonment of its plants. The raisin industry here has struggled from the be ginning. This year it has tasted a degree of pros perity, but nothing more than to sustain and hold it together until another crop is produced. If that crop is to meet free Zantes in the market it will not pay the cost of production. In this emergency the authorities at Washington must weigh the interests of the Standard Oil Com pany against those of the raisin-growers of Califor nia, and if the principles of commercial equity pre vail, there ought to be no doubt of the result. It is not exactly correct to represent that the Zante currant import is competitive with a California cur rant industry. Though there are in Placer County paying vineyards of the Zante vine, and the Thompson seedless grape is a similar fruit, yet the Zante import competes with our raisins of all kinds as a kitchen or cooking fruit. The problem that has been before our raisin men is the use of their product in cookery. Formerly the im ported Valencia and Malaga raisins were a table luxury, used as a dessert, and their use quite re stricted and uncommon. The task of the California raisin planters has been to put their product in the kitchen, for use cooked, as a dried fruit that carries all the wholesome food quality of the grape. In the kitchen it has been met by the dirty Zante currant. The latter has been considered in our tariff legislation since 1816. The tariff of that year put on it a duty of 3 cents a pound; the tariff of 1832 made it free; of 1842, 3 cents a pound; 1846, 40 per cent ad valorem; 1866, 3 cents a pound; 1890, free; 1894, \ l / 2 cents a pound; 1897, 2 cents a pound. It was only between 1866 and 1890 that Zante cur rants became a competing import, and their competi tion became disastrous after the tariff of 1890. It will be far more disastrous now if they are again made free, for, no matter what the tariff may be on tbe large raisins, the real rate of protection they enjoy is the duty on Zante currants, their most formidable kitchen competitor. 0N EXPERIMENT IN FORESTRY. PRESIDENT McKINLEY in his message to Congress announced that the Forestry Bureau of the Department of Agriculture "is giving special attention to the treeless area of the regions of the country, and is introducing species especially adapted to the semi-arid districts. Forest fires, which seriously interfere with production, especially in the irrigated regions, are being studied, that the losses from this cause may be avoided." This brief statement will have the effect of directing public attention to what is being done by the Depart ment of Agriculture for the preservation of our for ests. The siibject is one of the most important that confronts our lawmakers, either at Washington or at Sacramento. Our forests are worth infinitely more to us than the Philippines or all the islands put to gether over which so much debate is going on. One report that comes to us from the East of what is being done by the Forestry Bureau is worth more than a passing notice by reason of the promise it car ries of future good. Early in October the Department of Agriculture issued a proposal to forest owners that they prepare a plan for harvesting the merchantable timber on any given tract under the supervision of an agent furnished by the department at the expense of the Government, the only condition being that the Government should have the privilege of publishing the financial results for the benefit of other timber owners. It now appears that timber-land owners represent ing 1,000,000 acres of land have filed applications for Government supervision. In the report that comes to us it is stated that 100,000 acres of the area arc in THE SAN
