THE DAILY CHRONICLE. RULE RICKS, Proprietor,' THURSDAY MORNING. DEC. 7, 187L; THE LAKGEST C'UlCUtATIOJf Of Any Daily Published in East Tennessee. THE EX-PRESIDENT AND GOV. BSOWN. H. V. R., of the Cincinnati Commercial, has just completed his fifteenth interview with ex-Fresident Johnson, and "writes a racy letter upon what Andy eaicL Among other things he alluded to Gov. Brown, which H. V. R. reports as follows : The ex-President considers himself badly treated ly John C. Rrown, the present Gover nor of Tennessee. "When Brown came out of the nrtny Johnson pardoned him, thus restoring him to citizenship and protecting his property from confiscation. Brown always professed much gratitude for this, but when J oh neon ran for the Senate, the whole family of Browns took a vcrvdocided 6tand againsc him. "When Brown made his canvass for Governor, he call ed upon the eiPreeident at hia place, ex pressed his gratitude for his pardon, as it was a pearl without price at the time, and alio wished Mr. Johnson to understand that he was not in the caucus that caused his defeat in the Senate, that he had been misrepreienled, &c. Tho ex-President talked to him pretty plain ly, telling him that he wished to hear nothing about gratitude, as that hzd " played out." He accused Brown of having taken a decided stand against him for the Senate, and doing his best to cause his defeat, even if he was not present at the caucus. Thi3 Brown could not. deny, and the two distinguished Tennesseeans parted cold ly, and have not "exchanged observations' since. In Brown's last speech of the canvas?, at Memphis, he pitched into Johnson, calling him a "malcontent and political harlot." "1 will remember him for that," said Mr. John son, "and intend to reply to it some of these days." 

SECRETARY BOVXWZLL'8 REPORT. . Secretary Boutwell, in his annual report jut submitted to Congress, in reference to the reduction of taxes, takes the ground that the nation is able to pay $50,000,000 of the principal of the public debt annually, aud thiuks the reduction should be made with this view, lie thiuks it practicable to d'spense with all revenue from internal sources', except that derived from stamps, spirits, tobacco and malt liquors. He thiuks these sources should furnish a rev enue of one hundred and ten millions, which would be a reduction, on present rates of about sixteen millions of dollars, or about twelve and a half per cent. He thiuks a reduction of twenty millions may be made in customs, which, -would be a to tal reduction of thirty-six millions. In this view he recommends the reduc tion of the duty on salt, 50 per cent.; that the duty on bituminous coal be fifty cents per ton. He also recom mends a reduction on raw hides and skins, aud the removal of all duties from a large class of articles, which enter into the arts and manufactures of this country, and which are not produced in the United States, aud the revenue derived from r which is inconsiderable. He also suggests that "the removal of duties from a large class of articles used in manufactures, and the reduction of the duties on coal, furnish an opportunity for a moderate decrease in the rates of duties uion those products whose cost will be di minisbed by their changes." gress will. make larger ; deductions than the able Secretary suggests!, whether wise ly or not, we do not undertake to say. Certain it is that the taxes for next year will be reduced at least thirty-six millions. This is a most gratifying result better than any one anticipated six years ago. 

WHAT THE PAPERS SAT OF IT. To the exclusion of editorial matter we present this morning what the. press says about the President's message. The Mem phis Avalanche says To tho exclusion of much other matter of in- terest wo print this morning the Message of the President of tho United States delivered yes terday to Congress, by far tho most important of General Grant's State papers. In our col- ul as will also be found tho material portions of the annual report of the Secretary of the Treas ury. From the Union and American. seems predetermined to be satisfied with eve: thing, and tho'siraplicityof his satisfaction must be refreshing to any one conversant with current events. Civil service reform is prom ised as complacently as it was one year ago. In the same way, the President's argument for the i r - e ' i Grant's report to President Johnson on the con dition of the South xix years ago, and his later delusive cry "Let us have peace," "We hope it will have more weight with Congress. The promise of a reduction of taxation will be grat ifying to the people, North as well as South, if Secretary .Boutwell, to wnom we are referred, gives the proper figures. Until wo see the lat ter' report, we must withhold opinion on this only substantial point ot the Presidential ines eage. From the Courier-JonrnaL The President's message is simply a review of the past year i work, and a statement of the re lations ot tho Lmtea btates with loreign coun tries, lie makes few suggestions, or none at alL the matter of general amnesty is handled in a delicate and rather non-commital manner. If anything, he seems to lean forward the propo sition with, still, certian restrictions and ex ceptions. The Spanish uimculties are passed over with the assertion that the government means to protect American citi'-.ns' in Cuba. There is little consolations for 'e Mormons, while the Indians are still cajoled and petted. A mere history of the South Carolina matter is given, and Akerman is left to do tho justifica tion part of it Our relations with England and the Cztir are represented to be extremely cor dial, and the Geneva conference promises to do welL From the Baltimore gun. In conclusion the President declares himself in favor of such civil servico reform as will viait the responsibility for bad appoiutnients upon those who recommend improper persons for of fico to the appointing power. lie refers to the commission appointed under tho act of Con gress of March 31, 1871, to devise regulations lor the reform of the civil service, and promises to give to tho experiment a fair trial. Taken as a whole, the message is of moderate length, simple and unpretentious in its style, rather negative than positive in its merits, and certainly less aggressive in its tone and recom mendations than might have been apprehended, and perhaps, by a certain class of political ex tremists and faetionbts,rwas desired, r- From tho Washington Chronicle, Congress reassembled yesterday, and . the President's message was communicated to the llouseand read about 2 p.m.: This document will be found in our columns to-day. It is a plain, sensible, business-like document, clear and terse in its style, and replete with useful in formation. The President take ground for what is called "universal amnc.-ty." We have no objection to this. "We havo uniformly favored it. But the President seems to lump all the Southern whites together. There are thousands of South ern white men who preserved their integrity from first to last, and who are to day as loyal as any citizens in the country. There are thou sands of others who offended as against the na tion only technically, under the force of circum stances which no human power could have re sisted, and who wero always at heart faithful to the old flag. These . classes of Southern men wore as anxious that General Grant should take Vicksburgand Petersburg as he was. They rejoiced when he triumphed,- and mourned when ho seemed to fail. Some of these are banned technically. They would resent indig nantly any comparison which might be made between themselves and, the "great criminals" referred to in the message. But, without ro gard to this, and in spite of this, we may let amnesty be granted. Let it cover all. The na tion can allord to be magnanimous. Many of those whom it is proposed to relieve are as loyal now as they will be ten years hence. They will neithor bo hardened or softened by delay. They are set, even as the northern star is, and they will never change, As a matter of course, the President will bo assailed. This is to be expected. But, con scious of the rectitude of his intentions, and aiming, as we believe he does, at tho good of tho whole country,!hev can? afibrd to disregard these assaults. History will : make, its record, which will not be affected by the passions ot thjs hour, nor effaced by malevolence or envy, lie is to be judged, not 6o much by what he 6ays as by what he does. His words may bo written now and then on sand, but his deeds will sur vive him in imperishable marble. "Blessed is the peacemaker." It is far better to compose troubles than to create them ... " Certain Democratic journals are now very severe in their allusions to Tammany now, which were defending the ring only a few months ago. - Then, the charges against Hall, Tweed & Co., wrere denomi nated "Radical lies," 

NEW-ADVERTISEMENTS. Winter Wisdom. Warm clothing alone will not protect the body again the consequences of the sudden depression of tempera ture which is concomitant of early winter. Flannel next the skin preserves the' animal heat, bat it does not impart animal vigor. That property is the special pre rogative of Hostettcr's Stomach Hitters, which is there fore a specific protection against a majority of the com plaints which are most common at this season. For example, & course of the great vegetable invigorant, commenced now, will be almost sure to preclude chills and fever, bilious colic, disorders of the stomach, con stipation, and many other complaints which are often the direct or indirect effect of an atmosphere surcharg ed with cold, unwholesome vapor. Moreover, the sys tem toned and regulated by this means is much more likely to resist pulmonary disease than it would other wise be ; for the influence of searching medicine per vades all the organs, and every fibre and tissue of the frame. Persons whose vital powers are weak, especial ly invalid ladles and the aged, are' earnestly recom mended not to face the winter's rigor without having recourse to this safe and sufficient means of re-enforcing the enfeebled nature. Much suffering may be es caped, much danger averted by following this counsel. Better late thaa never, is a good proverb, but it is bet ter to be early than Iato. HOLIDAY TRADE! A. -HI.
