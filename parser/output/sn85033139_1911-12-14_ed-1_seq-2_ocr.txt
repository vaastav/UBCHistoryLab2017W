Nlll AT PEACE president informs congress ABOUT RELATIONS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES. NEW ARBITRATION TREATIES United Stages Help* In Amicable Set tlement of Disputes—Evente Con nected With the Mexican Revolu tion —Need for Merchant Marine. Washington. Dec. 7.—Foreign affairs are the sole subject of President Taft's special message, which was submitted to Congress today. In part tho docu ment says: The relations of the United States with other countries have continued during the past twelve months upon a basis of the usual good will and friendly intercourse. Arbitration. The year just passed marks an Im portant general movement on the part of the powers for broader arbitration. In the recognition of the manifold benefits to mankind In the extension of the nolicy of the settlement of International dls pu.ea by arbitration rather than by war In response to a widespread demand fr an advance In that direction on the (art of the people of the United States and of Gren* Britain and of France, new arbitration treaties were negotiated last spring with G-eat Britain and France, the terms of which were designed, as expressed In the preamble of these treat ies. to extend the scope and obligations of the policy of arbitration adopted In our present treaties with those governments. To pave the way for this treaty with the United Stales Great Britain negotiated an Important modification In Its alliance with *apan and the French government also expedited the negotiations with sig nal good will. The new treaties have been submitted to the senate and are awaiting its advice and consent to their ratification All the essentials of these Important treaties have long been krviwn. and It is my earnest hope that they will receive prompt and favorable action. Arbitration*. In further illustration of the practical and beneficent application of the princi ple of arbitration and the underlying broad spirit of conciliation. 1 am happy to advert to the pari of the United States In faclllatlng amicable settlement of dis putes which menaced the peace between I'anama and Uosta Rica and between Haiti and the Dominican republic. Since the dale of their Independence. Colombia and Costa Rica had been seek- Ing n solution of a boundary dispute, which came as a heritage from Colombia to the new republic of Panama, upon its beginning I;f•• as an Independent na tion. In January. 19,C. cl the request of both governments the agents represent ing them met in .inference at the depart ment of stale and subsequently conclud ed a protocol submitting this long pend- Ing controversy to the arbitral Judgment of the chief justice of the United States, who consented to act In this capacity. A boundary Commission, according to the International agreement, has now been appointed, and it is expected that the ar gumenls will ahortly proceed and that this long-standing dispute will be honor ably and satisfactorily terminated. Again, a few months ago It appeared that the Dominican republic find Haiti were about to enter upon hostilities be cause of complications growing out of an acrimonious boundary dispute which the efforts of many years had failed to solve The government of Hie United Htates. by a friendly Interposition of good offices, succeeded In prevailing upon the parties to place their reliance upon some form of pacific settlement. Mexico. The recent political events In Mexico received atletrlon from this government because of the exceedingly delicate and difficult situation created along our south ern border and the necessity for taking measure* property to safeguard Ameri can interests The government of the United Htates. In Its desire to secure a proper observance and enforcement of the so-called neutrality statutes of the federal government. Issued directions to the appropriate officers to axerclse a dill gent and vigilant regard for the require ments of such rules and laws. Although a condition of actual armed conflict ex isted. there was no official recognition of belligerency Involving the technical neu trality obligations of international law After u conference with tie* secretary of war and tho secretary of the navy. I tn.ught It wise to assemble an army division of full strength at Kan Antonio. Tex .. a brigade of three regiments at Galveston, a brigade of Infantry In the Ivo* Angeles district of southern Uull fornhi. together with a squadron of bat tleships and cruisers and transports at Galveston, and a small squadron of ships at Han Diego. At the same time, through our representative at the t’lty of Mexico I expressed to President Diaz the hope that no apprehensions might result from unfounded conjectures as to these mili tary maneuvers, and assured him that they had no significance which should cause concern to his government. 1 arn mere than nappy to here record the fact that ull apprehensions as to the effect of the pres'-m c of so fiirg** a mili tary force in Texas proved groundless; no disturbances occurred. The Insurrection continued and resulted In engagements between the regular Mexican troops and the Insurgents, and this along the border, so that In several Instances bullets from tfi* contending forces struck American citizens engaged In their lawful occupations on American s- Proper protests were made against these Invasions of American rights in the xicun authorities. The presence of a large military and naval force available for prompt .idion, near the Mexican border, proved to be the most fortunate under the somewhat trying conditions presented by this inva sion of American rights. The policy and action of this govern ment were has* and upon an earnest friend liness for the Mexican people as a whole, and It Is a mutter of gratification to note that this attitude of strict Impartiality as t* * all factions in Mexico and of sincere friendship for the neighboring nation, without regard for party allegiance, has ■ i 1 |, i suit* and in an • yen closer and more sym- I eon the two re | rd one foi i r. and restore tranquility throughout the M*xh an i • pu- w;m ..f peculiar Inter •st to tills govnno rit.

SIOO,OOO. and on July IT. Ull Japan’s general treaties with the other powers, however, terminated In 1911. and the Japanese gov ernment expressed an earnest desire to conduct the negotiation,* for anew treaty with the United Stales simultaneously with Its negotiations with the other pow ers. There were a number of Important questions Involved In the treaty, Includ ing the Immigration of laborers, revision of the customs tariff and the right of Americans to hold real estate In Japan. The United States consented to waive all technicalities and to enter at once upon negotiations for anew treaty on the un derstanding that there should be a con tinuance throughout the Ilfs of the treaty of the same effective measures for the restriction of Immigration of laborers to American territory which had been In operation with entire satisfaction to both governments since ISOS. The Japanese government accepted this basis of nego tiation, and n new treaty was quickly concluded, resulting In a highly satisfac tory settlement of the other questions re ferred to. Europe and the Near East. In Europe and the near east, during the past twelve-month, there has been at times considerable political unrest. The Moroccan question, which for some months was Uie cause of great anxiety, happily appears to have reached a stage at which It need no longer be regarded with concern. The Ottoman empire was occupied for a period by strife In Al bania and Is now at war with Italy. In Greece and the Balkan countries the disquieting potentialities of this situation have been more or less felt. Persia has been the scone of a long Internal strug gle. These conditions have been the cause of uneasiness In European diplo macy, but thus far without direct politi cal concern to the United States. In the war which unhappily exists be tween Italy and Turkey th's government has nn direct political Interest, and I took occasion at ths suitable time to Is sue a proclamation of neutrality In that conflict. At the mime time all necessary steps have been taken to safeguard the personal Interests of American citizens and organizations In so far as affectid by the war. Fur-Seal Treaty. The fur-seal controversy, which for nearly twenty-five year* has been the source of serious friction between the United Htates and the powers bordering upon the north Pacific ocean. who*e sub jects have boon permitted to engage In pelagic sealing against the fur-seal herds having their breeding grounds within the jurisdiction of the United Staten, has at last been satisfactorily adjusted by the conclusion of the North Pa*'fie sealing convention entered Into between the United States, Great Britain. Japan and Russia on the seventh of July last The attention of congress Is especially culled to the necessity for legislation on the part of the United States for the pur pose of fulfilling the obligations assumed under this convention, to which the sen ate gave Its advice and consent on the twenty-fourth day of July last. International Opium Commission. In a special message transmitted to the congress on the seventh of January. 1911. In which I concurred In the recommenda tions made by the secretary of state in regard to certain needful legislation for th<‘ control of our interstate and foreign traffic in opium and other menacing drugs, I quoted from my annual mes sage of December 7. 1909, In which I an nounced that the results of the Interna tional Opium commission held at Shang hai in F bniury. 1309. at the Invitation of the United States, had been laid before lids government: that flu report* of that commission showed that China wns mak ing remarkable progress and admirable efforts toward flu- eradication of the opium evil; that the Interested govern ments had nol permitted their commer cial Interests to prevent their co-oocra tlon In this reform; and, as a result of ch Ila feral Investigations of the opium question In lids country, 1 recommended that the manufacture, sale and use of opium In the United Htates should be more rigorously controlled by legislation. Prior to that time and In continuation of the policy of this government to se cure the co-operation of the Interested nations, the United States propose 1 an international opium conference with full powers for the purpose of clot bldg with the force oi international law the reso lutions adopted by the above-mentioned commission, together with their essen tial corollorles. The other powers con cerned cordially responded to tb • pro posal of this government, and.

Tn my last annual message T referred to the tariff negotiations of the depart ment of state with foreign countries In connection with the application, by a se ries of proclamations, of the minimum tariff of the Itn 11• 1 States to importa tions from the several countries, and I stated ihat. In Its general operation, sec tion 2 of (he new tariff law had proved ft guaranty of continued commercial peace, although there were, unfortunate ly. Instances where foreign governments dealt arbitrarily with Ann rlcan Interests within their Jurisdiction In a manner In fux oua and Ina |u tal le During the past year some Instances of discriminatory treatment have been removed, but I re gret to say that there remain a few cases of differential treatment adverse to the commerce of the United States. While none of these Instances now appears to amount to undue discrimination In the sense of section 1! of the tariff law of August fi, Wf), they are all exceptions to that complete degree of equality of tar iff treatment that (he department of state has consistently sought to obtain for American commerce abroad. While the double tariff feature of the tariff law of 1909 has been amply Justi fied by the results achieved in removing former and preventing new. undue dis criminations against American commerce, It jo believed that the tine- has come for the amendment of this feature of the law In such way as to provide a graduated m< ii • of meeting i trying degrees of discriminatory treatment of American commerce In foreign countries ns well n to protect the financial Interests abroad of American citizens against arbitrary and Injurious treatment on the part of foreign governments through either leg islative or administrative measures. It would seem desirable that the maxi mum tariff of the United States should embrace within Its purview the fr**e list, which Is not the case at the present time. that ■ might hi i reasonable significance to the governments of those countries from which the Importations Into the United States are confined vir tually to articles on the free* list.

NAME OF OARRGW IN BRIRERY QUIZ McNamaras’ Counsel Involved by Witness at Los Angeles. CAUSES SENSATION IN CASE Prosecutor, However, Says It Is Only Talk, Which Is Valueless as Evi dence —Lawyer Declares His Inocence. Lob Angeles, Cal., Dec. 12. —After sensational testimony in which the name of Clarence Darrow was men tioned In connection with the pay ment of bribes to Jurors and pros pective Jurors In the trial of James D. McNamara, Ilert H. Franklin, the detective under arrest for bribery, Is sued a statement denying that the Chicago attorney was in any way im plicated. Franklin was held to the superior court for trial. The statement was called out when Robert F. Hain, sworn juror In the Mc- Namara case, testified that Franklin had told him, when arranging for the bribe, that was paid to him, that Dar row had given Franklin 120.000 “to use.” To Fix Way of Payment. George W. Lockwood, the man who accepted a bribe after informing the district attorney that lie had been ap proached, had testified that Franklin had said that he would see Clarence Darrow to arrange some satisfactory payment of the money promised Lock wood. Lockwood also said he in ferred that when Franklin promised to bring the “big fellow” out to see him, he meant Darrow. Franklin, he said, afterwards asserted he had re ferred to C. E. White, the man se lected to hold the money until Lock wood was qualified and the Jury had returned its verdict. “I haven’t said anything about this case,” said Franklin after the hear ing ended. “I know' enough to keep rny mouth shut about my own affairs. Hut this Is different, and I've got Just one thing I want to say. When these fellows bring into this case the name of a man who is innocent, I’m not go ing to sit by and hear it without put ting in a word, and I want to say that whoever says I ever mentioned tho name of Clarence Darrow in connec tion with such a matter, t°lls a lie. Neither did I ever mention • s having given me $20,000.” Darrow Issues a Denial. Darrow when told of the statement denied any connection in any way with (he bribery. "It Is only fair to counsel for the McNamaras to call attention to the fact that one mention of my name was in conenction with hearsay evi dence when Lockwood testified (hat Franklin told him ho would ask me to arrange for the safe payment of the money and the other was an In ference that Lockwood thought a man referred to by Franklin was myself.” said Darrow. “Those are not In criminating. The statement that I gave Franklin $20,000 is untrue and unfounded. 1 know nothing about the bribery case.” Not Legally in Case. The testimony of the witnesses mentioning Darrow was called to the attention of District Attorney Fred ericks. "Lockwood’s statement is In no way legal evidence against Mr. Harrow,” Fredericks said. “He told only what he said was told him, and that is not legal evidence. We have no evidence that In any way Is sufficient 4o con nect. Mr Darrow either with bribe giving or the attempted bribery that we have discovered.” The bribery hearing started with the testimony of C. E. White, the “escrow man” In the Lockwood case. White told of negotiations with Franklin who, he said, asked him to accept tho money and pay it to Lock wood. He fold in detail of the final transaction when he received the money, paid it over and was ar rested.
