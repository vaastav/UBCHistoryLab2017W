San Francisco's new Chinatown rtuich has arisen on the ruins of the old Is ready for occupancy ond Is rap idly filling up with merchants and tradesmen who were scattered to the (our winds by the terrible earthquake and fire of a year and a half ago. All movements looking toward the trans fer of the Chinese to a less desirable part of the city failed utterly, and the new Chinatown has risen on the site of the old, under the shadow of Nob 11111 and touching shoulders with the finan cial district. In the first flush of hope after the catastrophe several plana were evolved for moving Chinatown out toward Telegraph Hill or to some suit able part of the Mission district. The Bite of old Chinatown was needed for the expansion of the financial district ' One thing stood In the way of this part of the "city beautiful" dream. Chi fnese firms and wealthy Mongolian lndt vlduals owned much of the property In Chinatown. They were satisfied with the site of their quarter. It was near the big hotels patronized by eastern tourists, and It was not too far from the water front whence their goods came. The Chinese refused to acll and tralghtway set about rebuilding. There Is a reason why Chinatown was rebuilt before the other parts of the burned area, even before Market Btreet had been repaved. The Chinese property owners had no troublo In get ting ready cash. They did not try to borrow from San Francisco banka or even from New York money lenders. The fli'Kt steamer to China carried long letters describing the situation. In closed were drafts on the treasurer of the company which backed the San Francisco firms.

The building department and the health authorities Insisted that the new Chinatown be built according to law and tlio new Chinatown has, of course, lost such ptcturesqueness ns was found In the dirt and the squalor and the tumbledown effect of the old buildings.

The message attempts to reassure the business man, the railroad man, the working man, the farmer and the labor lender. The President Is In favor of curren cy legislation. lie would have provi sion made for the Issuance by the banks of an emergency currency wifely secured by bonds, which should b; tax ed enough to make It unprofitable to continue Its use after the emergency had passed. ' He would hnve the Sherman nntl- triist law amended, so ns to permit cer tain proper combinations, necessary to Industrial progress, nnd also made to prevent other combinations that are op- pow.il to the public Interest. Unilroads, for Instance, If Ills plans nre carried out, could combine under restrictions safeguarded by the Inter state Commerce Commission, while If they did It now their officials would face the penitentiary. Railroads, he says, should be permitted to Increase their capital stock, but under scrutiny by the Interstate Commerce Connils slon or other body, whereas when It Is done now thero Is n suspicion that there nre Improper profits In some se cret syndicate. Railroads, he urges, should hnve the right to make rate agreements among themselves, under the scrutiny of the Interstate Com merce Commission, whereas now this is illegal. In return for this permission the President would have Congress devise some scheme which would compel rail roads and great corporations doing nn Interstate business to get a federul li cense or charter. While the President commends con sideration by the people of nn Inherit ance tax and nn Income tax, he does not suggest their immediate considera tion. He would, have consideration Given to the subject when Congress comes to revise the revenue laws. Mr. Roosevelt thinks the tariff should be revised nt proper periods, but not until after the next Presidential elec tion. Ho looks with favor on the pro posal to remove the tax on print paper nnd pulp, but only conditioned on the Canadian government permitting Its pulp wood to enter tlio United States free of nn export tax. The President wants the condition of women and children" who work in factories Improved. He wants more Investigation of the subject. Ho, too, the President wants technical trnlnlng extended to the farm. He does not ex pect Congress will enact any of his rec ommendations at this session, except, perhaps, currency reform and railroad relief. If his present plans nre Carried out hewlll have no tights on his hands with Congress. President Roosevelt Is In favor of a fixed sum being provided for payment to employes for certain Injuries or death In case of accident, while In the discharge of their duties. In the end, It Is held, this would not be n tax on the manufacturer and other employer, but would bo against the cost of the product and the general public would pay.

H.'MKK) words. Ia part the President says : No nation has greater resources than ours, and 1 think it enn be truthfully said that the citizens of no nation possess greater ..nergy and industrial ability. In no nation uro 'tint tiimiuiiietitnl biisinss conditions sounder than in ours at this very moment : and il is fool.sh. when buc.Ii Is the case, for people to hoard money Instead of keening it In sound minks; tor It is such hoarding that is the Immediate occusiou of mouev htrinuenev. Moreover, us a rule, the business of our people is conducted with honesty uul piob.ty, and this implies ulilte to farms and factories, to railroads and hanks, to all our legitimate commercial enterprise. in any large body ot men, however, there are certain to be some who are dis honest, and If the conditions uie such that these men prosper or commit their mis deeds with impunity, their exainide is a very evil thing for the coamiuu.ty. Where these men Rre business men t great sa gacity aim ot temperament both uuscrupu lous aim reckless, ana where the couJ Lions are such tlmt they act without mi pervision or control and ut lirst without effective chink from public op.uiou, they uciuue many innocent people Into making Investments or embarking in kinds ov business that are really unsound. When the misdeeds ot these successful !y dishon est uieu are uiscuveruu, sunermg comes not only upon them, but upon tlio inno cent men whom they hnve misled. It is a painful awakening, whenever it occurs; and, naturally, when it does occur thoso who suffer are apt to forget that the Ion er It was deferred the more "painful it would be. In the effort to punish tho guilty it is both wise and proper to en deavor so far as possible to m.nimisse tu, distress of those who have been misled hv the guilty. Yet it is not possible to re train because ot sucti distress from striv tug to put an end to the misdeed that nr mo ultimate causes oi me saacruig. ant as a means to this end, where poss.hlc to punish those responsible for them. There may be honest differences of opinion as to many governmental policies; but surely there can be no such differences as to the need of unflinching perseverance In tiiu war against successtul disnonesty.

Only the national government enn in thoroughgoing fashion exerc.se the needed control, 'l itis does not mean that there should be any extension of federal authority, for such authority already exists under the roust inn ion in amplest and most far-reaching form; but it does mean that there should be an ex- eim.oii of federal activity. The most vital need Is in connection with the rail roads. As to these, in my Judgment there should now be either a nati il ineorpo- rat. on act or a law licensing railway com panies to engage in interstate, commerce upon certan conditions. The railroad anil all other great corporations will do well to recognize that th.n control must come ; the only question is ns to what gov ernmental body can most wisely exer cise It. Mir r inn it Anti-Trust Law. Moreover, in my Judgment, there should he additional leg.slation looking to the proper control of the great business con cerns .engaged in interstate business, this control to be exercised for their own bene fit and prosperity no less than for the protection of investors and of the general public. As I have repeatedly sajd in messages to the Congress and elsewhere, experience has definitely shown not mere ly the unwisdom but the futility of en deavoring to put a stop to all business combinations. Modern industrial condi tions are such that combination is not only necessary but inevitable. It is so in the world of business just as it is so in the world of luhor, nud it is as idle to desire to put an end to all corporations, U all big combinations of capital, as to desire to put an end to combinations of labor. Corjioration and labor union alike have come to stay. Kach if properly man aged is a source of good and not evil. Whenever in either there is evil, it should be promptly held to account ; but it should receive hearty encouragement so long as It Is properly managed. It is profoundly immoral to put or keep on the statute books a law, nominally in the interest of public morality, that really puts a pre mium upon public immorality, by under taking to forbid honest men from doing what must be done under modern business conditions, so that the law itself provides that its own Infraction must be the con dition precedent upon business success. To aim at the accomplishment of too much usually means the accomplishment of too little, and often the doing of posi tive damage. . The anti-trust law should not be repeal ed; but It should be made both more clU dent nnd more In harmony with actual con ditions. It should he so amended as to fortild only the kind of combination which does harm to the general public, such amendment to be accompanied by, or to be an Incident of, a grunt of supervisory pow er to the uovernment over these big con cerns engaged in Interstate business. This should lie accompanied by provision for the compulsory piibllrution ot accounts ond the subjection of books nnd papers to the In spection of tho government omciais. a ne ginning has already been made for such su nervlslon liv the establishment of the Hu- reau of Corporations. The design should be to prevent the nbuses Incident to the crca' lion of unhealthy and Improper comblna tlons, Instead of waiting until they ore la existence und then attempting to destroy them by civil or criminal proceedings. The law should maUe Id prohibitions ond per missions as clear nnd detlulte as possible, leaving the least possible room for arbi trary action, or allocation of such action, on the part of the executive, or of diver gent Interpretations by the courts. Among the points to be ill men III suouin ue me prohibitum of uuhealtny competition, such as by rendering service at on actual loss for the puriiose of crushing out competi tion, tho prevention of inllntlon of capital, nnd tho prohibition of a corporation's mak ing exclusive trade with Itself a condition of having any trade with Itself. Reasona ble agreements between, or combinations of, corporations should he permitted, pro. vliled they, are first suhtuftteu to anu ap proved by some appropriate government body. To confer upon ihe national govern ment, In connection with tho amendment 1 advocate In tho anti-trust law, power of su pervision over big business concerns en gaged In lnterstati) commerce, would bene- lit them as it lias nenentea mo national banks. In the recent business crisis It Is noteworthy that tho Institutions which failed were Institutions wlilcn were not under tho supervision nnd control of the national government. Those which were under national control stood the test. Those who fear, from nny reason, the ex tension of federal activity will do well to stink- the history not only of the national banking net but of the pure food law, nnd notably tho meat inspection iuw recently enacted.

For several years evidence has been accumulat ing that additional legtslattou is needed. The recurrence of each crop seasou empha sfes the defects of the preseut laws. There must soon be a revision of them, because to leave them as they are means to Incur liability of business disaster. There Is need of a change. I nfortunately, however, many of the proHised changes must be ruled from consideration been use they are cmimllcftted. nre not easy of comprehen sion, and teuu to disturb existing rignts and Interest.

In other words, the prin ciple of the present tariff law could not with wisdom be changed. Hut In a coun try of such phenomenal growth ns ours It Is probably well that every dozen years or so Ihe tariff laws should be carefully situ-. llnlzcd no as to see that no excessive or Improper benefits are conferred thereby, that proper revenue Is provided, nnd that our foreign trade Is encouraged. There must always be us a minimum a tariff which will not only allow for the collection of an ample revenue but which will nt least make good the difference In cost of produc tion here and abroad; that Is, the differ ence In the labor cost here and abroad, for the well-being of the wage-worker must ever bo a cardinal point of American pol icy, ihe ipiestlon should lie approached purely from a business standpoint; Isith the time und the manner of the change be ing such as to arouse the minimum of agi tation und disturbance In the business world, snd to itlve the least nhiy for selfish and factional motives. The sole considera tion should be to see that the sum total ot changes represents the public good. This means Hint tne subject ennnot witn wis- dlm be dealt with lu the year preceding a presidential election, because ns a matter of fact experience bus conclusively shown tnnt at such a time It Is Impossible to get men to treat It from the slaudisilnt of the public good. In lay Judgment the wise time to deal with tho matter Is Immediate ly ufter such election. Income Tax and Inheritance Tarn. When our tax luws nre revised the ques tion of an Income tax and an Inheritance tax should receive the careful attention of our legislators. In my Judgment both of these taxes should be part of our system of federal taxation. 1 speak dlllldently about the Income tax because one scheme for an Income tax' was declared unconstitutional by the supreme court; while In addition It Is a difficult tax to administer In its practi cal working, and great care would have to be exercised to see that It wus not evaded by the very men whom It was most desira ble to have tuxed, for If so evaded It would, of course, be worse than no tax. at all ; as the least desirable of nil taxes Is the tax which bears heavily upon the honest as compared with the dishonest man. Nev ertheless, a graduated Income tux of tho proper type would be a desirable feature of federal taxation, nnd It Is to be hoped that one may be devised which the supreme court will declare constitutional. The In heritance tax, however, Is both a far bet ter method of taxation, nnd far mora Im portant for the punose of having the for tunes of the couutry bear in proportion to their Increase In size a corresponding In crease and burden of taxation. The gov ernment has tho absolute right to decide as to the terms upon which a niaa shall re ceive a bequest or devise from another, and this point In the devolution of proper ty Is especially appropriate for the Imposi tion of a tax. Enforcement of the Lair. A few years ago there was loud com plaint that tne law cuutd not be Invoked ugulnst wealthy offenders. There la no such complaint now. The course of tUe de partment of Justice during the last few years has been such as to make It idect that no man stands above the Iuw, that no corporation is so wealthy that It cau not be neld to account. The two great evils In the execution ot our criminal luwa to day are sentimentality and technicality. Both of these evils must be removed "or public discontent with the criminal law will continue. Injunctions. Instances of abuse in the granting el lu Juuctlons lu labor disputes contlnuu to uc- cur, and the resentment In the minds of those who feel that their rights are be!ii Invaded and their liberty of action und t speech unwarrantably restrained coutlnu a likewise to grow. .Much of the attucK in tho UBe of the process or Injunction la whol ly without warrant ; but 1 am coustrnlt.4.'d to express the belief that for some of it there is warrant. This question is beconi.g more und more one of prime Importune, und unless the courts will theniseivus ileal with it In effective manner, it is ceitain ultimately to demand turns form of liiis latlve action. 1 refrain from dlscuss-'cn of this queatlon as I am Informed that U will soou receive the consideration of Cj su preme court. Employers LlaMllty. The national government should! be a model employer. It should deuuud th highest quality of service from each ef Its employes uud It shuuld care for all o! them irooerly lu return, t.omtress should adopt legislation providing limited hut Oetlnlte compensation for accidents to all workmen within the scope ot tne leuerai power, in cluding employes of navy yards nnd ar senals. In other words, a model employ ers' liability act, fur-reaching und thor oughgoing, should bo enucted which should upply to oil positions, public uuu private, over which the nutlonal government -has Jurisdiction. Industrial Disputes. Strikes and lockouts, with their attend ant loss and suffering, continue to Increase. For the live years ending December ;u, 11)05. the number of strikes was greater than those In uny previous, ten years and was double the uiimner in tne piveeuing five years, t hese ngures indicate the lu ei-easinit need 'of nrovldlng some machinery to deal with tins ciuss or uisiuroauces in tho Interest alike of the employer, the em uloye. und the general public. 1 seaew my iirttvtous reroniuwndatlou that te t'ou- m-ess fuvorably consider the mutter of ere- itinir tne macninery tor coiupumorj inves tigation of such Industrial controversies us are of aulticleut magnitude and of suthcleut concern to the people ut tne country as u whole to warraul tne icuerui government In taking action. Capital and Labor. It Is certain that for some time to come there will be a constant increase absolutely. uud perhaps relatively, of thosu amoug our citizens wno aweu iu ciues or luivus oi some size and who work for wages. This means that there will be nn ver-iuerenslug need to consider the problems insepnrablH from a irreut Industrial civilization. Where nn Immense and complex business, especial ly lu those brunches relating to uiununie ture uud transportation, Is truuaactsd by a large number of cupituusis wno employ a vi.rv much lamer number of wuge eurners, the former teuu uioie u tuuiu iv com bine Into corporations and the latter luto unions. The relations ot the capitalist und wage-worker to one a not tier, und of each to the general public, nre not always easy to adjust ; uud to put them und keep them on i satisfactory basis Is one of the most Im portant and one ot tne most oenciue tasks before our whole civilization. It Is Idle to hold that without good luws evils such as 1)11,1 labor, us tuo over-worsing oi women, as the luuure to proiui-i ciuuji-i num loss of life or limb, cun be effectively reached, any more than the evils of rebates and stock watering can be reached without good luws. To fall to stop tuese practices by legislation means to loree oonest men Into them, because otherwise tne uisnonest who mir.lv will take advantage of them will have everything their own wuy. ir tne Suites will correct these evils, well and good ;- but the nation must staud ready to m them. No uuestlon srowlng out of our rapid and couiblex Industrial development Is more Im portant than that ot tne employment oi women and cntidren. J ne presence ot worn en In Industry reacts with extreme direct lies iiKin the character ot the Home ana noon family lite, and the conditions sur rounding the employment of children bear u vital relation to our luiure citizcusuip Farmers and Wane Workers The two citizens whose welfare Is In tho aggregate most vital to tne welfare of the nation, and therefore to the welfare of .nil other eltlzeus, are the wage-worker who does manual lalsir and the tiller of the soil. the farmer. The calling of the skilled tiller of the soil, the calling of the skilled mechanic, should alike lw reeognlzcd as pro fessions. Just us emphatically as the cull I hum of lawyer, doctor, merchant, or clerk The schools should recognize this fact and It should ruually I rccomui.il lu popular opinion.

IM'IMIM nr tc past a peculiar dependence has bad to be placed UHiu the funning population; uud Hits dependence has hitherto been jusiiiled. lint It can not be JiiHiliied lu the future If agriculture Is peiuilitcd to sink lu the scale ns compared with other employments. We can not afford to lose that pre-eminently typlcnl American, the farmer who owns his own medium-sized farm. To have his place taken by either a class of, .small peasant proprietors, or by n class of great land lords with tenant-farmed estates wo-i'd be a veritable rnlnmlty. I no g o v-t si of our cities Is a good thing but only In so far ns It does not mean a growth nt the ex pense of the country farmer. We must welcome tho rise of physical sciences In their application to agricultural practices, and we must do nil we can to render coun try conditions more easy nnd pleasant. There nre forces which now tend to bring about both these results, but they are, as yet, In their lnfnncy. The national gov ernment through the department of nirrl culture should do all It can by Joining with the mate governments nnd with independ ent associations of farmers to encourage the growth In the open farming country of Such Institutional nnd social movements as will meet the demand of the best type of farmers, both for the Improvement of their farms and for the betterment of the life It self. The grain producing Industry of the conn- try, one of the most Important in the I'nlted States, deserves special consideration at the hands of the Congress. I suggest to the Congress the advisability of a national system of inspection and grading of grain entering Into Interstate and foreign com merce as a remedy for the present evils. Inland Waterways. For the last few years, through several agencies, the government has been endeav oring to get our people to look" ahead and to substitute a planned .and orderly devel opment of our,resourrs In place of a hap hazard strlvlnf 'for linme ii ito profit. Out great river syoms should be developed as national water highways ; the Mississippi, with Its tributaries, standing first In Import ance, and the Columbia second, although thre are many others of Importance on the racitlc, the Atlantic and the tiulf slopes. Th national government should undertake thft work, and 1 hope a beginning will be muTle In the present Congress ; and the greatest of all our rivers, the Mississippi, should receive special attention. From the (ir-ot Lakes to the mouth of the Mississippi thfre should be a deep waterway, with deflp waterways leading from It to tho east ani west. Such a waterway would prac- tlrilly mean the extension of our coast UO Into the very heart of our country. It wruld be of Incalculable benefit to our peo ple If begun at once It enn be carried thi'ough In time -appreciably to relieve the congestion of our great freight-carrying Urea of railroads. I have appointed an In land waterways commission to study and outline a comprehensive schemo of develop-, mm': along all the lines Indicated. Later I slrlll lay Its report before the C'ongres. Reclamation Work. Irrigation should be far more extensively developed than at present, not only In the 8'es of the great plains, and tho Kocky Mountains, but In many others, as. for ln slAnce, In large portions of the south Atlan ta and Gulf States, whero It should go h-nd In hand with the reclamation of t'smp land. The Federal Government slfiukl seriously devote itself to this task, relllning that utilization of waterways and w'ler power, forestry. Irrigation, and the reSsmation of lands threatened with over flow, are all Interdependent parts -pf the same problem. I he wora ot the reclamation s'wvlce In developing the larger opportuni ties of the western half of our country for Irrigation Is more Important than almost may other movement. Public Lands. The effort of the Government to deal with t9 nubile land has been based upon tho sane principle as that of the reclamation service. The land law system wnicn was dnftgned to meet the needs of the fertile n1 well-wntered regions of the middle wfit has largely .broken down when ap pVird to the drier regions of the great plslns, the mountains, and much of the ra-iilc slope, where a farm of KIO acres Is nadequate for self-support. In these re gions the system lent Itself to fraud. Three years ago a public lands commission was ncolntcd to scrutinize tne inw, ana de fects, and recommend a remedy. Their ex- am'nation specifically showed the existence of Rreat fraud upon the public domain, and thT recommendations for changes in tne last were made with tne design or conserv ing the natural resources of every part of thA public lands by putting It to Its best us The recommendations of the public lui'ns commission nre sound ; for they are esr"rlnlly In the Interest of the actual horeD-maker ; arid wnere tne smau nome m.Vr cannot ut present utilize the land thy provide Ihnt the Government shall kee control of It so that It mny not be niiNinpollzed by a few men. Some such lefr-eiatlnn as mat proposed is essential In tfrder to preserve the great stretches of pu'.llc grazing land which are unfit for cnl tlVP'lon under present methods and nre va'tmble only for the forage which they suf fly. Preservation of Forests. Pltlmlsm Is a good characteristic, hut If carried to an excess It becomes foolishness. V are prone to speak of the resources of th'o country as Inexhaustible ; this Is not so. The mineral wealth of the country, the cont Iron, oil, gas, and the like, does not re- nreiTuca Itself, and therefore Is certain to lie cxfrMisted uuthnately ; and wastefulness in dertlng with it to-day means tnat our do servants will feel the exhaustion a gener ntMf or two before they otherwiso would. n.; there are certain otner forms of waste whl?h could be entirely stopped the waste of till by washing, for Instance, which Is anteag the most dangerous or ail wastes no-r In progress In the United States, is canity preventable, so that this - present enrvmous loss or fertility is entirety un necessary. Tho preservation or replacement of the forests Is one of the most Important mentis of preventing mis loss, we have mudo a beginning in forest preservation hot It la only a beginning. At present ltSoibeting Is the fourth greatest Industry in the Ihilted fitates ; and yet, so rapid has brn the rate of exhaustion of timber lu tha United States in tne past, and so ran- l,lt Is the remainder bring exhausted., that tvi country to unquestionably on the verge ot a timber famine wnicn win no felt In eery household In the land. There has ltadv been a rise la the price of lumber. nut there is certain to ue a more rapid nl heavier rise in tne inture. The present rnnual consumption or lumber is certainly fhfre times as great as tne annual growth ; ind If the consumption and growth continue nnehanired. practically all our lumber will rs exhausted In another generation, while Wing before the limit to complete exhaus tion is reacnen tne growing scarcity will make itself tell in many biiL-ntuur wuvs upJn our uational welfare. Forests can lie Mill he red so as to give to the public the fiail use of their mercantile timber without fo slightest detriment to the forest, anv nrnvre than It I a detriment to a f.rrm to C'trnlsh a harvest. Hut forests, if used ail all our forests have been used In the nast and as most of them) are still used, will lie ntfher wholly destroyed, or so damaged that uibuy decades have to pass before effective use ran be made of tneni again. All these facts ar so obvious that It 1 extraordluarv that It should lie necessary to repeat them The only trouble with tho movement for Ihe preservation of our forests, Is that It has not gone nearly far enough, and was not begun soon enough. It It a most for tunate thing, however, that we lsgan It when we did. We should acquire In the Appalachian and White Mountain regions all the forest lands that It is possible to ar quire for the use of the nation. These lauds, because they form a national asset are as emphatically national as the rivers which they feed, and which How through o many States before they reach the ocean Tariff on Wood Pulp. There should he no tariff on any forest product grown In this country; and. In esscial, ther should be no tariff on woo pulp; due notice of the change being of course given to those enguged In the mis! ties so as to enable them to a. Host them selves to til new conditions. The repeal of the duty nn wood pulp should If possible Is accompanied by an aiireeimit with an ailu that there shall be no export duty un I unadiau pulp wood. Mineral Lands. In my Judgment the Government should have the rtuhl to keen the fee of the coil pll and gas fields In lis own po-io'ssimi ami to lease the ruhts to develop the uuder proper regulations; or else. If the Congress will not adopt this method, the coal deposits should is- sold under Itmn.i tioas. to 1-oiii.erve them as public utilities. ihe right to mine coal Isiug .-cpjruic.t from uie title to the noil. The l'a un inn t 'uanl. Work on the Panama Canal Is procivdlng In a highly satisfactory manner. Uisi win ter bid were requested and received for doing lue work ot cuuul construction by contract. None of them was found to W satisfactory and all were rejected. It is the unanimous opinion of the present com mission that the work can be done lsttcr, more cheaply, and more quickly by the Gov ernment than by private contractors. Fully HO per cent of the entire plant needed for construction has been purchased or con tracted for: machine shops hnve liee:i erect ed and equipped for making all needed re pairs to the plant ; many thousands of em ployes have lieen secured : nn effective or ganization has hern perfected; a ree"iiitlU4 system Is In operation which Is cnpible if furnishing more Inbor than can lie used ad vnntngeously ; employes are well sheltered and well fed salaries paid are satisfactory nnd the work Is not only going fonvar! smoothly, but It Is producing results far In advance of the most sanguine anticipa tions, t'nder there favorable conditions, n change In the method of prosecuting th work would Is" unwise and unjust limine, tor It would Inevitably disorganize exlstin.: con ditions, check progress, and Increase the cost and lengthen the tlmo of completing the cnnal. The chief eneineer nnd oil his profes sional associates are firmly convinced Ihnt the Ko-font level lock canal which tney are constructing In the best that could be de sired. Some of them had doubts on t'.is point when they went to the I.dhmus. As the plnns hnve developed under their direc tion their doubts hnve been dispelled. While they may decide unon changes In detail ns construction advances, they are In hearty accord In approving the general plan, iiiey believe that It provides a canal not only adequate to all demands that will be made upon It,- but superior In every way to a sea level canal. I concur In this belief. Postal Affair. I commend to the favorable consideration of the Congress a postal savings bank sys tem, as recommended by the Postmaster General. The primary object Is to encour age among our people economy and thrift nnd by the use of postal savings banks lo give them an opportunity to hnsbind their resources, particularly those who have not the facilities at hand for depositing ' their money In savings batiks. Viewed.- however, from the experience of the past few weeks, It is evident that the advantages of such nn Institution are still more far-reaching. Timid depositors have withdrawn their sav ings for the time being from national banks, trust compnnles and savings bunks; individuals have hoarded their cash and tlie worklngmen their earnings; all of which money tins ls?en withheld and kept In hid Inir or In the safe denoslt box to the detri ment of prosperity. Through the agency of the postnl savings banks such money would be restored to the channels of titide, to the mutual benefit of capital and labor. 1 fur ther commend to the Congress the consid eration of the Postmaster General's recom mendation for an extension of the parcel post, especially on the rural routes. Presidential Campaign Expense. It Is well to provide that corporations shall not contribute to presidential or na- tlonalcampalgns. The need for collecting large campaign funds would vanish if Con gress provided an appropriation for the proper nnj legitimate expenses of each of the great national parties, an appropriation ample enough to meet the necessity for thor ough organization an i machinery, which re quires a large exenditurc of money. Ocean Mall Service. I call your especial attention to the un satisfactory condition of our foreign raatl service, which, because of the luck of Amer ican steamship lines. Is now Inrgely done through foreign lines, ond which, particu larly so far ns South and Central Anier.ca are concerned, is done In a manner which constitutes a serious barrier to the exten sion of our commerce., Tho time has come. In my Judgment, to set to work seriously to make our ocean mail service correspond more closely with our recent commercial and political development. The only serious question is whethel nt this time we can afford to Improve our ocean mall service as it should be Improved. All doubt on this subject Is removed by the reports of the Postolllcc Department. The Govern ment of the I'nlte.l States, having assumed a monopoly of carrying tlie malls for the people. Is making a prollt of over S.i.limuitK) ny rendering a cueup ami i uci. ;cn:iii m-i i.-.-. That urolit I believe should be devoted to strengthening our maritime power in those directions where It win best promote our prestige. 1 strongly recommend, therefore, a simple amendment to the ocean mall act of 1MH which shall authorize the Postmas ter General In his discretion to euter Into contracts for the transportation of mails to the republics of South America, to Asia. the Philippines, and Australia nt a rai not to exceed $4 a mile for steamships ot 1U knots speed or upwards, subject to tne restrictions and obligations ot the act of 1S!1. The Army. Xot oniv there is not now. but there never has' been, any other nation In thi world so wholly free from the evils oi mil itarism as is ours. Never at any tln-.e of our history has the regular army been of a size which caused the slightest apprecia ble lax upon tlitax-paing citizens of tao nation. As a nation wo have always lieen shortsighted In providing for the efficiency of the army In time of peace. 1 think it is only lack of foresight that troubles us, nut any hostility to the army. There are, of course, foolish people who denouueo any care of tho army or navy as 'militarism," hue 1 do not think that these people are numer ous. We are glad to help in any movement for International peace, out tins is oeeause we sincerely believe that it Is our duty t help all such movements provided they nre sane and rational, nnd not liecause there Is any tendency toward militarism on our part which needs to lw cured. The evlis Wi? have lo tight are those in connection vviiii Industrialism, not . militarism. Industry is always necessary, Just as war is sometimes necessary, l-.acn nus us price, ami imiusiry ln the I'll ted States now exacts, and Ins always exacted, a far heavier toll of deal!: than all our wars put together. We should maintain in penco a rainy complete skeleton of a large army. A great and long continued war would have to be fought by volunteer. "i nionins woum pas before any large body of efficient vol unteers could be put iu the field, and our regular army should be large enough to meet nny Immediate need. In paiiieuiiir It Is erseutlal that we should possess a num ber of extra cnleers trained in peace to per form iftiiiently the duties urgeutly required upon the breaking out of war. The rate of nn forthe officers should ls greatly In creased ; there is no higher type of citizen than the American regular oineer, au.i he should have a fair reward for his admir able work. There should lie a relutirely even greater increase In the pay for the enlisted men. The rate of desertion In our army now in time of peace Is alarming. The deserter should be treated by public opinion as a man guilty of the greatest crime; while on the other hand tlio man who serves steadily In the army should le treated as what he is. that U, as pre-eminently one of the best citizen of this re public. m The 'a y. Itwas hoped The Hague Conference mlcht deal with the question of the limita tion of sraiaments. Hut even ls?fore it ha 1 aa.umlili.il I nf ii.iim I tmiilll-li.it ll-l ilnrnliitin 1 that as regards naval armaments, the only ones lu which thl country Itad any inier- est. It was hopeless to try to devise any plan for which there was the slightest pos sibility of securing Ihe assent of the na tion gathered at The Hague. It -la evi dent, therefore, that It is folly for tills nation to base any hope of securing peace on any International agreement us to the limitation of armaments. S.irn being tlie fact It would be most unwise f ir us to slop the upbuilding of oar navy. To build one battleship of the ls-t und most ad vanced type u year would barely keivy o n fleet up to Its present force. This is no; enough. In my Judgment, we should this year provide for four battleships. P. it It Is idle to build battleships utile.; ii irtili tlon to providing the men, and the im.ms for thorough training, we provide t ie aux iliaries for them. uule-.s we provile docks, tho coaling stotions, the colliers and s io il.v ships that they need. We are extremely d.'tliient in co.illng stations un I i',.i,-ki on the Pacltlc and this deficiency should rot longer be permitted to exist. 1'ieuly of In--tie Jo biNils ami destroyer should le built. Iloth on the Atlantic and I'arble eoasrs, fort ltieat Ions of Ihe best type should le pi-o-vidcil fur nil our gi"atcst harbors. We need always to rctnemis'r th.it in time of war the nny Is nit lo le i.,e-l to i'efe,.d linrl,i' ami seuronst cij-'i: v.c should piTtect oar svsiem of co.-ist I'r ii.'-,-tious. Tlie only efheicut use lo- tl.c i.ivy Is for offense. The only way In wh'.ci it can etticieutly pnuc.i our own coed a;ii.nsi the possible action of a foivl,-:i navy Is by deslro.viug that foreign navy. For ilef.'s-.e a-jalust a hostile lleet which uctnallv attacks thcui, the coast ' cities must dt-pcud upon their for!. mines, torpedoo.i, submarine and torpedo boats nnd destroyers. I'ntll our battle Meet Is much larger than at present it should never le split Into da--tnehtnents so far apart that they could not lu event of emergency be speedily united. Our coast line Is on tlio Pacific Just as much as oa the Atlantic. The Interests of fnllforiia. Oregon nnd Washington are as et.ipli.iilcally the Interests of the whole I'nlon as those of Maine, nnd Now York, ot l.o:ii-:lnna ani Texas. The battle fleet . should now and then lie moved to the Pa cific, Just is nt oilier time It should be kept In tlie Atlantic. I bespea1; the nrvt Il':ernl treatment for Ihe olReers itfd enlisted men of the navy. It 3 true of them, as likewise of the otticera 1 nnd eal'.sted men of the nrmy, that they form n Isidy whose Interests should be dose to t'io heart of every good Ameri can. In return tlie most rigid performance of duty should lie exacted from tliem. The rewind Hhottht lo ample when they do their bnst : and nothing less tiitin their best should be tolerated. It must be remembered that everything 'one In the navy to lit It to do well in time of war must he done In time of peace. .Mo.lern wars are short; they d;i not last the len;;th of time requisite ti build n bnt tleshlp; and It tnlces longer to train tha ollice:- nnd nun to do we. I on the bnttle sltlp than it takes to build It. Nothing ef fective can bo done for the navy once war has begun, and the result of the war. If the combatants nre otherwise equally matched, will depend upon which power has prepared best In time of pence. The I'nlted States navy Is the best guaranty the na tion bus that its honor nnd Interest will not be neglected ; nnd In nddltlon It offer by fur the best Insurance for pence that can by human ingenuity be devised. ForiiKii Affairs. In foreign nffalrs this country's steady policy Is to behave toward other nations ns a strong nnd self-respecting man should behave toward- the other men with whom he Is brought into contact. In other words, our aim is disinterestedly lo help other nations where such help can be wisely given without the appearance of meddling with what does not concern us ; to tie care- ful to act as a rood neighbor; and nt tha SKme tin e, in good-natured fashion, to mak it evident that we do not Intend to be Im posed upon. Tim Peace Conference. The second International peace conference was enlivened at The Hague oa the 15th of Juno last nnd remained In session tiutll the 1'ith of October. For the tlrst time tlio representatives of practically nil the civilized countries of the world united in a temperate and kindly discussion ot tlie met nods by which the caimes of war might be narrowed nud its Injurious effects re duced. Aiti.ough tho agreements reached In the conference did not lu any Utrection go to tlio length hoped for by the mora sanguine. yet In many directions Important steps were taken, mid upon every subject on the pro.;rnm tlicw was such full and consider ate discussion as to Justify tho belief that substantial progress ban been made toward further agreements In the future. The delegates of the I'nlted States worthily represented the spirit of tho American peo ple and tan int allied with fidelity and ubil ity the policy of our government upon all the great questions discussed in the con ference. Cuba. A year a-jo In consequence of a revolu-i. tiouary movement in Cuba which thrent- ) eneu the Immediate return to chaos of the 1 Island, the I i ltei States intervened, send ing dowa an army uud establishing a pro visional government under Guv. Magoon. Absolute quiet iindr prosperity have re turned to tlie island because of this action. We ire no.v tiiKinu' fcleps to provide for elections lu the island and our expecta tion li within .the coming jcar to be able to turn the island over again to n govern ment chosen by the people thereof. Cuba Is ut our doors. ' Gcrm.iii Tariff Agreement. The adoption of a new tariff by Ger many, accompanied by conventions for re ciprocal tariff concessions between that couutry and most of the other countries of contlntntal F.urope. led the German gov ernment lo give tne notice necessary to teitnltmte the reciprocal commercial agree ment with this country proclaimed July 13, l'.ioo. The notice was to take effect ou the 1st of March. l'.HlO. t'nder a special agree ment made between the two governments In February. l'Jtlo. the Genua u government postponed the operation of their notice unlit the ItOtn of June. 1007. In the mean time I sent to Iterlln a commission com posed of i om potent experts in the opera tion and administration of the customs tari:?, from tt.o departments of the treas ury and commerce and labor. This cim laisslou wus engaged for several munlh In cjnieienco wita a similar commission np pointcl by tlie German Government, under Instructions, so far as practicable, to reach a common understanding us to nil the facts regarding the tariffs of the I'nlted States and Germany material and relevant to tlie t i-u Jo relations between tho two countries. The commissioa reported, nnd upon the basis of the report, a further temporary commer cial agreement was entered into by the , t Ao countries. This agreement is to remain In force until the h'Oth of June, 1U0H, and cclll six months after notice by either party to lrrmir..:ti: It. Tho Public Health. At last the public mind is awake to the fact that many diseases, notably tuberculo sis, are national scourges. The work of the State nud (itv boar. Is of health should he supplemented by a constantly lncreaslns Intciest oa the part of tho natlouul govcrn c:e.'ii. Other ItecammeiMlntlona. I recommend that a naval monument be established In t'.ic Vlcksburg Nutlonal Prrk. I-cihintlon should be enacted at the pres ent session of the Congress for tho thir tentn census. There should le a national gallery of art established iu the capital city of this coun try. I again recommend that the tights of titl zens'hip le conferred upon tho people of I'orto Itico. The Secretary cf War has gone to the Philippine!, on lij return 1 shall submit his repoit on the islands. I strongly recommend to the Congress to provide funds for keeping up tho Hermit age. I lie home of Anii ew Juckson. The loss of life and Unih from 'rnilrond acel.lenls iu tills country has become np p.illlng. It 1 a subject of which, the na tional government should take supervision I reiterate my recommendations of last year a regards Alaska. Some form of local self-government should bo provided, 1 simple and Inexpensive as posibie. Tlie biological survey Is quietly working f ir the go.iJ of our agricultural Interests, and I au excellent example of a govern ment bureau which conducts original sclcn tilic tcsearch the findings of which are of much practical utility. Tho Congress should consider the exten slon of the eight hour law. The general In troduction of the eight-hour day should lie tlie go.il toward which we should steadily tend, nnd the government should set the example in tills respect.
