Pend Oreille County, Wash. 25-6 62ND SESSION OF CONGRESS CONVENES Regular Session Opened Mon day With Prospects of Pro tracted Meeting. Washington.—The first regular ses eion of the Sixty-second Congress opened Monday. Having perfected its organization when it met in extraor dinary session last spring, Congress was ready to begin work. Democrats, Republican Insurgents and Republican Standpatters all ad mit that the session, on the eve of the presidential campaign, will be bit ter and protracted. There are few who think that the session will end before next June. A great game of politics, with each side sparring for advantage, is to be played, and nothing except the near approach of the national conventions and the necessity for "fence building" will cause the legislators to cease their labors at the national capitol. President Upholds Sherman Law. President Taft in his message stat ed that, owing to the number of im portant subjects calling for comment, it was impossible to include a discus sion of them in one message of rea sonable length and, therefore, he would transmit a series of messages between the opening of Congress and the adjournment for the Christmas holidays. His first message dealt with anti trust legislation. The President stated that he was strongly opposed to the repeal or amendment of the Sherman law, and suggested that the law should be strengthened by supplemen tal legislation. He urged the enact ment of some sort of federal incorpor ation act and the creation of a federal corporation commission. Must Do Over Extra Session Work. Much of the work or the extra ses sion which President Taft called in order to pass the Canadian reciprocity agreement, must be done over again. The President vetoed the tariff revi sion bills passed by the Democrats and the Republican Insurgents, and both factions are armed for the fray once more. The Democrats have a good work ing majority in the House, and the Important bills on their program will be passed qmcKiy, Tariff and constructive corporation legislation are the two items of gen eral interest standing out from the rest In the line of serious business. As soon as President Taft sends in his tariff message, following the report made to him by the tariff board, the Democrats of the ways and means committee will shape their program. It is practically assured that whatever the ways and means committee puts forward, whether wholly en rapport with the tariff board findings or not, will pass the House. Many Tariff Bills Coming. The probability is that there will be a series of measures revising vari ous schedules in conformity with the plan followed last summer. The real tariff fight will follow in the Senate with the result uncertain now and with the impending complications wearying to contemplate in view of the balance of power held by the In surgents and the lack of harmony in the ranks of the Senate Democrats. The corporation legislative prob lem is even more vexing than that pertaining to the tariff. The Presi dent and his friends are hopeful that non partisan public sentiment will force the parties to co-operate and place a federal corporation law on the statute books. Panama Canal Legislation. The coming session is expected to develop the first legislation for the operation, maintenance and govern ment of the Panama canal and the canal zone. Everything that Congress has done in the past regarding the great artificial waterway has been di rected toward construction. The question of tolls for use of the canal and its permanent fortification are two of the big subjects that it is ex pected will be embodied in legislation introduced during the session. It is not believed, however, that much leg islation will be passed on the future of the canal, it being attempted large ly as a formative precaution to test the sentiment toward the different plans suggested. Will Do Little Before Holidays. But little constructive legislation is expected before the Christmas holi days. After the reading of the Presi dent's annual message both houses settled down to the introduction of bills and preliminary skirmishing in advance of the real battle that will begin after the Christmas recess. The House Democrats will then plunge at once into the consideration of the tariff revision bills and the an nual appropriation measures. The re- Port of the tariff board on the whole schedule will be submitted shortly after Congress convenes. J. B.

RUSSIAN TROOPS MOVE ON PERSIA Teheran. —Persia is In a ferment over the warlike action of Russia, and the excitement in the capital was intense at the news of the Russian ad vance. Placards proclaiming "death or independence" were posted both on the walls of the city and on the le gations. Thousands of persons formed in procession and marched past the le gations. William Morgan Shuster, treasurer general of Persia, is the real object of Russia's warfare on Persir., and it is to dislodge him that the czar has landed troops on Persian soil. Mr. Shuster came here to straighten out Persia's tangled financial affairs. He was recommended by President Taft and Secretary of State Knox at the re quest of the Persian government. He brought four young Americans with him to help in the difficult problem, and their progress has been such that it looked as if Russia and England were to be disappointed in their long cherished hopes of partitioning Per sia. Then Russia made certain de mands, and the Persian prime minis ter ordered Shuster to recede, but he refused, and those who know him have no doubt that he will leave his post rather than yield a single point.
