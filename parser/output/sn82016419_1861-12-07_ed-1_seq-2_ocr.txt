mu (mm EMPORIA, KANSAS: SATURDAY, DECEMBER 7. 1861.' LATEST NEWS. A gentleman arrived here last evening from Leavenworth, bringing a copy of the Timesol Wednesday, from ; which we clip the. folio wing late and interesting items:,. t.. Gen. McClellan is "understood to have .-...- - 'i- i j, made the most urgent representations to the President, in favor of a regular and syste matic exchange of prisoners. ' He will prob ably 'succeed .in having his views approved and acted upon. ; - i i. Me Call is moving towards Leeaburg, and Gens. Smith and Porter are extending their line3 'forward;' while McDowell and Franklin are, watching' the -enemy's centre, which is growing weaker and weaker every day. : Times Dispatch of the 2nd says: I am ena bled tdrstale in the most positive manner, that the struggle U over, and that the Pres ident's conservative policy is sustained by his Cabinet with entire unanimity. The World's j correspondent says Secretaries Cameron and Seward were serenaded to night but only the( latter appeared. He simply complimented the -music, - and stated that within ten diys :the country would : re joice at great news. ' . ' A most important order will soon be issued, to the effect that no more recruiting of regiments or independent companies will be allowed, except upon the requisition of the War Department. Recruiting officers are to be appointed for several States, to. re cruit for regular service. ; The reported removal of the Capital from Richmond is incorrect. " The Southern .papers are advocating the abolishing of the elective franchise. The lattest advices from Pensacola repre sent lLat the fight had , not been renewed. Accounts say, that had the fight continued Fort McRae would have been destroyed. No particulars of the affair are given. ' The planters throughout the Southern seaboaid are represented to be destroying their crops, lest they should fall into the hands of the Yankees. A conppiracy of Union men had been discovered in New Orleans, causing great excitement there. Many arrest3 had been made. ' " 

SOMETHING DEFINITE. " There is every indication that something is'to be done by our Government to speedi ly put down the rebellion. We are unable to 6ay what plan of opeiations has been adopted to bring about this most desirable object. Judging from statements made in several of the leaJing 'papers of the coun try, lhe (iscene of conflict is to be changed from, Virginia to South Carolina and Geor gia, and that the "bloody ground" of the army of the West is to be Tennessee and Mississippi instead of Missouri., This is right, j Those States .which led off in this unholy find unjust rebellion, should be made the battle-fields. ; They should be made to feel all the immediate horrors of civil war. Their cities and towns' should be laid in ashes'. Charleston should never more dis grace tho map of the United States. It has always been the hot-bed of a dissatisfied and ungodly'set of politicians. ' Gen. 'Halleck is preparing as fast as pos sible to move the army of the West down the Mississippi, while large numbers of our troops in the East have .been sent to lein force the coast fleet. Sme big strkes right at the heart of the rebellion will; be made soon. v ' ' i i Secretary Chasewhom 'we regard as the man of the Cabinet, in the course of some remarks lately made to the New York Bank cis, V gave strong and pointed assurances thatjlhe. government now saw their way clearly to quiet the rebellion ; that they had information which warranted him in saying that the public would soon hear glad tid ings of success, more startling and more ef fective in their results than those from Port Hoyal and the West ; that neither the Gov ernment nor Gen. r McClellan ever had the least' idea of, placing the army in winter quarters, but, on the contrary, the military plans ; all con t e m plated regular, systematic and energetic activity in pushing I forward upon the rebels as prudence and judgment dictated ; that government had ample funds to supply every liability until 'February 1, and that' all the machinery of the depart ments ; was gradually . woikiag into a very satisfactory state of efficiency." ' ' The Fortress Monroe correspondent of the New York ZfercfW writing on the J9th, says Major General John E. Wool, in an swer to an; application for & furlough to tlayi stated in .reply that he would not give an" officer or a private leave of absence for th.next three weeks, as the campaign then would be over.? What i3 going to be done 2 am not at - liberty.? to say ; but , you may look for some important movements in Ibis department in a short time."; " .1 -" .' This information .coming from high au thority, is significant. , Some grand scheme is evidently oa foot to bring the war to a close, and that speedily. AT Paris letter in the World Bays a num ber,Qf vessels left about two months since with supplies for the Rebels, but returned without disposing of their cargoes. FAX . The people of Missouri are taking steps, by means ; of memorial and petition, to procure, a' remission of the direct tax for national purposes,-, levied by Congress . at its late session, assigning as a reason that the war has utterly ruined portions of their State, and that it will be utterly Impossible to collect the tax in the manner, and time prescribed by law. There would seem to be more and better reasons why Kansas should ask to be relieved from the payment of this direct tax. , ; , ; .The-amount apportioned to Kansas is seventy-one thousand seven , hundred land forty-three dollars, the payment of which must be made by the 13th of June, 1862, under certain prescribed penalties, and two modes are pointed out whereby this tax may be collected. One 'mode is that the State may assume the payment of its quota of the tax and assess and collect in its own way; the other is that the Secretary cf the Treasury may 1 appoint assessors, and col lectors for the purpose of assessing, appor tioning and collecting the same. It is per haps unnecessary to add ' that this tax must be paid in gold and silver. ,:: ' That the State cannot assume the pay ment of this amount is obvious, for. the reason that there is no money in the Treas ury, and the State has not the credit abroad to procure a loan as is evident by the refu sal last spring of New York bankers to ne gotiate Kansas bonds at any price. . .... - The alternative, then, must be the course pursued, and then arises the question, can the people of Kansas pay nearly ' seventy- two thousand dollars by he 13th day of June, 1862. In all newly-settled countiies after the first flood tide of emigration, and with it money, comes the ebb, and this had pretty effectually commenced in 1859; and what little money was left in the country was swallowed by the drouth of 1860. In con sequence of the raw-head and bloody-bones stories told about the. drouth of last year, that Kansas was an arid desert, e'.c, mak ing matters appear much worse than they really were, and by reason of the present troubles, no emigration has come in, and but little business has been done in the year 1861, and at the present time there is no market foi the crop the farmer has grown this season. ! ''' Hence we say that it will be utterly impossible for the people of Kansas to pay this tax in the time and manner prescribed, and we venture the assertion that not one man in five'will be ready to pay his propor tion when called upon so to do. This be ing the case it must be collected by levy and sale, thereby involving a sacrifice of property for one-third or perhaps one half its value. It is an old adag that blood cannot be obtained from a turnip, and it is hardly possible to get money where there is none. It would seem hardly equitable that the people of Kansas should bo harrassed and their property sacrificed in the manner indicated, after the exertions our gallant young State has made in behalf of the Gen eral Government, having at least five men in the field in proportion to her population where any other State has cue. It is therefore suggested that our citizens petition the . Legislature to memoralize Congress to remit this tax; or, if it must be paid, to modify the payment in such a man ner as to render its collection practicable; and also to instruct our Congressional del egation to urge this matter upon Congress and the Administration. " R. 

NEWS OF THE WEEK. ' Gen. Denver, has been ordered -to Fort Scott to take command of the Kansas Brig ade. ' ; ' It is feared that Price and McCulloch are again; advancing on Lexington. It is thought if such is their intention our for ces in that section of Missouri are not suf ficient to drive them back. - A gang of; rebel' desparadoes under: Si. Gordon, stopped the St. Jo. train-at Wes ton on the 28th, and took Captains Moon light and Rabb, of Lane's Brigade prison ers. . .T?bese gentlemen were on. their way from St. Louis, where they had been to pro cure cannon for Lane's Brigade. On Fri day the rebels again surrounded the train, took a large portion of the baggage belong ing to the passengers ' and all the mail and express matter.' The mail was afterwards secured.' We hope this is the last outrage of this kind we shall have to ",-chronicle. The policy indicated by Gen. Hunter by our last' advices will dry it up, if .he car ries it out. At last accounts the prisoners were still- held. ; "Some bridges were burned and the locomotives disabled.- , ,, . A big train 'arrived at Leavenworth a few days ' ago, under '' charge of ' Major Hough. It consisted of 1 60 wagons 2000 exen and twenty-five rebel prisoners. These are some of the trains that were taken by the rebels in Missouri lately. ' ' t ? ! . .- A report wa3 current here a few days ago that Gen. Lane had been taken and hung m Missouri.

Jennison still continues his. w"ork in Jackson county. Mo, He tried and shot a notorious rebel named Fitzpatrick a -few days ago. On his trial the rebel boasted THE 

DIRECT TAX. that he had killed several Union men, and died with a shout for Jeff. Pivis. y , 1, On Saturday last ,Gen?r Hunter sent six companies over into Missouri, to look after fhe rebels in Plait county It is to be hoped they will liberate Captains Eabb and Moonlight. '--' V' ; Reports have reached Kansas City that there are lOjOOO rebels at Pleasant Hill. The" Conservative thinks this "ah exageralioh" but h&s no doubt there is considerable retH el foTce there. We - fear we shall -all bare reason to think the withdrawal of the troops from Springfield, and placing them at St. Louis, a military blunder. - Some of them should have been left down in that region anyhow. Secession was nearly dead in Missouri when Fremont left.' 4 ' ; Gen. Price has issued a proclamation at Neosho for 50,000 men from Missouri to to sustain the Southern cause.. fje says only 5Q0Q men have come from Missouri as yet to aid him. Unless his call Js respond ed to he hidts that all will be lost -and the Lincoln' Hessians will have control of the State. " ' - " The advance guard of Price's forces are working their way up towards Sedalia, com mitting depredations as they go. It is reported that Lexington has again fallen into the hands of the rebels. ; The Tribune' Washington .dispatch of December 1st, says no fear need be enter tained as to the position the President will take concerning the seizure of Mason and Slidell. He will hold that Capt. . Wilkes did rijjht but that he should have seized the steamer Trent also. Mr. Ely, now a prisoner at Richmond, has sent word that he shall take his seat in Congress this session. Reports from Richmond say the rebels are terribly excited concerning Federal op erations on the coast. Southern troops de clare they will go home and leave Virginia to her fate. - ' Upon the renewed application of -George D. Prentice, Secretay Seward, on Saturday, ordered the release of Calhoun Benham and Ex-Senator Gwin, from confinement in Fort Lifayette. The Secretary of the Navy in his report, after mentioning the capture of Mason and Slidell, says that the prompt and decisive action of Captain Wilkes merited and re ceived the emphatic approval of the .Naval Department, and if a too generous forbear ance was exhibited by him in not capturing the vessel which had rebel commissioners on board, it may, in view of special cir cumstances, of its patriotic motives. be ex cused, but it must by.no means-be pe.rmit ted to constitute a precedent hereafter for the treatment of any similar case. : Thirty thousand troops were expected at Fortress Monroe, and an order was read to those there on Monday that they will not be furnished with winter quarters. This seems to indicate an advance.. - .. . The Richmond Dispatch reports 3.000 Unionists in the mountains of East Tennes see under Parson Brownlow and Major Gillham, doing more mischief than the Yankees in Kentucky. Commodore Wilkes had an enthusiastic reception in Boston on the 25th and made the following speech : ..'. 7.. . -j " " "Mr Mayor and Friends : -I am , deeply sensible of the kindness you have shown me. I depended upon.my own judgment in doing what you all' have flattered me for." Applause. ; . Waldo P. Johnson, being 'a rebel, will fail to return to the U. S.

FORT PICKENS. Tuesday V papers brought he ws that Gen . Bragg, of the rebef army had attacked Fort Pickens, and it was thought ?had ;made a breach in the walls with some of j his heavy guns. It was supposed by? many that Col. Brown, whovis in .command of the Fort, would be compelled to surrender, as was the noble Anderson. .. , . . - -: s "But the news b Thursday maij pute quite a different face on Affairs down there. A dispatch from Fortress Monroe, bearing date Ncr. 27, says : v ? :i it J Passengers by a flag of truce from Nor folk ' this' morning,, furnish "'some further news in regard to the fight at Fort Pickens. These particulars, it must be remembered, came through rebel surcrs. Gen. Bragg had not made a breach in the Fort as was before reported. - r - Great excitement was prevalent through the South respecting the battle, but it as thought Bragg would be able to force Col. Brown to surrender. '"' ' ' ' , A messenger arrived from Pensacola on Sunday last with a peremptory order for reintoreements. . Uragg was at tnai ume hopeful of an early success and was reply ing at intervals on the Fortress with great effect. His regular salvos are described as being really terrible. ' The ; General was perfectly cool and confident.'' No breach had yet been made, but on Monday- would be manifest when Bragg expected reinforce ments, and would storm with fresh troops and ordnance. ' Col. Brown had concentre: ted a perfect storm of shot and shell 1 upon the navy yard, burning ; it down, together with all the out-buildings, and a considera ble amount of ordnance stores.' Pensacola had been evacuated by order of Gen. Bragg. ' Col. Brown had called to his assistance five vessels of war. all of which had been driven off by the batteries. The frigate Niagara was riddled with shot, and the Col orado and Monougahela were disabled.' Gen'. Bragg had declared to his men that he would never, surrender alive, and tne greatest enthusiasm prevailed among the men. . ; ' On Tuesday Gen. Bragg would engage Col, Brown in front and land a large force on the Island so as to take him in the rear. : . ,It i3 generally believed that an action has taken place at Pensacola between oUr forces and the rebels, and that Bragg has been whipped, Pensacola burned, and probably Bragg's 'whole force captured. The dis patches in, the Southern papers have no ap parent' end. nor beginning, and are' very meagre. '.'.' '; '. ' THAT'S THE TALK. It is evident that Gen. Hunter is not go ing to fool away much time with the petty horde of rebels, thieves and robbers of Platte .county, .Missouri. The .Conserva tive of the 3d inst. says : , ' A . committee of the citizens of Platte county visited Gen. Hunter yesterday. The General said to them : Tell the Trustees of Platte county that unless they give up Gordon and bis gang and break up every rebel camp, that I shall send Col. Jennison over there with orders to burn every house in the cpiinty.5'' I am getting tired of this whole subject.' i! 1 " -; '. -: Committee Will vou put that in wrii ing? -". ;;' : ; .' - ?" ' Gen.Hunte'lyi.' v -;. ' That brief interview satisfied Platte coun ty, and the policy indicated will satisfy Kansas and the country." 4 . If Gen. Hunter carresout the policy thus indicated, he will do to bet on. Hurrah for Hunter, 6ay we ! ' . Advance Down the RiYer. 1 The following we take from the St Louis correspondence of the Cincinnati Enquirer: A large force is at work on the gun-boats and mortar fiats, 'and 'all will be' sent' for ward to Cairo within the present week.' The engagement of steamers for transportation of troops and supplies, &c, will not at all be dimcult, Tor the tunnage laid up at this port and now idle,' is immense and ample to carry '100,' 000 men. i General Halleck has not yet intimated his policy, but as "straws show.which way the wind 'blows," so do preparations and movements, indicate the future advance of our army. Co-operating with the forces in Kentucky, Gen. Halleck will '.move on to Ten ne see overlt-nd and down the Mississippi river, and the opinion is now entertained that by the 1st of March the Union forces will have complete posess ion of that State, and possibly be on their onward march further south.

A gentleman just from Henry county, who passed down' on the train,' denies the report that he is in Ulinton county, ine truth seems to1, be, that that portion of the army which is composed of Missourians is disbanding.
