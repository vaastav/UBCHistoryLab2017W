2 Gila Passes All High Water Records through train that crosses the river on the Mar'copa and Phoenixybrtdge. GOVERNMENT WORKS SAVED Locally the greatest interest lies In the RooseVelt storage dam being built by the Government seventy miles above Phoenix on Salt River to create the largest artificial lake in the world. A terrific flood came down Tuesday, but fortunately the contractors were warned and had their work in good condition "to .withstand the strain. They removed their machinery from the canyon and damage will be confined to less of time and injury to colter dams which it will take some time to repair. A big volume of water Is still running today, but Is falling slowly. . The work of beginning repairs to cof ferdam wlttbe attempted tomorrow, it is said, but* hey and the rock dam site, according to telephone message this evening, are still under water. T7lth appalling- suddenness the Gila River rose yesterday and swept down from the mountains in which it takes It rise in a turgid flood. The swift melting of the snows in the ranges of Southeastern Arizona combined with, the numerous cloudbursts that have as sailed the territory is given as the reasons for the raise In the water. It carried away a bridge on the Mari <*opa and Phoenix and Salt River Val ley Railway as if it had been made of straw, flooding the low lying lands and damaging the orchards and vineyards that have been planted In the valley. By the destruction of the bridge Phoe nix is cut off from communication with the Southern Pacific Railroad, though the officials said yesterday that it would take only a few days to restore the railroad. The greatest harm that the Gila does when in flood Is when It joins the Colo rado a little north of Tuma. The land on both the Arizona and California sides Is low and ;the Gila and the Colo rado backwater fill the .depressions and convert the country north of Tuma into a huge lake. To the north of Tuma and subject to the overflow of the two streams is the land on which the Government is build ing its dam at a point called the La guna Dam. and the question arises whether this work will be damaged by the Gila River joining the Colorado. There are a sr-rles of elaborate levees along the Gila to protect Tuma, and whenever the river is In turbulent mood large gangs are employed to strengthen- the banks. The railroad people are anxiously \u25a0watching the progress of the Gila. In past years It has swelled the volume In the Colorado to dangerous proportions, and - the effect this increased tide may have on the protective works the Southern Pacific has recently built south of Tuma to restrain the Colorado within Its proper channel is naturally awaited with 111-coneealed fear. The December and January floods are among the w<Jrst on the Colorado River, and though the railroad people say they feel confident that the intake where the water is taken to irrigate Imperial Valley Is sufficiently strong to withstand the onslaughts of the river there is. of course, some anxiety.- Both RandclrtKsatid Cory insisted that the railroad should be left on f!ie banks of the levee so that mater'iil could be promptly rushed to any break I and with such a vigilant man on hand j as Engineer Cory the Southern Pacific j Is inclined to the belief that should ! there be any accident to the newly made levees they would be mended In short. order and no great damage re r sult- } MAP SHOUTNG SECTION OF ARIZONA INUNDATED BY THE GILA HIVBR FLOOD, AND THE DAM THAT IS THREATENED WITH BEING CARRIED AWAY BY THE RUSH OF WATERS.
