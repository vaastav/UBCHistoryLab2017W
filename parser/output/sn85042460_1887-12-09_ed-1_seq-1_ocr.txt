XXIX. mencement of two additional armor clad vessels to cost, exclusive of arma ment, a sum not exceedingstio,l,oo() one to bit built by contact and tin other in one of tlie navy yards. He also asks for authority to build three more fast cruisers of toe highest type, The report of tho chief constructor states that but four of tlie present cruisers w 11 remain serviceable at the end of six years, and that the present navy will "have disappeared. Atten tion' is called to the considerations presented in that report in reference to tlie provi-ioo of additional facilities for naval work on the Pacific coast, especial y in the neighborhood tf Puget Sound, the great coal and iron region of the future upon that coast, ipart from this question of an addition al naval station, measures should cer tainly betaken to place the only naval station now existing upon the coast, that at San Francisco, in a fully equipped condition. 

OCEAN SURVEYS. In reference to tho continuance of ocean surveys, It appears highly de sirable that rocks and slioals reported toexi-tinlhe Pacific ocean and the Car ri bean Sea, hut no', put down on charts, should be searched for and lo cated. SHIPBUILDING. Under tho head of shipbuilding, the report sayi: "It is beliovop that oar private ship yards c in produce War ships equal and perhaps superior to those produced elsewhere, when these industries shall havo bean established, tt is notably in this connection that the efforts of the department to raise tho standard of material for ships has resulted in a class of material believe 1 to bo superior to any ever produced for any similar purpose. Especially has the steel matte upon tho Pacific coast been notable for its durability in the construction of cruisers. These facts may mark an important event in its iudustii 1 history. MORE MEN WANTED. The report concludes by savin;:: "A point has now been reached when an increase in the number of officers and men is absolutely required by the demands of the service. It is not possible for tho present limited com plement to perform efficiently the duties imposed on it. The number of second-lieutenants is now tiiteen. and is subject to further reduction. At the same time promotion iv higher grades IS blocked. 'Iho number of enlisted men is also inadequate. At none of tlie shore stations are there enough inoii to carry on duty, and numerous vacancies exist in the truards of vessels, which it is i Qpossi ble to fill. On the Pacific station alone there are no less than thirty in ile members on corps, and the con sequent overwork leads to frequent desertions In view of these facts I strong l }' recommend that the number of officers bo increased, and that the com idem oit of enli-ted men bo raised by the addition of 50J privates.

Washington, December B.—The Republican National Committee was called to order at the Arlington Hotel this morning, by Chairman Jones, who briefly stated that tho purpose of the meeting was to select a time and place f >r holding the next National Convention. He said: ''We may congratulate ourselves upon the improved p os pects of the Republican party since tho National Committee met in this city four years ago for the same pur pose that WO are now assembled. \t. that time the majority against the Republican party iv the North at the last preceding^State elections counte I up in the hundreds of thousands.

PBBBTIOB OF SUCCESS, The signs are uti-pieious for tho elec tion of a Republican President in 1888. The momentum acquired by twenty five ye ir*' prevalence of Republican principles has not yet lost its force, and Ihe material interests oi the coun try are si ill prosperous as a result of Republican industrial legislation. Re cent utterances, however, indicate a determination to end this prosperity by advi rso legislation forced up in the country by an udminislralion hostile to American Industry, and also indi cate the necessity of a return to power of the lie publican parly in the national government., so that American li dllß try, wool growing and sugar raising equally with iron making and textile production, may have continued pros perity, and employes in these indus tries get the constant employ ment and continued good wages American work men shonld receive." The roll was then called, and everj Slate anil Territory, uith one or two exceptions, was represented by dele gate or proxy. 

PRESENT VTION OF DELEGATES, The c nominee on invitation of the National League decided to adj iurn the meeting to the League headquar ters, and when tho committee reas sembled it was finally decided that fifteen minutes sliou d be accorded each delegation to present the claims of the different cities. The first delegation admitted was that from Minnesota, who urged the claim of Minneapolis. Windom advocated the northwest as the place for holding the national convention. (ieneral Henderson of Missouri, spokesman of a large delegation fa voring St. Louis, presented the plans of tho St. Louis Music Hall, and argueil that tho hotel and railroad ac commodations were excelled by none. He promised in behalf of the press fairness to all candidates. Mayor Roche detailed the conven iences of Chicago, which, he said, were better than any city. Senator Cullom spoke earnestly in favor of Chicago, and made a brief resume of tho hotel, railroad and tel egraphic facilities of the city of Chi cago. Senator Manaerson spoko for Omaha, which he sai l would Supply the presidential candidates with head quarters ireo of charge. Congressman Butterworth pre sented Cincinnati as a place pecu liarly suited for tho convention Marat Hal stead seconded Butter worth in favoring Cincinnati.

Washington, December 8. — Tho annual report of the Secretary of the Navy was made public to-day. Con aiderab'o space is given to statistics and details of the operations of the various branches of the service, which are not of general interest, t.ie re port, says that many diffien'ties: stood in the way of the creation of a credita ble new navy. During the last year many of those have been removed, and if it is the will of the country that we be possessed of a navy able to maintain tho honor and dignity of the government,, it can now readily be ac complished. The most notable fact connected with the work of last year concerns cruisers, Numbers 4 and 5. Congress, by act of legislation, litßt winter put to a test the ability of the department, an lof American ship builders hy the construction of c nis ers having the highest standard. The requirements of the law have been observed, and th-se cruisers are now under contract with adequate security of the results to be attained. Ameri can shipbuilders have In these con tracts placed themselves on a line With tlie foremost in the world. TORPEDO WARFARE. Touching on the subject of torpedo boats and pneumatic dynamite guns, the report says: "To sum up tins matter, the Department deems It an wise to follow at present the course of European powers In building unpro tected torpedo boats. It recognizes the power of the dynamite projectile, and believes it practicable to embody it in such a manner a* will insure its reaching any'desired object of attack in spite, of knqwn weapons, and upon that problem the Department la no* engaged, The pneumatic dynamite gun has been developed by private enterprise to a point where It meets imme Itate attention. Against its method of attack neither nets nor machine guns are of any considerable use. There are, however, questions yet to be settled before its efficiency for naval purposes can be fully de termined. For coast and harbor de fen«e. to be fired fro n laud batteries, its accuracy is substantially estab- Hshed, but for naval purposes other dements of difficulty intervene.

Public feeling seems to exist for the creation of a naval reserve and com mittees of the Chambers of Commerce of New York and San Francisco have passed resolutions urging the organ ization of each a force as a means of providing for 00Mt defense aud meet ing tho increased demands on the naval establishment for men and ves sels upon an outbreak of war. T' c department has informed itself fully of tho different systems of organiza tion for coast defense and naval re serves at present in force in foreign countries, and is prepared to formulate a general plan for a similar organiza tion lo meet the requirements and conditions of our own institutions. In the time ot war, troopships or trans ports are in great demand. Several European governments have an an nual contribution based on tonnage to companies constructing new vessels. A notable illustration of the gener osity with which England pushes her shipping interest is seen in the man ner in which she is dealing with her 

TRADE lit THB NORTH TACIPIC. U has been thus far principally un der the American flag and contribu tory to San Francisco and the United States. The British government ami Canada together are proposing the es tablishment of lines of first class steamers from Vancouver to Japan and a subsidy is likely to be paid of $130,000 tinnttally, $45,000 from F.ng land aud sflS.OdJ from Canada. This will also bo contributed from the na val reserve fund, probably $5 per ton annually for each ship constructed for the route, which will increase tho aum to probably $125,000. Under such competition it is quite easy to conjecturo what will become of the American flag and our resources in tho North Facific. NKW SHU'S ASKED FOB.
