The statement of Alderman Gill, in the Common Council, that money had been demanded by Aldermen as a consideration for votes in that body for certain candi dates for office, can be sustained by ample evidence. "NVe have been waited upon by two citizens, both well known, one of them a former city oflicial, whoso personal char acter is beyond reproach, who informs us that a direct and unequivocal demand was made upon them for money, and that the assurance was given to each that if the money was paid he would bo elected. Tho demand in both cases was made by a mem ber of the Board of Aldermen. It is hardly necessary to say that, the money being re fused in both cases, neither of the persons was elected. How far the inference that the persons elected did pay, is a just one, can readily be ascertained upon investiga tion. One of these gentlemen, by way of testing the earnestness of the blackmailer, asked if there could be no reduction made, or if $059 would not be accepted iu place of the S3OO demanded ; to which the answer was made that the S3OO was the price .fixed for the office. The applicant then offered to pay the S3OO to the Relief Society, or to any charitable insti tution iu the city, leaving tho Alderman to M*lcct it. This was laughed at. The oiler was then made to give three notes, payable respectively in 3, C and 0, mouths, the notes to state the consideration ; and, of course, this was refused. The applicant, refusing to pay the money, was told that ho could not have the office, and the interview was closed. It should be stated that the candidate was in formed by one Alderman that it was neces sary that ho should at once go to a place designated, to meet another Alderman, and this last-named Alderman, in behalf of tho majority of the Council, made the demand. We can state that the person of whom this blackmail was demanded was, perhaps, one cf the most experienced and competent men iu Chicago for the office he sought, and that the person elected has no knowledge what ever of the business which he is elected to superintend. We do not choose to discuss this subject further atthis time. Wehave stated enough lo require an investigation. The names of the persons will be given to any committee of investigation that may bo appointed. Wc will wait until it can be seen whether the Council dare refuse to order an investiga liou, to be conducted by a competent and unimpeachable committee. Should tho Com mon Council refuse such action, we trust there is some Judge in this county who has courage enough to order the empanelling of a special grand jury to investigate the facts, and to indict every man iu the Council guilty of this unblushing knavery. THE DESPOTISM OF THE CAUCUS. King Caucus showed his form in the Sen ate. on Tuesday, in his most sinister and threatening aspect, rendering it apparent that the legislation of Congress during the ensuing session is likely to he coerced by Hint unscrupulous potentate even more despotically than before. It will he for the press, and other organs of popular expres sion having regard to the purity of legisla tion, to give some attention to this caucus business, before it shall become too serious for cure. The power of the canons has heen develop ing and extending with fearful rapidity dur ing the past two years. It was not until last spring, on the opening of the preliminary session of the present Con gress. that Morton, the chief emissary and grand factotum of King Caucus, ven -1 mod to assert tlie prerogative of that newly-risen tyrant to dictate to Congress what business should and what should not be considered during the session. There were other high-handed acts of the star chamber managers, such as the deposition of Sumner, the confirmation of improper Ex ecutive appointments, etc., for which some color of precedent might be alleged ; but for this obstruction of legislation there was none : the thing was an innovation—a revo lution,—as unjustifiable by precedent or cus tom as it was by any inherent merits. Nev ertheless, as the session referred to was ex pected to be a very short one, the caucus plan did not meet with any active opposi -1 ion. and the tabooed topics of legislation were not insisted on. Now, however, comes the same caucus jun to and proposes to impose the same restric tions uj)on the iirst session proper—the long session, as it is called, since the other main session of each Congress is limited hi* law to three months,—fixing fan early day for ad journment, and escludiugfrom consideration all subjects except the routine business aud certain political affairs which it is for the in terest of the caucus manipulators to have attended to—by the caucus, of course. Tlie object of this policy is evident. The desire of the intelligent and patriotic mass of the Republican party (and of the people generally, we trust) for certain vital re forms in the systems aud policy of our gov ernment, is unequivocal. So far as t he voice of the people, expressed, not through the press alone, but through many formal and official channels, can instruct a legisla ture, Congress has already been instructed to adojit certain reforms in the revenue sys tem. and to consider with great care and pa lieni discussion certain other reforms,—nota bly that of the civil service. There arc also grave matters concerning the national finan ces to discuss, which, with due deliberation, will absorb much time, as will the subjects above mentioned. To shut off all agitation of these questions, and postpone legislation upon them until after the ensuing Presidential election, is the obvious purpose of the caucus junto in the attempted resolution for an adjournment in May. These crafty wire-workers (and we refer particularly to those operating in the Sen ate caucus) arc as averse to any of the pro posed reforms as the people are favorable to them: and their scheme now is, to put the country off with the barren promises, or promises, of the President’s message, instead of doing any of the beneficent acts which the pressure of popular opinion has forced the President to hint at In his mes sage,—hints which, without appropriate leg islation, are mere Dead-Sea apples, instead of the fruits which the enlightened sentiment of the present day ought to bear, provided that sentiment is properly represented in our halls of legislation. In furtherance of this scheme, Mr. Mor ton’s resolution for an early adjournment was taken up, by a coalition of the Demo crats with the caucus Republicans. All i.mendments and substitutes, intended to so modify the action upon the resolution as to leave open an opportunity for action upon the subjects of popular interest which, it is t he desire of Mortou to suppress, were voted down at the crack of the caucus whip; and, to cap all, the session of the Senate was re solved, first into an executive session, aud then into a caucu*, for the final disposition of the whole work of the session. It is plain that the stewards of the Federal patronage and tent ers for Presidential campaigns cannot trust the affairs which they have in charge to the fair aud open discussion of the Senate Chamber. The question then be comes. Can the people trust their affairs to be thus discussed; or do they prefer to have them settled by a dark-lantern junto, with some of the most mercenary-minded and unscrupulous politicians in the country to dictate the terms ? Do the people of Amer ica. who choose two hundred and forty-three Representatives and seventy-four Senators to do their legislation, wish to have that ]i gislalion dictated by twenty-nine Seua . .. ;-:e the men who have flic least character, and are the most likely to bo in fluenced by mercenary considerations? If not, they must frown down the caucus sys tem, which brings about precisely this re sult. There are fifty-seven Senators who were elected as Republicans. Any twen tj'-nino of these can control a caucus, even when all the Senators turn out. Those who are most likely to bo active in party chicanery are the worse class of politicians,— those who obtained their places by finesse, by log-rolling, or by absolute bribery. Hence these twenty-nine—and the people can readily understand of what material the number is most likely to bo made up—can, according to the rules of the caucus, dictate the policy of the majority in the Senate. Hence, to prevent all progress in legislation, especially such ns is calculated to turn rogues and imbeciles out of office, all that is necessary is for these twenty-nine to assemble by the light of their dark lan tern, with their chief Ku-Klux, Morton, in the centre of the circle, to cry “ The Party! The Party !” and to give orders what bills shall be received by the Senate, and what shall be burked. He does so, audio! what mere ciphers are the conscientious and dis creet majority of the Senate, supposing there be a majority of such! What powerless phantoms the two or three hundred freshly chosen representatives of the people in the Lower House! We say “Lower House,” be cause that has become the usual designation of the popular body in Congress; yet no body could be lower than the American Sen ate is sure to become after a few years of caucus domination, such as has now been in augurated. The question is, "Will the people allow their Senate to become so debased ? Will they permit a revolution in the most vital rules and practices of legislation, which is inimical to freedom of speech, which diverts all responsibility of delegatcd s actlon, and which not only throws tho power to control all law making and law-administering into. tho hands of a few men, but inevitably throws it into the hands of those who nro the least worthy to wield such power ? Will a party composed of such intelligent material as the Republican party hold its representatives in Congress amenable to the behests of Morton and his clique—the Nyes, Stewarts, Spencers, Pomeroys, and carpet-hag misrepiesentatives of the oppressed South—rather than to their own moral convictions and their own inter pretation of the popular judgment ? We do not behove they will. On tho contrary, we expect to see such an agitation of this sub ject, and such a general condemnation of tho growing iniquity* of the caucus system, as shall bring out the more upright and discreet of the Senators, one by one. from under tho yoke of the caucus despotism, and place them erect in their own manliness and sense of rectitude before the grand assem blage of the people, to whom alone they are rightfully responsible. THE 

CENSUS OF GREAT BRITAIN. Tlie Registrars-General for England, Scot land, and Ireland are now engaged in tlio arrangement of the census returns ; and the preliminary abstracts which have just made their appearance in public show gome very interesting, and,it maybe added,unpleasant facts. According to these abstracts, the population of the United Kingdom is grow ing at the rate of 1,173 persons a day,, of whom 705 stay at home and 408 emigrate. The proportion of men among these emigrants is so great that there is a rather startling unevenness in the proportion of the sexes, as has happened in a smaller degree in some of onr own New England States, where the dis proportion has heen caused by emigration westward. In a population of nearly 3*3,000,000, the women outnumber the men by {>25,000. The English Registrar-General tabes coni fort in the thought that the sexes at adult age are equal in num ber, and that the excess of men can he found somewhere else. He finds them in the United States. How this helps the case we do not exactly see, unless the Regis trars-General, especially the Irish Registrar, shall contrive in some manner to send over the 025,000 women, or a certain proportion of them, to our shores, each bent upon reducing the disproportion. In various parts of our country the number of women exceeds the* number of men in the native-born population; Americans, as a rule, marry Americans ; and there must, therefore, he doubt that the 025.000 husbands can ho found for the extra female population of the United Kingdom, as the number stands in no immediate danger of reduction by American intermarriage. A brighter out look, it seems to us, is found for this army of spinsters in the fact that emigration is de creasing. In the ten j'cars ending in ISGI over two millions of persons came to this country, while during the past ten years the number only amounts to 1,074,501, or nearly 380.000 fewer. The results of the census in Ireland are un usually interesting. The population is still diminishing. In IS4I it was 8,000,000; inlSsl it fell to 0,500,000; and now, in 1871, it is only 5,402,750, a diminution of 300,208 in ten years. This diminution is chiefly in the rural dis tricts. Galway shows the largest per cent of decrease, the population having sunk more than 22 per cent in ten years. There are only live places which mark any increase, and three of these are in Ulster. The suburbs of Dublin show an increase of 4,450, but that is more than offset by a decrease of 0,080 in the population of the city. Belfast, the centre of Irish manufacture, has increased more than 43 per cent in ten years, and Londonderry has increased its pop ulation by 4,307. The diminution in the re ligions memberships is very uneven. There arc hut 258 Jews in Ireland, a decrease of 35 per cent since ISCI. The members of the dis established Church have decreased 13-4 per cent; the Presbyterians, Methodists, Bap tists, andlndependents 4 per cent; while the Roman Catholic decrease is more than S per cent. The population of Scotland, on the other hand, is increasing. Its population is 3,358,013, an increase of 290,310 in ten years. The prin cipal towns have increased 21 per cent; the large towns 22 per cent; aud the smaller 7 1-2 percent. The population of the principal cities is as follows: Glasgow, 477,141, an in crease of over SO,OOO since 1801; Edinburgh, 100,500; Dundee, 118,074; Aberdeen, 83,125 ; and Grccucck, 57,138,—these live cities being the only ones in Scotland whoso population exceeds 50,000. In summing up the results of the census, the London Daily JVcirs, to which we are in debted for the facts enumerated above, says: On the whole, the survey of these returns is full of encouragement. During the past ten years the country has gone through a series of commer cial disasters, and has come out again into the sunshine of prosperity. Ireland lias probably touched the lowest point, for the rate of emigra tion and of decrease is sensibly decreasing. The increase in the other parts of the United King dom is the healthy growth of great trading com munities, and is more likely to go on at acceler ating pace than to relax or stop. It is evident that ex-Governor Haight, of California, is on good terms with the report ers of the press. An exploit of his has just been reported by telegraph, as one which has been “highly applauded by all classes.” On examining into the particulars of this ex ploit, we find that it consisted in mustering his military staff in full force, aud turning eut the militia to parade, on the occasion of his own outgoing aud Governor Booth’s in going. Considering the repugnance w’ith which Governors aud otherpubllc men usual ly regard display of all kinds, the act of Gov ernor Haight was almost phenomenally hero ic. And, it being heroic, it is fortunate that the genial ex-Governor is, as already hinted, on good terms with the telegraphic corre spondents, that the act may bo duly cele brated. Al>out thirteen mouths ago, tho city of Chicago entered into a contract with the Astronomical Society of this city to make arrangements for giving a correct register of time from the Court House. Under that contract, the Astronomical Society made a canvass among our business men, and raised a fund, which was applied to the purchase of a clock that was placed in the Court House dome only a few weeks before tho fire. Tho hours had, however, been struck on tho boll, by electricity, for about nino months, ior this service tho city agreed to pay to tho Astronomical Society the same amount per annum which it had previously paid to tho. day-watchman in the cupola,—his services bciug then dispensed with. Some two weeks after tho tiro tho Astronomical Society addressed a communication to the Board of Public Works, ottering to furnish the time yrath in future,—the supposition bo THE CHICAGO TRIBUNE - THURSDAY, DECEMBER 14. 1871. ing that the city would bo too poor to pay for such service,—and now stands ready to furnish to the city, without charge, the'cor rect time, as often as may bo required, for any clock, large or small, which it may desig nate for that purpose. Under such circum stances it is rather carious that the Common Council, at its last meeting, should deem it necessaiy to appoint another party as City Time-Keeper, especially when it is remem bered that the register of time kept at the Chicago Observatory is the only authority in this section of the country. The House of Representatives has passed a hill to pay government laborers ton hours’ wages for eight hours* work. It is stated that this hill, if it becomes a law, will result in giving the laborers on the public works at Rock Island SOO,OOO as backpay. Probably $1,000,000 will be required to pay the so-called arrearages of all kinds of government labor ers in all parts of the country; and all laborers not in government employment will be taxed to make np the alleged deficiency, as well as to pay the future increase of wages. The effect of this hill is to create anaristoc. racy or privileged class of laborers, to-wit: those getting ten hours* pay for eight hours’ work, as distinguished from those who get eight hours’ pay for eight hours’ work. Employment on government works, such as arsenals, ship-yards, etc., becomes a species of office-holding, whore there will, of course, bo a hundred applicants for every place. The trades-unions seem to think that, if they can persuade two or three hundred members of Congress to vote away other people’s money* in this manner, the fashion of paying ten hours’wages for eight hours’work will be come so popular that all employers of labor will adopt it. Instead of having this effect, it will, so far as it has any effect at all, work in tho opposite direction, for, to whatever extent tho employers of labor are taxed to pay the workmen in government shops more wages than they now earn, to that extent exactly will they be disabled from paying to their own laborers what they really do earn. It is well known that hundreds, perhaps thousands, of policies of insurance were de stroyed on tho oth of Octoher.with the other papers of our business men, This is, proba bly, true also of the policies of large num bers of families, who. in the hurry and con fusion of leaving their homes, forgot their insurance papers iu some bureau, or table, drawer, or corner of a closet. In cases where an individual had any considerable number of policies destroyed, it is most likely that he cannot tell tho names of all the companies in which ho is insured, or, if he remembers them, the cx actaiuountsfor which each policy was issued. Is it not, therefore, the duty of the Chi cago companies, and of those of other States and foreign countries having agencies in this city, to publish from their books a com plete list of the insured, and tho amounts at risk on each particular piece of property;? Surely none of them propose to take advan tage of the loss of a policy' to add its value to the assets of the company. That would bo so flagrant a breach of honesty' and fair dealing that to attempt it would bo infa mous. fEach company shouldmako outacom plcte list of its policies issued on Chicago property', and hang it np in its office for the nspection of the public. The Legislature would, perhaps, render an important service if, in the new revenue law, a provision should he inserted requiring counties and cities to report annually tothq State Auditor a full statement of the amount of taxation levied by them respectively, to gether with a statement of the valuations, the amount of tax collected, the cost of col lection, and the amount of debt outstand ing, incurred or paid off each year. In the State of Ohio, all taxes are levied and collected at one time. The tax sta tistics of the thirty-two cities of that State are now published. The valuation of real estate for 1871 is $253,231,000: of personal prop erty, $135,830,873; total, $380,001,003. The rate of tax for State purposes •is two and nine-tenths mills. The rates for local purposes range from 14 mills in Paines villc to 22 mills in Cincinnati and mills in Sandusky. The amount of levies for local purposes aggregate $7,850,780, of which $3,480,- 005 are in Cincinnati. The total tax levied in these cities for’State and local purposes amounts to $8,088,0**5. There is but one valu ation of real and personal property for all taxable purposes in Obio, and this ought to he the way here. It is required by the con stitution, and nothing is gained by resorting to two assessments for two different kinds of taxes. The good people of Canada are disappointed in their census returns. The papers are lilled with communications advising the govern ment what to do to fill up Canada. It ap pears that the immigration is large, but it does not remain in the Provinces, nor docs the native population stay there. Largo numbers of young men annually leave for the States, and come back no more. The increase in population, notwithstanding the large immigration, does not keep pace with the ordinary natural increase of the same number of persons elsewhere. One writer proposes a large system of colonization, for the clearing of the Canadian forests. The plan is for the government to borrow $20,000,000 upon the laud, and expend the money in wages among the settlers, in building roads, in clearing lots of twenty acres in each one hundred, and in building log houses and barns. The per sons thus employed, it is argued, will be come attached tfcthc soil, will purchase the land, and repay the outlay. It does not seem ever to occur to the Canadians that, the more they adapt their laws, customs, and institutions to those of the States, the less motive is left for persons to leave that coun try to come to this. The Chicago Relief and Aid Society have established a Labor Bureau on the Court House square, at which all able-hodiod men out ofcmploj'meutand asking relief fromtho society’s agents are required to report. Per gons wanting laborers of any kind will lindas many as they can employ at this place, and it is hoped that contractors and builders will take pains to call or send to this bureau, as they can do much in this way to promote the economical disbursement and use of the relief fund. We learn that a committee, representing the Netv York Chamber of Commerce fund, which has some six hundred thousand dol lars subscribed for the relief of sufferers by the October tires (principally for Chicago), was here lost week looking into the opera tions of the Relief and Aid Society and the needs of the sufferers, aud that a report will shortly bo made to the Chamber of Com merce on the subject. Wo presume that this report will bo a suflicient answer to all the anonymous accusations brought against the society, including that to which the Cincinnati Gazette recently gave prominence. It is reported from Washington that Gov ernor Palmer has an agent there laboring for the removal of tbo army (four companies, supposing them to have arrived) which the government has stationed in Chicago, aud threatening, unless this is done, to fulminate another proclamation. This is hard, very hard, and wo beg the Governor to reconsider his determination, if that is possible. If not, will His Excellency, since he is so staunch a stickler for constitu tional forms, point out to the people the pas sage, either iu the Constitution of the United States or that of the State of Hlinois, which prohibits the government from having a mil itary station iu the city of Chicago aud keep ing troops thereat? —The Nc tv Orleans Republican, a paper ostab Hshed by the late Lieutenant Governor Dunn, and edited by one of bis race, states that the Lieutenant Governor was never in a condition of servitude, thus exploding tho some what dramatic statement that he once escaped from slavery, and got advertised, in consequence, as a runaway in the Picayune newspaper. His father was a free man of color, named James, a native of Virginia, and worked in Now Orleans for many years as a stage car penter in tho Camp street theatre. Tho state ment that Governor Dunn left a largo property is also denied. Ho was always a poor man, afaet "reatly to his credit, inasmuch as latterly ho en joyed rare opportunities to enrich himself by selling his influence to the lobby in attendance at the Legislative sessions. -Au elherialized Ruloff is delighting spiritual seances at Ithaca, N.

FEES OF THE RECORDER AND OTHERS. The Committee on Finance, to whom was re ferred tho communication of tho Circuit Clerk, reported the following resolution: Kesolted, That in tho opinion of this hoard tho foes oi the offlees of Sheriff. Clerks of tho several courts and of the Recorder of Deoils hereafter elected should too so adjusted as to cover tho expenses thereof in cluding b reasonable salary, ro tho officer in each ease not higher than is compatible with Just economy ami a fair rewan! for tho services- rendered and rosnonsi. toilltles assumed.

Commissioner Stearns thought the board was far more capable of judging of such matters than any committee of the Legislature. Commissioner Ashton thought there was too much economy attempted. Commissioner Stearns thought there could not be too much economy. God rbrbid that tho coun ty should ho asked to pay such taxes as they had boen paying. He wanted the Finance Commute© to lix the maximum amount, and then lot tho Legislature tlx that amount. Then if they did not like it the new constitution gave thorn the privilege of resigning their office. He plead for tho tax-payers of tho burnt city, and hoped that the board wouldnot go hackouhlm. Commissioner Crawford moved that the report of the officers of the different courts bo to tho hoard. Commissioner Harrison thought it would bo better to amend the report before adopting it, and discuss it in open board. Tho Chair explained that tho information tho committee had was to arrange the fee bills im mediately. The report was intended to prevent unreasonable fee bills, but at the same time the fees of tho officers wore not to ho so small as to throw tho burden on the county. Ho thought it would bo proper to add another resolution re questing the Legislature to lix the salaries under a certain sum. Conmiißßioner Talcott said ho thought it an almighty had law which proposed to tux a man no cents a month for continuance of cases, lie agreed with Sir. Stearns. Ho had worked with a number of men for twenty-five years, and though they were in the habit of strik ing he never had any difficulty. Ho would tell them that they mighttakotheirmoneyandtravel. The same thing applied to tho officers. Ho thought a resolution or hoard would hare more weight at Springfield than the wholo number of petitions and suggestions of tho Clerks of tho va rious courts. Commissioner Ashton presented tho following amendment: To strike ont, in the second resolu tion,the words *■* the committee of the State Legis lature having the subject in charge,” and insert instead, “theßoard of Commissioners of Cook County.” The amendment was carried, and tho report adopted. 

FEES OF THE WARDEN OF THE COUNTY HOSPITAL The Committee on Hospital, to whom was re ferred the fixing of salaries of employes and Agent of the County, reported, recommending that the salary of tho Warden of the County Hos pital be Saco. The commute further reported that the Board of Supervisors had entered mto a con tract with George Dotson to furnish fuel and help for $2,300 pc’r annum. Tho report was concurred in. CERTIFIED RILLS ALLOWED, The Committee on Miscellaneous Claims, to whom were referred sundry hills for printing and stationery, amounting to $1,437.25, reported. The committee added that the bills were duly certified by tho Judges, Sheriff, and Clerks of tho several courts. The bills returned without their approval were those not properly certified. Tho committee recommended that steps be taken to stop the purchase of goods for the county generally. Except by some duly authorized agent, whose duties shall Uo defined bv tho board. Tho report was concurred iu. REMINDERS. The Chair rcmlnuCi !) ,n number of responses had been made to uic iuvlrr»tisll of the board to real estate dealers to exhibit their books. Ho would like to know what time would ho appointed to examine them. The Chair also reminded tho board that the assessments for levying tho taxes had been ren dered of no use, and that the necessary action by tho Legislature should, if possible, bo postponed. Commissioner Talcott wanted the members from Cook Comity to attend to business. They had not attended to their knitting; had dropped a good many stitches lateley. He wanted a resolu tion addressed to them. Commissioner Hitchcock moved the following resolution: WuniiKAS, immediate legislative action is impera tively demanded to enable Cook County to levy State, county, and town taxes; therefore, Jfaoltfd, That the members of tho General Assem bly of Cook County be requested to press such resolu tion upon the attention of the General Assembly.

An Insurance Swindle* To the Editor of The Chicago Tribune: The city is in rapid process of reconstruction. Millions of dollars are about to be invested in the erection of buildings of every description. Enor. mous stocks of merchandise are pouring in from all quarters to swell the commerce of Chicago. The owners of this vast wealth will no doubt re sort largely to insurance to protect themselves against loss. It is proper, therefore, that wo should study carefully thetessons taught by the late conflagration. Principles of insurance should hereafter bo more strictly exam ined by the property-holder, and the character of each company be carefully scrutinized by all per sons intending to insure. It may be safely laid down as a rule. that.if ever a man bo detected in a scheme to cheat or defraud* his neighbor, he would lie marked from that moment as a man to be avoided in the future. This principle has be come familiar to every one, and is embodied in a thousand forms of popular maxims. Applying it to insurance companies, we may safely infer that companies which have sought, by deception, or by taking advantage of the necessities of the times, to extort from tho policy-holder that which does not legally or morally belong to them, are not tho companies to whom tho great insur ance interests of the fntnre should bo entrusted,. Strictness on the part of all companies in requir ing the insured to mako fall, complete, and de tailed proof of loss, no one is disposed to object to. This strictness may sometimes, smatter of the by crtechnicai, but it certainly is a right of the company to require it. The loss, however, having been once adjusted to the satisfaction of the company, which thereby constitutes an admission that a certain snm is- duo to the insured, tho company should, without hes itation, pay that sum immediately on the expira tion of the sixty days “after notice- and receipt of proof of loss by tho insured.” If the insitrea desires the company to pay him his loss before tho expiration of sixty days, be must allow whatever discountmay be required by the company; for that is a matter otc consideration to tho company to pay before it is required to do so by the terms of the policy. .Some companies, it is truo, , d “ w S; but, nevertheless, this reqidrcmont isariht whlf>l» tlm nomnanv uta>/ insist upon, lue forced SS5SSmnRbt to ba put upon tho clause UWo minted bv most companies. Damns a tow simply dishonest, and, it Stared mfsimSid bo sufficient ground to war the nronorty-owner la withdrawing hia oon- companies in tho future. The tshonorubie companies referred to construe the <1 ' vord “receipt” of proofs to mean "acceutanctf ” of proofs; or, In other words, insist that the? ard not obliged fa pay tho loos until sixty dava after tiey (the companies) have adjusted or declared the proof satisfactory \o themselves. UalersnSJ a construction, there is nothin* company from plscon-holing tho carefaUy-n?£ 0 ?! 8 of the policy-holder until each tuna as It sees fit or convenient to examine thorns ami irhen months of patient waiting on the pixrtof tho policy-holder nave elapsed, whothe outpace peiretratcrt has become too flagrant to be lonar endured, to-mark the proofs “accepted ” or “nq.

The magnitude of this swindle is better under stood wt ecTvc consider that tho sum thus ille gally and fraudulently withheld amounts, in the aggregate, perhaps, to several hundred thousand dollars, which, if added to the enormous rate for insuring fo-day, maywcll convince any com pany that has not been totally ruined that a tiro of the magnitude of oars is quite a profitable speculation, and that rh© gain will soou over balance the lolkcs. This question, Mr. Editor, is of vast public importance ; for our citizens require every dol lar they can . raise to build up their shattered business, and, while not desiring that wliieb does not properly and justly belong to them, neither can they afford‘to be cheated or defraud ed oat of what tSey are legally and equitably entitled to. I therefore urge upon my fello w-suf ferc-rs to consider carefully the conduct of these servant companies to-<la>j r ihxt. in their future in surances, they may know not only which are the strong companies, but which are both honorubTe snd strong. I hspo that both merchants anti* builders will take this opportunity to separate the tares from the wheat, ft lies in their power to make the business of a dishonorable company very unprofitable In Cluctvgo. I hope soon to have a list of the companies of doubtful integ rity prepared, with a few comments on thedeecr tivc character of their advertisements. Chicago, Deo. 21. faciv. Tbe-Old Trrmont. To the Editor of Tho Chicago Tribune : Slit : On tho morning of October 9, 1371 .among tho many old-timo bnildings that fell a prey to the sheet of flame which spread like a yaU over our beloved city,.was tho Old Tremont. There were many travelling from hero all over the world; both in this and other countries,.who, as tho news sped over the wires that Chicago was in flames, thought first of their homes, and friends; but, with a second thought of tho old landmarks that bad gone, came a desire to know if tho Tremont, too, had fallen a victim.to the flames. For many years it had fcaemthe homo of some of oar oldest residents, and- they looked upon it os a dear, familiar spot—one whore all our citizens liked to go and spend a fow hours after business. If any place was wanted for committees to meet on business, or for pleasure, they were sure to select tli© Tremont, os heiag. control, and Just where they would bo apt to find the parties they were anxious to see. The different societies— Masonic, Ac.—generally held their annual din ners. balls, and parties within the dining-rooms or parlors; and many a time nave those rooms been tilled with the gentlemen and ladies of oar city, who came here to trip the light fantastic toe, as well as to enjoy the good least prepared for their benetlt, at an early day, under the su pervision of Ira Conch; later, by the Gage Broth ers; but for the oast few yearsl>y John B. Drake, who has been mine boat of the Old Tremont. Here it was-that, in any time of excitement, like the late war, the people came to talk matters over. It has been the scene of many warm de bates; for hero were found Lincoln, Douglas, and all the politicians of dlfferentages and times. Our Presidents, Senators, and men of distinguished rank came to the Tremont a? to their own homes, and from its piazzas spoke many times to the as sembled multitude of the state of the country and affairs all over the world. It seemed perfectly natural for Stephen a. Douglas to come here and lay down his life after years of labor. Daring the war that followed close upon this great man’s death, our Generals, as well as those of lesser rank; thronged the halls and rooms of the Tremont, until it was like a busy hi™ of bees. Some of our soldiers came here to stop a few days, and it was God’s will they should go no further; but they must fall asleep, enter upon their long reaMbere in the Tremont surrounded, perhaps, by no fa milar face, yet by those willing and anxious to do all that could be done for our noble defenders from the ileld of battle where the fatal wound was received, or the disease of which tboj* <Uod had been contracted. Here it was that the Prince of TValea, and Eng- Jflad’6 great lh6iJ,'■amQ to stop; for the Tremont was known all over the wui'lu, from one end to the other; it is a familiar household word to all foreigners who know aught of our city and the great Northwest. There are some among us still who have not forgotten when the foundation of that building was laid, and who, with many wise looks, styled it “ Conch’s Folly.’' They thought they could tell Ira Couch what he was able to do: but he knew best, and went about it. The Tremont House was begun amid intuiy difficulties, fop those who were first to promise aid when the buildiag was started, refused to help when it was most needed, and. after completion, the building bad to be furnished. Ira Couch, however, was equal to the emergency, and he did not turn back, even through all the different discourage ments that came to him from time to time as lie went on .with the building, until it was finished and ready to be opened to the public. At the opening of the Tremont gas was used for the first time; and, as the house was lighted throughout on that night, it made a brilliant spectacle, which many of our people have not forgotten; and, in recalling that fearful time of trial, so re cently passed, when, for days, we were without this pleasant luxury, we were reminded of the first time it was used within our city, and of the many changes time has brought about since those early days. Twenty-one years have passed since that opening, and the fifteenth anniversary of the builder's death will soon come round; nut the Tremont has stood as a monument to the skill, energy.andperseverance of him who, In Chicago’s early years, had such far-seeing ideas of her future greatness and prosperity. It was the permanent home of John Went worth, and his cheerful face was always seen here, if anywhere in our city; in fact, he seemed to be part of the Tremont,—one of the pictures that time only would remove; and, surely, no one went out from its portals that night with sadder heart or more regret than Mr. Wentworth. Among the last to leave the Tremont, on the night of the fire, was one present at the opening, and who had labored faithfully and well, being ever at her post. She left the house accompanied by a friend who came In that hour of danger to assist her; and, as she walked through the halls and down the stairs for the last time, there was a stillness as of death,—not a sound to be heard at the dead hour of night; it was a leave-taking she had little thought would ever come to her, and, with her devotion to the Old Tremont, must have been a fearful trial, if there had been time for a moment's thought. There were those within the walls that night who had been there for twenty-ene years, ever working for the interest of their employers, be cause they loved the dear Old Tremont. and could not bear to leave it. All the help who had been there any length of time were attaehed to the house, and every one thought, if the Tremont should, at any time, take fire, it would never burn down, for the men and bova would save it if possible. The hour of trial came, and, in a single moment, as It were, that old, familiar building was gone,—nothing left to mark the spot, except the tall chimney atone corner. Who conld work successfully against the fire-fiend when it came with such power 1 The fierce gale that prevailed sent the long boards or wood and sheets of iron all ablaze into the base ments and upon the roof—first burning off tho awnings on Dearborn street. It must have been an awful sight to see all those buildings about that corner in fiames, and tho stout-hearted might well tremble as they saw about them tho sheets of fire, and bat one war of escape, which at any moment might be cut off. Old men. who had lived hero for years, had no time to think of anything but saving their lives, and, if possible, something that might be of value to them if spared. It was well that those who escaped were obliged to hasten; for, in their sorrow, they might have lingered, and thus per ished in tho flames. All had to keep their pres ence of mind about them, and it is wonderful that more were not lost amid that terrible sea of fire. It must have been a severe trial for Mr. James Couch to go down through the sparks and Ilamcs to see the Old Tremont fall, and remember it was the third time he had seen it melt away from his sight; to think the house so endeared to him as the place where he bad spent many years ol hia life, and the associations surrounding which were of the tenderest nature, was about to be destroy ed by tbe fierce lire raging all about. That night will ever linger in his memory; for lie had not forgotten the builder of the dear Old Tremont, and tbe time when they both came hero together. The burning of tbe Tremont is an afliction deep ly felt by her who spent so many years there as the wife of Ira Couch. It was the severing of the links that bound her to tbe past; for the house has ever been connected, in her thoughts, with the life of him for whom she still sosadly mourns; and, now that has vanished from view, memory clings to those days gone by when she labored to help her husband all that she could. Many words of encouragement, in the dark days of building, were given by her, when every one else sought to put obstacles in the way of bis success; and she feels that, could tbe Tremont have been left, she would not mind any other loss that has come to her in common with so mauy of our oldest settlers and friends. Here the ■writer spent her earliest years. Around the house are clustered all the youthful memories of her life. She had a love for each room and place about the Trcmont; and, now that it has passed from sight forever, her jhonghts will often revert to the dear old times that can never come to us again. It is very sad to think of so many of .the old landmarks being swept away in a few short hours, and nothing left to show what had boon. The beautiful buildings .in which our citizens . took so much pride arc laid low, and the new : ones cannot take the place of these with very many of oar old people.
