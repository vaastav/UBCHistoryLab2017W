CONGRESS TOLD OF PATROL OF THE MEXMRDER President Taft, in Special Message, Also Discusses Relations With Russia. PEACE IS THE KEYNOTE OF THE COMMUNICATION Expresses Hope for the Success of the Arbitration Treaties. GOOD WILL OF ALL 

NATIONS Jteviews the Negotiations of the Year With * Other Countries of the World. Peace is the keynote of President Taft's special message on foreign relations. which was sent to Congress today. After directing attention to the fact that the United States Is at present on the most cordial terms with all the other world powers President Taft lauds the arbitration treaties which this country has negotiated with . France and Great Britain and expresses the sincere hope that the Senate will ratify them at once. Arbitration Treaties. Upon the topic of "Arbitration" the President has the following to say: "The year just passed marks an Important general movement on the part of the powers for broader arbitration. In the recognition of the manifold benefits to mankind in the extension of the policy of the settlement of international disputes by arbitration rather than by war, and in response to a widespread demand for an advance in that direction on the part of the people of the United States and of Great Britain and of France, the terms of which were designed, aa expressed in the preamble of these treaties, ^ to extend the scope and obligation* of ] the policy of arbitrations adopted in our ] present treaties with these governments. < To pave the way for this treaty, with the < United States Great Britain negotiated an important modification in its alliance with Japan, and the French government 1 also expedited the negotiations with signal good will. The new treaties have been * submitted to the Senate and are await- 1 lng Its advloe and consent to their rati- ] fication. All the essentials of these tm? ' port ant treaties have long been known, and it is my earnest hope that they will receive prompt and favorable action." Guarding the Mexican Border. The message contains the first official explanation of the movement of United States troops along the Mexican border at the time of the Madero revolution in .Mexico. The President stated that advices from Henry Lane "Wilson, United States ambassador at Mexico City, lndiated that the situation in Mexico was much graver than press dispatches implied. Fearing for the lives of the 40,000 Americans In Mexico, Mr. ..aft "took a good deal of responsibility." i she phrased it. and ordered out the soldiers and warships. At the same time President Taft notified President Diaz of Mexico that no i iarm need be felt, as the troops were to be used only to enforce neutrality and to prevent the shipment of arms across the ",io Crande from the American side. It seemed my duty," said Mr. Taft, "to :t troops where, if Congress had directed it thee enter Mexico, effective move lit could have l?een made promptly." President Taft declared that the pres i e of the troops had a good effect. He ther explained that the restraint of the ri'.tMl Stares government, even alter -tlties bad resulted from Pallets fired ro-s the .nternational line, was not due a lack of force, but a desire to avoid t tr vent ton. The friendship of tire United States with Mexico lg now closer than ever, the rnes ige says. Touching uj>on the anti-Macro revolution inaugurated by Hen. Bernardo Reyes, who was arrested by tjie laderai authorities for plotting an insur.eotion against a friendly power on United States soil, the President declared that this country was merely following out a policy of respecting the cotemporaneous recognised constitutional authority in Mexico President Taft also voiced his pleasure that war had been probably averted by the United States In acting as mediator in a boundary dispute between Haiti and Santo Domingo and between Costa Rica and Panama The Disturbances in China. The message touches lightly upon the j i evolution in China In refcren es to loans ) tor railroad construction and currency i reform, n which American financiers I ngured. "While safeguarding the interest of our ! nationals, ' says the President, "th's gov- j ernment Is using its best efforts in continuance of its traditional policy of sympathy and fr.endshlp toward the Chinese empire and its people, with the confident hope for their economic and administrative deve opmert, and with the constant disposition to contribute to their welfare In all piroper ways consistent with an att tude of strict impartiality as between contending factions. ' Pan-American Union Lauded. The President lauded the work which Is being dor.e by the Pan-American Union ithe old bureau of American republics), especially in the way. of promoting peace. The i .essage deplores the war between Italy and Turkey, but It was with satisfaction ti.at Mr. Taft called attention to the fact that It could in no w.se embroil the United States.

GOVERNORS^ CITY Eight From Western States Arrive at Noon. SPECIAL TRAIN LEFT BEHIND Big Cars Cannot Squeeze Through Tunnels in Baltimore. MET BT DISTRICT HEADS Commissioners on Hand to Extend Welcome of City Along With Civic Bodies. Pilled with enthuslam for the east and the reception which they have been accorded on their long trip, eight governors of western states and the personal representatives of two more arrived at the Union station at 12:52 o'clock this afternoon. They came in a special train, but not the governors' special. The big cars of the Great Northern railway, which were provided for the trip of the governors, could not squeeze through the Baltimore tunnels, and the train had to be abandoned at Bay View, on the outskirts of the city. The Ave big cars filled with exhibits of the products of the western stater attached to the governors' train, will remain at Baltimore, much to the sorrow of the governors, who had hoped to have the exhibits shown in the National Capital. The governors who are in Washington today are James J. Hawley of Idaho, Adolph O. Eberhart of Minnesota, Edwin L Norris of Montana, John Burke of xvortn Dakota, Oswald West of Oregon, Robert 8. Vessey of South Dakota, Joseph M. Carey of Wyoming and Taster L. Oddie of Nevada. Gov. John F. Shafroth of Colorado was expected to make the trip, but failed to join the party, and Stephen R. Fitzgerald, lieutenant governor of Colorado, is representing that state. California Is represented by Colvin B. Brown of the Panama-Pacific International Exposition Company. To Show East the Great West. The governors are In the east, they say, to show the eastern people something of the great west; to get the two sections of the country in closer touch. They decline to go deeply into a discussion of the political situation. The democrats among them, however, gave the opinion this morning that the race for the presidential nomination lay between Harmon and Wilson and that while both were going strong, Harmon seems to be gaining. Gov. Hawley of Idaho declared that soth Wilson and Harmon have strong support in his state. "Speaking of the republicans," added 3ov. Hawley, "although I am not of that party, I believe that Taft has an overwhelming advantage over La Follette in ; Idaho at present." The opinion expressed by the governors generally was that Taft had strengthened his position by his trip through the west. The governors reached Washington just four hours behind their scheduled time. This prevented their attending the morning session of the National Rivers and Harbors Congress at the New Willard, as they had planned to do. They went directly from the Union station, after they had oblingingly posed for the cameraman, to luncheon at the Capitol with their various state delegations. Party of Welcome at Station. rne party was met at the station by District Commissioners Cuno H. Rudolph, Gen. Johnston and Maj. Judson, and by committees from the Board of Trade and the Chamber of Commerce, consisting of President Thomas C. Noyes and Secretary W. J. Enyon of the board, and President James F. Oyster and Secretary Thomas Grant of the chamber. They were given a cordial welcome to the capital. The governors joked about the inability of the eastern railways 10 care for the big cars of the west and told the committee and the Commissioners how glad they were to be in Washington. When it was definitely settled that it would be impossible to get the big cars ; of the special train under, over or around i Baltimore, the excited officials of the : Pennsylvania railway hurried a train of : Pullman cars to meet the governors at i Bay View. The governors remained in > their special during an hour and a half's i wait. Former Gov. James H. Brady, the president and organizer of the special trip of 1 the western governors, declared that lie was particularly grieved that the exhibit cars of the special train would not be brought to Washington. He talked enthusiastically of the reception of the party all along the line. Afternoon Program Carried cut. Although the program for the morning had been knocked awry by the delay of the governors' party, the afternoon program was run off as planned. The governors assembled In the marble room at the Capitol soon after - o ?-loc.<, and in the automobiles provided by the chamber of Commerce and Board of Trade, and accompanied by officers aiui numbers <>t the two organizations, thev wort taken swiftly to the White House to pay their iespecis 10 un; i-iesitieii., wan whom th- -y will d.ne at tile White lieu.- at s o'clock tonight. Kellly Atkinson of Boise, Idaho, was a busy man when the party arrived here, rounding up the governors and perfecting plans for this afternoon. a telegram was delivered to Former Gov Brady of Idaho, from Gov. Wilson ol New Jersey, shit ng that Gov. Wilson would join the party at Trenton and accompany the governors to New York. Troubles Began at Albany. -Mr. Atkinson declared that the special train had been in trouble all the way from Albany. N. Y , to Baltimore. An engine provided for the train hitd been unable to draw the big train of eleven cars, and an engine was taken from a freight train to help out. The train had just crawled along, making slower arid slower time. The special which carried the governors from Baltimore to Washington, however, made the trip in forty-two minutes. At the Capitol the governors, who by right of office are accorded the privilege of the floor In both House and Senate, were a center of attraction while the sessions were going on. At the end of the automobile trip about Washington, the governors and the members of their party, some fifty in number, w-ill he given an Informal reception at the Commercial Club, where former District Commissioner Henry B. F. Macfarland will make an address describing the relations between Washington and the federal government. The party is to leave for Baltimore tomorrow morning at 0 o'clock, where it will board again its special train. 

SPLENDORAT DELHI Roar of Imperial Salute Welcomes King and Queen. ALL JNDIA TAKES HOLIDAY Arrival Prom Bombay Greeted by Princes, Officials and Natives. GORGEOUS COSTUMES PREVAIL Brilliant Display of Jewels and Richly Colored Garments Much in Evidence. DELHI, India, December 7.?The roar of an imperial salute of 101 guns welcomed the king-emperor and queen-empress on their arrival here today from Bombay. The railroad station in the Selingarh bastion of the fort had been the mecca since dawn for everybody in the city and the coronation camp. Equipages which vied with one another in splendor passed along roads crowded with Indian princes, military officers and government officials, and streams of natives went the same way. The route to the camp was lined alternately by British and Indian regiments under the command of Lieut. Gen. Sir J. Willcocks and Gen. Sir E, G. Barrow. In providing guards of honor and escorts native troops were also given an equal share with British soldiers. The king-emperor and queen-empress were received on the elaborately decorated platform by the viceroy and the vicereine, the governors and heads of provinces, the commander-in-chief and a number of high military and civil officials. Receive 150 Ruling Chiefs. After a series of presentations their majesties proceeded to a pavilion within a wall of the fort, where 150 ruling chiefs were introduced. This brilliant ceremony, with its gorgeous display of Jewels and ricniy colored garments, occupied considerable time. Meanwhile the provincial legislators had gathered on the ridge by the durbar camp to greet the royal party. Then began the great procession to the camp four miles away. Throughout India a holiday had been decreed and great numbers of natives had gathered to get a glimpse of their ? emperor and empress. They formed a ~ striking background to the gorgeously T uniformed procession, which was headed I by lancers with bands playing. Then I came Gen. Peyton, the herald, in silk and gold tabard emblazoned with the royal coat of arms, and sixteen British and native trumpeters, all mounted on black chargers. Next followed the native es" -ort of the viceroy, in scarlet and gold, . preceding the Imperial cadet corpse composed entirely of princes and their sons. Their majesties and the viceroy's suites T succeeded. ^ King and Queen Acknowledge Salute As their majesties approached the command to present arms was passed along the line of troops, European spectators took off their hats and the natives bent deep toward the ground. The klng-emperor, the queen-empress and si the viceroy bowed right and left in p] acknowledgment. The bodyguard of p Indian princes, which followed imme- . diately after, outshone in splendor all v that had passed. n< In strict order of precedence came 150 maharajahs, rajahs, nawabs and other u chieftains. The column was closed by e) a band of savage-looking Afghans and pathan chiefs mounted on wild ponies ,r! and a detachment of native and British w troops. el Their majesties entered the city tr through the king's gate, now opened for the first time since 1857, when the King of Delhi went to public worship. All along the route the impression seemed to he profound, and the reception was a cordial one. On arrival at '5 the camp the troops defiled past the L. imperial carriage, receptions followed . and the king-emperor was presented ' with a brief address of welcome, to which he replied in a few words.

He ?c reiterated that business firms must be Ja given some means ox Knowing huh ? j an "unreasonable restraint of trade," be- t fore they take any steps that might make " them liable to federal prosecution. t m Wants Law to Be Explicit. fu "1 would have the law explicit," he ai said, "and permit the corporation com- th mission to say what agreements would n< be permitted." th He suggested that where a financial sf panic might confront the steel industry with ruin, the federal commission should tli have power to approve a temporary n< agreement among all steel manufacturer m to keep the price of rails or other prod- tl< ucts at a certain figure. .'!? "Such agreements, approved by the ca commission, and made with full pub- ie Ucity," he explained, "would be in the n< public interest, preventing business de- th moralization. in "I assume that what is needed." said le Judge Gary, "is the absolute protection of the purchasing public, the public generally, and any one interested in the business; and on the other nand, the protection of the manufacturing corporation in the development of its business.

"Does .such a meeting leave every ?ne;||/ as he goes out, free to tlx his own price, , IU asked Senator Cummins j "It does absolutely. ' Mr. Gary added that there was no violation of the Sherman law unless there was an actual agreement made to sell at a certain price. ' But the government bill Is to the contrary." he said. Judge Gary made these suggestions: -rManufacturers should be able to go to [ ' a federal commission in advance and as- j certain whether proposed acts or agree- , merit? are legal.
