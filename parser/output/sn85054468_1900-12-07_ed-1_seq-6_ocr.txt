Tears with the privi lege of wearing the inifonn of the rank from nuich he was suspended was jes terdaj restored to his position as Com missary General and honorably retired It is difficult to treat of this matter vi ithcul falling short of the respect which comentionally is due to the Piesident of the United States In the interests of truth and the honor of the countrys gal lant defenders howeter it is necessary to say that no greater outrage was ever perpetrated by executive authority Eagan has been rehabilitated Otrce more lie has appeared before the country s a full fledged brigadier general Is tharge of one of our great military de partments He has been placed on the retired list in the company of noble vet eran officers Mhom the country delights to honor This Commissary General who lind the peculiar influence to demand and receive Immunity for an offence which would liae been almost capital in any other army is again distinguished by be ing made a permanent public annuitant at the rate of forty five hundred dollars a year or thereabouts Were it not for considerations of bread ind butter and the support of their fam ilies there is not a doubt that this Eagan infamy would lead to the resignation of ecry gentleman in the army A like thing could have no other result in the army of any other country The tale of Administration turpitude in connection with the military establishment appears to be about complete but the situation is one which is logically consequent upon the evils of Algerlsm Eaganism and Ab cerism which the combination now in power established in the earliest days of Mr McKlnleys tenure of office Tli lreaident sod the Army It Is a deplorable incident of the veiled but rapid change In the character of American Institutions that the masses of the people seem absolutely Incapable of realizing what a doctrinal and constitu tional revolution they haTe been promot ing and endorsing in their action at the polls In the two latest Presidential elec tions There is no Just reason for doubt ing if the American people as a whole had been aware of the effect of their support of the trusts monopolies and the Admin istration system of unconstitutional car neltas rule over our new possessions at they would have exercised the suf agc differently Perhaps unwittingly t not the less distinctly and definl jely they haie approved of a goern ntal policy as formulated and applied the combination of financial lndus al and political elements now domi ting the country which It will be seen Hin the nature of Administration pro tals for legislation Is subversive of the Jslatlve branch of the Government cal ated to transfer the powers and pre jaties of the legislative to the execu t branch and generally tending If not designed to make the ultl ic ruling power in the Republic execu te that is imperial instead of popular I representative aIng thponEiderations in mind It pofcitUely encouraging to know that re is one Republican Congress brae enough and patriotic ugh to dare the vengeance of Marcus llanna and the powerful remorseless vengeful trusts and monopolies behind and stand out for respect for the grity of American popular instltu is Such courage has been shown by Hon Samuel W McCall in a speech the Army Reorganization bill dellv I In the Houie of Representatives on Inesday last It Is not that the argu t of Mr McCall presents anj thing daily new The ohicctlenj jAlcod by to the proposition that the size of arm ouglt to be regulated by ei lve pleasure have been repeatedly id by this and othir independent press jnents But his attitude remember that he Is one of the Republican nn y In Congress popularly supposed to altogether the dumb driven cattle Sauna is unique and almost justifies liopc that within an organization llcnv Hy the purely personal asset of a y bow there may still exist men who ler or m ribe jn reloU aeanit polltlco plutone ConSpiraty to sub our liberties ant oIa th thc nr friends of the people v defeat it Mr McCall like The Times is he 1 ing that the military arm of the Govn I tnent should be made strong enough to meet ine emergencies f th hour The clrnitlnn in Sa 1lf t HMOdul of the dtnial to them of their constitutional rights as citizens of an American territory and to keep the peace In Cuba That Is one thing but to endow him with power and authority to sa what the ttrength of the United Stales Army Miall be In peace and war within limits which would enable him to more than iuudic its tire at will Is a proposition vond this minimum thc President is to le allowed to increase the force siity six per cent whenever he shall consider the same necessary or desirable In principle this Is not short of an institutional revo lution In practice it would be purely and simply Caesarisin The Congress can not make the President arbiter of the size of the army without surrendering to the Executive an important part of the war making power whkh thc Constitution vests iu the Legislature alone Mr Mi Call Is right In declaring that such a power should be vested in no sin gle man In a Republic Xo doubt as mat ters stand and remembering thc scarcely concealed designs of the comblmtlon now in control of the Administration the priv ilege of expinding the arniv for certain purposes would be of enormous value to the interests dominating the White House At some time it might happen that the people would show a disposition to rise against the trusts Then it would be easy to pad the arms In order to suppress them Again it might ihancc that thc Democratic party carried the country and elected a President In that event it would not bo strange if a large military increase should he legarded as necessary to leep the President elect from being inaugurated The piny which stole a Presidential election In 1S7C by resort to corruption bribery and crime is hardly to be trusted not to steal another cne In the future by resort to bayonets and rapid fire gun A Cure for Connnniiition It is reported that Prof Iloff a phjsl clan in Vienna has discovered a cure for consumption The prescription follows If Acid vrctn 1 Acid Cinnamic 3 ha I Cali dip 2 Aqua distill 5 Male a perfect tolution Add Cjniac 25 It will be seen that there is nothing particularly new In this prescription a part of thc medicine being the arsenic and balsam of Peru which have long been given to people with consumptive tenden cies Trof Hoff does not claim that his discovery will do away with consumption or that the medicine will cure people with large holes in their lungs He does state however that mild cases of thc disease can be cured and If this is so he has made a most Important discovery Thc chances are that consumption Is a legacy bequeathed to thc human race from ages past In which people common ly had insufficient nourishment shelter and clothing and were overworked and abused generally Although the exact cause of the disease cannot be ascer tained it is certain that it attacks the system when the vltalit is low and that 11 is transmitted mainly by heredity The person with a consumptive tendency is bound therefore to tnke particularly good care of himself physicallj to culti vate a cheerful disposition eat proper food refrain from overworking and keep away from places in which the climatic conditions favor thc development of the malady Of course he may not be able to do these things and even if he does them inherited weakness may be too strong for him but at anj rate he stands a better chance than he otherwise would not only of escaping the disease himself but of transmitting to his children gocd costltu tions The old fashioned way of looking at disease was to regard it as a heaven sent scourge intended for the moral Im provement of mankindV and to b alle viated but not destroyed In these days the scientist contemplates the absolute wiping out of some diseases and the di minishing of fatalities from others Smallpox Is no longer the dreaded scourge it once was people do not so generally suffer from skin diseases and fevers as they did a century ago and contagious diseases generally arc under control It will take time to overcome the inherited evil of past centuries for eins against the body are not forgiven they have to be outgrown Iiut It is entirely possible that consumption ma some day become the remotely dreaded evil that the bu bonic plague and the cholera arc today If Prof Hoff has helped to hasten that time he will deserve a monument The Uiioi Cnsc Thc incidents which are said to have caused the death of Oscar L Booz recent ly a cadet at West Point appear i o fr as the authorities of that institution arc concerned to be shrouded In mstery Colonel Mills the Superintendent of the Academv declares that there is nothing to investigate The facts seem to be as follows The young man was of a sensitive nature and not very large phjslcally and he con ceived the idea that he had come to West Point to study and not to engage In fist fights rinding that he refused to fight an attempt was nade to force him Into a hand-to-hand combat with auother cadet considerably larger and stronger than himself He refused to fight and was forced to drink a mixture of red pepper and Tobasco sauce Some of Ihls stuff also got Into his cjes and In jured his sight Hot grease as then poured on hl bare feet and a tooth knocked out He subsequently resigned giving weak eyes as the reason for his resignation After his return homo tu berculosis of the throat set In and It was discovered that the membrane of his throat had been blistered so that ulcers were produced The young man died of tuberculosis arising from this Injury but refused to tell his father the names of the cadets nho had maltreated him

TIMES WASHINGTON FRIDAY DECEMBER 7 1900 joung soldiers to go through a Moqui snake dance as an Initiation in the duties of warfare Even the lndivn is more sen sible in his training than these West Point joungsters When he compels his growing boy to endure a long period of fasting and loneliness at a certain time in his life It is because he will In the course of his life as a hunter have to learn to do without food In an cmergencv But there is no emergenc In the life of thc ordinary soldier in which he will have to drink Tobasco sauce to prove his fit ness for command The fact is that at both West Tolnt and Annapolis there is altogether ton much hazing and too much pugilism generally Of course there must always be fighting In boys schools There arc alwajs a few bullies where a crowd of bojs arc gath ered together and they must follow their bent But when the authorities range themselves on the side of the bullies the slate of things Is not pleasant to contem plate Government institutions arc not places In whlth brute force should be the court of last appeal A very casual glance through history will show that the greatest generals the world has ever known have been men who under the West Point pugilistic svs tem would have run some risk of being killed before thej had done anj thing Xa poleon was small slight and extremely sensitive in his youthful das and it is quite possible that he might have re fused to stand up and be pummeled by a man of twice his strength Nelson was a small man so was Julius Caesar so Is Dewey and there is hardlv a great sol dier In history vho is conspicuous for skill with his fists Strategy not muscle is required to win bottles There was a time when this rough and tumble plan of educating boys was con sidered thc only proper thing by English school authorities but that day is past The time lias come however when it should be recognized that a boy goes to school or to eollege to study not primari ly to fight and while he should be al lowed to develop his muscle If he Is In clined that way and encouraged to be come strong and athletic he should not be beaten abused and tortured If he hap pens to prefer the work of the brain to that of thc prizefighter Other colleges have abolished hazing and It Is absurd to say that West Point and Annapolis can not do the same In order that the reward for apocryphal Fere Ices during tje Spanish war should be mdc as great as possible It might be well to add a clause to the provision of the Xavy bill reviving Ihe grade of vice ad miral providing that the officer appointed to that grade shall have thc privilege of cmplojlng warrant and petty officers as personal servants and of drawing and keeping their pay Life should be made as pleasant as possible for the bloodless vic tors of battles they have heard of but have never seen Thc Houe Committee on Insular Affairs yesterday granted a hearing to a delega tion of the W C T U which organiza tion is much interested In Representative Littleflelds bill to prohibit the sale of opium and Intoxicating liquors to the in habitants of our Pacific islands Including of course the Philippines We have no doubt that a drastic measure of the kind desired veil b enacted into law and perhaps at this session Such action on the part of Congress would be on edlfjlng concession to moral sentiment That it would be without any possible utility hnn nothing to do with the principle involved There Is not an island in the aggregate bunch Guam poelbly ex cepted where the natives do not produce a local liquor compaied with which the brain paralyzing rum of Xew England is toast water What Is more they make and con sume It on a basis of about fifteen or twen tj cents a gallon There will be much hilarity In Porto Rico Hawaii Luzon Mindanao the Stilus and so on when tha aborigines learn that they are to be freed from the curse of American compounded high wines at four dollars a gallon The next number on the reform programme ought to be a hill to prohibit the tale of totacco to the Cubans Xow for Xeely and Rathbonc Mr Pres ident Dont weary of well doing they too deserve thc glad right hand of fellow ship Eagan

retired li t of the army as major gen erals Necl appropriately might be ap pointed major and paj master Holland is a little but a brave nation The reception of President Krugcr at Thc Hague thc language of thc addresses of welcome and thc action of the national assembly all show an independence of British inrtuencc and an Indifference to British hostility which Is rather refresh ing The perfervld character of the whole business rather tends to eniourago a sus picion that the Dutch are not without moral support somewhere In the attitude of their Government to the distinguished exile from South Africa Dont hold your noses fellow citizens dont squirm In endorsing McKinley you endorsed Eagan It was reported eterday that the Treasury officials were afraid that if the war taxes arc cut down there might be a deficit This is interesting in view of thc Administration demand that the Treasury shall be thrown open to loot by thc subsidy Jobbers the river and harbor logrollers and the

against thc Seaboard was believed to be one of the subjects under consideration Another matter under discussion It was rumored was the effecting of closer re lations between the Seaboard Air Line and the Southern One of the Seaboard directors was quoted as saying that the negotiations for the consolidation of the Seaboard Air Line and the Soutnern Rail way interests were more favorable than at any
