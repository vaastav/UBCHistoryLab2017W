FRIDAY, HI iI 11 III.v 8, 1905 Til PHI'SMIKXT 1 MESSAGE, There is do uncertain ring about the declarations of the president in his message to con gress on the three great ques tions that are uppermost in the minds of the American people today. The transportation question, the trust problem and the life insurance scandals have each come in for treatment in that plain and forceful manner for which President Roosevelt has become famous. There- is nothing of the equivocal or am biguous in his utterances on these burning questions. The man who does not agree with his recommendations will not hesitate to admit that his stand is broad and patriotic—that in the message he has given his sincere conclusions. If congress will take these platters up in the same spirit— deal with them frankly, honest ly and promptly, as the people will expect congress to do, it .will go far in the direction of al laying the spirit of opposition and hostility to great corpora tions. It is not in the nature of hu man affairs for the strong to give in voluntarily to the weak. In controverted points between the corporations and the people, in their individual capacity, ; the great corporations will always win. The great corporations must be met by the people in an or ganized form —by the govern ment, before impartial jus lice is done between the individual and the corporations. To this end the Inter-State Commerce Com mission should be given the power to adjust differences be tween the people and the rail roads. Just so should the affairs of the industrial trusts and the life insurance companies be subject ed to governmental supervision and regulation. President Roosevelt's message meets the expectations of the great mass of the people.
