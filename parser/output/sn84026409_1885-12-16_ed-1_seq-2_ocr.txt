The Somerset Herald EDWARD 8CULL, Editor nd Proprietor. m EDKE8DAT DECEMBER U.18W. Ik their anxiety to have the tariff reduced the Democrats forgot to re duce the public debt, last month. Death loves a 6hining mark Grant. McClbllan, Hendricks and Vanderbilt all summoned whhin a brief period. Since Georgia has gone for Prohi bition, Democratic papers are en quiring whether the "Solid South" is not broken. The present session of Congress is going to be a long one, and will probably last until the heat of mid summer drives the per?pirir.g states men borne. Is the Philadelphia public schools thousands of girls receive instruc tions in sewing, which most people wi'l hold to be of more utility than temperance hygiene. This Democratic reform Adminis tration asks for $50,000,000 more money to ran the government this year than was required for the Re publican Administration last yer. Dakota, Idaho and Washington territoriss are all knocking for ad mission into the Union as States, and Wyoming expects to be ready before the session of Congress ad journs. The most remarkable thing about the President's message is its length. Nearly everything that it recom mends the lir-pulilicns have tried to do fjr the last ten years, but have been prevented by the Democracy. The soldiers of the Grand Army have determined to build a suitable monument to General Grant at Washington City. This means that one monument, at least, will be built to perpetuate the memory of the great Captain. Pennsylvania paid tl,lll,000of her State debt last year, and has over a million still left in the Treas ury, notwithstanding the fact that half a million was added to her an nual expenses by the useless extra session of the Legislature. The Democrats of the Virginia Legislature have decided to elect J. W. Daniels United States Sena tor to succeed Stallone. The chief inducement to the election of Mr. Daniels is his gallant war record as a Major in Stonewall Jackson's bri gade. " " " Some of the Democratic newspa pers are boasting that there is no reference to sectional questions in the President's message. Well, no From time immemorial the dough faced Democracy of the North has been afraid to say "boo" to a South ern goose. The cause of temperance, like a pump handle,has its ups and downs. The cold water people of Atlanta, Georgia, voted down whisky last but since then the court has weec. enjoined them to "hold on," until it decides upon the constitutionality of their action. The President's suggestion that it is time to stop the coinage of silver dollars to be piled up in the Treas ury, have set the silver kings to howling, as they will be without a customer if their Uncle Sam ceases to buy and store away the product of their mines. For twenty years or more the Democrats have been boasting of what they intended to do when they again got in the saddle. Well, Cleve land is mounted, and last week tbe Democratic House got on behind him. Now, let's see what they do and how they do it The friends of ex-Senator Wallace in Philadelphia have started a boom for him as the next Democratic can didate for Governor. It is alleged that the Governor and Wallace have struck hands, for the purpose of downing Randall, who, having tb car of the President, is controlling all the Federal appointments in this Sute. Dasifl Kfmgax, of Rosemont, Montgomery county, was Just week indicted, tried and convicted of keep ing a nuisance id the shape of a fil thy pig-pen. This was the first prosecution under the new law cre ating the State Board of Health. How would it do to call the atten tion of the Board ot Health to the worse than pig-sty nuisance in our county jail J Judge Williams, of Tioga county, in "charging tbe Grand Jury" at the laat svisirt riM hv tiim Mtlnrl t.h-ir i i ,...!. tr.- r-"""" use of games of chance at licensed Lars to decide who should pay for drinks, and instructed then that I "lb use of dice, cards, dominoes, checkerf!. or the toss up of a penny to determine that question, was vi olation of the law." Under Republican rule the pub k debt has been reduced at the rate of $7400,OO0 per year for the past four years. The President's uies age informs as that during the past five months there has been paid on ihe public debt $3C325, and the ctatemeat of the Treasurer shows that during November the debt was increased nearly $5,000,000. Com ment on these facts are useless. A Pittsburg paper says Dr. Hos tetter, in talking of Mr. Vandexbilt's death, said: "If the courts decide that the South Penn Railroad can- not be transferred to the Pennsylva nia road, and if Mr. Gowen is elec ted president of the Reading Rail road, with the help of Philadelphia capital already promised, we will buy the Vanderbilt interest and complete the South Penn Railroad ourselves." If the doctor had only omitted a couple of "ifs" from his announcement, we would feel much happier over the prospects of the South Penn. The Harrisburg Patriot boo-hoos right out over Sherman's election as President of the Senate, thus : -It was the foolishest' thing in the j world for any one to expect that the Republicans could rise to the height of electing a Democratic successor to the dead Democrat whom the people had chosen to preside over the Senate. What else could have been expected of tbem but that they would eelect for that place the mean est bloody-shirt partisan in their nnrtv?" t -J Poor lellow 1 . nat ayaimn u, u j ... . . . i j :i zr me democracy owu u .uW BO long as iuoruecm eiuciu at king's gate ? According to the Annual report of State Treasurer Livsey, which will be out in a few days, the total debt is tl7.972.6S3, against which there 19 in the sinking fund $S,52'2,G35 .69, thus leaving the actual debt $9.4S0,-j 047.59. When it is remembered that the State debt was $42,000,000 when the Democrats were turned out of power, it must be admitted that the Republicans have most success fully managed the finances of the Commonwealth, remembering also that they have abolished all State taxes on real estate, and that the appropriations for common schools now exceed one million annually. The first ct of Senator Cameron after the organization of the Senate, was the introduction of a resolution declaring "That inasmuch as tbe business industries of the country at present seem to be reviving, it is in expedient, during the present Con gress, to pass upon any legislation looking to the reduction of the tariff duties." This has put the free-traders into a perfect fury, and they are insisting that it is the duty of the Democratic House to show Mr. Cam eron that he cannot dictate to it Mr. Cameron has thus adroitly drawn the fire of the free-traders and un masked the batteries, which they bad concealed behind the harmless looking brush of "revenue relorni." It is asserted that, if at the time of his death Mr. Vanderbilt was not the richest man in the world, he at least bad the largest income.

As will be seen by reference to the "ynopsw of the Annual report of Au ditor General iles, published else where in this paper, the tax collect ed last year from corporations and limited partnerships amounted to $2,037,618. This is the tax which the last Legislature abolished, and expects to make good to the Treas ury by a rigid collection of the tax on monies at interest, which is now being assessed. Just why corpora tions should be released, and the tax heretofore paid by them be placed npon the accumulations of the peo pie, is a question that is being large. ly and angrily discussed just now. Doubtless money at inteiest is a fit subject fur State taxation, but should money invested in corporations and limited partnerships escape? It is announced from Columbus that the Democratic Supreme Court of Ohio has reversed the Circuit Court, and decided to give the Dem ocratic coal oil Senators trjd mem hers from Cincinnati seats in the Legislature to which they were not elected. Although it was clearly proven that immense frauds wera perpetrtd, and fake returns made by the election officers, the old Democratic doctriue "you cia't go behind the returns" was applied, and it is ordered that the benefic iaries of the fraud be given the cer tificates. Thu result leaves the Re publicans only a majority of three on joint ballot, quite sufficient hjw ever to re-elect Senator Sherman, whose defeat was tha principal i- ducement U perpetrate the frauds, iTisa quarter of a century since a Democratic President has had a chance to send a message to Con gress and as during that long period a , . . , 6"0" 

-CLUUJU- ilated lor use. it tollows that a etate paper of no ordinary length could contain the bottled up utterances of so many years. Thus it comes about the first message of President Cleve land is of Euch extraordinary mag nitude that the ordinary country newspaper cannot publish it entire. We have availed ourselves of a syn opsis of it, which we take from tins Pitteburg Timet, covering all its material points, and to which we re fer our readers. It is a very creditable paper, well written, and clearly presenting the affairs of the coiiutry in a plain and intelligent manner. Republicans will not find in it much for cavU or for censure, as nearly all its sugges tions point to the same line of policy presented by his predecessors. Its principal critics will be found in the ranks of his own party where his tariff, silver coinage and ciyil service reform views will not be acceptable to a majority of his partisans. Hut to use a homely adage, "soft words don't butter parsnips," and the country must wait to see ju?t how the Democratic majority in the Houfe will act upon the suggestions of the message, and what measures of long promised reform they will mete out to the people, whom they insist have been badiy misgoverned since their party was las-t in power. Fbanelis h. Gowen Esq, former President of the Reading railroad, addressed an -immense audience at the Academy of Music in Philadel phia on Friday night lan-tj more than six thousand tickets of admission had been given out, and tlie house was crowded with the most notable citizens, millionaires, bankers, finan ciers and stockholders of Phila delphia, Reading, Pottstown, and other prominent points on the line 1 of the road.

DEAD KINO OP bPAIV. A Solemn Kcqatem Maaa Which President Oereland and Cabinet. Attended. Washington, Dec. 10. A solemn requiem mass for the repose of the late King Alfonso of Spain was cele brated at St. Matthew's Catholic Church in this city at 11 o'clock this morning. The arrangements for the mass were made by the Spanish minister, Senor Don Juan Valera. Six hundred invitations heavily bordered with black, were issued to tne President and Cabinet, the Diploruotic Corps and others The auditorium of the church was draped in morning. In front of the alter rail stood the catafalque, on which was a state casket of black ornamented with silver. The case of the catafalque with Spanish flags surmounted by the Spanish national coat-of-arms. The alter was dress ed in black, the pillars of the taber nacle being entwined with black bunting and the candlesticks shrouded in the same material. No flowers were on the alter, and a sim pie floral wreath rested on the top of the casket. At precisely 1 1 o'clock President Cleveland and Secretaries Bayard and Endicott entered the church and were assigned seats in the front pewon tbe right side of the centre aisle. The Spanish Legation occu pied seats on the opposite side of the aisle. Senor Valera, assisted by the Naval Attache and the Vicomte de Noguerras, the Portuguese minister, the dean of the Diplomatic Corps, received the foreign minister at the head of the centre aisle. Thev were then given seats by the attaches of the Spanish Legation, who acted as ushers. They wore black crape on their left arms. All of the foreign legations were represented, the mobt of the ministers being present. The English, German, Frenci ,Poit Jguese and Russian ministers and attaches had seats very near the Spanish Le gation. The Diplomatic Corps at tended in full uniform, including the Japanese and Chinese. Members of the various legations acted as ushers. There wa3 Bcarcelv a seat left vacant in either auditorium or galleries. Mozart's Grand Requiem Mas? was sung by the church quartette, assisted by a choir of thirty voices and with orchestral accompaniment. Rev. Dr. Chadella, pastor of St. Matthew's was the celebrant of the mass. A number of priests occu pied seats within the sanctuary. At the conclusion of the mass Senor Valsra escorted the President to the door. Then came the Secretaries and the entire Diplomatic Corps. All reainnined standing as the President passed down the aisde. A Tenement Horror. Londox, Dec. 13. At Plymouth to-Jay a tenement house on Love street, in a low and squalid neigh borhood, took fire and a terrible ca lamity resulted. The flame3 burn ed rapidly and fiercely, and when at last subdued 12 calcined human bodies were found among tbe ruins. Two others are raimng. and in all probability they too have been burn ed to death. One unfortunate vic tim was smashed to pieces by jump ing from a high window to the ground. Several of the tenants in their fright escaped by throwing bed dine to the pavement, 40 feet below, and jumping from windows. A number of these had legs and arms broken by the fearful leap. A harrowing incident of the ca lamity was the appearance of a youth who, with his little sister in one arm, hung suspended from a window by the other for some min utes, until the flames surrounded him and caused him to lose his hold and fall to the ground. He had both his legs fractured. The child was also severely injured. The in tensity of the flames gave the build ing lliii appearance of a furnace, but this aid not deter the nrenieu, many of whom entered the house and by a heroic Btrugg'e succeeded in res cuing several persons. Breaking tne Truoe. London, Dec. 10. The truoe be tween Servia and Bulgaria has been broken. To-day the Servians at tacked the Bulgarian outposts at St. .Nicholas Izoor and Krivofer, and were repulsed at all points without loss to the Bulgarians. Servia's note to the foreign ministers at Belgrade states that Servia is still willing to submit to the mediation of the pow ers and to accept torrns cinsqnaut with her honor. At Belgrade, how ever, tbe expectation is that there is yet to be a great battle, and that it may occur soon because of Servia's rejection of the terms of peaoe offered by Prince Alexander. The Servians think they now have a;i army at Belgrade capable of defeating the en. euiy and burnin"; to retrieve its mil itary honor. Forty Servians have been shot for mutilating themselves by blowing their triifr tiugtrs off and othor wise, injuriug ilieoiaelvea to escape military service. King Milan order, ed the executions. M.

A des-j perate encounter occurred on Mon- j day afternoon at the winter quarters of Forepaugh's Circus, Lehigh ave- nue and Eemont street, between si' recently-imported Nubian lion and; captivity, which resulted in tne death of the lion. Early in the morning it was noticed th.it the lion acted more restless than usual, and the trainer was warned not to go through the usual exercise with him that day, but did not pay any at tention to the advice of the httend ants. , He entered the cage, but no sooner had he closed the door after him when tbe lion raised his huge paw and struck at him, slightly scratching his thigh. The enraged beast crouched for a spring, which the trainer avoided by jumping back against the bars which the lion had loosened. The bars yielded and the trainer fell to the ground uncon scious. The lion leaped through the opening and made his way to the elephant room, where about 24 of those animals are confined. The bulky form of Bolivar at once be came the object of attack. The lion slowly crept forward until he was within reach of the elephant, when he struck at the trunk, and tore the skin, causing the elephant to bellow with pain. This gave way to rage, and with all his strength Bolivar at tempted to break his chains and rush upon his supple foe. The lion than sprung on the elephant's head, but was easily thrown off. The roarinz ol the combatants, united with the trumpetings of the other elephants,attracted the few men who at that time were in the vicinity, but who were afraid to interfere. Again the lion crouched for a spring. The elephant raised his trunk- which met tbe flying body of the lion half way, and threw it to the ground with such force as to stun the brute. With a roar of exultation Bolivar jumped upon the body and crushed it with his huge feet. 1 hen Jittir.g up the lifeless bmly of tbe lion with his trunk, Bolivar threw it over into a corner of the ' uilding. The keep ers could no! r tore tranquillity un til the carcass of the lion was re moved. The G. A. it. Grant Monument, Washington, Dec. 10.

About two weeks ago the bare fact that Frank Sanders had been shot down in the mountain wilds of Whitley county was learned here from citizens com ing from that section. A gentleman that lives here has just returned from Whitley count, and he brings news of tne romance of winch the killing was the finale. He says that the tradition in Whitley is that just before the close of the war Sanders and two other men, all of whom were members of a guerilla band, took a man named Sam Smock into the woods in the eastern part of the county and put a pistol between his eyes and fired. Smock fell and they left him for dead. Fortuuately for Sam, the ball ran ged downward, missing the brain, and came out at tbe base ot the neck. He was found and cared for by friends, and after long nursing recovered. Tbe men who attempted the murder did not try to conceal their identity from Smock, in fact they wanted him to know them. Thev felt secure in the faith thit "dead men tell no tales." Aft-rwards Smock registered an oath that he would devote his life to hunting down and killing these three men. A few days ago he passed through Wayne county, and, in con versation with one of his old friends, said : "I have killed two of the men who attempted to murder me years ago. I found one of them in Mis souri and the other in Garrand coun ty, Kentucky. I did my work si lently and well and have never been even arrested. I am now on tbe truck of the last man. His name is Sanders, and I will have him in less than ten days. I will make mvself known to him before shooting. One week later the body of Frank Sands was found in a lonely path in the plena of Whitley county with (hp ful lowing note scribbled in pencil and pinned to his coat: "This is tho last act of a tragedy begun years ago.'' No one doubts that Smock did the killing. He has not been seen since and no one is taking any p.iins to find him. A Family Hluwn Into a. Two Acre Ijot. PiTTSBCUfi, Dec. 9. One of the most peculiar explosions that haye ever occurred in this region of nal uril gas took place this morning at Cannonsburg, in Washington Coun ty. A lare frame house was blown to pieces and the occupants, Wesley Greer, a rich stock dealer, and his wife and two children, were hurled from their betU into a two-acre lot surrounding the house.landing thir ty feet sway. The explosion took place at 4 a. m. The roof was lifted from the house with such terrible force vs to be carried some distance away. The sides of tha building, bulged out by the explosion, fell. The fragments of the structure took fire and in ltfs than an hour the whole building was in ashes. The members of the family are not fatally injured. Mr. Greer's hair ::nd mustache are singed and h's back injured. Mrs. Greer is burned about the head and hands and her li iir partly burned off. A baby escaped without iniury. It was securely wrapped up in bed and the clothing it ii supposed saved its life. A ten-year old boy was less fortu nate and i pretty badly burned about the body. The report of the explosion, which could be heard for a mile away, aroused the people of Cannonsburg and the light from the burning building brought relief to Mr. Greer and his family. The building occupied an elevated posi tion in the centre of a two-aore plot of ground. Natural gas was not used in the house, but a local gas pipe line strikes the lower portion of Mr. lireers ground, some forty or fifty yards from the house The theory advanced is that there was a leak in the gas line and that the gas found its way to the building through some old drain leading from the house. In this way the danger ous fluid has accumulated in the cellar. Frotn that time it filled every apartment ia the building before the explosion took place. Flti'it with inqianh. Dkmino, N.

M Pi-tf from Tritltii-.H. Vabaii, Ind., Dec. C Thet-u-vear old daughter of James Dunn,of Xenia, died from trichinosis. A week or more ago she complained of severe pains in her arms and legs and later became unable to walk. "The muscular portion of ber limbs swelled rapidly and suffered great agony until her death. The physi cian falling to comprehend the na ture of her ailment, an examination of a portion of the muscle from the upper portion of the arm was made. When placed upon a microscope the sedion removed, was found to he alive wiih trichiu. It is said that two weeks ago the girl ate raw pork and that her death resulted from this. It is feared that other mem bers of the family will suffer similar attack?. Hold Break for labertj. Meridian-, Miss, Dec. 13.
