SEX. at,lE, auES FRIDAY MORNING, - - DEC. 8, 1893. THE PRESIDENT S MESSHIE. The message of President Cleve land to the Fifty-third Congress is a comprehensive and able document.— It abounds in suggestions the wisdom and practical common-sense of which ought to commend themselves to Con-* gress as they undoubtedly will to the people of the country in general. The message opens with a reference in detail to our relations with foreign countries, especially with the South American republics; the Chinese de portation law ; recommends active co operation witli other counties in the suppression of the slave trade, &c. No new light is thrown on the Ha waiian trouble, a brief sketch being given of the action of the government in the matter. The President refers with gratilica tion to the movement in favor of the peaceable settlement of international troubles by arbitration. The facts he gives concerning the national banks of the country demon strate their general soundness and safety. In President Cleveland's opinion the ultimate result of the repeal of the silver law will be most salutary and far-reaching. He advocates reason able delay in dealing further with the silver problem, in the hope that there by a lasting and comprehensive finan cial plan may be evolved. President Cleveland favors a mone tary conference with other nations, with a view of accomplishing an inter national agreement on the subject. The Superintendent of Immigration, through the Secretary of the Treasury, reports that during the last fiscal year there arrived at our ports 440,793 im migrants. Of these 10G3 were not per mitted to land under the limitation of law and 577 were returned to the coun tries from whence they came, by rea son of their having become public charges. The total arrivals were 14,034 less than for the previous year. A 

PLACE TO ECONOMIZE. The President says that the fee sys tem, which makes the compensation of the United States attorneys, mar shals, clerks of Federal courts and commissioners depend upon the vol ume of business they can create is wrong. POSTOFFICE .MATTERS. The receipts in the Postofflce De partment, in consequence of hard times, have fallen below the expenses. The President says the expenses are enormously increased by the vast amount of matter carried free through the mails, chief among which are 300 tons of seeds and grain from the Agricultural Department. The sale of special delivery stamps yielded the government a profit of 180,976.59 last year. 

ECONOMY IN NAVAL EXPENDITURES. The President is in favor of building up a navy but thinks Congress should consider the number of unfinished vessels and the depleted treasury be fore contracting for additional vessels. THE PENSION LAWS. The President says that on the 30th of last June there were on the pension rolls 966,013 names, an increase of 89,- 944 over the number on the rolls J une 30, 1892. It is interesting to note that included in the list are 17 widows and daughters of revolutionary soldiers, 86 survivors of the war of 1813, 5,435 widows of soldiers of that war, 21,518 survivors and widows of the Mexican war, 3,882 survivors and widows of In dian wars, 28-f army nurses, and 475,- 645 survivors and widows and children of deceased soldiers and sailors of the late war. The number added to the rolls during the year was 123,634 and the number dropped 33,690. 

PENSION FRAUDS. The discovery having been made that, many names had been put upon the pension roll by means of wholesale and gigantic frauds, the Commissioner suspended payments upon a number of pensions which seemed to be fraud ulent or unauthorized, pendinga complete ex amination, giving notice to the pensioners, in order that they might have an opportunity to setablish, if jmssilile, the justice of their claims, notwithstanding apparent invalidity. I am unable to understand why frauds in the pension rolls should not be exposed and corrected with thoroughness and vigor. Every name fraudulently put upon these rolls is a wicked imposition upon the kindly senti ment In which pensions have their origin ; every fraudulent pensioner has become a bad citizen ; every false oath in support of a pen sion has made perjury more common, and false and undeserving pensioners rob the peo ple not only of their money, but of the pa triotic sentiment which the survivors of a war, fought for the preservation of the Union, ought to inspire. Thousands of neighbor hoods have their well-known fraudulent pen sioners, and recent developments by the bureau establish appalling conspiracies to accomplish pension frauds. By no means the least wrong done is to brave and deserving pensioners, who certainly ought not to be condemned to such association. Those who attempt in the line of duty to rectify these wrongs should uot be accused of enmity or indifference to the claims of honest veterans. The sum expended on account of pensions for the year ending June 30, 1893, was $156,- 740,467.14. The Commissioner estimates that $165,000,- 000 will be required to pay pensions during the year ending June 30,1894. AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT. The President refers, with evident approval, to the excellent work done by Hon. J. Sterling Morton, Secretary of Agriculture. In view of the deplet ed treasury he has reduced the force in his department without impairing the efficiency of work done, the saving amounting to about $57,000 during the first quarter of the present year. The importance of the agricultural interests of the United States is clear ly shown by the statement that our agricultural exports for the year end ing June 30, 1893, were $800,000,000, or more than three-fourths of our total exports. For the year ending June 30, 1893, our agricultural products ex ported were $615,000,000, or 75.1 of all American commodities exported. Great Britain and Ireland absorb by far the largest proportion of our exported agricultural products. Of cattle the total exports aggregat ed in value for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1893, $26,000,000, of which Great Britain took considerably over $25,000,000. Of beef products of all kinds our total exports were $28,000, 000, of which Great Britain took $24,- 000,000. Of pork products the exports were $84,000,000, of which Great Brit ain took $53,000,000. In breadstulTs, cotton and minor products like pro portions sent to the same destination are shown. THE 

FREE SEED HUMBUG. President Cleveland condemns the free distribution of common seeds by the Agricultural Department, which has grown to extravagant proportions. In 1839 Congress appropriated SI,OOO to be taken from the Patent Office funds for the collection and distribu tion of rare and improved varieties of seeds. Daring the last fiscal year the seeds purchased and the cost of put -1 ting them up and distributing them : was $135,000. This money, instead of being used for the purchase of rare or improved varieties of seeds, was ex - pended in procuring bulbs, cuttings ! and ordinary seeds, everywhere easily J attainable at low prices, affording members of Congress a means of grati fying their constituents at the public ' expense. Besides it is an unjustifiable interference with the legitimate busi ness of the seedsmen of the country. It would be yet more injurious to the latter if it were not for the fact that very few people who plant seeds large . ly are willing to trust their hopes of a crop to these ‘‘Patent Office Seeds,” . as they are generally called. The President says that more than $100,600 has been stricken from the .. estimate made by the Agricultural , Department for the distribution of seeds and the $35,000 asked, for will be , confined strictly to the purchase of seeds calculated to benefit farmers. These will be distributed through ex periment stations, which the Presi dent believes to be the proper agencies to experiment with and test new vari eties of seeds. 

ECONOMY IN PUBLIC EXPENDITURES. President Cleveland strikes a popu lar chord when he urges economy in public expenditures. On this point he . says : , Economy in public expenditure is a duty that cannot innocently be neglected by those intrusted with the control of money drawn from the people for public uses. It must be confessed that our apparently end less resources, the familiarity of our people with the immense accumulations of wealth, the growing sentiment among them that the expenditure of public money should in some manner be to their immediate and personal advantage, the indirect and almost steaithy mauner in which a large part of our taxes i are exacted, and a degenerated sense of olll cial accountability have led to the growing ex travagance in governmental appropriations. At this time, when a depleted public Treasury , confronts us, when many of our people are engaged in a hard struggle for the necessaries of life, and when enforced economy is press ■ iug upon the great mass of our countrymen, I desire to urge with all the earnestness at my command that Congressional legislation ■ be so limited by strict economy as to exhibit an appreciation of the condition of the Treas ury aud a sympathy iyith the straitened cir * curastauces of our fellow-citizens. The duty of public economy is also of im mense importance in its intimate and neces i sary relation to the task now in hand of pro viding revenue to meet Government expeudl [ tures, and yet reducing the people’s burden of Federal 'taxatiou. 

TARIFF REFORM STILL THE ISSUE. - No part of the President’s message has been awaited with more anxious expectation than that relating to tariff , reform. His views on the subject, evi , dently, have undergone no change since he wrote his famous tariff mes sage of 1887. He refers to tariff reform as the business directly before Con gress. The people have spoken in 1 favor of it, and have confided the ' work of its accomplishment to the hands of those who are solemnly pledged to it. President Cleveland says that if the members of Congress are really the servants of the people and if political * promises and professions have any I binding force our failure to give relief so long awaited will be sheer reere s ancy. Nothing, he adds, should in ; tervene to distract our attention or i disturb our effort until this reform is i accomplished by’ wise and careful i legislation. He adds : , While we should staunchly adhere to the , principle that only the necessity of revenue * justities the imposition of tariff duties and t other Federal taxation, aud that they should be limited by strict economy, we cauuot close our eyes to the fact that conditions have grown up among us which iu justice and fair ness call for discriminating care iu the distri : butiou of such duties and taxation as the em | erganciesof our government actually demand. Manifestly if we are to aid the people direct i ly through tariff reform, one of its most obvi ous features should be a reduction in the pre sent tariff charges upon the necessaries of ’ life. The beuetits of such a reduction would be palpable and substantial, seen aud felt by thousands who would be better fed aud i better clothed aud better sheltered. These gifts should be the willing benefactions of a government whose highest function is the pro ■ motion of the welfare of the people. 

FREE RAW MATERIALS. I President Cleveland strongly cates, the removal of duty on raw ma -1 terials necessary to our manufactures. The world, he says, should be open to f our national ingenuity and enterprise. This can uot be while Federal legisla tion, through the imposition of high k tariff, forbids to American manufac -9 turers as cheap materials as those used , by their competitors. It is quite ob- I vious that the enhancement of the price of our manufactured prod nets resulting from the policy not only confines the market for these products J * . within our own borders, to the direct ! disadvantage of our manufacturers, \ but also increases their cost to our - citizens. J The interests of labor are certainly, ■ though indirectly’, involved in this ( feature of our tariff system. The 1 sharp competition and active struggle among our manufacturers to supply . the limited demand for their goods, ; soon fill the narrow market to which 1 they’ are confined. Then follows a 1 suspension of work in mills aud fac tories, a discharge of employes, and , distress in the homes of our working ■ men. Even if the often-disproved assertion * could be made that a lower rate of i wages would result from free raw ma , terials and low tariff duties, the intel * ligence of our workingmen leads them > quickly to discover that their steady employment, permitted by’ free raw materials, is the most important factor s in their relation to tariff legislation. President Cleveland is satisfied that - the reduced tariff duties provided for ' in the Wilson bill will in the near future produce sufficient revenue to meet the needs of the government, t With regard to a provision against 3 any deficiency in the needed revenues r of the government until the country - adjusts itself to the new schedules the 3 President appears to sanction the re ; commendation of the Ways and Means ; Committee providing for additional 3 internal revenue taxes, including a small tax upon incomes derived from 1 certain corporate investments. Taken altogether an evident sincer r ity and honesty of purpose pervades - the entire message. There Is no r self-glorification, no appeal to preju -1 dice or partisanship, but an earnest a desire to give wise and prudent coim - sel for the benefit of all the people. 1 * ♦"* ‘ —Secretary Morton, in his report, 5 has failed to incorporate in the Agri r cultural Department estimates the sum of $720,000, heretofore asked for . the support of 48 agricultural experi r meat stations, one for each State and , Territory. This is regarded as signi r ftcant of the attitude of the Agricul -1 tural Department towards these in stitutions. If no money is appropriat . ed by the general government the s most of them will probably be closed, - as few of the States are likely to ap propriate the amount needed for their - support. i —Mr. Van Alen, of Rhode Island, who was appointed by President Cleveland as ambassador to Italy, has 3 declined the appointment, because of r the charge that he received the ap i pointment in return for a contribu . tion of $50,000 to the Democratic cam ) paign fund. The President, in a let -3 ter to Mr. Van Alen, asking him to re ■ consider his determination, says Mr. r Van Alen was selected on account of s his entire fitness for the place. THE 

FIFTY- THIRD CONGRESS. The first regular session of the Fifty - thiid Congress began at Washington on Monday’. There were crowds of spectators in the galleries of both Houses but the occassion was depriv ed of some of its interest by the fact that there was no Speaker to elect and no committees to appoint, the work of organization having been perfected at the special session in Au gust. It took an hour aud twenty minutes to read the President’s mes sage in the House. Its reading was listened to with marked attention and at its close the Democrats declared their gratification that President Cleveland has expressed himself in such thorough accord with the Wil son tariff bill. It is the general opin ion that the Republicans, while in sisting upon a full debate upon the tariff bill of the Ways and Means Committee, will not employ dilatory tactics against it. —An institute was held at Beltsville, Md., on Wednesday, under the aus pices of the Vansville Farmers’ Club, of Prince Georgies county, the topic , of discussion being the necessity of a State Board of Agriculture. Repre sentatives were present from various ' farmers’ organizations. A paper was read by Mr. George E. Loweree, favor ing the proposed board. Mr. A. Haviland Hull, of the Forest Hill Farmers’ Club, representing the farmers’ clubs of Harford county, thought the Maryland Agricultural College was fitted to perform the same functions as a board of agriculture. He advocated legislation making it compulsory on the faculty of the col lege to hold institutes in every county where organized bodies of farmers re quest them. He thought the College should be given an increased appro priation by the State. Capt. R. W. Silvester, President of the Maryland Agricultural College, asked the farmers of the State for their sympathy and encouragement. He did not like the idea of being compell ed to do by’ law what the College was only too glad to do voluntarily’. Addresses were also delivered by Mr. W. T. L. Taliaferro and Mr. James S. Robinson, of the Agricultural col lege, and others. —The new tariff bill, it is thought, will be laid before the House on Wed nesday next. It will not be taken up however, until the minority of the Ways and Means Committee has been given an.opportunity to prepare its report. The bill will probably be passed in the House substantially as reported by the committee. On the basis of the imports of former years the new tariff will not provide suffi cient revenue for the support of the government, and the committee are therefore looking to internal revenue taxation to supply the deficiency’. It seems probable that an income tu x on corporations and perhaps an ad ditional tax on spirits will be resorted to for additional income. Eventually, it is believed, the Wilson tariff will supply all the needs of an economical ly administered government. In the meantime, the government expenses might be pared down to meet the amount there will be to expend. —Several iron furnaces and rolling mills in Alabama, which have been idle for some months, have resumed, operations since the publication of the Wilson tariff bill, giving employ ment to several thousand men. The prompt passage of the law, we be lieve, would stimulate every’ Ameri eian industry, except, perhaps, that of the calamity croaker, and bring about good times. —Tlie great game of football be tween the Princeton and Yale College teams came off at New Y T ork, on I Thanksgiving Day, and resulted in a score of 6to 0 in favor of Princeton, whose team was led by Thomas G. Trenchard, of Queen Anne’s county, Md. —The cadets of the Naval Academy met and vanquished the army cadets from West Point, in a game of foot ball at Annapolis, last Saturday.— The score was 6 to 4. Of the four games which have been played the navy’ has won three and the army one. The Review of Reviews. The multiplicity and excellence of other magazines, fur from lessening the usefulness of the Review of Reviews, make this unique periodical more aud more a necessity. Its in dexes, condensations of leading articles, clas sified lists of new books, aud general survey of things written, things said, aud things done during the month preceding its issue, would suffice to keep the busy reader in touch with the current of life and thought, even it he were able to read nothing else. The Decem ber number is as full of variety and freshness as its predecessors have regularly been ; aud to those who know the Review of Reviews this is a sufficient commendation.

MEMORY of Christmas is the richest legacy which age receives from youth. It is well for us all that one holiday like this comes to arrest with its mellow warmth the the chill which with advancing age and life’s growing cares creeps over us. It is a rich blessing to bathe once a year in this fountain of eternal youth. Who so poor that he cannot onc(> a year re member those around him with some little token of affection ? These gifts should not be appreciated when measured by heartless dollars. Even a sunny face or a cheery word may be as “Bread Cast upon the Waters, to Return after Many Days.” Then let us be generous, bright and happy, and do what we can to make the little ones around us enjoy the “Good Cheer.” Joy Is as contagious as sorrow, and the little child, too, when this Holiday is not overflowingly happy, is the poorer for all his days. We arc prepared to supply such gifts for Christmas as will make old people feel joy, middle aged people feel happy, and young peo ple fell happier still. 13?” We wish you all a Merry, Happy Christ mas.

HENRY O. DEVRIES, ldec2t Chairman of Road Convention. \ A,ll> The published statement that I was arrested for cruelty to my wife is untrue and can be so proven by my wife and neighbors. I do not know upon what charge I was arrested, the warrant being sworn out by a neighbor who was drinking at tin* time. 1 was not taken be fore a magistrate but was released without a hearing. I was afterwards arrested at the in stance of a quarrelsome neighbor but released upon giving bail to keep the peace. I was never before arrested or accused of any viola tion of law, and I publish this card in Justice to the good name I nave always borne. Sdeclt MICHAEL J. KELLY. READY FOR THE HOLIDAYS.
