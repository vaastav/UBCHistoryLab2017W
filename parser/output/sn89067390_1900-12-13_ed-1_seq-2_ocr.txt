THE TASEY CODSTY REPUBLICAH. TRICE &. CARROLL, Publishers. FORSYTH. : : MISSOURI. Hawaii will have to make a much better showing of ballots than she did in the last election before she can hope for statehood. Only 11,000 rotes were cast in the whole territory. It is the precedent of paying- a debt, not the money involved, that worries the sultan when the American claims are presented. The Turks fear that if they settle one account the first downward step will have been taken and a dangerous habit formed. It is said Gov. Sayers of Texas con tributed to the Galvestion relief fund more money, in. proportion to his means, than any other individual. What's better, he did it quietly, not letting anyone know anything about it. Charity brings its own reward. The Cubans are having some excit ing discussions in their constitutional convention. So do every people who go throi gh this experience. There was some inflammatory talk in the convention in Philadelphia in 17S7 which framed the American constitu tion. Chicago thugs attempted to hold up a stranger who had once been chief of police of a modest Wisconsin city. One of the holders-lip is in the hos pital, while the other, in the opinion of the Wisconsin man, will be found stiffened out in some alley of the Windy city. The governors of all of the states are to participate in the festivities at Washington which are to mark the completion of the hundred years since the transfer of the national capital to that site. While there were only 16 states ia the Union then, there are 45 now. .At least one white citizen in North Carolina believes in helping his col ored brethren. R. J. Ravold, of Winston-Salem, has just given $5,000 to wards erecting a hospital for the ne groes of that vicinity. The building is to cost $10,000, and the colored peo ple are to contribute the other $5,000. Just why German silver is called by that name is one of the unaccountable things. Silver itself, in connection with it, is a misnomer, for it is sim ply composed of an alloy of the baser metals, and inasmuch as it was in vented in China, it is difficult to un derstand what Germany has to do with it. There have been some of our peo ple who were fearful that the Cubans were to be betrayed and the island actually held in bondage to the Unit ed States. This fear can be now dis sipated, for the president says: "I will transmit to congress the consti tution which the Cuban convention is expected to adopt." Bev.Heber Newton makes the startl ing assertion that woman's influ ence in the church is harmful be cause she is "not fully created." Mr. Newton gives as his ground for thit statement that women are responsi ble for that tendency to a sickening sentimentality which has served to drive men away from worship.' The only limit to the salmon catch in the northwest this season was the inability of the packers to take care of any more fish. The supply this yeai has been greater than ever hereto fore known. It would seem that thi favorable condition should not onlj debar the forming of a salmon trust but also allow the securing of all the fish needed on trust. Some of the women of Adrian. Mich., are determined to place them selves in position to do their part in defending the honor of their state. Twenty-four of them have enrolled themselves in a militia company and elected their officers out of that num ber. They receive weekly instruction in drill, and are said to have already attained great efficiency. Boston proposes to erect a monu ment to the memory of Edgar Allan Poe. The memorial is to stand in the public gardens, which adjoin the his toric common. Edgar A. iroe was not a great man in the true acceptance of the word. Neither was he a super latively good one, but in the matter of genius, from a literary standpoint, he possibly outranked all other Americans of his day. The man'i genius should be commemorated; his faults forgotten. A new source of supply for gutts -percha has just been discovered in Zanzibar, East Africa. It comes from a fruit that looks like a peach, but as as large as the a vera ire cantaloupe It is wholly unfit for food, but through experiments it was , found that the milky juice, when thrown into boil ing water, would harden into a sub Stance so nearly like gutta percha as to be almost impossible to tell the cifference. Nature seldom puts all her eggs in one basket. JS 4
