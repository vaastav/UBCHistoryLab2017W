Thus It will bo seen tbat from tbo first meeting of Congress until tho beginning ot the rebellion thero was a heavy Import duty on sugar except during thirteen years tbat alter tbo acquisition ot Louisiana our only sugar producing country that this duty was largely Increased and that In 1600 out of 415000 tons of sugar consumed 130000 tons or 35 per rent was mado In this coun try Louisiana produced nearly all ot this sugar n email quantity being mado In Texas and Florida Tbe war of tho rebel lion totally destroyed sugar production so that In 1C0 the year of Its close only 8C0O tons wero produced out of 391000 tons consumed Hut tbo heavy duties levied In 1803 solely to produco rcveuuo becauso thero was not a pound of sugar raised In tho loyal states stimulated tho production lu Louisi ana so tbat In four years It was nearly 80 000 tons Instead of 8500 In 1870 Louisiana having again taken Its place In Congress tbo rate of duties were cbarged somewhat to afford It still greater protection and In 1875 uhen Congress be came Democratic 25 per cent was added to tbo already high rate of duty for tho pur pose of helping tho Louisiana sugar pantcre Louisiana tbat year produced one eleventh ot tho sugar consumed In tho country and It docs not produco quite that amount now Tbo effort mado by tho Republican party to stlmulato tho production ot cana sugar by a protcctlvo tariff has now lastoil twenty years When It began tho country pro duced one eleventh of the sugar consumed ancTat tho close of tho twenty years It pro duces one twelfth of tho amount consumed During that timo tho government has collected ono thousand million dollars from tho pcoplo upon ono of the ncccssirles of life and Is to day collecting ouo dollar a year from every man woman and child In tbo country to aid tbs Louisiana sugar planters For each pound ot sugar raised In Louis iana during theso twenty years tho paoplo havo paid alter paying for tho sugar they use nearly tnenty ntnecenti Averaging tbo population at 45000000 each Inhabitant has paid tucnty two dollars lax on sugar to aid the Louisiana sugar planters Is It not tlmo to stop this foolishness J Tbo pcoplo could betterafford to take every sugar planter In Louisiana and board him nnd his family at tho St Charles Hotel In New Orleans during tho winter and at tho Grand Union at Saratoga In the summer than to contlnuo tho present method of keeping them It Is very desirable tbat tbo country should produco food clothing and arms for homo consumption and a protcctlvo tariff becauso of tbo countrys great variety of cllmato and soil and Us varied mineral resources will Coubtlcss cuablo It do so with all articles not of tropical growth But the experiment has failed so far ns sano sugar Is roncerned and It Is tlmo to call a halt as tho government do6s not any longer need tbo revenue derived from tbo duties on sugar In disposing of this EUbJect Congress should consider ono fact and that Is this that tho family ot tho poor

Cady ot Atlanta Co has an Interview In tho Galveston Kews In which ho suggests a novel and somewhat striking Idea on tbo subject of river and harbor Im provements Mr Cady proposes that In all cases w hero tbo federal government Is called upon to furnish tbo money for Im proving rivers or harbors tho cities or states to bo Immediately benefited should undertake to pay ono belt tho cost ot tho proposed undertaking For example sup posing It would cost eight millions to se cure deep water In tbo harbor of Galveston tho state ot Texas and tha city ot Galveston or both should undcrtako to supply one half of tbo sum Thus It Is suggested tbo federal treasury would bo called upon to help only tboso who aro willing to help themselves and besides thero would It Is believed bo much greater caro and watch fulness m tho expenditure of tho money wlththepeoploof tho locality directly In terested In Its economical and offcetlvo ap plication Tho National Repcwlioan Is not prepared to soy tbat this plan sliould bo odopcd as a universal rule but It Is cer tainly worthy of respectful consideration Sieakino ot tho estimates of expendi tures for tho noxt fiscal year tho Albany Join mil notices that It Is proposed to spend 30000000 on river nnd harbor Im provements of which over 7500000 Is devoted to tho Mississippi river and re market Tho Mississippi river Is tho rival or tho water system of which tho Erlo canal Is an essential part Thero la tho greatest Injusllco In spending so large a sum for tho benefit or ouo system of water transportation whllo tho competing Bjstem Is left to Bhlfl for Itself Every patriotic man wishes to sco every part of Iho country prosper and thero is certainly trado enough from tho west to rcqulro both the I Mississippi and Erlo canal routes to tho seaboard Thero should bo at least nn ap proach toward fairness In tho treatment of theso two waterways by Congress Onoot theso highways Is tbo work of naturo and tho property ot tho nation the other Is tho work of man and tho property oi a state Perhaps It tho state of Now York would mako a freo gift of tho canal system to tbo nation Congross might ac cept and caro for It Tbe general govern ment will not Invest largely In property tho tltlo of which Is vested In a stato Till most painful fact ot tho present national situation Is that tbo great ques tions of revenue and finance now pressing
