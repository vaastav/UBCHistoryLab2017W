HERALD AND TRIBUNE. JOXESBOKO. TEN'N., PEC. 17, 1885. The Democrats continue to call John Sherman an Iceberg. They probably ex pect a chilly time of it. Senator Beck, of Kentucky, is in dignant at the President's silver policy, and trill do all be can to smash it. The trouble with this Administration is that it is too anxious to reduce the tariff and too indifferent to reducing the public debt. ' The Government is likely to be placed under the cruel necessity of shooting and hanging a few hundred Mormon outlaws in the interest of reform. Is the twelve Massachusetts cities which voted on the local option question last Tuesday eleven adopted license and one only choose prohibition. Genehai, Logan's declination of the Senate's presidency probably spoiled more Democratic cditoriul matter than any one man s act during the present generation. IP William II. Vandcrbilt had done nothing else to win public respect,' the American people would always be rever ently grateful for bis delicate generosity to General Grant. What is tho matter with the postal card business? The supply is so limited that postmasters are everywhere com plaining that they can not meet the de mand. Vilas must bo tinkering again. A long and bitter debate on the silver question in Congress is a prediction of the Democratic New Orleans Timet Democrat, but it hopes and expects to see the advocates of silver demonetization fail. The plurality of Governor Hill, of New York, as declared by the State Board of Canvassers, is 11,134, and be is in a minority on the popular vote of 13,309. The total vote of the State was 1,025,239. Three of the leaders in the Maine con spiracy to count in a Democratic Legis lature a few years ago have been given otllco by the Cleveland Administration, and now ex-Govcrnor Garcclon himself is an applicant for a post-office. The Providence Journal very properly contrasts the candid and respectful treat ment Mr. Cleveland's message receives from tho Republican press with the surly, disingenuous treatment the messages of Republican presidents used to receive from Democratic papers. Senator IIakws, of Tennessee, in a letter to the Nashville Union, put him self down in favor of tho general Government's right to regulate inter state commerce, but reserves to the State governments the power to regulate com merce within their own borders. ' General Lawtos,, of Georgia, who, by promptly and manfully declining the Russian mission saved President Cleve land from much of tho embarrassment which he suffered through the persis tency of other ineligible appointees, has petitioned Congress for the removal of his political disabilities. The petition should be promptly granted, and then Lawton ought to get something. ITc has been a square man. Congressman Hemi'iiim,, of South Carolina, has returned to Washington filled with the conviction that if the coinage of Bland dollars is continued un til they drop in purchasing power to their real value the South will be the chief sufferer. The South is absorbing the largest share of theso eighty -cent dollars and when the inevitable decline in their value comes, which must follow their continued inflation, that section must suffer the most which has the largest volumCof this cheap currency on hand. If Mr. Hemphill can impress his col league with the undeniable truth of this fact the suspension of the compulsory coinage will be easily accomplished. Decknct will compel the English journals to refrain forever after this from criticising American election methods, and speaking snecringly of riots and dis order here in times of political excite ment. Their present record is a more shameful ono than any of ours in the worst days of mob law. Ono candidate dying from injuries received at the hands of a mob, another just saved from being thrown Into the river after having been beaten black and blue, twenty residences and two hotels wrecked in ono place, fifty casulties in another, scores of citi zens and policemen injured at a third "riots the order of tho day," In fine- such aro the facts cabled last week. And theso things, it Is to be noted, happened In England, not in Ireland. TnE Democratic majority of tho Su preme Court of Ohio has decided that the frauds and forgeries in the election returns of Hamilton county shall not be eliminated, and thnt the Democratic Btato Senators elected by these frauds and forgeries shall have tho certificates. The whole transaction is one Of the most disgraceful in the history of politics There is an honest Republican majority In Hamilton county or 8000 or 0000, as has been demonstrated at the last three elections held in the county. But by systematically stuffing the registration list and the ballot boxes, nnd then forging returns, the Democratic candidates for the Legislature were given a few hun dred majority. Tho Circuit Court, on a writ of mandamus, threw out tho fraudu lent returns and elected the Republican candidates, and now tho Supreme Court has reversed this decision. This decision is mode still more disgraceful by the fact ' that one of tho Democratic Supreme Judges who took part In making this decision is an appointee of Governor Iloadlv to fill a vacancy. Hit successor was elected last October and U a Republi can, and will take his scat as soon as the result of tho election on State officers is declared. According to law, oil there turn ouirht to have been lent to tho i Secretary oi staio wccks ago, uut tue same Democratic clerk of Hamilton county who declared the Democratic State Senators elected on fraudulent re turns has held back the returns on Slittc officers from the county so as to keep the Democratic Judge on the bench. The Judge returned the favor by helping to give the partisan decision just made public. Nowhere in his long message did President Cleveland find room to say a word about the colored people or to en courage any of the movements made to further their welfare. He could devote as much space as a president's message usually occupies to foreign relations, dis cuss the Chinese question, the independ ent state of the Congo and naturalization frauds, but ho had no concern about 7,- 000,000 of pcoplo whose future is one of the most intricate problems the nation has to settle. Such profound silence Is significant and it will be interpreted as meaning that Mr. Cleveland shares the prejudices of the Dcmocartic party asainst the colored race. When one man injures another it almost invariably awakens in his mind an antipathy to the man injured, nnd the fact that Mr. Cleve land was given tho opportunity to write a presidential message only through the suppression of tho black vote may Iinvc had the effect to deepen his dislike for the colored citizens. At all events, he Ignores them as profoundly as If they were inhabiting the wilds of Africa. A 

DEMOCRATIC 8LANDKK. The Nashville American of the 14th inst., in an editorial, under the head of "Pension Frauds," says: East Tennessee Is full of pensioners as liistv and able-bodied as any men in the world. Republican bosses, to maintain political prestige, have aided thousands of these persons to get upon tho Govern ment pension rolls. To this system of despoiling the Government, ana taking tho money wrung as tnxes from the people of the United Slates, more, perhaps, than to anything else, tho strength of Repub licanism in East Tennessee is to be im- fiutcd. There Is no better place for tho nvcstlgation to be instituted than in the Republican regions of East Tennessee. This Is an unmitigated slander, not on ly on the pensioners of East Tennessee, but also on the largo number of highly respected Democratic claim agents who arc now, aud have been for years, engag ed in the prosecution of pension claims for these veterans. Dr. William Sevier, whose reputation as a physician and a prominent Democrat was not confined to East Tennessee, was for years, and up to the date of his death, a member of the Pension Examining Board for this congressional district, and nided and assisted in the examination of hundreds of these soldiers who are on the pension rolls. The above utterance is a slander on his memory and an imputation on his honesty. The hardships, privations and expos ure endured by the East Tennessee Union men from 1801 to 1865, first in escaping the conscript catchers of the Southern Confederacy, and then in tb,e service tf their country, resulted In more or less disability in ninn cases out of ten, and those now on the pension rolls arc not onlv leeallv and justly entitled to their pensions, but every honorably discharged Union soldier in East Tennessee ought to have a pension. The object of the inves tigation is not the detection of frauds, for few if any exist in' East Tennessee, bet the bosses of tho machine Democracy arc apprehensive that the tweuty thousand Republican majority in East Tennessee is fatal to Democratic success in the State, and they hope to intimidate tho pension ers Into their support by threatening them with a loss of their pensions. All the powers of the Southern Con federacy in 1801 could not make Demo crats out of the loyalists of East Tennes see, nor will the threats and Blunders of the Democratic bosses in 1886 accomplish that result. The Rum Tower In Atlanta. The question of State prohibition, cither by statutory enactment or State constitutional provision, will likely go to the Supreme court of the United States, as a result of a recent election in Atlanta. On November 20, an Atlanta liquor dculer and wine Importer, acting with a Cincin nati firm interested in the Atlanta Brew ing Company, obtained from the United States District court a temporary writ of Injunction, restraining the Ordinary of Fulton county from counting the ballots or declaring the result of the election. The local option law prohibits the sale of all but native wines, but it does not pro hibit tho importation of foreign wines, and it has been decided by the Supreme court of the United Stales that a per mission to import carries with it the right to sell. The Cincinnati parties appear in court as having tlieir vested rights de stroyed. 1 hey go upon the theory that tho United States government is bound to protect manufacturers and dealers in liquor because it recognizes the manu facture and tralllc by levying taxes on the product of the distilleries and on places where the traffic is carried on This argument will not hold good. The ledcral special tax Is not a license. I he United States law requires every liquor dealer to pay a certain amount of tax; but tne payment of that tax only authorizes iuo person wno pays it to sell iiouor in accordance with (he law of (he place. Such is mo specino provision ot the statue, it is a disclaimer that the United States pos scsscsthe Tight to intcrfcro with the power of the State to control tho traffic. and is a recognition of the right of the State to tax, license or prohibit, as It may cnoose. louao made. Arguing Against Atlanta's New Laws. Atlanta, Ga., Dec. 12. In the United States Court to day, Judge McKay pro Biding, argument was begun In the con tested election case. Hon. Albert II. Cox, representing the liquor dealers, argued that the bill was unconstitutional under the Federal Constitution, because it inter-state commerce and discriminated between citizens of the several States in that it allowed the sule of Georgia wine, but prohibits the sale of wine mado in other States; also that the bill is in viola tion of the Georgia Constitution, because it was passed as a general bill, but is lo cal in Its operations. He attacked the legality of election, on the ground th at it was ordered and registration took place before the bill was published, and that the registration was Illegal, because It closed ten days before th election, nnd voters who became qualified after regis- trntion were not allowed to vote; that the use of three ballot boxes at each Atlanta precinct was illegal. , MR, VANDERBILT'S WILL. Cornelias and William K. Oct the Bulk of It-Forty Millions In Trust. New YonK, Dec. 13. There was an unusual stir yesterday forenoon around the office of Probate Clerk Charles H. Beckett, as it was expected that the will of William H. Vandcrbilt would be filed. At noon the four sons, Cornelius, Willlnm Frederick and George, with the attorneys of the estate, Chauucey M. Depew and Henry H. Anderson, of the firm of An derson & Howland, came into the office. Clerk Beckett closed the door and a peti tion for the probating of the , will was presented, signed by Cornelius Vander bilt, William K. Vanderbilt, Frederick W. Vanderbilt and George W. Vander bilt. Two copies of tho will were filed in the office. Each covers eighteen and a quarter pages of foolscap type-writing and contains between 5,500 and 0,000 words. The will first makes provision for the widow. To her the decedent gives for her use during life the house in which he resided at tho time of his death. The pictures and other works of art, horses, carriages and stables, and also leaves her nn annual allowanco of $200,000.

This will be divided into eight equal parts, and each of the eight children is to receive the income from $5,000,000 during life. The princi nul eocs to the children of each ono in such proportions as that child may direct bv will. II any son dies witnouv leaving issue, his portion is divided among his surviving brothers or tticir surviviug is sue. The same direction is applied to the daughters' shares. Tho testator next sets aoart 1:40.000,000 of certain specilied securities and directs tnai mcy De inviu- eu into eight equal parts and distributed to the children, civins to each one $5,- 000,000 absolutely. After the death of the widow the wonts or nrt, excepting tho marble bust of Commodore Vandor hilt, (which is given to Cornelius) the family residence, horses, etc., In which the widow is given a lifo estate, arc be queathed to George W. Vanderbilt or to liis children u lie suouiu do aeau. u George W. dies without leaving issuo William II. Vanderbilt, the eldest son of Cornelius, will receivo this property and $2,000,000 besides. The testator gives $1,000,000 to this grandson, irrespective of George W. leaving children. If the grandson, William II., is not living at the time when such bequests would lail to him, they will go instead to the next son of Cornelius, who bears tho same name as bis father, "my object being," the testator says, "that my present residence nnd my collection oi worts oi art ue re taincd and maintained uy a male aescen dant bearing the name or vandcrbilt. Mr. VBiiderbilt also gives $30,000 to William V. Kissam, a nephew; to Jacob II.

The will is under seal and is dated September 25, 1884. The witnesses are Charles A. Rnpallo, Samuel F. Barger, U. U. Clark and 1. 1. Cham bers.

Thinking a few items from sunny Florida might be of some interest to your numerous readers, I take the liberty of sending you a few from our little city. Orange growers are busy gathering and shipping their fruit to market. The first shipments did not prove profitable in consequence of the unripe condition of the oranges. The citizens of Florida are turning their attention largely to grow ing vegetable for the Northern market. Tomatoes, cabbage, onions, beans, squash, cucumbers, sweet potatoes, etc., all do well hero and bring a handsome price, the late cool weather and frost have injured the bananas, guavas, etc. I made garden early this year with the expectation of feasting upon vegetables during the winter, but Jack-frost was so greedy that he consumed the whole crop at one meal. The health of the community is good, with exception of a few persons who came here too late to be benefitted by the delightful climate. There is a large immigration to this State as well as quite a number who came to spend the winter. Almost every train is crowded with people seeking homes and health. Our railroads are small aud the rolling stock is not first-class. The engines are small and often run with one cylinder head out, and sometimes they .have to take crowbars to help start the train. It does not seem as if they have any regu lar time to run; sometimes two hours abend of time, and often three or four hours late. Mr. Geo. Galloway, one of our East Tennessee boys went hunting the other day and could not find any game to shoot, so he let his gun go off accidentally and , one or two shot took effect In his big toe. Well, I guess you will get tired reading my letter if I string it out too long, so I will close for this time. W. R. Fink. CHESTNUT CROVE. Dec. 12.

Dec. 15 The Eighth District Btill ex ists, and its citizens still rank among the intelligent, tho industrious, the enter prising, the good and the bad of the hu man race. The educational interests of our dis trict are thriving. Our people seem to manifest a greater interest in their schools and seem to be concerned in their child ren's welfare more than formerly. They seem to have caught the Bpiritof cduca tlon, realizing that the education of their children will be their safeguard after they have been removed from the busy scenes of life. Three of our schools have adopted the uniform system of text books; the remaining two arc using any kind and every kind thnt the parents choose to send. I predict that the schools thnt are using tho uniform system will be far more satisfactory to all concerned than the two not using them. Mr. Jas. Hart8ell, who hos been visit ing relatives and friends for some time, has returned to his home in Roan county.
