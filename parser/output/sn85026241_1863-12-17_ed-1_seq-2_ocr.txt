The tnes- tage, as transmitted by telegraph, we frightfully butchered ; in fuct, tha tense of it was aknoat deittrovedi. For this reason we hare ermohided to re-print the latter part ef it, relating to the war and to reconatruc tion. We copy from a Washington City paper the Intelligencer When Cnnsjrem aatemhlad a rear ai tha war bad already lastud nearly twenty months aud there had beeu tuauy eotifiiets- on both tend and ken, with varyina: results. -The roliellion had been nrerwd back into reduced limits; yet the tone of po'me feeling and opinion, at home unit am-outi, was not aaiis- liiutory. nil cutiar em in. the popular election;, then Just past, imlicuted uneuM- nes. unionir ourselves, while amtrl much that was cold and menacing tba kindest words coin in from Ktiroiro were uttered in aocenta of pity that we were too bllud to surrender a hnirflle enure. Uur commerce was suf ferine greatly by a lew ai mm) rebels built upon and furnished from foreign shores, and we were tureatenrd with, lurh additions from the same quarter as would sweep our trnde trom the sea and raise our l.sackuilu. We had failed to elicit front Kuropesn Gov ernments any thing hopeful upon this sub ject. The preliminary emancipation procla liou, issued in Scplriuliet, was running it assigned period to tho bug-inning of the new; year. A itinnttt later the nual proclamation came, me;uding the announcement that col ored men of suitable condition would be re ceived in the war scrviee. Tha polioy of emancipation and of employing black soj diers gave to the future a now aspect, about which hope, and fear, and dmibl eonlendud in uncertain conflict According to oar po litical system, as a matter of civil adminis tration, tbe ticueral Uoverninent had no lnwlul power to effect emnncipntinn in any State, and for a long time it had been hoped that tho rebellion could be sunDressed with out resorting to it aa a military measure. It was all the while deemed pcvMlilo that tho necessity fur it might come, an 1 that, if it should, the orisis of the contest would then be presented. It came, and, aa we antici pated, it was followed by dark and douln- lul ilnys. f.leren months having now passed, we aro permitted to take another review. The ruhol borders are pressed still further back, and by the complete opening of the Missis sippi the country dominated by the robot- lion H divided into distinct parts, with no practical communication between them. and tor and and to the bill strike the of the tho 1 Iive- Wil Win : ar : un fertile the 8n- for tne Ke ferred All Con ' per- de clared on free- of the ex tha a oon-l of! him self amend inoom there- and Danish- have fennesseeund Arkansas have bet'n snl atanlially cleared of insurgent oontrol, and inllueoliul citizens in each, owner ol slaves and advocates of slavery at the beuinuitig of the rebellion, now declare openly for emancipation in their respective plates. Ul those States not Included in the emanci pation ptoclaiuation, Maryland auJ Missouri, neither of which three years ago would tol erate any restraint upon the extension ot slavery into new Territories, only dispute now as to the beat mode ot rcniovini it it within theii own limits. Of those who wore slaves at the beirinniiitt ot the rebel lion, full one hundred thousand are now in tbe United States military service, about one-half of which number actually bear aim in tho ranks; thus giving the double advantage of taking so much labor from tbe insurgent cause, and supplying tbe places which otherwise must be filled with so many white men. So fa ejus tested, it is difficult o say they are not as aood suldier as any, No servile iiiiurrectiou, or tendency to vio lence or creel ty, has marked the meaiures of eiuanoiuation and arminz tho blacks. 1 lies ineannrea have, been union dwneaed in foreiarn countries, and ounteiuDorary with such disouision the tone ol uublie sentiment there is much improved. At homo the same measures have been fully disoussod, sui perted, criticised, and denounced, ana the annual elections lollowing aro bigbly en oouraging to those whose otticial duty it to hear tbe country through this great trial. Thus wo hare the new reckoning. The crisis which threatened to divide the friends of the Union is past. Looking now to the present and future, and with reference to a resumption of the national authority within the States whera in that authority has been suspended, have thouiht fit to issue proclamation, cony of which ia herewith transmitted. On examination of this proclamation will uppear, s is bolisved, that nothing attempted beyond what is amply Justified the loiiaututinn. true, the lorm ot au oal is itiven, but no man ia ooeroud lotake it. The man is only promised a pardon in case lie voluntarily lakes the oath, lhe Const tutinn authorises the Executive to grant withhold the pardon at Ins own abolut duoretion: and this includes tho power graut on terms, as ia fully established judicial and otbor authorities. It ia also proffered that if, in any of the States named a atate Uoverninent shall be, in the mod proscribed, set up, such Government shall lie recognised and guarantied by the United States, and that under it the State shall, the constitutional conditions, be prolcoted asainst invasion and domestic violence. The constitutional obligation of the United States to guaranty to every State in tho Union republican form of Government, and protect the State In lhe casca stated, la ex illicit and full. But why tender tho benefits of this pro vision only to a State Government set up this particular way? This section of the Constitution contemplate ease wherein the element within a Stato, favorablo to re publican government, in tha Union, may too feeble for an opposite and hostile ele ment external to or even within 4ha Slate and such are precisely the cases with which we are now dealing. An attempt tn guar anty and protect revived Stato Govern ment, constructed in whole or in ' prepon derating part from the very eleinout against whose hostility and violence it is to be pro tected, i aimply absurd. There must lie lest by which to scnarate the onnoaina ele-l tuenta, so as to build-mily from the sound (nd that teat ia auHioiently liberal one which (ooeut as sound whoever wi l make a (worn recantation ot his former unsound Bui if it be proper to require, aa test admission to the political body, sn ' nath allegiance to tha Constitution of the United States and to the Union nnder it, why also to the lawa and proclamation In regard slavery? Those Jaws and proclamations were enaoted and puC forth for the purport of aiding in tho luppresinn of th rebel lion. To give them their fullest effect, there bad to be pledge for their mainte nance. In my judgment they bar aided. and will further aid. tho cause lor vhioh they were intended. To now abandon them ould be not enly to relinquish a lever power, but would also bo cruel astounding breach of faith. ' I may add at this point that while I main in my preaent position I (hall not tempt to retract or modify tbe emancipation Droolamation : nor ehell 1 raturet to alavarv any person who i fre by the term of proclamation, or by any of tho act o( Con greu. For these and other reason it thouirht belt that snnoort of theaa maa. ores shall be Included in the oath ; and it Dciiuveu in jaawnuive way lawinuv in return for pardon and restoration of' forfeited riahr. which he hasolear constitu tional power to withhold altogether, or gnnt upon the terms which he shell deem wisest for the Dublio interest.

Te objections lo premature presenta tion of a plan by the ' National Executive cow'st in the danger of eommittalaon points which eould lie more safely left lo further developments, tare has been taken to so shape tho document as to avoid embarrass mentif from this sonrcs. Saying that, on certain terms, ccrttrin clasws will be pardon ed, with ri;hia restored, it is not said that other classes, or other lei iii, will never bo included, haying that reconstruction will be accepted if presented In a specified way, it Is not said it will never be accepted iu any other way. - Tho movements, by State action, for mancipation in several of the States, not included in the emancipation proclamation, are matters of profound gratitulation. And while I do not repeat in detail what I have heretofore so earnestly urged upon this sub jeet, my general views and ladings remain unchanged ; and 1 trust tlutt i ougrcss win omit no fair opportunity of aiding these im- pon ant steps to a great con-uuiination In the midst of other cares, however im portant, we must not lose sight of the fact that the war power is still our main reliance. To that nower alone can we look, yet for a time, to give oouhdence to the people in the contestod reginns, that tho insurgent power will not uguin overrun them. Until that confidence shall be established, ittln can be done any where tor whnt is called reconstruction. Hence our c hie test care must still be directed to the army aud navy, who hvo thus tar borne their harder part so nobly and well. And .it may be esteemed fortunate that in giving the great est efficiency to these indisiiensable arms. we do also honorably recognise the gallant men, from command r to sentinel, whocom nose them, and to whom, more than to others, tho world must stand indebted for the home nf freedom disenthralled, regeu eiated, enlarged, and perpetuated.

The Rebels Ionic aito passed acts and is sued proclamations embodying and announ cing their determination to treat tbe omcers and urivates oi'ourblaok reaiuient as above ataterl. And there can be no rational iluuut that they are as bad as their word. Bo lore we had a black company in the field, they knlaapped tho drivers ot carriages sent down in August, 18(13, to the battie-neid ol uen. Pone's Bull Run with relief for our wound ed. and (went them off into Slavery. They did the same with those betrayed into their hands by .Miles' treachery at HVpcr'a Fer ry. Last June, as they swept across Mary land and u u into Southern Pennsylvania, they caught rjnito a number of blacks some of them, doubtless; fugitives troni Rebel owners, but many free born and earned them all off into bondage. And up to tbia hour, alter meeting our black soldiers in tair ngnt at least a union tunes, wnerein they hove always had tho advantage over in position or in numbers, the;: have never yet exchanged one single prisoner, white black, balonging to colored regiment, and we presume tiny are resolved that they nev er till. And they are torturing and starving our captured brothers in order to compel our Government to exchange for whites only, and leave officer nnd privates of our colored regiments to be enslaved or murder ed without resistance on our Dart.
