ONROE, Register. 1868.) the has day is by to tlic He a of ing until and gave the from and side the will of of B. of NEWS OF THE WEEK. Hronek, the Chicago dynamiter, has been sentenced to twelve years in the penitentiary. The democrats will have 159 votes in the house of representatives and the re publicans 166 a majority of 7. The bank of Durham, N. C., owned and controlled by W. T. Blackwell, the man ufacturer of the Durham smoking tobacco, has failed for half-a-million dollars. The Fiftieth congress of the United States convened, at Washington, on Mon day Dec. 3d. The proceedings of that body will now till the public prints to the exclusion of much interesting matter. Mail advices from the west coast of Africa say a rumor Jias reached Conuy from the Upper Nigffl' that Henry Stanley is proceeding back oFthe Great Oil rivers under the British flag, and that the natives were friendly. John W. Keely was committed to jail by a Philadelphia judge Saturday for contempt of court in refusing to explain to a committee of experts appointed by tlic court the secret of the Keely motor. He lias been released op bail, A special from Oklahoma says: The settlers who have lately gone there held a convention. After a thorough discussion of their interests as affected by the pend ing congressional legislation unanimously resolved tq throw np tfoeir plaims and abandon the territory and improvements until they had full warranty to occupy and enjoy the same. Forty thousand persons, at Toronto, gave Wm. O'Connor, tjje winning oars man, a reception Dec. 3rd that eclipsed the one given to Haptan on his return from the American centennial. He was presented with an address, a check for $1,000, and a purse containing $300 in gold. A telegram conveying the gov ernor-general's congratulations was read and many prominent citizens made speeches. m Parson" Davies, Jake Kilrain's manager, was interviewed by the Chicago Times to the effect that Kilraln w ill fight John L. Sullivan with bare knuckles to a finish under prize ring rules for $5,000 a side within ten or twelve weeks. Richard K- Fox, Kilruin's backer, said Davies, stands ready at any time to make the necessary dejiasit, and Kilrain is qnally anxious to hear, too, that Sullivan will agree. Aron Vanderpoole, chairman of the naval reserve committee of the Boad of Trade, has distributed a circular seeking information and suggesting the feasibility of establishing a naval militia for the United States by legislative enactment. Among those communicated with are Gen, Schofield, Admiral Porter, Governor Gordon, of Georgia, Governor Fitzhugh Lee, of Virginia, General Beauregard, of Louisiaua, Cornelius Vanderbilt, Jay Gould, Chauncey M. Depew and Claus Spreckels. The sailors of the steamer Haytien Republic, now under seizure at Port au Prince, who arrived at New York a few days ago, complain that they were ill treated by Haytien soldiers, who purposely made a noise over the head of a comrade dying of yellow fever; that after his death they carried his body away and damped it in a swamp without burial. They seem particularly put out because Captain Ramsey, of the United States steamer Boston, did nothing for them. The reading of the president's message occupied one hour and twenty minutes. The portions of it which discuss the ques tions of tariff revision, treasury surplus, fishery troubles and West incident were listened to with very close attention and apparent interest by the fourteen repub lican senators, and about an equal number of democrats. OLier portions of the message seemed to have few, if any listeners, and the reading had the effect of gradually clearing the galleries of the numerous spectator. The president has made the following appointments: Congressman Perry Bel mont the first New York district to be minister to Spain, Howard Ellis of New Jersey to be consul at Rotterdam, Charles B. Tsail, of Maryland^ to be secretary of the legation in Brazil, William H. Chand ler, of Pennsylvania, David Urquhars, Jr., of Louisana, Charles B. Richards, of Connecticut, Howard A. Clark, of Massa chusetts, aud David King, of Rhode Island, to be assistants to the commis sioner-general to the International exposi tion to be held at Paris in 1889. A bloody fight took place on Sunday m the streets of Portland, between the two factions of Chinese highbinders. Trouble between the two crowds has been brewing for sume 4 time. Thursday a street fist fight occurred between several highbind ers and Sunday afternoon a sanguinary meeting took place on the streets. About twenty Chinamen all armed with pistols, participated. Over fifty shots were ex changed and the row lasted some ten minutes. Four highbinders were shot down and two others badly wounded. Four were removed to the hospital, where one died very soon after. 'The other is 3 a three were fatally wounded and cannot live. The two other wounded men were carried away during the fight by tlieir countrymen. Several more are believe wounded. Most intense excitement pre vails in Chinatown, where several thou sand Chinese are congregated. It is feared the trouble is not ended. The bloody fight is due to the hatred caused by rivalry of interests between the factions. The grand six-day walking match at the Madison Square garden, in New York city, was finished last Saturday night. Littlewood, the winner, walked 623 miles. Herty, second, rounded out 605. Mike Kelly presented a belt to Little wood with a brief speech. Champion Albert challenged Littlçwood to another match for the championship of the world, each man entering to put up a thousand dollars, to be divided among the walkers, in addition to sharing the gate receipts. The gate receipts for the week amounted to $19,123. Of this $9,561.50 will be divided among the walkers. Littlewood will get $3,824. with $1,000 added for breaking the record. Littlew'ood and Herty feel no bad effects from their ex ertions at the walking match last wick, ft Is understood that flip next race will be in February. The contestants will be in two classes. The first-class will consist of men like Littlewood, Albert, Rowell and Herty, and cacli man will put up $1 ,000 for a sweepstake, in addition t° wjiicli the winner will get a share of the gate money. The second-class men will each put up $200 entrance fee. This arrangement is expected to keep out the useles small fry that have encumbered previous races. The Calumet &ITecla mine in Michigan is on tire again. Flames were discovered at midnight by a party of tim ber men, consisting of Christopher Hull, Chas. G. Larson and Henry Berkivvinki. One of them smelled smoke and they searched until the fire was located in No. 3 shaft of the Calumet mine. It is sup posed that the fire is as low as the eighth or tenth level and extends upward to the surface. A vast body of smoke mingled with sparks is pouring out the opening. Rull and party immediately warned the one hundred or more miners who were in dangerous parts of the miue aud they es caped by the main entrance. Eight men who were working in the main entrance shaft 1,700 feet deep, are missing, and it is almost certaiu that they have been smothered owing to the great heat and dense smoke which is in No. 3 shaft, and is beginning to prevade the entire Calu met part of the mine. No rescuing party could live ten minutes, and the missing men must be abauded to their fate. The names are* Joseph Masolis, Antonio Katta resina, John Vanderbilt, W. G. Martin, Kcw Hanson, and three others, an a his the put pan to has or as names unknown. Four of the men are married and leave families. Everything goes to show that tho mine was set on tire. Mag;innis of Montana. Pioneer Press. Hon. Martin Maginnis came down from Montana Sunday and took apartments at the Ryan. Mr. Ma ginnis was elected delegate to congress four times on the democratic ticket, and is loath to concede that the territory has a republican majority. A republican delegate and a republican legislature were chosen this year by 5,000 majority, but Mr. Maginnis attributes this to a general dissatisfaction among the demo crats. He thinks it probable that the territory will be made a state by the present congress. They have had a sea son of material prosperity in Montana as far as the three great pursuits of the terri tory, mining, stock raising and agricul ture are concerned. It was in the St. Louis convention that Maj. Maginnis made a national reputation. When the con vention was organized Mr. Maginnis wanted to present a resolution. Tem porary Chairman White shouted at the Montana man: "Your name and state." The clarion tones of thc major rang out, "Maginnis of Montana." The vast crowd took up the cry and the words Maginnis of Montana echoed from gallei y to gallery. When Dan Doherty nominated Cleveland and the bosses and officeholders had howled thepiselves hoarse the roll of States was called for and seconds. The convention listened to prosy speches, and wearied of hearing Cleveland alluded to as that ''matchless leader Grover Cleve land," while alleged orators spouted The territories were reached, and when Montana was reached one vast shout that fairly shook the building went up for "Maginnis of Montana." Nor would the assembly be appeased until the fiery poli tician mounted a chair and delivered the best one of the seconding speeches of the day. Then began inquiring who he was and it was then told that he was one of the snrvivers of that immortal charge of the First Minnesota volunteers at the bat tle of Gettysburg, and a man who had an honorable and useful career. J. J. Nickey, manager of the Grand hotel in Billing, a property valued at $30,030, is getting up a scheme to dis pose of the same by lottery. Besides the hotel prize there are to be one or two private residences to be included in the list, also some $10,000 in cash. If in in ig thc inost costlv of all the te Ie 

MONTANA NEWS. St. Andrews day was celebrated in Helena, by those of Scotch ancestors, by an elegant banquet. J. G. Van Voast, of Townsend, received a prize of $50 from Peter Henderson, of New York, for prize potatoes. E. B. Camp of Billings has resigned his office of mayor as lie intends to re move to Helena with his family. The New England people, who have settled in Helena, have organized them selves into a New England society, for social purposes. Many prominent Helena people are included in the society. Nelson Story has been losing so many cattle by their straying onto the Northern Pacific railroad track that lie has sta tioned men along the line lor some dis tance west of Park city to keep them driven back. Miles City Journal : An amateur vet erinarian, of Park county, predicts the prevalence of foot and mouth disease among the eastern Montana herds during the coming spring. He attributes the hoof trouble to incipient kidney trouble. His name Is Charles Depew. Husbandman: Mr. Manville, of this place, who lias been a large smelter operator of Lleadville, Col., says he will put up a smelter at Smith's camp if he pan contract for 80,000 tons of ore. The Castle Mountain Mining company is now prepared to contract one-third of this .'.mount, aud before spring may be able to contract for thp entire tot n ige required. Missoulian : The office of train master has just been created on the Rocky Moun tain division, W. H. Houston, of Missoula, being appointed to the position. Mr. Houston will have entire charge of the train service. Heretofore the superin tendents have managed this branch of the business, and as it often happens that the superintendent is uot a practical engineer or conductor, lie is incapable of giving orders understanding^ and holding the men to a just account. A. J. Urlin through his attorneys, Woody and Webster, lias commenced proceedings against the Northern Pacific railroad company for $50,000 damages. Mr. Urlin was in the Gold Creek wreck last summer and was probably more ser iously injured than any of the other pas engers. He was confined at the hospital over two months, and although able to be about now, is in feeble health. It is feared lie was hurt internally so severely as to preclude the hope of complete re covery Argus: The telegraph line from Poplar River to Fort Maginnis, in the Department of Dakota, 232 miles in graph lines connected with the military service. Thc total receipts from the line during the past year were $155.17, while the cost to the government for maintain ing and operating the section is over $4,000annually.—Glendive Independent. If government lines were put up properly in the first place it would not cost so much to keep them in repair. Agent Upshaw, of the Tongue River agency, reports little change in the con dition of the northern Cheyennes. He says they have done but little m agricul ture but have started at stock raising, and could, with encouragement, make a suc cess of it. The Indians earned $1,262 at freighting the past year. Their physical condition is good, and they seem to be in more comfortable circumstances than the other Montana Indians. They arc lazy and. headstrong and don't advance very rapidly in civilization. Salt Lake Tribune: The Carter cattle company, which has been operating in Wyoming and Montana, lately sold all their cattle interests in Montana for the handsome price of $275,000, and here after will operate entirely in Wyoming. Extensive ranges with a splendid ranch near Fort Bridger, will be the future home of their herds. This is one of the most successful cattle companies in the west, being the result of the labors of the late Judge Carter, who organized and carried on the company, oyrned chiefly by the Carter family. It is reliably stated that Mr. Marcus Daly has recently completed the purchase of about a dozen valuable horses, says the Butte Inter-Mountain, for his.stock farm in the Bitter Root valley, investing $60, 000 in the lot. This is the heaviest single investment of the kind in the country. Among the flyers are a number of Wilkes and Electioneer colts, and Favonia, a famous Ohio mare, record 2:15, for which Mr. Daly paid $25,000. It is stated that he also purchased, from Mr. Haggin, a thoroughbred mare at the cost of $17,000. Montana is the best horse country in the world, and it is the intention of Mr Daly to fully test its capabilities in this respect, and to improve as far as may be, the breeding and reputation of Montana horses. Herald : Russell and Adams, two horse thieves, who made a successful raid on a herd near Fort Benton last week, were followed as soon as their deed w*as dis covered by Deputy Sheriff Al. Rowe, of a a of Choteau county. Rowe tracked them to Arrow Creek and thence toward the Ju dith Gap, overtaking them finally near Sage creek. When they saw he was de termined to overhaul them they went out on a level piece of ground, dismounted, made breast works of their horses and leveled their rifles at him. They allowed him to come near enough to talk and then made him halt. They said they did not propose to be taken alive. They cautioned him not to follow them further. Russell said he knew every pass in the mountains, and that it would take a bloodhound to trail them and a dandy of a sheriff's posse to effect tlieir capture. It is certain that they are making tlieir way to the Yellow stone. Agent Briscoe, of the Crow agency, reports: The Crows will number 2,300. Hereditary disease aud the change from a nomadic life to houses, and an all meal diet is playing havoc with the health of the people. Allotments of lands to each Indian, the agent thinks, are too large. Forty acres would be enough. The fuel question is a perplexing problem for these Indians. The marriage of white to Indian women on the reservation is another evil which should if possible be checked. The white man who would now marry an Indian woman is low enough to commit any crime. With the exception of Thomas Stewart, the interpreter, all the squaw men should be ordered off the reservation. One of these "squaw men" claims the right by virtue of the interest of his wife and children to pasture 20,000 sheep on the reservation. The North Montana Cattle company formerly known as the Montana cattle company is again in trouble. The prom inent men interested in this company in clude Russell B. Harrison, son of the presidentelect; W. H. H. Miller, formerly law partner, of Gen. Harrison J. C. Johnston, of Washington; John S. Blair and J. K. McCannon. The two last named were formerly assistant attor ney generals of the United States. The Farmers Loan and Trust company, of New York, before Judge Bach at Bcn tou to foreclose a uiortgage given to it as trustee for thc bondholders of the North Montana Cattle company. The suit is based on alleged breaches of the terms of the mortgage. The bonds issued by the cattle company are $750.000 in amount and are held by the above named trust company. The breaches alleged are failure to keep defendants herd up to 22, 000 head, as agreed, the failure to pay interest on the bonds and the sale of cattle by which it is asserted the number was diminished, The North Montana Cattle company was formed m June, 1886. It succeeded to the business of the Montana Cattle company, and issued bonds to take up the indebtedness of that concern. Helena Herald: Workmen under Mr. M. II. Iveele, who has a contract for sewer excavation on the West Side, on Saturday made what bids fair to be an important discovery. While working on a trench iu Lawrence street, opposite the residence of Thomas Cruse, they encountered some quartz about eight feet below the surtaee. Mr. Keefe happening around about that time picked up a piece of the iron stained rock and saw that it was gold ore. He at once procured a notice of location aud posted it over the discovery, claiming a 1,500 feet of a lode. Subsequent explor ations developed several specimens of free milling gold ore, which were at once taken to the an assay er and tested. The result was a showing of a considerable amount of free gold, but the exact value we have not learned. From present indi cations the lead is two to three feet wide and trends towards the property of Mr. Cruse, who if inclined to prosecute the search for its continuation, may find a valuable gold mine in his back yard. A number of people visited the ground this morning to see such a novel sight as a gold mine in a public street and a number of ore sharps looked at the rock and pro nounced* it veritable gold quartz. Some hold the opinion that the lead runs with the street, east and west, while others as before stated, claim that the dip is south ward, toward Mr. Cruse's property. Red Lodge Notes. J. W. Taylor is away to Billings for freight with three four-horse teams. Freighters from this point find it pays to haul coal sixty-five miles for the Billings market. Rock Creek coal com mands the top price. T. P. McDonald, assessor-elect, ac companied by his family returned by Saturday's stage. Mrs. A. A. Ellis and son have returned from a visit to friends in Billings. Mr. Chas. Depew, veterinary surgeon, is doing good work among the sick horses in this vicinity. From his suc cess we judge he understands the dis ease that has proved so fatal in the bands of Ellis, Cole, Woods and others in the pan handle of Park county. W. R. Mahone has removed to the village for the purpose of sending his children to school and to serve our com munity as justice of the peace. Mrs. M. A Macumber with her tw'o sons have moved out on a ranch. Major Losekamp, accompanied by Mr. Sam Hanson, paid our camp a pleasant visit the past w'eek. School opened last Monday under the supervision of Mr. Peppinger. We have ihe material for an excellent school and having secured the services of au ex perienced and successful teacher we hope to note a marked improvement in the minds and morals of our young. E. D.
