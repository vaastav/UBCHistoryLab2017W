TWENTY-SIXTH YEAK. NO. 71. CONFIRMATION OF GEN. MACEO'S DEATH Is Received at the Spanish Legation 1 HIS BY CLAIMED la the Suicide of Gomez' Little Boy THE WHOLE TALE IS A FAKE It the Opinion of the Leaders ■ More Evidence Is Needed to Make the Story Credible Weyler Himsftlf Asks for Troops to Crush Maceo Two Days After the Alleged Death of the Insur gent Leader Associated Press Special Wire WASHINGTON, Dec. n.—Senor Du puy dc Lome, the Spanish minister, te> day received the following cablegram from Madrid from the duke of Tetuan. minister of state of Spain: "Confirm officially the death of the insurgent leader Antonio Maceo in a glorious bat tle for our troops, und also the suicide of tho son of Maximo Gomez." Senor de Lome also received a cable dispatch from Havana which seems to bear out the press report of the death ~1 Antonio Maceo and young Gomez. As the cable was sent last night before the press reports, it lacks many of the details of the latter. De Lome expects flesh advices from the government at Havana. The following dispatch in confirmation of his previous advices was received to day by Minister De Lome from the Span ish minister of foreign affairs: "The Insurgent leader, Antonio Ma cro, realizing the Impossibility of re maining in Pinar del Bio province, and being constantly pursued by Spanish columns, crossed the trocha on the 4th instant. He was at the head of over 2000 men whom lie had recruited from the local bands of the western part of the province of Havana, when he was over taken by Major Cirrujeda's column, 350 strong. Maceo's forces were routed, the leader being killed it:, the engagement, and Maximo Gomez' son committed su icide after being wounded. The Corpses have been identified and their clothing, arms and documents in their possession were taken by the Spaniards. The re mainder of the band have dispersed in consequence of the brilliant victory of our troops." NOT CREDITED WASHINGTON, De c. 9.—Second sec retary Diaz Albt rtini, the only member of the junta now In the city, expressed the opinion that the story had no basis of truth, and was sent out for the sole purpose of Influencing and if possible defeating action by the congress of the United States. "It is really amusing." he said, "to learn that Maceo wore silk socks con taining his Initials worked in red silk, and that bis linen und that of the young er Gomez were also marked with Initials. Neither of these men have worn linen shirts und silk socks for many a day. Them notice the letter to young Gomez. The Cuban in writing his child never signs his name as this letter was signed. M. Gomez. That is a cold formality the Cuban never employs. He would have Signed 'Your father.' The whole story- Is a feeble and transparent attempt to delay the action of congress and nothing else. The United States and the Span iards, too. will soon learn that Maceo Is very much alive." A SPANISH FAKE NEW YORK. Dee. 9.—Dr. Estrada Falma ar.d Dr. J. Castillo of the Cuban junta in this" city refuse to give credence to the report of the death of General An tonio Maceo in a recent engagement with Major Cirrujeda after crossing the tro cha in the western part of Cuba. "This is the seventh time that the news of Maceo's death has been circu lated with the semblance of official au thority," said Dr. Castillo. Continuing, the doctor said it had always been the custom to report Maceo had fallen in e'onfliot whenever he compelled the Spanish to retreat with heavy loss of life,. "If he is dead, his death will not end the contest." said Dr. Castillo, who in timated that he looked upon the report in the light of a Spanish "fake." "I shall reserve my decision until I re ceive more authentic infromation," was all that Gen. Palma would nay. Dr. Castillo thinks it strange that in making the identification of Maceo's body, no reference to the four bullet wounds on Maceo's breast was made. When the sixth report of hi? death had been circulated, one of the points of Identification was the finding of the ini tials "A. M." on the saddle. I saw the saddle and know there are no such let ters on it. added the doctor, who Is hope ful that the latter report will turn out o be a pure fabricaion. SPANISH REJOICING. MADRID. Dec. 9.—The official an nouncement of the death of Antonia Ma ceo and Francisco Gomez, son of Max imo Gomez, has been published and has caused the greatest enthusiasm.

The story is not thought to be true, but is believed to have been sent out by the Spanish government to stop action In congress for the relief of the insurgents, "merican correspondents sent couriers to the scene of the battle but they were chased back to the city by the Spanish troops.

PROOFS ADDUCED. Only Seem to Increase Doubt* of Gen. Maceo's Death. HAVANA. Dec. 9.—(Copyright, 1896. by the Associated PJLss). The confident claims of the Spanish officials that they have abundant proof of the death of An tonio Maeeo and his young aide, Fran cisco Gomez, son of Maximo Gomez, con tinue without abatement. The details announced today, however, of the fact* relied upon for the identification ot the two Cubans, have caused an undercur rent of doubt in the this city. Major Cirrujeda, who commanded the Spanish forces in the engagement at Punta Bra va on Monday and whose troops discov ered the two bodies and gave the evi dence of identification, consented to be interviewed on the circumstances of the case. He said today to the correspond ent of the Associated 1 Press that when the rebels were routed it was evident that the body of the chief waa abandon ed on the field. The Spanish column without stopping to explore the field went in hot pursuit of the insurgents and followed them for a mile or more. Mean time young Gomez is supposed to have committed suicide by Maceo's side. When the troops returned to Guato. after the- pursuit had ceased, various guerrillas belonging to Cirrujefla's com mand went over the field where the lout of the insurgents had occurred and searcehd the bodies remaining there for anything of importance. "The body of Maceo." Major Cirru jeda continued, "was relieved of a ring, clothing, etc. The guerrillas who per formed the act were at the lime quite unaware that the body was that of Maceo. In fact, ittle attention was paid to the identity of the bodies. It was al ready dark on the field, and it was rain ing. Various other bodies were also searched." It was an adjutant, according to Ma jor Clrrujeda's further statement, who insisted that the above mentioned body nnd the other which was lying by its side, were evidently ot first rate im portance, and that they must not be left without identification. "The two bodies were therefore tied by the feet to the tails of some horses," said the major, "and thus dragged over the ground, the IntenticS being to carry them to town for identlfle-ation. But after prooeeding for. awhile the horses became tired with their burdens, and the bodies were cut loose and left in the road." When tlie troops reached Guato, Major Cirrujeda proceeded to read the docu ments which had been found upon the bodies and which were described in a dispatch exclusively to the Associated Press yesterday. They Include a letter addressed to "Dear Pancho," signed M. Gomez; a diary of Maceo's operations from Nov. 28th to Dec. 7th. and a note in pencil found on the body of the young er man. saying he died rather than abandon the body of his general. Maceo. The undershirts and socks on the body of the older man were marked with the initials "A. M.." an da ring on the finger contained the engraved inscription, "Antonio y Mria." After reading these documents Major Cirrujeda says he became convinced that the bodies which his troops had abanrlrmed were those of Antonio Maceo and young Gomez. But it was then too late to return and recover them. Major Cirrujeda, however, expresses the firm conviction that they v ere those of Maceo and Gomez' son. , With the insurgents in the battle. Major Cirrujeda says, was a liclCAtiful Amazon, about 22 years old, who urged the rebels "a la machete," but at the same time Interposed to protect the pris oners. MMaJor Cirrujeda has taken charge of the objects found on the body said to be that of Maceo for further examina tion. There was a gold watch, a splen did pair of cuff buttons (Opera glasses referred to yesterday?— Ed.) made by Mnreu Torin. Paris, with five pointed stars on them and inclosed in a big strapped leather case; a hunting knife with an ebony handle and a gold mount ed and a good waterproof coat. All of these were taken from the body by the scout Santa Ana. It is thus seen that there has been nr, actual identification of the bodies them selves, the conviction as to the identity resting upon the evidence of documetns and articles found upon them. There is no doubt, however, of the assurance of the general public here that Maceo is dead. It is pointed out that he met his death in a similar manner to that of Jose Marti and Zayas. His loss Is re garded as the heaviest blow the revolu tion has received and tt was fet that his continued life was all that could save the Insurgent movement. He was the most striking personal character of the out break. Major Cirrujeda telegraphed to head quarters yesterday that after the battle at Punta Brava he had been obliged to abandon the bodies which in the course of a reconnoisance his troops had dis covered' to be the bodies of Antonio Ma ceo and Francisco Gomez. The guide of the column said the body looked like Maceo. Some one standing by observed that Maceo was in Pinar del Rio. but It is nevertheless believed that the bodies were those of the Cuban leaders. The bugler of the battalion of San Quentln was taking a ring from the fallen Cuban, when he found he was still alive. He thereupon killed him with a machete. The Insurgents, upon noting the small force of the reconnoitering party, rushed in with large numbers of troops and suc ceeded in carrying away the body said to be Maceo's. but without securing any of the Jewelry and papers which had been found upon it. Major Cirrujeda, In order not to aban don his dead, and wounded, was compell ed to retreat to Punta Brava. At Punta Brava the soldiers delivered the jewels and documents which had been found with the two bodies and then the chief of the column became convinced of the death of Maceo. Following is a copy of the letter writ ten In pencil which wa3 found on the body of the youth supposed to be Fran cisco Gomez: Dear Mamma, Papa, Dear Brothers: I die at my post. I did not want to aban don the body of General Maceo and' I stayed with him. I was wounded in two places, and as I did not fall into the hand? of the enemy I have killed myself. 1 am dying. I die pleased at being in the defense of the Cuban cause. I wait for you in the other world. Your Son, FRANCISCO GOMEZ. Toro in San omlngo.

REFEREE EARP ALL RIGHT In the Estimation of the Sailor Pugilist EVERYTHING WAS WRONG According to the Testimony Produced by Fiizsimmoos Sl'arkey's Trainers Swear Point Blank That the Decision as to Feml Blow Was a Put Up Job I Associated Press Special Wire SAN FRANCISCO,Dec. P.—The legal contest between Sharkey and Fitzslm mons for the possession of the $10,000 purse has commenced before the supe rior court. Excitement was intense when the proceedings began In the crowded court room and Manager Ju lian brought out his witnesses to prove the conspiracy which he stated had de prived Fitzsimmons of the purse. "Australian Billy" Smith, one of Shar key's trainers, was the first witness. He detailed his work in connection with preparing Sharkey for the ring, and said when the Question of selecting a referee was mooted in Sharkey's training quar ters he was asked to suggest a referee. Witness suggested Hiram Cook, and Lynch then asked him if he knew Cook well enough to "talk business with him." Afterwards witness said Lynch charac terized Cook as "no good" because he would not favor his own brother in a fight. On the evening of the fight Shar • key told witness that Earp had been fixed as referee and that "Earp was ay right." Witness described tho uproar over the preliminaries to the fight and said when Fitzsimmons objected to the bandages on Sharkey's wrists Earp went over to Sharkey's corner and said: 'Take off those cloths. It will be all right anyway." Witness said when Sharkey received the knockout blow on the jaw in the eighth round Lynch said to Sharkey: "Lie low. Hold your hands on your groin and pretend to faint with pain." Sharkey was then carried to a room. He did not appear to be much hurt. Witness said Allen, another trainer, "removed Sharkey's bandages and did the work which caused the swelling." Sharkey was then driven to his hotel in a hack. Allen was with him. Sharkey was all right. George Allen, another of Sharkey's trainers, corroborated the story of the previous witness, adding that several physicians were refused admittance when Sharkey was undergoing the ope ration with Allen which produced the evidence of a foul. Lynch said no doc tor should come into the room and In terfere with his plans. Witness said Sharkey told him the National Athletic club was composed of Groom. Glbbs. Lynch and Sharkey, and that Sharkey was to receive 20 per cent of the pro reeds of the light after the purse was deducted. Sharkey said his three part ners in the National club were broke and Sharkey had had to advance $2500 for preliminary expenses, which had left the sailor pugilist stranded financially. Witness said a few days before the fight Sharkey told him he thought Earp would be the right kind of a referee for him, and added that It would be worth $2500 to Earp if he were the "right kind of a referee." Smith was cross examined by Shar key's counsel, but nothing of any Im portance was elicited. The case then went over until tomorrow. Trainer Al len, who has not yet appeared as a wit ness, will then go on the stand and cor roborate Smith's testimony. DANNY'S DENIAL Dan J. Lynch. Sharkey's manager and backer, made the following statement tonight to the Associated Press: "Mr. Sharkey desires all his friends, and especially those in the east, to sus pend judgment on the story told today In criyrt by Australian Billy Smith until Sharftey can be heard on the stand. The fact of the matter is that Smith per jured himself, and we will prosecute him for perjury when the present trial Is over. His statement Is a tissue of false hoods from beginning to end and it is very clear to me that he has been bought by the Fitzsimmons crowd to give tes timony damaging to Sharkay's case. Smith demanded $1000 after th™ fight for four weeks' assistance as trainer. Shar key refused to give more than $100. This is the animus of his testimony In court. "Smith stated on the stand today that I had said to Sharkey when he fell In the eighth round to Jplaee his hand on his groin and pretend To faint.' Asa matter of fact I was in the timers' stand, fifty feet from the ring, at the time that Sharkey was struck and did ont get any nearer to the ling than that distance before Sharkey was carried to his dress ing room, where I awaited him. He was carried into the room, accompanied by his three trainers, the doctor, myself and several newspapermen. In all there were at least a score of personal friends in the room and there was no opportu nity of tampering with Sharkey should any one have so desired. Smith did not remove Sharkey's bandages, but this was done by the doctor. Sharkey never saw Earp until ho entered the ring. I did not know Earp was selected to act as referee until I saw the announcement in the afternoon papers. I ask that Sharkey's friends suspend judgment un til our witnesses can be heard. We will prove that Smith perjured himself and we will take action against him on this ground." "Australian" Billy Smith, one of Sharkey's thrainers, said today: "I talked to Sharkey at 10 oclock on the morning of the fight. He told me that F.arp would be chosen referee and that the game was for him to be given the decision on a foul in the first round or as soon after that as Fitzsimmons hit ! him a body blow of any kind. Then Needham was to jump into the ring I and claim a foul. He told me not to say I knew anything and that Lynch and Needham would be crazy if they i found out lie had told me. When the men got into the ring and Fitzsimmons objected to Sharkey's hand bandages, Harp came over to our corner and whispered to Sharkey: 'Take off the bandages, Tom. it will be all right, any how.' Well, things went on until the ! eighth round and I saw Sharkey fall. 1 did not see the blow that sent him down. ; 1 climbed up into the ring, picked him up and hauled him to his corner. In a min ute or two Lynch came up into the ring and, rushing over to Sharkey, said to him: "Now keep your hands down and pretend to be In great pain' but Shar key was so badly dazed by the blow on the head that he forgot to do what Lynch ordered, except once In a while. Lynch then told us to take him into the room. We did so and then laid him on a cot and closed all the doors. Lynch said: 'on't let a soul in—reporters, doctors, or anybody else.* " On visiting Sharkey the night after the fight the latter called him to his pillow. He said: "What kind of a fight did I put up?" I said: "Pretty good." He said: "That can beat Corbett in two rounds. He hits like the hind feet of a. mule." I terld Sharkey he would have a "cauliflower" ear sure, and he said, "yes, it; it will spoil my good looks." IN THE

Teddy Hale, Ireland's champion, had Increased mate rialy his advantage over Rice, the near est man. and this, too, despite the fact that he took two hours' rest during the night. At 9 o'clock, the lifty-seventh hour of the contest, the Irishman was eighty-four miles ahead of the best pre vious record, which was also beaten by Rice, Reading, Forester and Moore. Hale was a little more than fifty miles ahead of the record at 2 o'clock, his long rest having materilly decreased the com manding lead he held during the morn ing. The second man. Rice, with Read ing, Forster, Pierce and Moore, were all ahead of the record, but Schoch had fallen behind. Pierce went oil about 2 o'clock, and Smith and Glick soon fol lowed him. When the band began the afternoon concert the riders took on re newed courage, all except Schoch, Ash inger and Hale, who glided along at a ten-mile gait. Glick met his second accident shortly before 4 o'clock rounding the fourth turn. His right pedal came off and he was thrown with much force. Luckily the other riders were some distance In the rear. Glide's face anel left arm were badly scratched, and he went to his tent for a rub down. At 6 o'clock the score stood: Hale 997, Rice 963, Schoch 901, Reading 918. Smith 901, Forster 941.

The greatest enthu siasm prevailed when the plucky Irish man, Hale, scored 1000 miles. This was shortly after 6 o'clock. Hale rode the 1000 miles in 66 hours 11 minutes and 27 seconds. The previous record for the same time was 9.11 miles 3 laps, mads in the garden in 1893 by Martin. Between 5 and ■•r o'clock Hale rode about forty-one miles, while H!oe. the second man. rode about forty-three miles. During that time, however. Schoch was most of the time off the track. Schoch fell behind badly during the hours named. He rode as if very tired, and scored only twenty-nine miles between 5 and 8 o'clock. Schoch and Hale indulged in several spurts, but the Irishman went ahead whenever he felt like It. Schoch is a plodder in this race, and during the night he kept up a pretty steady pace. At 9 o'clock Con Baker of Columbus, 0., came on the track and gave an ex hibition of fast riding. He was not out for any records, but he made the racers hustle to keep up. The crowd In the garden howled and yelled when Forster and Schoch tackled him for a couple of laps for Forster even passed the sprint er, but could not keep up the gait. At 9:10 oclock there was a smash-up. in which Rice, the second man in the big race, and Moore were the central fig ures.

Hudelson. charged with libel by D. B. Woodworth, was on for hearing before Police Judge Campbell. Wood worth's son. Todd Woodworth, was the first witness for the prosecution. He testified that he had assayed a mine in eastern California on behalf of his father and had rendered a report stating that it was paying property.

Owen and they were there for the sole purpose of seeing Mr. Spreckels about the mine. The defense endeavored to show that Wondworth's mine was a myth and that his visit to Spveekels' Office was in con nection with the blackmailing scheme sent forth in the alleged libelous article written by Hudelson. At the close of Woodworth's cross examination Hud elson took the stand and had just begun to state when and how he had first met Woodworth when court was adjourned till-tomorrow. ADA'S SILVER STATUE.

PER SINGLE COPY, 3 CENTS ON TRANSPORTATION LINES, « CENTS TALK, ONLY TALK, ON TARIFF TOPICS Some Surprise Caused ifl the Senate IffTS TARIFF Bill THEM V But Its Chances of Passing Not Improved VIGOROUS RESOLUTIONS Looking to the Recognition of Cubit Belligerency A Flood ol Bills Introduced Covering Every Conceivable Subject The House Holds a Three-Hour Pen sion and Passes a Dozen Bills of , Minor Importance—Discus* sion In Committee . \ • - ~ r >; Associated Press Special Wire WASHINGTON. Dec. 9.—The senate today by the decisive vote of 35 to 31 adopted a motion to take up theDingley tariff bill. Unexpected and surprising as this action was, it did not have the significance which the vote itself an* pears to convey. Immediately following it. Mr. Aldtlch of Rhode Island, one of the Republican members of the finance committee, moved to recommit the bill to that com mittee, and this motion was pending; what, at 2 o'clock, the morning hour ex pired and the entire matter lapsed as though no vote had been taken. Neither Ihe bill nor the motion to recommit will any privilege cr precedence as the re sult of this action today. It showed, how- ever, some lively parliamentary fencing; between Mr. Allen. Populist, of Nebras ka, the author of the motion, and Messrs. Chandler. Hale and Aldrlch, and was an exposition of the uncertain and shifting elements within the senate when a vote is precipitated on an important public question. The debate was at times sharp and personal. Mr. Allen is very fluent in his expressions, and he taunted the Re publicans for shrinking in the Dingley. bill MhatHftlng a tariff campaign. It has gone out from the powers that be that in the Republican party," said Mr. Allen, "with the incoming adminis tration we are to have an extraordinary, session of congress for the purpose af>S storing the tariff laws." Thus Mr. Allen went on. touching many points that have hitherto been reserved for caucus con sideration. Mr. Chandler reminded Mr. Allen that not only had tariff won. but free silver tiad lost in the late election, and he urged Mr. Allen to aid in a genuine effort to execute the will of the people. Mr. Hale took occasion to state with frankness that the Republicans expected an actual majority in the next senate, which would make tariff legislation more easy of accomplishment than it is now. Mr. Aldrich's ©"at move was to ask to have the bill referred back to the finance committee with instruction to strike cut the silver amendment, but later he ac cepted the suggestion of Mr. Harris to omit the instructions, li was in this form that the question of recommittal waa pending when 2 o'clock arrived and cut off debate. Early in the day three sets of vigorous resolutions for Cuban independence fur nished an interesting feature. They, came from Mr. Cameron of Pennsyl vania. Mr. Mills of Texas and Mr. Call of Florida, and while differing in terms breathe the same spirit of recognition by the United States of Cuban independ ence. Mr. Frye. Republican, of Maine, presi dent pro tempore, occupied the chair to day in the absence of the vice president. The prayer of Rev, Mr. Milburn made eloquent reference to the late Charles F. Crisp of Georgia, "a man faithful and loyal in all his relations, an admirable presiding officer, an earnest and faithful servant of the people, may his name be graven on the tablet of his nation's, memory. Mr. Piatt, Republican, of Connecticut presented the report of the joint select committee of congress relative to the question of alcohol used in the arts, etc., and offered a resolution for the contlo uauce of the eommlttpe. This cleared the way for a series of vigorous Cuban resolutions. The first, offered by Mr. Cameron, Re ptiblican, of Pennsylvania, was as fol lows: Resolved, by the senate and house of representatives. That the independence of the republic of Cuba be and the same is hereby acknowledged by the United Stales of America. Resolved, That the United State* should use its friendly offices with the government of Spain to bring to a close tin war between Spain and Cuba. The Cameron resolution went to the committee on foreign relations. Mr. Mills. Demeie-rat. of Texas followed at once with his resolution: R»solvod. That the president of the United States is hereby directed to take possession of the island of Cuba with the military and naval forces of the United States nnd to hold the same until the people of Cuba can organize a govern ment deriving its powers from the con ; sent of the governed, and arm and equip | such military and naval forces as may Ibe necessary to secure them agaii t ' i. ; eign invasion. Without comment the Mills resolution ! was referred to the committee on for eign relations. Call, Florida. Democrat, followed with another joint resolution, as follow**} "Resolved. By the senate and houseof representatives that the United States of America recognises the republic of Cuba as a free and Independent country and accord the people of Cuba all the rights of a sovereign and independent government in the ports and within the jurisdiction of the United States." The Call re.-olutlon went to the table Mr. Call announcing that he would speak on It at an early day. The three Cuban resolutions came in quick succes sion, each being read In full and occa sioned marked attention owing to the directness and vigor of the language used by the three senators.
