THE FREE PRESS ST. C. FEJCEsE. Ed. mud Pea. MAYS CITY, KAKJ What Becomes of the Dimes? In some parts of the country trouble Is reported on account of the scarcity of dimes. What becomes of the dimes? An official In Washington sue gests that because the country Is pros perous people keep dimes in their pockets to hear them jingle. This po sition is not tenable, because any other coin would jingle just as well, and If people are so prosperous, as to find pleasure in jingling coins in their nock eta they would be likely to use larger ones for the purpose. The penny-in-the slot machines are held responsible for a scarcity of pennies. Street car lines and automatic telephones sccu mulate nickel five-cent pieces, but there is no particular use for dimes that would cause thorn to be concen trated in the hands of a few corpora tions. It Is not likely that they are hoarded in children's savings banks' to the extent that pennies and nickels are, because it does not take many dimes to make a dollar, and dollars aro deposited in. banks where they draw Interest and then the coins are released to go back into circulation Estimating the coinage of dimes since the publication of the last reporof the director of the mint as averairine the same as in the last few years re ported, there have been coined from 1792 to the present day. says the Chi cago Tribune, about 520.000.000 dlmps Moro than half of these, however, have been coined in the last 20 years, and the older ones have largely disap- pearedfrom circulation. In the year 13UJ t&e different mints of the United States received nearly 8.000.000 dimes which were retired as uncurrent, a number almost exactly equal to one third the coinage for the year. It is probable that there are not in circula tion more than three dimes for each inhabitant of the United States. The slight relation which the total coinage, or even the amount outstanding, bears to the amount in circulation is shown by the fact that there are still out standing about S00.000 half cents, 28, 000,000 two-cent pieces, and 20.000,000 nickel three-cent pieces which no one ever sees, and which may have been lost or melted long ago, but are still on the treasury books as outstanding. In view of the statistics the seareitv of dimes need not be wondered at. Tho only extraordinary thing Is that anyone should complain. There is nothins a dime will buy that cannot be paid for in other coins with almost equal convenience. Any kind of mon ey is good if there is plenty alto gether. "The obstacle to salvage at great depths Is pressure," says the Marine Review. "Little is attempted beyond a depth of 50 feet, by reason of it. With his new diving suit M. do Pluvy, the French hydraulic engineer, has, however, made considerably more than 100 descents, reaching depths of 150 to 300 feet much below the limits Of ordinary diving. No air is received from the outside. . The dress consists of ap armor of sheet metal from one- fifth to ono-third of an inch thick, with joints and coupling points of pressed leather and rubber, and a helmet with two cylindrical regenerating chambers attached. The air circulating through the helmet has Its oxygen continually renewed by chemicals in these cham bers, regulating valves keeping the dejths. Mounting and descending are effected by a cable carried on a drum driven by an electric motor, and this cable also carries the current needed for the respiratory apparatus. The diver communicates with the surface by telephone, while wires run from the armor to electric lights that show the working of the difteernt parts of this complicated 'dress.'
