T HE people of the United States will learn with a great deal of satisfac tion that the war department is de termined to clean the slate relative to charges of gross misconduct and brutal actions of officers In their punishment of soldiers in France. This chapter In the history of the army has been a dis graceful blot, for which we are glad to say a comparatively few men are re sponsible. Secretary Baker is de termlned to bring those responsible to trial and to urge the most severe pun lshment. It has been difficult for the American people to believe that the tactics used by the Germans, were fol lowed in some of our prison camps abroad. However, they are forced to recognise tills as a fact. But the men who advocated such ixylitary policies will bo promptly dealt with and most of them will gel long prison sentences. One of the lutest alleged culprits Is Captain Karl \V. Detser of Fort Wayne, lnd„ who while attached to the 308th military police company, had charge under the provost marshal of all crimi nal Investigations in the Le Mans' area, the largest American concentration center in France, through which a mil lion soldiers passed. This officer is c harged with resorting to various meth ods of torture to secure confessions from soldiers that he might win favor wlthl the ''higher ups." There has been too much of that in the army and the case of Captain Dttzor Is not the first. This officer sent men who were obstinate and refused to confess to In fraction of military orders to hospitals for a week a, a time, although there was nothing physically wrong with them. Others were required to stand at attention for 36 hours 10 minutes on and 5 minutes off. Some were starved. Some were pulled to their feet by their hair, were struck in the face, threatened with pistols, forced to swallow lighted cigarettes .and gen erally abused. It is expected that before the court martial gets through with Captain Detzer he will be given life sentence in & federal prison. The sentence is none too severe. It is true that there were constant violations of military orders and that in many cases strict discipline was necessary, but there is, nothing that can Justify Inhuman treatment of soldiers, and the officers guilty of such acts should be severely dealt with as a lesson to others that hereafter nothing of the kind will again be tolerated. T AN INTERESTING DOCUMENT HE report of Secretary Glass Is an Interesting document and one that reflects great credit on him. It is dear and comprehensive, and wholly sound In its recommendations. The secretary advises that some attempt be made by congress to reduce taxa tion, a thing that it can easily do if It will adopt the rigidly economic pol icy advocated in this report. At least there should be a revision of "the rev enue act on lines which will produce the necessary revenue with the mini mum Inconvenience and Injustice.".No immediate reduction is possible, how ever, unless expenditures are greatly reduced—since the current disburse ments will exceed current revenues by several billion dollars. The excess profits tax Is condemned and Is said to be specially harmful In time of peace, since It "encourages wasteful expenditure, puts a premium on overcapitalization and a penalty on brains, energy and enterprise, discour ages new ventures and confirms "old ventures in their monopolies." Mr. Glass would eliminate or reduce this tax and Increase the personal income tax. Also he would make It impossible for men to evade their surtax by con verting their holdings into tax-exempt etate and municipal bonds. All of which Is excellent, as is the recommen dation that changes In the law be made before the beginning of the year's bus iness, in order that business men will know in advance what they will have to pay. Economy Is urged, not only for the purpose of easing the burden of taxa tion, but also of reducing the cost of living. Yhe argument is bo clear and convincing that congress must be Im pressed by It. The most harmful me thod of meeting expenditures is by currency Inflation, to which this gov ernment has not resorted; less harm ful Is the Issue of bonds, "which to the extent that they find lodgment In tha hands of Investors who pay for «ham from Sayings, are a means of masting expenditures without expan TRIBUTE TO OUR SCHOOLS. T HE United States has always bean proud of its schools and school sys tem and has ovory reason to bo. But oven In our pride we are Inclined to look at things in a pessimistic light. It Is therefore cheering to read the opin ions of others who are not Americans but who on recent visits to the United States marveled at the advanced stage of our schools. This was true with the king of Belgium. It was true of Philip Gibbs. Speaking of the schools of America, the latter searching observe* says: "I must say that I was overwhelmed with admiration for the American sys tem of education and for the build ings In which it Is given. England lags a long way behind here, with its old fashioned hotchpotch of elementary schools, church schools, 'academies for young gentleitien'—the breeding ground for snobs—grammar schools, and private, second-rate colleges, all of which complications are swept away by the clean simplicity of the Ameri can state school, to which boys of every __________ L la „ may go without' bei hand icap | ped by the ca „ te syatem which )s the j curge of En|rland Jf the BChool t0 which I went at Montclair or another at Elisabeth, New Jersey, or another at Toledo, is at all typical of American schools generally (and I think that is so), I take my hat off to the educa tional authorities of America and to the spirit of the people which inspires them." PLACING RESPONSIBILITY. S HOULD a wife be required to pay her husband a reasonable price for putting a shelf in the kitchen? Should he charge something approximating the union scale for painting the bath room woodwork? Should he render a weekly bill for mowing the lawn, car rying out ashes, bring the furnace and 1 *' 1 * 0 ^ other routine chores, a bill that his wife Is bound by law to pay? No, certainly not! The answer is more than a mere answer. It is a legal de cision, handed down by a learned Judge In the best legal manner and language. Moat people will agree that the judge could have done nothing else; other wise there might have been chaos In the state of New Jersey. The decision was made In a case where a New Jersey husband sued his wife for moneys alleged to be due for painting and carpenter work about their home, which she owned. There had, of course, been some previous signs of want of domestic tranquility. No doubt the libsband's motives were not entirely removed from a desire to advertise to the public that he had been an exceptionally industrious and versatile household choreman. The court not only ruled against him, but in anticipation, perhaps, of similar uits ' ruIed specifically that a wife is not expected to pay her husband for washing the dishes, fl:yns the fence or otherwise exercising the energy and in genuity necessary to promote cleanli ness and noatness in and about the house. The court, by Implication, even went further, tactfully hinting that a wife might reasonably expect such co operation from a dutiful husband. And while no mention was made of the wife s right to order and compel a hus band to attend to his chores, there Is a reasonable presumption that this principle was not denied. In fact, an Ingenious wife can take the decision and establish a new basis of inde pendence upon what it leaves to con jecture. Neatly printed, with certain passages heavily underscored and framçd, It should find a ready market as a kitchen ornament, not only In New Jersey, but throughout the country. Lady Astor didn't take her baby to parliament with her, as no doubt the little shaver, being the first baby to have a mother In the house of com mons, would break up the session with some pointed comments on the food shortage. It Is to be hoped that while the sen ato was away on Its vacation the chamber was redecorated, as there's no telling when the new session will end. RIPPLING RHYMES By WALT MASON. FIERCE TIMES So many troubles chase us, so many problems face us. we're al ways in a stew; so many woes dis tressing, so many cares are press ing, we don't know what to do. We sigh for days departed, when we were happy hearted, and full of wholesome glee; when griefs were not invented, and every man oon tented, sat 'neath his vine and tree But In those bygone seasons, ere Huns, with bricks and treasons, kicked up a beastly row, we all were as unhappy, as sassy and as scrappy as sore as we are now. The trouble athen parading, were of another shading, they bore another brand, but they were Just as gall ing. they kept the whole world brawling throughout a wearied land. Our words were Just as bit ter, we didn't sing and twitter more than we do today; we pawed around and panted, and walked the floor and ranted, and groaned our hearts away. Despite the thorns that scar us, despite the Jolts that Jar us, we still can emUe a few; It doesn't make thing« better to be a chronic fret ter and weep a «uart or two. X PEPS X REASON TO EE SHOCKED.

" THE ARTISTIC TEMPERAMENT. Tho folks, they all just gather 'round And stare at him without a sound. In admiration rapt they gaze And love him for his winning ways. The callers, they all hover near And whisper, "Alnt he Just a dear It seems they can't get close enough. They are sincere; It Is no bluff. It's worth a trip of many miles— When baby smiles. But they do not remain to gaze; They scatter fifteen different ways; They dash out to the open air Glad to escape most anywhere. They jump through windows to the ground And smash tho glass with • fearful sound, They do a lot of funny stunts And all try to escape at once. They make for far-off wooded dells— When baby yells. GRANDPA. No sanitary drinking cups were ram pant In his day; No bubbly fountain soiled his vest—hs didn't drink that way. He never heard of microbes on the (50 note. He kissed the pretty gals and no ba cilli got his goat. He used a common old crash towel when he would wipe his face; There were no fancy blotters then a-hangln' round the place. Unfiltered water he consumed, he didn't swat the files; The daily bulletin of health he didn't scrutinize. He didn't pasteurize the milk and It turned out as how He violated all the rules as set down by experts now. He didn't know about the germs and that Is how I ween, That grandpa lived until he was a hun dred and fifteen. There has been general complaint In the redemption division of the treas ury at Washington that paper money, and especially the smaller notes, le wearing out so fast that many addi tional expert counters are now re quired. No doubt the public is little surprised at such a complaint, as the cost of living has mounted higher and higher. The mere fact that the worn out bills are mostly of the smaller de nominations simply goes to show that nowadays they are spent, and pass from hand to hand so rapidly that the constant friction soon frays them to tatters. • Twenty, fifty, one hundred, and one thousand dollar bills are com ing In for redemption very slowly, all of which indicates that they are being handled less frequently by their pos sessors'. THEM WAS THE DAYS, UNCLE JOE. Dear Peps: Note from newspaper: "Uncle 'Joe' Cannon tells us that a young man went many miles to go courtin' in those good old days, no matter what the weather was.' ' And "Unk" please tell the boys how that old applejack made loving a real pleasure, even though the family hung around.— J. B. If some of those Russian generals would cut a few syllables off their vestibule names, they would get Into the headlines oftener. It seems queer, but you never hear anybody complaining about the high cost of prohibition liquor. Many a man doesn't save any money until he's married, and then he doesn't save any. A thing of beauty is always worried for fear she will lose it. G. D. M. Informs us that Mrs. Chew runs a cafe In Detroit. The other day an elderly man came out of a shop, gazed about him in a bewildered and strange manner, and collapsed slowly to the pavement. WHO'S WHO IN CURRENT EVENTS.

There tho patient slowly revived Into apologetic speech. "Very sorry, doctor. Silly of me. But my heart Is a bit shaky, and I had a sudden shock." "No bad news, I hope," the doctor said, pulling on his gloves. "No. oh, dear no. You see. I went into a cigar store, where I wasn't known, and the salesman asked me If I would like a box of matches." A critic was discussing John Singer Sargent, the artist, with Chauncey Depew, and remarked: "They say he painted a cobweb on a celling once and it was so natural that the maid wore herself out trying to brush It off." "What you say about the natural ness of the cobweb may bo perfectly true," retorted Depew, "but there nev er was any such maid, I'nr sure." "Hello! Is this Mr. Jlgson?" "Yes," "This Is Smith. Can I borrow your auto for this afternoon?" "Why, no. I shouldn't think you'd have the face to ask for It." "I haven't. That's why I'm asking over the phone." I WHAT THE PRESS OF THE| I NATION SAY | INTERESTING QUE8TION. (New York Tribune) The American delegates to the Paris conference have signed a treaty of peace with Bulgaria. This document will presumably be submitted to the senate, which will then have to wrestle with this interesting question: How can two countries make peace without having been at war? GOOD PICKERS. (New York Herald) That so-called American party in picking, tentatively, Governor Coolldge of Massachusetts, and Ole Hansen, of Beattie, as candidates for president and vice president, respectively, shows that It is not asleep to the necessity of having names on a ticket that appeal to the Imagination. NEWBERRY'S CASE. (New York Sun) The activity of tho department of Justice may appear strange to those who cannot recall any state election since reconstruction about which tho federal administration has so busied Itself. But these will remember the curiously strong Interest which Presi dent Wilson displayed In the candidacy of the man who Identified Benedict Arnold as a writer. 

MASSACHUSETTS FOR COOLIDGE. (New York Times) Governor Coolldge Is to be Massa chusetts' favorite son at the next Re publican national convention. Senator Lodge's declaration in his favor puts that beyond doubt. Despite a good deal of foolish and unwarranted talk. Mr. Lodge has never been a candidate for president. Whether or not he Is of presidential stature, he Is not of the stature of candidates, apd he has too much sense to miss the fact. His worst enemy could never charge Mr. Lodge with guiding his public actions by any such ambition. 

FRE8H AND ENERGETIC. (New York World) Lady Astor promises to be no lay figure when she takes her seat, nor to draw attention to herself In the great assembly solely because of the novel circumstances of her advent. She has views of her own, on which she en larges with disconcerting freedom from class prejudice. She has the advant age of not having been drilled in the stern discipline of party, and as a raw recruit she has not yet learned to sur render her individual freedom of opin ion In blind obedience to the authority of party whips. She still has the fresh ness of mind and energy of the new member who has not encountered the deadly lethargy of the average legisla tive body. LADY ASTOR'8 VICTORY. (Philadelphia Public Ledger) British electors may be conservative about some things, but their election of Lady Astor to a seat in parliament for one of the Plymouth divisions, by a plurality of 6200 over her nearest competitor and a majority of more than 1000 over all, was a display of liberality and progresslvenesB that Is quite significant. The fact that the successful candidate was American born, that she was the first woman to win a seat in the "Mother of Parlia ments" aiyl that she succeeds to a po sition vacated by her husband because of his succession to the peerage com bined to make the canvass and election in Plymouth one of the most Interest ing and picturesque of English by elections. j EDITORIAL OPINION { IDAHO EDITORS OF OUR REPUTATION GOOD (Register, Idaho Falls. I Official visitors from Colorado Springs, a supposed to be very modern town, a tourist town of more than three times the population of Idaho halls on their visit here from the Colo rado city praise us as one of the most modern and best appearing communi ties in the northwest with more civic Improvements per population than the most places, particularly our paving. That is a good reputation to have and the people of Idaho Falls are proud ol the community which they have bullded and which they hope and ex pect to see continue to grow and pros per. There Is a civic duty as well as civic pride, and It Is a well established fact that communities are not as offi cient In management as individuals or corporations and that fact brings up again the quoatlon of the commission form of government for Idaho Falls. The plan was submitted to the people one and defeated, but the people have had an opportunity to "think It over" for several years and if properly ap proached the public might be in mind to try It again. Idajio Falla, at a community, owns more property than probably any com munity In the atata and our source of income If given the efficient manage ment of the privately owned buisness institutions, could make for Idaho Falla almoat a taxless town. Such a plan would be oppoaed, but U might bo well to study tbo reason for such opposition and soe if selfish ■usa and not community good does not prompt the opposition THE KEYNOTE OF THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE TO CONGRESS I RE S CUE. the TO O MR NIHTÏ hien the back H/P& 4>fc * w o Ü T »h? /9 STRANGE FACTS THAT FEW PEOPLE KNOW "Recent declaration by W. M. Hugh es, prime minister of Australia, that his country was determined to main tain its traditional policy of a 'White Australia,' a policy as firmly grounded there as is the Monroe Doctrine In the United States, again turned the atten t'on of tho world toward that remote and unique continent," says a bulletin from Washington headquarters of the National Geographic Society. "It is not that Australia despisos immigration," explains the bulletin, which is based on a communication to the society from Herbert E. Greg ory. "It is rather that she has clung to her ideal of 'a homogeneous people of British origin.' ''Australia Is disappointed that of the four large areas which offer con genial homes for people of European blood—namely, Australia, Canada, United States and Argentina—AustraL la alone Is passed by, while the other three favored regions have received Europeans by hundreds of thousands She saw the United States receiving In one year (1913) 1,197,892 people from abroad, more than the entire net im migration to Australia for the preced ing fifty-three years, and In another year (1910) enrolling four times as many people born in the United King dom as were living In Australia. "Australia Is the most isolated of all inhabited continents and is remote from the center of all of the world's ac tivities. Northward the sailing dis tance to Japan is approximately 3,000 I.autical miles; to India, 2,500 miles. South America is 7,000 miles to the east, and Africa an equal distance west. "From London to the capital of Aus tralia ships by the Suez route traverse approximately 13,362 miles of water and by the Panama canal 14.582 miles. From California ports the routes via Samoa, or Fiji, or Tahiti cover a quar ter of the circumference of the earth. Australia's only large civilized neigh tor within a radius of 1,000 miles is Java.

For most knowledge of this fascin ating land Is obtained by a study few pages In the back of school geographies—pages descriptive of 'Australia and New Zealand' and ac companied by a map of 'Australia and the islands of the Pacific' on a scale too small for the recognition of sig nificant features. "Australia Is a large country. It is about fourteen times the size of France or Germany, twenty-five times the size of Italy, Hungary, or Ecuador, ahd two end one-half times the size of Argen tina, its chief competitor In tne south ern' hemisphere. fts area is equal to three-fourths of Europe, one-third of all North America, and one-fourth of the British Empire.
