vra m G. A. Lisa, Publisher EAST JORDAN, MICHIGAN An Odd Cure. Are jou a sufferer fuun Indigestion? Here is a curious re incdy. Rer. John Spencer of Duittth has brought back with him from Ceylon one of the most curious presents in the world. "Riding on an elephant," he said the other day, ' behind a native prince on a hunting expedition, the conversation chanced to turn on indigestion, to which I said 1 was subject. The prince at once puliect out a black leather button kind of thing, which he was wearing on a string round his neck, under his t Mhos. 'What's that?' said L 'A hy ena's snout,' was the startling reply. "What for?' 'To cure indigestion.' 'How can it do th's?' it fai .ery simple. A hyena gets iis ftrtag by dlggiag upand OnilifllriBl old bones. Now, it pos sesses in its snout this peculiar virtue, That when its nose approach.-; any thing haul, such as bones, those tough uhstanoes instantly grow soft, and enable the animal to eat them with comfort and benefit. "w you will find if you keep tbi:- Charts hnh round your neck the proximity of the hyena's uose, though dried up and lifeless, will soften your food, however indigestible, to such an extent that you will never wigain suffer from indigestion. Edur.riting Nevvtboys. EkMln ben an association of news boys which has begun to establish a fund for educating at Harvard one or more among them, and has raised al ready $2,000 toward the neeessary amount. This lively association, says Collier's Weekly, baa already been ad dressed by President Eliot more than once, ana its latest Step shows how full of high ambition these hoys are. There could he, VPS gratefully believe, no more sterling proof of opportunity and of character in America tban these self-supporting yonths now give. In what other nation would a boy born in poverty, earning each day his food and bed, set out cheerfuly to pass the examinations of a great seat of learn ing, and, once in,' to master to the full its manifold weapons for adding to the conquests of his life? Criticise it how we will, and should, we may well glow always for our land of the free. Now, as ever, since the pioneer's ax fought its battle with the wilderness, Is it the home of Opportunity and of her uaugh ter, Hope. An ambassador of a well-known Eu ropean monarch was riding in the streets of Constantinople when one of the sultan s carriages rolled by. See ing it was guarded, his curiosity got the better of him. and when the car riage reached him he was daring enough to peep in at the passenger. He was surprised aTid pained to re ceive a blow in the face from an at tendant In charge. (ad with rage, he demanded audience of the sultan. The sultan listened attentively, and for a mome appeared lost in thought. At last spoke: "My dear , I have gone carefully into the case, and see exactly how it stands. You are, of coarse, a gentleman, therefore you would never have committed such a breach ef good manners as you allege to have taken place. Therefore no attendant could possibly have struck you. The whole affair seeinB to be a product of your fancy. Let us dis miss It." An engineer from Sunderland was spending a few days in London with a 1 1 lend, and after a busy morning sight seeing the Londoner chose a large res taurant for luncheon, thinking it would be a novel experience for the man from the north. The visitor appeared to enjoy his luncheon, bat kept look Ing in the direction of the door. "What are you watching?" asked hie friend, rather annoyed. "Well." was the quiet reply, "A's keepln' an eye on ma top oat," "Oh. don't bother about that.' said the other, "yon don't see me watching mine." "No," observed the guileless engineer, "thee has no call to it's im minutes sin' thine went" Bill Wright is a country storekeeper in Pennsylvania, and went to Philadel phia to purchase a stock of goods.

Mercer EXCITING RAGE PREJUDICE BOM BASTES FURIOSO TILLMAN DELIVERS A TIRADE ON THE "NIGGER." CHICAGO FEARED A RIOT Audience Become Wild Over the Lurid Word Pictures and Picturesque Pro fanity. Senator Tillman, of South Carolina, addressed a most frenzied appeal to race prejudice to 3,000 men and wo men in Chicago Tuesday Bight, pain' ing in terrifying perspective the spec ter of "black supremacy" and punch ing hard and straight at everybody and everything that has to do with tho colored race. S. hot ;;s his talk that a riot seemed imminent on several occasions and once was narrowiy averted. Tillman waxed furious several times over interruptions from the few ne groes present. 'To h 1 with Use law." he yelled, while all but a handtul of his 3,000 list eners cheered madly. 'Shut your mouth," he shouted at one man who asked a question. One time, when denouncing the pure blooded Afro-Americans, a man near the front said, with a laugh: "We haven't that kind of blacks here." "You haven't?" rang out the shril voice of the senator. "Look down that aisle. There's a nigger as black as the ace of spades." The man pointed to by the senator WSS a pronounced type of the negro. The audience, sagered at the Inter ruptions that came from a nero in the gallery, made a demonstration. It howled and yelled tind demanded s huidly that the disturber bo put out that the speaker could not proceed. The demonstration continued fully two minutes and two plain clothes po licemen who sat near the offender ar rested the negro. Excitement was at high pitch and it seemed likely that an attempt would be made to do tho in terrupter bodily injury. After telling in detail how the negro Is prevented from casting his ballot ir. the south, Senator Tillman saidi "There is a great deal more to thta Question than the little racket here in Chicago." A voice: "How about the negro Judge?" Chicago elected a negro to the bench a few weeks ugo, but he was counted out. Senator Tillman: "Well. I will tell you Lbout your negro judges and about your political machines putting him on your ticket and bamboozling those poor ignorant baboons in electing him. and then afterwards you fellows who voted the ticket without knowing what was on it, rind a way to cheat him out of it." "God Almighty made the Caucasian of better clay than the Mongolian or the African or any other race. Tho Ethiopian is a burden carrier. He has done absolutely nothing for history, nor has he ever achieved anything f any great importance. There are no great men among the race. Yet this people has been picked out by the fa natics of the north and lifted up to the equality of citizenship and to the rights of suffrage. No doubt many of you have listened to the oratory of the greatest colored man of this country Booker T. Washington. He h;id ;i white father, however, and his brains and his character he has Inherited from that father." In conclusion Senator Tillman said: 'Now, as a general Illustration of the Injustice that is sometimes done. President Roosevelt diSChsrgi d three companies of colored soldier ; w ithout a COUrt-martlal, and punished innocent men for the crime of a few. In doing that he transcended the author!!
