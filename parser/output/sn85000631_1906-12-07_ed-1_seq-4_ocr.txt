If you want some interesting reading, read President Roosevelt's message. It is a nice thing to live in coal belt along with the oranges and lemons. Congress convened last Monday. This session is liable to prove an interesting one as many questions of national importance will come before it. All over the state a cry of "car shortage" has gone up and the cry has been so long and vigorous that those in high places are awakening to the fact that there is going to be something doing in the near future. The loss to the farmers of the state through the shortage of cars, is hard to estimate, but will reach a large sum. In many of the places the farmers are unable to dispose of their grain and in consequence thereof are unable to meet their bills and the tradesman must suffer with them. The Min neapolis Journal has taken up the matter and is doing good work in giving it publicity. Congressman Marshall has also takea up tin car shortage question and it is now up to the Railroad Commissiners to see what they can do. The peo ple of Washburn have been very fortunate so far in being able to get cars for grain shipment. An Explanation. Mr. Editor: I should like to be permitted to make a short explan ation to your Readers in regard to a certain scurrilous attack made upon the character of our county superintendent of schools on the eve of election .'v The matter to which I refer was an affidavit pur porting to be made by the Rev. S H. Gray and sworn to before me, as a notary public. I did take an acknowledgement for Mr. Gray at that time and very likely for i.the instrument under consideration.'.. At this point I wish to make it clear to all the readers of this pa per just what connection a notary public has in connection with pa pers that are acknowledged before him. The notary public's busi ness is to see that a document is signed by the identical person rep resented as signer and to determine that such person signs the docu ment as his free act and deed and to administer oaths. The notary public simply verifies these facts to the public. He does not usually know what is in the instrument he acknowledges. Moreover, it is none of his busi ness what the instrument con tains. Indeed, the notary who at tempts to read what is in the pa pers he acKnowledges is frequent ly reminded that it is none of his business what the subject matter is. For the reason stated I did not know what the affidavit con tained for the reasons stated, also, it was none of my business what the papers contained. I am not attempting to deter mine the truth or falsity of the statements made in the affidavit. The man whose character is tra duced is present and in among friends and hence competent to defend himself. The young wo man, whom many of us kenw and remember as a respectable and es timable girl is absent and defense less. Such a report whether true or false made public and circulat ed by one who should be her natur al friend and protector, deserves our severest condemnation. There are a good many people in the county who have been led to believe that I must have known the nature of the document and to some extent endorsed the state ments therein when I administered the oath and acknowledged the signature of the maker of the affi davit. It is for these reasons es pecially that I wish to thus pub lieally testify that I knew nothing of the nature of the affidavit and that I utterly and unqualifiedly condemn it as indecent, scurrilous, and unfit for publication, whether true or false.
