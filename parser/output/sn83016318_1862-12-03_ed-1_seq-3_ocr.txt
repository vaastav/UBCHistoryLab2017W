Fassett's Pasorama of the IUbellion This U-auiilul Panorama w exhibited at RfpieMnta'ive Hall, on Monday ar.d Tuesday evenings lat, to very lair audiences. As a work of art, this Panorama will rai k with any Lich it Las been our good fortune to witneM ; aud in point of iiiteres; and instruction, far sur passes any exhibition ahich cu!d be presented to the public at ttiis time. Many of tho ba't!, -cents presented are very beautiful and lifelike, and would seem to place the benolder in the very midst of the cari.age; while others wouid 6!l the patriotic heart with joy, ai.d others still, rail up many bitter reineinbiancts ai.d teelings of regret ai.d haiue. We predict a brilliant ca reer lor this uoble woik of art, and commend it to tbe people he ever p e-ented A A lTert.itmfDt Settlement.

The Kail Road We sue no steps be ing taken, either by the company or our citizen. towards Completing the fUilroad to Michigan Avei.ue; but on the other hand the signs indi cate, and we har rumors to the efT.ct, that ihose who have the control of the cnc rn, d uot intend to continue the road beyond its pres ent terminus on Fianklin stieet. Now tliii is not what the people in tbe middle and southern portions of the city, who have paid their money Ir. ely fioto time to lime to aid in building the road bargained for. It is grossly ui j ist towards them, to allow the road to remain at its present termiuus, without an effort on tbe part of the di rectors to complete it to th; avenue. Will uot our citizens arouse to their iuterests, and take some measure to get the road completed ? The Legislature will soon be in session, aud we predict a happy time for the " Amboy, Lan sing and Traverse Bay Railroad Company," if the cars are not running to jiithian Avenue iu time to bring iu the members of that potent body.
