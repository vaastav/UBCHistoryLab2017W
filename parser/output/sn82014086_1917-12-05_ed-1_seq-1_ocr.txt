President Wfl son delivered to congress today an ad dress, considered so Important in its relation to International affairs, that Jt has been transmitted in advance by the government to every other capital in the world. The president spoke as folovr Gentlemen of the Congress: Sight months hare elapsed since I last had the honor of addressing you. They Have been months crowded with events of immense and grave signifi cance for us. I shall not undertake to detail or even to summarize these venal. The practical particulars of the part we "have played in them will be laid before you in the reports of tns executive departments. I shall discuss only our present outlook up on these vast aifalfirc, our present duties and the immediate means of accomplishing the objects we shall hold always in view. I shall sot go back to debate the causes of the war. The intolerable wrongs done and planned against us by the sinister masters of Germany have long since become too grossly obvious and odious to ' every true American to need to be rehearsed. But I shall ask you to consider again and with a very grave scrutiny our ob jectives and the measures by which we mean to attain them; for the pur pose of discussion here in this place Is action and our action must move straight toward definite ends. When Shall We Consider War Wont Our object is. of course, to win the War and we shall not slacken or suf fer ourselves to be diverted until it is won. But, It la worth while asking and answering the question, when hall we consider the war won? From one point of view It is not necessary to broach this fundamental matter. I do not doubt that the Amerleaa people know what the war is about anfl what sort of an outcome they win regard as a realization of their purpose in It. As a nation we are united in spirit and Intention. 1 pav little heed to those who tell me otherwise. I hear the voices of dis sentwho does not I hear the criti cism and the clamor of the noisy, thoughtless and troublesome. I also see men .here and there fling themselves- in impotent disloyalty against the calm, indomitable power of the nation. I hear men debate peace who understand neither its nature nor the war m which we may attain it, with uplifted eyes and unbroken spirits. But I know that none of these sneaks for the nation. They do not touch the heart of anything. They may safely be irt to strut their uneasy hour and be forgiven. Must Make .Object Plain. But from another point of view I 'believe that it is necessary to sav plainly what we here at the seat of action consider the war to be for and what part we mean to play In the set tlement of its searching issues. We are the rpokesmen of the American people- and they have a right to know whether their purpose la ours. They desire peace by the overcoming of evil, by the defeat one for all of the sinister forces that interrupt peace and reader it Impossible and they wish to know how closely our thought - runs with theirs and what action we propose. They are impa tient with those who desire peace by any sort of compromise deeply and indignantly impatient but they will be equally impatient with ua if we do not make it plain to them what our objectives are and what we are plan ning for in seeking to make conquest or peace by arms. Intrigue Must Be Crushed. . I believe that I speak for them when I say two things: First, that this Intolerable thing of which the mas tars of Germany have shown us the ugly aea this menace of combined . Intrigue and force, which we now see o clearly as the German power, a j thing without conscience or honor or be crashed and if it be not utterly I ttrecgirt to an end, at least shut out frtso the friendly Intercourse of the OF WAR ON 

AUSTRIA rations and second, that when this thing and its power are indeed defeat ed and the time comes that we can discuss peace when the German peo ple have spokesmen whose word we can believe and when those .spokes men are ready In the name" of their people to accept the common 1udtr- ment of the nations as to what shall henceforth be the basis of law -and of convenant for. the life of the world we shall be willing and glad to pay the full price of peace astd pay it un grudgingly. We know what that price will be. It will be full, impartial Jus ice Justice done at every point and to every nation that the final settler ment must affect, our enemies as well as our friends. No Vindicative Action. Ton catch, with me the voices of humanity that are in the air. They grow daily more audible, more artic ulate, more persuasive, and they come from the hearts of men everywhere. They insist that the war shall not end in vindicative action of any kind; that no nation or people shall be robbed or punished because of the irresponsible rulers of a single coun try have themselves done deep and abominable wrong. It is this thought that has been expressed in the form ula, "No annexations, no contributions, no punitive indmnitlett." Just be cause this crude formula expresses the instinctive Judgment as to the right of plain men everywhere it has been made diligent use of by the master of German intrigue to lead the people of Russia astray end the people of every otner country their agents could reach, in order that a prema ture peace might be brought - about before autocracy has been taught its final and con vir ring lesson and the people of the world put In control of their own destinies. . But the fact that a wrong use has been made of a Just Idea is no reason why a right ne should not be made of it. It ought to be brought under the patronage of its rea,l friends. Let it be said again that autocracy must first be shown the utter futility of its claim to power or leadership in the modem world. It is impossible to apply any stan dard of Justice as long as such forces are unchecked and undefeated as the present masters of Germany command. Not until that has been done can right be set up as arbiter and peacemaker among the . nations. But when that has been done as, God willing, it assured ly will be done we shall at last be free to do an unprecedented thing and this Is the time to avow our purpose to do It. We shall be free to baee peace on generosity and Justice to the exclu sion of all selfish claims to advantage even on the part of the victors. No Peace Won Until Victory. Let there be no misunderstanding. Our present and Immediate task is to win the war, and nothing shall turn us aside from it until it is . accom plished. Every power and resource we possess, whether of men, of money or of material, is being devoted, and will continue to be devoted to that purpose until it to achieved. Those who desire to bring peace about before that pur pose is achieved I counsel to carry their advice elsewhere. We will not entertain it We shall regard the war as only won when the German people say to us, through properly accredited representatives, that they are ready to agree to a set tlement based upon .Justice and ttte reparation of the wrongs their rulers have done. They have done a wrong to Belgium which must be repaired. They have established a power over other lands and peoples than their own over the great empire of Austria -Hungary, over the hitherto free Balkan States, over Turkey and within Asia which must be relinquished. Crush Prussian Power. Germany's successes by skill, by in dustry, by knowledge, by enterprise, we did not grudge or oppose, but ad mired rather. She had built up for herself a real empire of trade and in fluence, secured by the peace of the world. We were content to abide the rivalries of manufacture, science 'and commerce that were involved for us in her success and stand or fall as we had or did not have the brains and the initiative to surpass her. But at the moment when she had conspicu ously won her triumphs of peace, she threw them away to establish in then stead what the world will no longer permit to be established, military and political domination by arms, by which to oust where she could not excel the rivals she most feared and hated. The peace we make must remedy that wrong. It must deliver the once fair lands and happy peoples of Belgium and northern France from the Prussian conquest and the Prussian menace, but it must also deliver the peoples of Austria-Hungary, the peoples of the Balkans and the peoples of Turkey, alike in Europe and in Asia, from the impudent and alien domination of the Prussian military and commercial autocracy. Not to Interfere with Dual Monarchy. We owe it, however, to ourselves to say that we do not wish in any way to impair or to rearrange the Austro Hungarian empire. It is no affair of ours what they do with their own lire, either industrially or politically. We do not purpose or desire to dictate to them in any way. We only desire to see that their affairs are left in their own hands, in .all matters, great or sma.lL - We shall hope to secure for the peoples of the Balkan peninsula and for the people of the Turkish empire the right and opportunity to- make their own lives safe, their own for tunes secure against oppression or in justice and from the dictation of for eign courts or parties. - Not Against German People. And our attitude and purpose with regard to Germany herself are of a like kind. We intend no wrong against the German empire, no interference with her internal affairs. We should deem either the one or the other abso lutely unjustifiable, absolutely contrary to the principles we have professed to live by and to hold most sacred throughout our life as a nation. ..The peoples of Germany are being tola Dy tne men wnom tney now per mit to deceive them and to act as their masters that they are fighting for the very lire and existence or tnelr empire, a war of desperate self defense against deliberate aggression. Nothing could be more grossly or wantonly false, and we must seek by the utmost, openness and candor as to our real aims to convince them of its falseness. We are in fact fighting for their emancipation from fear, along with our own, from the fear as well as from the fact of unjust attack by neighbors or rivals or schemers after world empire. No one is threatening the existence or the independence or the peaceful enterprise of the" German empire. i To Emancipate Germans. The worst that can happen to the detriment of the German people is this, that if they should still, after the war is over, continue" to be obliged to live under ambitious and intriguing masters intended to disturb the peace of the world, men or- classes of men whom the other peoples of " the world could not trust, it might be impossi ble to admit them to the partnership cf nations which must henceforth guarantee the world's peace. That partnership must be a partnership of peoples, not a mere partnership of governments. It might be impossible also in such untoward circumstances to admit Germany to the free eco nomic intercourse which must inevit ably spring out of the other partner ships of a real peace. But there would be no aggression in that; and such a situation inevitable because of distrust would in the very nature of things sooner or later cure itself, by processes which would assuredly set in. -r- d:-l. XA--V- A " The wrongs, tne very deep wrongs, committed in this war will have to be righted. That of course. But they cannot and must not be righted by the commission of similar wrongs against Germany and her allies. The world will not permit the com mission of similar wrongs as a means of reparation and settlement. States men must .by this time have learned that the opinion of the world is every where wide awake and fully compre hends the issues involved.- No .repre sentative of any self governed na tion will dare disregard it by attempt ing any such covenants of selfishness jtnd compromise as were entered into at the congress of Vienna. The thought of the plain people here and everywhere throughout the world, the people who enjoy no privilege and have very simple and unsophisticated standards of right- and wrong is the air all governments must henceforth breathe if they would live. It is in the full disclosing light of that thought that all policies must be . conceived and executed in this midday hour of the world's life . German Rulers Have Upset Peace German rulers ' have been able to upset the peace of the world only be cause the German people were not suffered under their .tutelage to share the comradeship of the other peoples of the world, either in thought or in purpose. They were allowed to have no opinion of their own which might be set up as a rule of conduct for those who exercised authority over them. But the congress that con cludes this war will feel the full strength of the tides that run now in the hearts and consciences of free men everywhere. Its conclusions will run with those tides. Russians - Have Been Deceived.' ' ' T All these things have been true from the very beginning of this stu pendous war; and I cannot help think ing that if they had been made plain at the very outset the sympathy and enthusiasm of the Russian people might have been once for all enlisted on the side of the allies, suspicion and distrust swept away and a- real and lasting union of purpose effected. Had they believed these things at the very moment of their revolution and had they been confirmed in that belief since,' the sad reverses which have recently marked the progress of their affairs towards an ordered and stable government of free men might have been avoided. The Russian people tb been poisoned by the very same falsehoods that have kept the German people in the dark and the poison has been administered by the very same hands. The only possible antidote is the truth. It cannot be uttered too plainly or too often. Freedom of All Nations. From every point of view therefore, it has seemed to be my duty to speak these declarations of purpose to add these interpretation. nJiich-J ixiok -tfeA IT IS TO BE 

SUPREME Military Unity of Action is to Be As sured by an Inter-Allied General Staff Which Will Establish Pro gramme of All Military Questions as They May Arise. Paris. Dee. 4. The forelsm office of ficially announced today that at the recent Inter-alHed conference, in which the United States - participated, agree ments were concluded "upon the basis of-a complete understanding and close solidarity among the allies for the so lution of the questions in which they have a common interest in the war. It was also announcer" that the crea tlon of a supreme Inter-allied naval committee had been decide upon. Unity of Military Action. The inter-allied general staff, it was stated, was working upon a definite military programme which was plac ing unity of miiltarv action in the way of certain realization. The announcement regarding the re suits of the conference was made in the following official statement: Results of the Conference. "The minister of foreign affairs re ported to the cabinet council today the results of the conference of the allies The reading of communications from the presidents of each section of the allied conference, at which were pres ent for the first time representatives of all the countries taking part with us in this war. has given felicitous- re suits from every point of view: They give assurance of practical unity of action, economically, financially ana militarily. A Complete Understanding. "The agreements have been conclud ed upon the basis of a complete un derstanding and close solidarity among the allies for the solution of the ques tions in which they have a common interest in the war.' The financial needs of each of them, the .require ments of their armament, their trans port, their food, have, have been the subjects of profound study wncn guar aatees perfect satisfaction The crea tion of a Supreme Inter-AHied Naval committer has been determined upon! Military unity of action has been plac ed upon the course of certain realiza tion by the Inter-Allied General Staff which is at work upon an established programme of . all military questions. Assures a Common Victory. "From a dinlomatic point of view en- i- accord resulted from the oTscus- slons among the. representatives of the powers upon all the business, which has been arranged together, to assure the common victory of their countries." liberty of saying to the senate in Jan uary. Our entrance into the war has not altered bur attitude towards the settlement that must come when it is over. When I said in January that the nations of the world were entitled not to free pathways . upon the sea, but also to . assured and unmolested access to these pathways, I was think ing and I am thinking now, not of the smaller and weaker nations alone, which need our countenance and sup port, but also of the great and power ful nations and of our present enemies am well as our present associates in the war. I was thinking and am thinking now of Austria herself, among the rest, as well as of- Servia and of Poland. Justice and equality of rights can be had only, at a great price. We are seeking permanent not temporary foundations for the peace of the world and must seek them can didly and fearlessly. As always the right will prove to be the expedient What shall we do then, to push this great war of freedom end justice to its righteous conclusion? We must clear away with a thorough hand all impediments to success and we must make every adjustment of law that will facilitate the full and free use of our whole capacity and force as a fighting unit. : Urges War on Austria. One very embarrassing obstacle that stands in our way is that we are at war with Germany but not with her allies. I, therefore, very earnestly rec ommend that the congress immediate ly declare the United States in a state of war with Austria-Hungary. Does it seem strange to you that this should be the conclusion of the argument I have just addressed to you? It is in fact ' the inevitable logic of what I have said. Austria-Hungary Js, for the time being, not her own mistress but simply the vassal of the German government. We must face the facts as they are and act upon them, with out sentiment in this stern business. The government of Austria-Hungary is not acting upon its own initiative or in response to the wishes and feel ings of its own people but. as the in strument of another nation. We must meet its force with our own and re gard' the central powers as but one. The war can be successfully conduct ed in no other way. The same logic would -lead also to a declaration of war against Turkey and Bulgaria. They also are the tools of Germany. Turkey and Bulgaria More Tools. But they are- mere tools and do not yet stand in the. direct path of our necessary action, i We shall go where ever the necessity of this war car ries us, but - it seems to me that we should go only where immediate and practical considerations lead us and not heed any others. The financial and military measures which must be adopted will suggest themselves as -the war and its under takings develop, but I wiU take the liberty of proposing - to you certain other acts of legislation which seem to me to be needed for the support of the wor and for the release of our whole force and energy; It will be necessary to - extend hi certain particulars the legislation of the last session with regard to alien enemies; and also necessary, I believe, to create a very definite and particu lar control over the entrance -and de parture of all persons into and from the United States. Aliens Should Not Be Coddled. Legislation should be . enacted - de fining as a. criminal offense every wil ful viola Jidh of the presidential proc lamations relating to enemy aliens pro mulgated under 'section 4067 of the .nroyidins; -ectnrb- 

ENEMYTR ADING LIST All the Firms Named in the List Have Been Charged With Secretly or Openly Assisting America's Ene mies List Later Will Include Firms in the United States. Washington, Dec. 4. A blacklist of 1,60 firms in twenty Central and South American countries ith whom merchants of the United States are forbidden specifically to do business except under special license was pro mulgated tonight by the War Trade Board. It is officially styled "Enemy Trading List" and constitutes the first section of a record which eventually will include the names of firms in most of the countries of the world, including the United States itself. Assisting - America's Enemies. Latin-America is dealt with first be cause of the large number of German firms in the southern republics active in aiding Germany's cause.

All those named in the list issued to night have been charged with secret ly or openly assisting America's ene mies. Authorized by President. The action is taken under author ity conferred on the president by the trading with the enemy act and is designed solely for the guidance of American concerns to enable them to observe the provisions of the law. The act forbids not only . trading except under special license with an enemy or an ally of an enemy, but prohibits commerce as well with a purpose con ducting trade' on behalf of or for the benefit of an enemy. Any licenses issued for trading firm's named in the list will be apart from the regular export and import licenses, which must be obtained' for the ship ment in or out of the United States of most commodities. .

Eliminate Profiteering. : Recent experience has convinced me that the congress must go further in authorizing the government to set lim its to prices. The law of supply and demand, I am", sorry to say, ' has been replaced - by- the law of unrestrained selfishness. While we have eliminated profiteering in several branches of the industry it still runs impudently ram pant in others. The farmers, for ex ample, complain with a great deal of justice that while the - regulations - of food prices restrict their incomes no restraints are placed upon the prices of most of the things they must them selves purchase: and similar Inequities obtain on all sides.

After four days of onslaughts that have beeh characterized as equalling any previ ously witnessed during the war, only the artillery is now engaged. Al though the Germans claim the capture of more than 6,000 British prisoners in their attacks and also more than 100 guns, reports from the scene - of battle, both from the British war office and from correspondents have indi cated that their own loss in men kill ed, wounded or made prisoners was a terrible price to pay for the very small recovery of lost terrain.
