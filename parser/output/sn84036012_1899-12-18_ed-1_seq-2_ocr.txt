WILL INCREASE COST OF LIVING 1 A General and Radioal Advance in T Freight Rates All Ov-r the United States Chicago, Dee. 11.-The Chronicle to-mor row will say: onre of the most rad.cal and general advantces ever made in freight rates will go Into effect on all the railroads east and west of Chicago. Thousands of artlcles of everyday con- r sumption will be affected and the increase t will average 35 and 40 per cent., the jump e on many classes reaching 50 per cent. The contrimpiatl d action has aroused the ship- t ping interests of the country. a The shippers say that if the carrying t charges are increased to the extent an nounced by thl railroads it will have the effect of increasing retail prices in every , line of trade. Sugar, soap, coffee, flour, e coal and farm implements are a few of the articles to be affected. Of these, as well as on hundreds of other articles, the increase will run from 20 to 40 per cent. I i The rate on coal, for example, west ot Chicago will be pushed up 25 cents on the ton. Rates on cattle wilt be advanced to 28 cents per 100 pounds, and hogs and sheep will go up from 25 to 30 cents and dressed meats to 40 cents per 100 pounds. Hlay is anothter article that will feel the advance severely. The tariff on this will be increased to $1.10 per ton. Chicago shippers are circulating peti- t tions to defer the advances until April 1, e to enable them to catch up on orders. Should the railroads refuse disastrous re suits to manufacturers and wholesalers will, it Is claimed, be the consequence. C Shippers In several jobb:ng centers talk of appealing to the judiciary. Officers of the railroads declare that the advances are made necessary by the increased cost of everything they are compelled to buy, from ties to engines. They further aver that there Is no reason why the railroads should continue quot Ing panic rates while merchants, manu- r * facturers and others are advancing rates. t THE ELECTIONS i IN PORTO RICO t Republicans De'ear Federalists-The Na- r tives Are Art ously Awaiting the Action o Cangross. Correspondence of the Associated Press. San Juan, Dec. 12.-The elections in Porto Rico are progressing slowly. The republicans carried Ponce on Dec. 9 ' by about 1,100 majority. According to the census of 1597 there are more than 45,000 peop'e in the Ponce district, but of that number only 4,466 are eligible to vote, the right of suffrage being limiecd to taxpayera and professlnal men, about 4,400 of that number going to the polls. The republicans claim that San Juan will give them a tremendous majcraty and that the election throughout the island will result in an overwihelming federal defeat. The elections will last for atleast two months more, there bclng still more than 45 towns to vote. The people are look'ng forwa;d anx iously to the action of congress on the question of civil government. Many ex pect that Porto Rico will be immedi ately given a system of self-govern ment of the islands, while others take a more conservative view of the sub ject. The Boletin Mercantil, comment ing on the subject, says: "The form of civil government for Porto Rico will undoubtedly be the one recommended by President McKinley in his annual message to congress with the exception of the highest office, the appointee for which place is not known yet, the appointments w1.1 be distribut ed among the most capable Porto Ri cans and Americans." 

WORKED ALL DAY Straightening Out the Accounts of the Biroidway National SIaIk. Boston, Mass., Dec. 17.-A force of clerks worked all day to-day straight ening out the accounts of the Broad way National bank, which suspended yesterday. There have been no developments to day and the clearing house committee did not roet last night as expectd. It is still the subject of much discussion that the clearing house did not come to the relief of the Bl3adway bank as it did for the Globe bank earlier in the week, and this feature of the failure is likely to continue uppermost in mind until the situation is made more clear. The work accomplished to-day was in the way of tabulating assets, and while much remains to fill out the official papers, it is anticipated that a ,ce tailed report to the comptroller will co forward late to-morrow. Mr. Wing will continue to accept payments on notes becoming due, but will not pay out any bank funds. Everything, ap. parently, depends upon what action Comptroller Dawes takes on receipt of Mr. Wing's report. HIas Not Leased It.

MUiJEHEH WILL APPEAL Court Said There Was No Ex tenuating Circumstanoes. THE SOAPY SMITH GANG They Will Soon Secure Their Liberty The President HBa Pardoned One orf Them-Why Judge John son R. signed. Port Townsend, Wash., Dec. 17-J. Homer Bird, the condemned Alaska murderer, after being refused a new trial by Judge Johnson, will make an effort to prolong his I!fe by an appeal to the United States supreme court, according to reports brought here to day by the steamer City of Topeka. Judge Johnson, in imposing the death penalty on Bird, stated that in all the evidence in the case there was not one single extenuating circumstance to jus tify Bird's crime. The execution of Bird will be the first legal hanging in Alaska during American occupation. In the early settlement of Juneau some Ind!ans killed a white man. They were arrested and given trial before a tri bunal of miners. Judge, prosecuting attorney and jurors were eelec:ed from among the miners. The three Indians were found guilty and sentenced to be hanged. A temporary scaffold was erected and the Indians were executed the next day. On the gallows they coa fesced. On the Topeka were six prisoners in charge of United States Marshal Shoup of Alaska, who is taking them to San Quentin to serve terms ranging from three to twenty years. Among the pris oners are three Eskimos, two Indians and one white man named Carl, sen tenced to 20 years for murder. The Soapy Smith gang, which ter rorized Skaguay during the early days of the Klondike excitement and who were finally tried, convicted and sen tenced, after the death of Soapy Smith, their leader, will soon have their 110 erty. News has Just reached Alaska that President McKinl-y had pardoned W. F. Foster, alias "S1'm Jim." Fos ter had served 12 months and his par don is due to the fact that he is dying of consumption. Another of the gang named Triplet has served h's time, while Bowers will be turned loose in March. United States Judge Charles H. Johnson of Alaska has at last made public his reasons for resigning.

"CHARLES H. JOHNSON, Judge." London Stoek alnrket. London, Dec. 17.-The stock exchange last week had an exciting experience. During the early\part of the week. owing to the tightness of money and the ah sence of buyers, prices fell quickly. The settlement, however, passed better than was expected. Eight members failed, but their defaults were unimportant. Fortunately 'the news of Lord Meth uen's reverse at Magersfontein did not come until after clearing up on Thurs day. With the news of General Buller's repulse at Tugela river, a heavy fall all around set in and caused something like a panic for a while. Americans also dropped quickly, but New York's recov ery did not avail to check the decline. Wabash preferred fell 1% points, Wa bash debentures 2>k.

It results in unnatural losses that sap the vitality and dnstrey t the nerve centers-the very foun'aln-head of life. It causes weakness of body and I brain, diseased kidneys, and generative organo, dizziness, loss of memory, lack of energy and confidence, pains in the back and head, vital drains. a wandering mind, r dimness of vision, discontent, gloom and despondeney, an aversion to society, dread of impending danger, etc. If you want to regain your health and strength. and once more he a man. call at once on Doctor Hinz.
