CONGRESS CONVENES The Lonar Session of tha Fifty-Fifth Congress Oommenoos. BOUSE LEADERS READY FOR WORK. The Committee Will Begin Their Labors on the lilllt Introduced at the Kxtru Session About 300 I1I1U oq the Senate Culomlitr. Washington, Dec. 0. The regular, or long, session of congress, as it is called, because there is no constitu tional limitation upon the period of its duration, opened at noon to-day. The leaders and a large majority of the members of both houses were here to participate in the opening ceremonies, and President McKinley had made the journey to Washington from the bed side of his dying mother that his ab sence might not delay the national legislature at its assembling. The extra session robs the opening of the regular session of the excitement and interest which usually attaches to it On the eve of a regular session, ordinarily, Washington thrills with excitement. The hotel lobbies surge with place-hunters in the wake of the various candidates for speaker, clerk, doorkeeper, etc.; the members are struggling for committee assignments and the air is full of. ru mors and plots and counter-plots. Hut as the house was completely organized at the extra session and all the com mittee assignments were made then, beyond the natural stimulus pro duced by the returning statesmen, the regular hangers-on of legislation and the outlining of schemes by members of the "third house," or lobby, Wash ington lust night was tranquil. It is the intention of the house lead ers to proceed with the business of the session as rapidly as possible. The committees will all begin their labors this week, und as all of them have more or less bills on hand which were intro duced at the extra session, there will be no luck of material for the house to work on after the committee hoppers begin to grind. The appropriations committee has been at work for ten days and Chairman Cannon expects to pass at least tvvoof the regular budgets before the holidays the legislative executive and judicial and the pen sions appropriations bills. One or tb other of these bills, it is expected, will be reported by Wednesday and the end of the week promises to see the house down to business. Among the early general measures to receive consideration will be the bankruptcy bill. Whether it will be the Nelson bill, which passed the sen ate at the last session, or a modifica tion of the Torrey bill, depends on the temper of the judiciary committee, which will submit the measure to the house. Deyond doubt there will be several resolutions of inquiry during the first week which may be more or less sensational, and some of the radi- cal pro-Cuba members will attempt to get consideration for a Cuban rsolution before the foreign affairs committee can act. Congressman Livingstone, of Georgia, is ono of these. Hut owing to the nature of the house rules, all these hasty efforts will prove abortive, and they probably will take their course. There will be nothing except indis- position on the part of the members to prevent the senate's entering promptly upon us work, as there is a calendar already made for it with about 800 bills reported from commit tees during the special session. With the president's message read, it will remain for the senate to decide whether it shall enter seriously upon the work of the session after to-dav. or begin a system of delay intended to throw all important questions over be yond the Christmas holidays. The indi cations are now for a little more activ- ity than usual during the pre-holiday session. This is largely due to the fact that the supporters of the administra tion and advocates of annexation are very anxious to secure the earliest possible consideration of the treaty with Hawaii. Senator Davis, chair man of the committee on foreign rela- tions, announces his purpose of press ing annexation at the earliest possible moment, but it is probable that the matter will not be taken up seriously until the committee can have a meet ing and decide on the details of pro cedure. The committee will be called together on Wednesday for this pur pose. One point which the committee will be called upon to decide is whether to proceed to ratify the treaty of an nexation or to annex the islands by resolutions. The annexationists have lost some votes during the vacation, and there is now apprehension that the two-thirds vote necessary to assure the ratification cannot be secured. Some members of the foreign relations com mittee who favor annexation advocate this course, because they say they see no reason for traversing the same ground twice, as they would be com pelled to do in case the matter should be first considered in executive session, fail there, and then be taken up in the form of a resolution in open senate and house. The immigration bill, for which Sen ator Lodge stands sponsor, is practi cally at the head of the senate legisla tive calendar and will be considered early in the session. Senator Lodge yesterday repeated his intention of pressing the bill, but he will not an tagonize the Hawaiian treaty with it The first bill on the calendar is Sena tor Gear's measure providing for the adjustment of the Pacific railroad debt, but the sale of the Union Pacific doubt less will have the effect of causing the temporary withdrawal of this bill and the substitution of others. Of the 300 bills on the calendar about 200 are pri vate pension bills, and all of theso probably will be disposed of at one sitting when taken up. There are also several hundred recess appointments to be considered in executive session.

The company appealed to the supreme court and filed dilatory motions. The court became satisfied that the rail road company's object was to delay and harass Rae's heirs in collecting their judgment and threw the case out of court. j" It Catches Them All. Some of the county ollicials who took charge of their offices before the new fee and salary bill was passed by the legislature and who have still one year more to serve, are laboring under the impression that the new law will not apply to them. Hut Attorney Ueneral Uoylo has rendered an opin ion which holds the law applies to of fleers who hold over as well as the newly-elected ones. CURRENCY REPORT. Comptroller Eckels Makes His Re port for thu Year. HE FAVORS A BANK NOTE ISSUE. Thlnki It Will lie Always Commemorate with and Responsive to Trade Demand governmental Currency a Source of Weakness. Cripples the Tower of the Courts. Judge Simons, in the Hourbon coun ty district court, held that the new Kansas contempt law had left the state courts powerless to enforce any orders made in chambers. Under the new law the courts have no jurisdic tion in contempt cases except during a term of court. Trial for contempt by a jury, he said, was impracticable dur ing a session of court and impossible in chambers. Rays She Is a Legal Juror. Mrs. K. N. Purdue has been drawn as a district court juror at Fort Scott, her name being copied from the tax rolls through mistake. Mrs. Purdue lived in Wyoming in 1S90, and as wom en are enfranchised in that state, she voted for McKinley. Now she insists that she is a legal juror, and if her contention is denied she will carry the case to the higher courts. The Record of Eleven Tears.

Brown, a populist, who is chairman of the house commit tee on railroads, viciously attacks Sen ator Harris and charges that Harris and Jerry Simpson "played in" with the railroads to defeat a maximum freight rate law. Kansas Indian Lands. At the Pottawatomie and Great Ne maha Indian reservations in Kansas there are about 10,000 acres of surplus lands in the prairie land reserve that are likely to be a subject of contention in the future, and there seems to be a growing sentiment in the tribe favor ing their sale.

For High School Uniformity. State Superintendent Stryker hai called a meetipg of high school prin cipals of the state, to be held at To peka during the state teachers' asso ciation, the purpose being to adopt some plan for high school uniformity . throughout the state. , Washinoton, Dec. 0. The annual re port of James II. Eckels, comptroller of the currency, for the year ended Oc tober 81, 1897, opens with with a brief review of the history of the legislation which coustitutes the present national bank act, and invites the attention of congress to amendments to the law recommended in former reports with out specifically repeating them. On the subject of bank note circulation, the comptroller says: In the report of every comptroller of the our rency during the past 1!0 years the wisdom of changing the existing luw so that the banks, und through them tho communities in which thoy are located, might have the additional beneftt of an added lonnablo enpltal has been urged. Despite all this the luw still remains without amendment Not only should the bank act bo umended In this particular, but congress should seriously consider such a change in tho method of bank note issues as will enable the banks of the country to more adequately meet the demands of trade and commerce in all sections of the country. liotween the competition of tho government note Issues on the one hand and iho unneces sary restrictions imposed by law on tho other, together with the increasing price of bonds re quired to be doposlted as security, the note Issuing function of the banks has been permit ted to become merely an Incident to the con duct of tho nationul banking associations of the country. It has been seriously suggested more than once thut the bank noto issue be done awaylwlth, and all papor bo llsued by tho government instead. The danger of sueli a ooursc Is not to be over-estimated. Tho experi ence of every government has been that gov ernmental currency paper is a source of weak ness and danger. In tho United States, where there has been the nearest approach to success. with tho volume of tho federal papor compara tively limited in amount, the credit of the gov ernment has been moro than oneo put In jeopardy through It, and tho business Interests of the oountry subjected to unnecessary loss and confusion. Tho argument that the government, better than tho banks, can provide for tho redemp tion of paper noto Issues will not stand tho test of a careful analysis. The government has no means of caring for Its demand liabilities except through borrowing and through tho levying of taxes. Upon tho other hand tho banks have assets which oan bo promptly con verted into cash to meet their outstanding notes when presented. Their ability to com mand gold has always been beyond that of tho government, for In each tinunciul exigency which has confronted tho government the banks have furnished to it the amounts neces sary to maintain Its solvency. It is Impossible to believo that with a system of bank note Issues, based In part upon securities and in part upon bank assets, tho country cannot be pro vided with sound, safe and elastic bunk note Issue, always commensurate with und respon sive to tho demands of trade. The total number of national banks organ Ized since the system was put into operation. In 1883, is shown to have been 6,0115. On October 81 last there were In active operation 8,817, hnvlng an authorized capital of Mil), 230, 295. Tho total outstanding circulation of the banks then outstanding was J229, 109.8S0 of which K2U2,- 994,655 was secured by bonds of tho United States and tho balance by lawful money de posited with the treasurer of tho United Statos, The circulation outstanding of all na tional bonks on October 81 last was 230,13l,0O5, of which amount 1,S:8,800 was secured by bonds held for account of insolvent and liqui dating banks and 126.205,333 by lawful money deposited for their account and by active banks reducing circulation. Tho net decreano In tho amount of circulation secured by bonds during the year was i2,fim,;4 and the gross decrease In the total circulation was 14,851,292, During the year 44 banks were organized with an aggregate capital stock of 6,420,000. During the year 71 banks went into voluntary liquidation. The report contains the latest com piled statistics relative to the world's monetary systems and the stock of gold, silver and paper currency. A very interesting feature of this state' ment is the per capita amount of each kind of money in the countries named, The per capita averages in tho princi pal countries of the world are as fol lows: United States, $28.70; United Kingdom, $20.05; France,
