A STORY WHICH TENDS TO INDICATE LAXITY OF MANAGEMENT AT THE TOMBS. Commissioner Lantry of the Department of Corrections has refused to indorse the action liken by his deputy, N. O. Fanning, on Saturday in suspending from duty Warden James J. H&car> of the Tombs Prisor on charges of ac cording unusual liberties to ex-Wardman Bis sert. convicted of receiving money from the keeper of an alleged disorderly house. Mr. Fan nine. when seen yesterday, said: "Commissioner Lantry took the papers in the case, and he does not approve of my suspension of Warden Hagan. When I took the action I expressly stated thai the whole matter was re ferred to Commissioner Lantry. That is all I care to say." Warden Hagan appeared at the Tombs about I*i o'clock yesterday forenoon. According to the keepers it was the first time that the warden had ■-■-! appeared at his post on a Sunday. He remained until about 3 o'clock in the afternoon. Asked about his suspension, he said: w "Wliilf Commissions Lantry is in the city, any act of Deputy Commissioner Fanning is that of .i private citizen. I shall pay no atten tion 10 bis suspension of me as warden of the Tombs. 1 came down as usual to-day to attend to business, and was not interfered with. Had I been 1 should have resented such interference. "It was purely a case of religion, which I de plore, and I will not say who started it. It v. as alleged by a certain missionary who comes uj« sere to the Tombs that I favored Wardman Blssert and allowed him to <?at at my table and also to send out for delicacies. Before a man if convicted of a crime 1 extend to him the privileges that a man supposed to be innocent ur.der the law enjoys. If I know a man who is a prisoner i shall naturally lean toward him. as any other man will, but during the four years that I have been here I have never given a prisoner an unwarranted advantage, nor have I abus-ed a man. SAYS CHAPLAIN WAS ANGRY AT HIM. "Chaplain John J. Munro became angry at me lor a reason which I will not state, except to mv that it was a personal matter, and Deputy Commissioner Fanning took up the fight. "I am sorry that it occurred, especially as I will soon be out of office, owing to the change of administrations, and hate to have an attack made upon me at this late day. I met Deputy Commissioner Fanning Saturday afternoon, and v •- parted abcut 3 o'clock. Then he came around to the prison about 10 o'clock that night- and left n note for me saying that I was suspended. Ho Also stated to a couple of reporters that he could noi rind mo there, giving them the impression t'>*i I was derelict in my duty. Ho knew when hr made this statement that I was on days and v as not supposed to be. in the office at night." Commissioner Lantry said ho had received a -mi on Saturday night from Mr. Fanning, telling of the suspension of Warden Hagan. My idea. ".'said Commissioner Lantry. "is that V- Fanning lost his head. He certainly acted ill advisedly, for I was in the city, and if there was cause for Warden Hasan's suspension I should have been called upon to act in the mat ter. The charges, as 1 understand them, are that Warden Hagan afforded special privileges to Bissert. that Blssert was permitted to dine at :he warden's table, and enjoyed other special privileges. The warden of the city prison has th»> right to afford such privileges to any pris oner in his charge as he sees fit, so long as the rules of the- prison are not violated. I under- Ftand Bissert did dine at the warden's table, as he had the right to do if the warden granted him that privilege. "Warden Hagan is a good officer, and in his term of four years has proved himself thorough ly efficient. Mr. Fanning is also an excellent official, but somewhat erratic. I shall be at my office to-morrow (Mondavi, and will make a thorough investigation. Hagan will have a full opportunity to answer the charges against him, which, as I understand, originated through % <:uafrel between Chaplain Munro. representing the Presbyterian Mission Society at the city pi hum, and another missionary. It was a dis pute as to which of those two should have the righr to deposit certain of his books in an empty ed!." Mr. Fanning was seen last night, but would Bay nothing about the case. PAROLED MAN KEPT IN A CELL. .V stery was told yesterday by David Willard T.hkh would seem to indicate some laxity in the management of the Tombs. Charles L. Smith, twenty years old. who was arrested early in No vember on a charge of stealing a piece of lead I>ip». was paroled on probation on November 8 aad placed in the custody of Mr. Willard. who is Maacct«d~ with the University Settlement, and »h-, i.y special permission of the Department of Correction, has charge of the boys' department at tfae Tombs. On Friday he completed his fifth y-.ir of service there. Although Smith was offi cially eel at liberty on November S. he was kept in the Tombs for another month, and might have remained there indefinitely if Mr. Willard had not accidentally found him there. "I was coming out of the Tombs on Friday morning," said Mr. Willard to a Tribune re porter yesterday, "wh< n the man who sells Papers there .said he had got into conversation with a you-g man locked up in one of the cells »'bo said something about being in my charge. The young man said be wanted to see me. and I ■cat in, to look him up that morning. Smith •sii he wanted to know when his case was com mit up for trial. He told me he was placed in my custody by Justice Jerome on November S. or thereabouts* and he looked to me for' advice. "•lt seems to Tr.e/ I said, "your case is long delayed. i will look into it." "I went to the court and inquired of the clerK Ear the papers. The papers said plainly that tlie <-ase had been disposed of on November v The clerk said there must be some mistake. I ' ok the papers and went to see the chief clerk. tt.Vt safd that Smith had been released on pro bation on November S. I told him he was mis tclrea; that I had seen Smith In his cell. He ••aid the young man must have been rearrested on son:** other charge, or something of that kind, because on the original charge' h- hud •-•-en released. Word was sent over to the Tombs, and they replied that they had no such boy there; that Smith had been liberated on probation on November S. " 'He isn't here.' they told me. 'He was re • Hi some time ago and will probably come around to see you tome time soon.* "I insisted that he was in the Tombs, and gave them his cell and tier number, and told them I bad •en there and had talked with him. They --!.! for a Tombs record to show what disposi tion had been made of the case.' The record showed that Smith had been released on Novem ber 8, and that officially he was not in the prison. Finally then sent an officer to the cell, where he found the boy. He was immediately brought to court before Judge Holbrook. who, after examining the papers, said: 'The boy is in Jour charge. Take him." Tit is a most remarkable case. Both the Tombs and the court records showed that the Ifoy was : discharged, and yet he was ktpt in prison .for a month. How he came to be recon lined in the Tombs after he *as liberated no body twined to know. He was not held by any minority that we can determine, and there waa absolutely no reason for the officials holding him. If I. had not im'estißated the case It If Possible that they would have held him until doomsday. A HOSPITAL IN THE STREET HOW ORANGE HAS OUTWITTED OBJEC TION TO ITS PESTHOUSE. IT HAS ERECTED BUILDINGS FOR ITS SMALLPOX PATIENTS IN THE MIDDLE OF A PUBLIC THOROUGHFARE. Orange. N. J.. Dec. S (Specials — The author ities of the city of Orange planned a clever coup in the erection of a temporary hospital for the treatment of the ten patients now sick with smallpox, and to-night the sick persons were removed to the building and are comfortably housed there, while the city has no fear of fur ther injunctions or restraining orders, since no court would grant an order after patients were in the hospital. Driven from one place to an other in attempts to erect a building, and thwarted at every point, the city finally decided to close a street one block long and erect the hospital in the middle of the thoroughfare. In taking this action the authorities have placed themselves in a position where they may be in dicted for obstructing a public thoroughfare, but every one concerned is willing to stand an indictment if any grand jury should determine that in such an emergency a municipality trans tressed the laws. The city mad? every effort to erect a hospital before deciding to use the street. First. an ap plication was made to the city of East Orange for pel ml— lon to erect a hospital on the Orange poor farm, a tract of thirty-three acres in East Orange. The New-Jersey laws provide that no hospital can be huilt by one municipality within the limit? of another municipal corporation without the consent of that corporation's gov erning body. The East Orange Board of Health. and subsequently its City Council, gave the necessary permission, but this af.tion was vetoed by Mayor Edward E. Bruen of East Orange. Then the West Orange Town Council was appealed to for permission to place the building in that town on the Orange Mountain. Pressure brought to bear by citizens resulted in the West Orange Council refusing the request It was then that August K. Eckert gave tho city permission to use his vacant land, at Mosswood and Hey wood ayes.. for the hospital. The erection of the buildings whs begun, when an injunction was obtained by Thomas G. Bar ber, who owns vacant land near by: J. K. Wierdsna. of lfosswood-ave^ South Orange: the Bey. Charies L. Pardee, rector of St. Andrew's «"hurcb. South drancc rind Mrs. Bertha J. Chandler and Perry Walton, of Ifosswood-ave., ( trange. When this injunction was granted on Friday night the city authorities looked about for ways and means, and finally decided to place the. building: in the middle of Heywood-ave. This street was deeded to the city by Edward E. Clapp, manager of the Fidelity and Casualty Company, of New- York, who owns surrounding property, and who lives In Washlngton-st., East Orange. Although accepted by the city, the street is passable, because the stumps of trees there have never been removed. The injunction on the part of residents in the neighborhood to the use of the Eckert property was granted, be cause in the deed given by John G. Vose. the original owner, twenty years ago. there was a clause providing that the land should not be used for a stable, stores, circus or anything: else objectionable, obnoxious -or -detrimental to the surrounding property. The extension of Heywood-ave., in which the hospital is erected, was deeded to the city by Mr. Clapp. He was anxious to obtain an in junction yesterday, but no grounds could be found to warrant the granting of this demand. Lest some new ground should be found, it was decided by the authorities to proceed with the erection of the buildings rapidly. Electric lights were raised all about the place, and the work was carried on all night and continued to-day. Now that the buildings are erected, no court, it is thought, will give any injunction. inasmuch as the smallpox patients are all housed in the place. Mayor Henry Stetson, of Orange, was so in dignant over the action of the property owners in getting an injunction, even though the hos pital is 500 feet distant from the nearest dwell ing, that he issued a proclamation yesterday, attested with the city seal, in this proclamation he said, referring to Mr. Kckert. that •'his soul is much larger than his pocketbook/" and. con tinuing, ho said that the residents who had ob tained the injunction had "no regard for the interests of their own city." "Just why these •littlo people' should lend a hand to such a pro ceeding,'' said the Mayor, "surpasses all com prehension." He called upon the people of the city to "sustain by their words and action the work of the Board of Health in this trying emergency and give them their moral support in their almost superhuman efforts to stamp out the dread disease, instead of allowing it to become epidemic, as some property owners seem to desire. They have done the very best they could, while thwarted in their benevolent work by the very people who should have come to their assistance.*' The New-England Society of Orange last night directed its committee on public welfare to report upon the merits of the opposition to the erection of the hospital. The resolutions were presented by <"amillus G. Kidder, and de clare that the spread of smallpox in the country and the existence of several cases in the com munity give reason to fear that the disease will become epidemic this winter. The resolutions also declare in favor of a permanent isolation hospital for the Oranges, and attention is called to the fact that the money spent in the present outbreak would have provided such a hospital. Two new cases developed in Orange yester day. Thomas J. Taylor, a New-York business man. whose daughter was married only ten days ago. was taken sick with the disease. He lived until last week at Palm Lodge, in Centre st., which abuts on the property where the Peters family live and where the smallpox, fust appeared. Last week Mr. Taylor sold Palm Lodge and moved to High-st..- Orange. Robert Brennan. a watcher, employed at the Hurlbut st. house, was also taken with the disease. These cases make a total of twelve in Orange since the disease broke out. There have been two deaths. IM V 

TOSSED KY A BUFFALO. THE LAST OF THE ZOOLOGICAL PARK ORANG OUTANGS DYING. Bernard McEnroe, a keeper at the New-York Zoological Park, had a narrow escape yesterday from the wrath of Black Beauty, the big buf falo bull in the park- It was Black Beauty that so nearly killed one of the smaller bulls in the buffalo lot a few weeks ago. Yesterday Mc- Enroe and others were driving him into a small corral with a cement floor, because his hoofs were growing too long in the soft earth of his paddock. The cement floor will wear them down to their normal length. Black Beauty was close to the gate leading into the corral, when he wheeled suddenly, made a dash toward McEnroe, and, before the keeper could get out of the big brute's way, jammed one ugly horn through McEnroe's right boot leg. The flesh on his leg was torn, but not seriously. McEnroe turned a somersault on the buffalo's horn, and landed heavily in a fence corner twenty feet away, much shaken up. A fellow keeper brought a stout club down across the bull's nose, and Black Beauty entered the corral. Sally, the last of the orangoutangsg outangs in the Park, has fallen a victim to the same disease that carried off her companion, and is exceed ingly ill. Superintendent Hornaday says her malady is incurable. The disease is technically ROUND TRIP TICKETS TO CALIFORNIA On sale at all ticket offices, offering diversity of routes going and returning, via Chicago & North- Western.'

AND SAYS HE CANNOT BE "GUNNED OUT." |BY TELKGRAr-H TO TIIK TRIIiINK.I Boston. Dec. X.— Thomas W. Lawson to-night issued the following statement to the public: No one regrets more than I the bad break in the price of the stock of the Trinity Copper Compangr, which occurred last week. I own 150,000 shares, a short time ago worth at mar ket prices $6,000,000, and at Saturday's price only $2,000,000; but as none of it is carried on mar gin or borrowed on. and as I believe it is worth much more than it has ever sold for. and will sell higher than it has ever sold. I will not sell it, and it therefore can in no way be a menace to the market. As I believe th?ro is tittle Trinity carried on n^aridn outside that carried by my house, which will carry its customers to a finish on it. I see no reason for holders to be scared into selling. The cause of the drop in price was that ev erything I am, or mi supposed to Vie interested in has been under savage attack for weeks. I protected Trinity by buying until, as the on slaught grew more furious. I might have fatally weakened myself if i had stood my ground longer. I therefore decided it best, regardless of the personal humiliation, to beat a retreat. I earnestly request those who in the past have been with me in some pretty light stock market holes and who then had faith, afterward found to be well founded, not to allovv any of the des perate tactics of my generous opponents to pre vail with them to the extent of causing them to act t<> their own loss. Above all. I ask them not to be stampeded by the rumors, however well "proven" they may be. that I have capitulated or compromised. I cive them my word— and they, regardless of Wall Street scoffs, know whether my word should bo, as it always has been, at par — I give them my word I cannot be "gunned out" or made to capitulate or compromise, and that I will bo <lc.ing what business I decide to do in the way I decide to do it when every one of those who are lighting me has sneaked off the field, and I will do this, as in the past, without asking or accepting any assistance from any one. I do not wish to disguise that since the cut In the Amalgamated dividend 1 have lost heavily, or that I will not continue to lose, but I do want those who through long years of good and bad times have "been with" roe to know I am now, as always in thr> past, conducting my affairs on thos.-' old fashioned business principles which are absolute guarantees of solvency at nil times, without the favor of any. ;ind 1 also want them to know that tho tight now on, and which started with the coke and g;is Hffair and climaxed in the cup d^fendine episode, is to ho to a finish, and that while I expect no quarter I want none :md will give none. I just want my friends to know this fight will be to a flnish. TO SURVEY ANACONDA MINE. HEINZE <;ETS PERMISSION FROM THE COURT TO EXAMINE AMALGA MATED PROPERTIES. „ [HT TKI.FC.RAPH TO TITC Tr.lr.isr I Butte, Mont., Dec. £. — Another surprise was sprung .n the - Amalgamated litigation yesterday .by Judge Clancy, of the District Court, who granted an order permitting Hetuse'a' men to make a thorough Inspection and survey of the underground .. workings. of the».Anncondri mine, one of the 4 lOTtiflTT" ****** largest prop erties. The order giants permission to the. Heinze. people to go into the Anaconda and St. Lawrence properties, and for a period of ten days, extending from December 11 to •_"_'. to make an Investigation of the work being done by the Amalgamated people there The order Issued by Judge Clancy is the result of a suit of long standing, wherein Heinze peti tioned for the permission to make this examina tion. In the complaint filed in that action Eieinze claimed that he owned a half interest in the Fairmount mine, which adjoins the Anaconda and St. Lawrence, and that lie had reason to be lieve that his interests were being encroached by the Anaconda company, and that the latter was mining "re from veins having their apexes in the Fairmount and by underground workings in that claim. The order to show cause why this permission should not be granted was issued about a year ago, and the matter has been hang ing fire since that time until the court made the order requested yesterday. Following the order granted to Heinze to in spect the Amalgamated properties. Judge Clancy, at the request of tho Boston and Mon tana company, granted that company permis sion t<> send six men into the Minnie Healy mine, over which so much notoriety < amo !" Judge Hartley and Mrs. Brackett, and to mike a thorough inspect ion of the workings of <hr.t property. In this case, the order of the cour* granted to the Boston and Montana company permission to survey the underground work ings of the Minnie Healy and ascertain just what work is being done hy the Heinze people there. This order was. however, stayed for a period of ten days by Judge Clancy. Following these orders. Judge Clancy ap pointed Richard Lacy as inspector of the <\> manche mine while tin- Boston and Montana company is operating it. The same man was appointed, on the request of the Heinze people, as inspector of the Piccolo, <sambetta and Day ton mines, and his duties are to report to the court the work being done by the Boston and Montana company in those properties. The quick succession of orders made yesterday cre ated much excitement among copper interests here, and the next move by the Ilcinze people, which it is expected will lie in the shape of further suits and injunctions, is awaited with keen interest. HAS MRS. DALY SOLD OUT? PKRSISTKNT RtMOR THAT SHE IHSPOSED OF COPPER HOLDINGS DENIED. Butte. Mont.. Doc. fS. — Persistent rumors have been afloat here to-day regarding heavy losses through investment in Amalgamated Coppe!" stock by Mrs. Daly, widow of Marcus Daly, the copper king. Mrs. Daly received by the provisions of her husband's will many shares in this giant company, and the story, which comes from reliable sources in Butte, says that the widow of th? multi-millionaire invested but a short time ago s?. - eral more millions of dol lars in tne Amalgamate;! stock at top prices, ranging from 126 and 127 a share. The stock began a terrific decline, which carried with it immense losse.-. and Mrs. Daly, feat ing the resulU. not only disposed of her new holdings but als.. (he stock which had been in the Daly family since the organization of the Amalga mated Company. Mis. Daly, it the report be true, is the loser by her recent investment of nearly two million dollars, and by her quick determination to sell out the shares she held in the concern sent the price of the stock on a downward course, which stopped only after tho lowest price on record was reached in the marketing of the stock at T.'V In the face of the story of the sale of the Dab estate stock. John D. Ryan, vice-president of th«» Daly Bank and Trust Company, says to-day that he had received a telegram from John C. Laior, manager of the estate, in which he emphatically denies the n mors concerning the disposal of the Amalgamated stock. Mr. Lalor further said that the Daly people had the greatest faith in the Amalgamated and had no intention of selling their holdings. PL ATT TO RE RE-ELECTED. COLONEL DUNN SAYS THE SENATOR WILL CONSENT. DXCI.ARES HE TS A COMPARATIVELY POOR MAN, AND HAS GIVEN HIS MONEY FOR THE PARTY. "Senator Platt will be re-elected to the T'nited States Senate, despite his present desire to re tire from that office. There is a tremendous sen timent in the Republican organization, which Mr. Platt will not resist when he realizes its magnitude. This sentiment has been caused by Senator Platt's sacrifices to the Republican party and his own personal int< Tlty." This statement was made yesterday by Colo nel George W. Dunn, the chairman of the Re publican State Committee. Colonel Dunn had come down from his home, at Binghamton, and he said that he intended to stay in this city the entire week. He was moved to speak of the United States Senatorship by the report that Lieutenant-Governor Woodruff was likely to succeed Senator Platt. Colonel Dunn went on to say: "You can trot out all the candidates for the successor of Thomas C. Platt that you wish. The number or the kind of men will make little difference. If Senator Platt lives until January ' 1, lSiO.*',. and has two legs to stand on, he will be elected his own successor." "But he has said that he does not want to be returned." suggested a newspaper man. "I know ho has," was the answer. "But he will be re-elected despite that. There is a senti ment in the Republican party of this State which he will not want to resist when he learns its strength. The sentiment for re-electing Thomas C. Platt is as strong as the sentiment which elected him first. His leadership in this State is as strong as. if no' stronger than, it ever was." "What are the reasons for Senator Platfs immense power as a leader?" was asked. '"His self-sacrificing and his integrity of char acter," was the reply. "Senator Platt is a poor man to-day, although he might have made millions in a way which many political leaders would have considered legitimate. Senator Platt has for the last twenty years drawn a salary of $18,<MK» as president of the United States Ex press Company. Part of that time he has also been a United States Senator, at a salary of >C..O<K». And yet to-day ho is a com paratively poor man. I would not give $100,000 for a full and clear title to all that the Senator possesses. In his place as State leader, with the great powers that are attendant upon that office, with the complete control of patronage, and with all the other Influences that accompany such a place. Senator Platt might have made $20.0001000. And ho might have done so In a way which many political leaders would con sider as wholly legitimate. "But instead of building up wealth for himself, the Senator has contributed his own money to the work of the Republican organization. He ha.s always gone down into his pocket in sup port of the cause of his organization whenever the call came, and whenever he saw that defeat was inevitable without his support. He has often been known to contribute out of his own pocket toward the candidacy of his friends. I have seen this with my own eyes many and many a time. It was always the success of the Republican arms that was uppermost in his mind. And thus it is that he hay built up a wonderful organization, which will stand by him to "th» last ditch, and will send him back to Washington." The election of United States Senator will be held at the session of th« Legislature in 1003. The men who will vote at this election will be the Senators and Assemblymen who are to bo Chosen at the polls next. fall. Rec.iuse of the preponderance of the Republican party in the legislature at the present time, it is safe to as sume, so the up-State R^punlican leaders say, that the Repu oilcans will then have control. Only a Democratic lands-lido will be able, they say, to turn the scale. It i?: for this reason that the Republican leaders are at the present time cautious about making any changes in the Excise law, which, some of them fear, will alienate the rural population of the State, upon which the Republican party depends.
