DECEMBER 6 1900 JfKIOB 5 UbNTB Governor Approves Of Japanese In Schools Department of Justice Will Pass On Immigration Act SARGENT THINKS LAW NOT VIOLATED "An a result, of my Investigation I am convinced that nil the provisions of the Territorial Immigration Act have been compiled with In tho bring ing of theso Portuguese Immigrants to Hawaii. I do not bcllcvo that thcro lias been any violation of the contract labor law. But that is not for me to pass on. Tho Department of Justice will decide as to that. If there is any question as to the propriety of bring ing the immigrants here, It lies In tho -validity or invalidity or the Territorial Immigration Act. That will conic up beforo the Department of Justice. "I havo mado a very exhaustive In vcstlgatlon Into all matters connected with tho Importing nf theso Portu guese, and especially Into any possible violations of the contract labor laws. I havo made searching Inquiries Into whether or not these people come here under contract to go to work for any particular person or Arm, and as to whether or not they aro free to go where they please and to work for whom they please. My conclusions aro that they havo been brought hero by tho Territorial Hoard of immigra tion under tho special Immigration act passed by tho Legislature. The mon ey to pay for bringing them hero was raised by subscription,, and they arc free to-do as they please, now that tho aro bcreT They aro undcr.no obli gation, to work for anbody in particu lar. They' signed no contract on tho other side. Tho circulars which wc;o distributed over thoro wero issued by authority of tho Territory and merely stated the prevailing rato of wages in Hawaii and the inducements that were offered Immigrants to conio to the isl ands, go far as I can sec, everything Is satisfactory In that respect," The above Is tho statement mado by Immigration Commissioner V. P. Bar gent this morning. Mr. Sargent has practically concluded his labors hero and -has had time to size tho situation up fully. His Investigations, ho says, have been very complete, "I have taken testimony from every body In any way connected with tho matter, and all the testimony has been given under oath.

Carter's Report Favors Admission Of Japanese To The Pubic Schools Roosevelt Is Opposed, Says Sargent, To Large Land Holdings SETTLERS IN HAWAII SHOULD OWN HOMES . x K X X H X it K X X ft Mj K M X HI! jr XX In view of President Kooscvctt'K attitude nn the Japani'so question, and particularly In regard to the education of Japanese children in tho American public schools, It Is of Interest to be able to quote Governor Carter's Ideas on tho same subject. This Tho Bulletin Is enabled to do from the Governor's Annual Report to tho Secretary of tho Interior, which wns sent to Washington seven weeks ago, and which tho President has probably never hi en. Tho Governor says: "There la nothing to deplore In the Increase of Japanese children. The Japanese are here pro bably In large proportion to remain. Their natural Increase has besn very great and, as eight years have elapsed alnce annexation, a large number of the Japaneie children now crowding Into our schools have been born under the American flag. When these reach maturity they will have the right of claiming American cltltenihlp. It Is, therefore, most Important that they should have full opportunity of becoming equipped with the knowledge and habits of thought requisite to good American citizenship. Apart from that consideration, It must be conceded that It Is the Inalienable privilege of every child under the protection of the flag to enjoy the benefits of that public school system which Is one of the chief glories of the American Commonwealth, and which, moreover, Ha waii took as an Ideal long before admission and continues, as a part of the Union, with best endeav ors to maintain."

AFFORD TO BE WITHOUT ONE? Hawaiian Trust Message Has No Effect 8AN FRANCISCO, Cal., Dec. 6. The message of President Roosevelt regarding the segregation of Japanese pupils has effected no change In the situation here. MR dill AT WAIII BEACH Plans For NewYear's Day Festival Has Been Formed Commissioner of Immigration Sar- Rent was asked this morning to give tils Interpretation of that part or the President's message which refers to Hawaii, In which President Roosevelt says that "whenever tho leaders In the great industrial Industries of the Islands adopt our Ideals and Join In developing a middle class of substan tial citizens, a way will bo round to deal with tho Industrial and commer cial problems of tho Territory." A middle class of substantial citizens Mr. Sargent Interprets as meaning in dustrious people of small or modcriite means, who shall own their own houicj and bo good American citizens. "1 think the President means," said he, "people such as those who have Just arrived on tho Suverlfc, not merely laborers who come to Hawaii to woilc on the plantations. The President be lieves in small land holdings, where each man cultivates his own land and makes his own living Hn wants peo ple to coma here nnd ralso something, besides cane. Ho wants them to bo Independent. Ho thinks that the fu ture of tho Hands depends upon hav ing such n class, and ho Is ardently In favor or Immigration to tho Islands that will provide such n class. If Ha waii will become a Territory semen by this kind of people, she will bo 

TREATED rightly by tTto President end tho United 8tatci." Mr. Sargent expressed regret that ho had not had a chance to read tho wholti of tho President's message. "I know that It Is a strong nnd lgnrous one,' he said, "and that President Roosctelt has been deleting lots of tlmo and At tention tu It for scvcrnl months, i t hope that the peoplo or Honolulu will not pass Judgment on it until lh!t-y have had opportunity to read the whole or IL I think they will find that it is tho President's Intention to treat Hawaii all right."
