no. Wednssday Swminj, Pgat"'r ' I860. We think that it r sately- claimed that the Preside'"' message hat disappoint td hit own friends. It was of course not to be expected that his opponents would be pleased, for party spirit rum no high that xood partisanship demauda that a multi tude of faults should be discovered in the message by Democratic politician!. By far the greater number of criticisms upon it by Democratic and Republican journal isU might as well have been written oeiure . : I... ..'.JIm r,.ad i aiter reaoing , ui-;.. o - ir to censure, and the other to praise, n uiie this is generally the case, there will here and there be found a tfr-publicar. editor who will withhold his praise, and a I'emocrai who will take ploasure in commending some portions of the message and withhold hii censure of the rest But wa cannot believe that the document really commend itself s whole to thinking fair-minded Repub licans. The tedious verboaeness of the message no one was prepared for, for among both parties and the whole people, the President has been credited with a brevity and di rectness of expression,, (wheu indulging in en opinion), characteristic of the soldier and almost peculiar to the President. H inaugural in this respect met the public ex pectation. The paper under review pos sesses neither of these. In his inaugural address, it will be rememdered that he an nounced to Congress that he would enforce the laws whether he liked them or not, and that he would alwas have policy to recom mend, but none to enforce against the will of that body. Thii was intended as the assumption of a virtue in himself, and at a reflection upon his predecessor in oflice. .. . fi-.. l,.. ;mm.i;t1ir I Is lot) Bess. on vi itui", ....v ,u.hv -j i followed the delivery of this address and hit present message, illustrate to what extent he has kept his pledge. Among his firtt official acts was the appointment of an offi cer who was not only disqualified by law to act, but especially an un6t person, oo ac count of the exact state of facts from which the disiiualifviuir statute sprang, to perform I edy with impartiality the duties of the office ' I j Not satisfied with this, he petitiontd Con gress to virtually repeal, for his personal gratification, this who'.esotnn i-Utute, than which there is not a more reasonable enact ment. Thin incident in his early oflioial career illustrated at once bis devotion to hie own plans auJ persotial preferences, and his mistaku aj to the willingness of Congress to second them. The mPHeae before n fuiU so I'nr short oi hitt pledge to nlwavs have a policy to recomtueud, that the special instances of it need scarcely 'o be jmiuted out. We must not fail to do hiin the justice, however, to acknowledge at lean one prominent and gratifying rospect in which he makes a just and needed recommendation, to wit : That the State of Virginia, having complied with the requirements of Congress, be mime diately restored to her place iu the family of States. There is, however, more than an oiT sot for thia in hit recommendation as to Georgia He advises that, notwithstand ing this State has adopted a constitution, Republican in form, and chosen State ofli cers, and organized a civil government, and performed all the acts required of it by Conirrcss. vet he sutfireBts the wisdom ol authorizing the Governor uf the Stale to eonveue a defunct Legislature in the inter ests of Itadiralism. He gives as a reason for this, the fact that the Legislature of the State, in violation of its constitution, o.v Bubsrijuently tlr-clarnl by the Supreme Court of the Mate, unseated several of its colored members. He allows no credit to the Stnte on account of the decision of the. SiiprotiH' Court, but asks Coiifrres to virtually threw the Statu into tha throes of a second recon struction, because the Legislature did not respect the right of colored meu to sent?. Congress is thus appealed to to nuBert iu supervisory control of tha Stale govern ments of the. South for ull time. If this doctrine is to prevail, a departure by any one department of a southern State gov ernment from the wi'.l of Congress, will always and at any time subject the Slate to Congressional doctoring, the evident inten tion being to force those States to ( hooie between perpetual broil with Congress and a lull acceptauce aud adoption ol tlie lluu ical creed. On the Cuban question the Presi dent is profusely vague. Ha evidently thinks there is something to be said ou both sides and is disposed to make both parties be lieve they have worse enemies than himself. On this subject be has no policy to recom mend to Congress. lie is equally clear and poiuted on taxation, tariff aud r vcuue These questions being, of the very hifjhet importanoe, could not be paired over in silence, so he thinks something might with propriety be done, hut to avoid any issue on tho policy of reducing taxation and lessen ing the evils of the tariff robbery, he sagely sugiusts that these questions be postponed till the next Congress niceta by which time lie will have nscertaiued whether his parly is decidedly in favor of one policy or another, and being so advised, wilt of course give a strong recommendation one way or tne other.

The Johnson Clarenden protocol for a treaty between tnis country and England with reference to the settlemen of the Alabama claims, having been almost unanimously rejected by the Senate, he thinks be is per- fectW mle in assuring those who did it that they were perfectly right.
