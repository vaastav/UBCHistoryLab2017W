Abbott) Washington, lVc. C Some day a president will create a stir by send ing to congress a message which even n-monibor of tho body to which It Is submitted will read. Mr. llooso vclt's message submitted at tho open hiK of tho sixtieth congress fills sixty-three panes of a good sired octavo pamphlet. It may bo o pic turesque commentary upon tho folly of such a voluminous montage to congress that when tho house and senate adjourned the newspapermen swarming Into tho two chambers found the neat pamphlets In which the message w-as hound lying on tho desks of the statesmen or cast upon the floor. Ijong after the ad journment hour no tut nber of either house or congress could bo found who had either read or listened to the reading of the message. None would give an opinion upon it. Of course In a general way prominent republicans would say that they were sure It was a statesmanlike docu ment, though they could not go Into detail. Democratic leaders tin the oth er hand admitted not having read It and declined to discuss It either In a spirit of fairness or otherwise. The president's message. If put Into the type used h hook pub lishers, would make a novel of the ordinary sixty-cent size. That Is not to say that It would be so Inter esting as a novel. Hut when the members of house ana senate, ami tho people of Jhe nation hao tin loaded uion them suddenly an ex- ecutlve document of these dimen sions", It Is etpially hard for the pub lic men to t xprcss an opinion con cerning It, and for tho people to form an opinion about It. A distinguished senator of the I'nlled States weighing one of these pamphlets In his hand, said today, 'Time was when the president could express himself In not more than five thousand words. This time it is easily thirty thousand words. Is the burden on the president or on the people?" To be fair the burtlen Is somewhat on the president. As long as the president shall remain the chief iHilltlclau of the nation, the lead er of his own partisan organization, so long he must make certain prom ises. He must say to newspaper pub lishers desirous of having the tariff on wood pulp reduced that ho will urge It. What easier way than to put, as Mr. Roosevelt has, a per functory paragraph of t Ight Hues twp hundred words Into a document of slxtythree pages, of over four hundred words to the ago. The news paper publishers who called upon Mr. Roosevelt must shout with Joy when they read tho magnificent re sult of their visit to him and his promise to them. There is an old phrase about "tho nigger In the woodpile," this being a matter bear ing upon woodpiles and wood pulp, seems to Justify the use of the metaphor. Mr. Roosevelt thinks, 'there should be no tariff on wood pulp.due notice of the change being of course given to those engaged In the business so at to enable them to adjust themselves to the new con ditions. Tho repeal of the duty on wood pulp should, if jioslble, bu accompanied by an agreement with Canada that there shall be no ex port duty on Canadian pulp wood." If the committee of distinguished publishers who visited the white house and came away confident of presidential support, can get any comfort out of that, they are more credulous than the bumpkin who expected to get blood from a turnip Tho notice to the American manu facturcrs and an agreement with Canada will remilro more time than tho present congress will have at Its dlsjiosal. The President and Tariff. Of course tho country thinks a little bit about the tariff. Naturally the president lias to say something about It. One would think that In the slxty-threti pages of his message at least ono pago might bo given to this subject. Ab a matter of fact txarco half n pago was given, and tho presidential discussion of this subject Is purely platitudinous ex cept for one .inragraph, "The sub ject cannot with wisdom be dealt with In the year preceding a prosl. dentlal olectlon, because as a mat ter of fact experience has conclu sively shown that at such a time It Is Imposslblo to get men to treat It from tho standpoint of the public good. In my Judgment tho wise tlmn to deal with tho matter Is Immedi ately after such election." Unless history Is misread, this Is tho first tlmo that a president has proclaimed himself a politician. Mr. Itoosovolt sets aside the tariff Issue In ortler that the fortunes of his lurty may not bo Impaired. What promises Is there that after tho elec tion his party will touch tho tariff In any way advantageous to the people. Mr. lloosevelt, Mr. Cannon, Mr. Dalzell, all he high prophets and saints of the republican lurty ha for years been preaching that when the tariff Is to bo revised, It Is to bo revised by Its friends. Its friends are now In jiowor. They have tho president, tho vice presi dent and tho house, why not revise It now? If they defer there Is grave danger that It may bo lotlsott by Its enemies. Why does tho president himself ami tho speaker, who Is sec ond only In kjwit to the president, poMnm the Inevitable revision un til tho moment, when as the whole country believes, the friends of the robber tariff will he in the mi nority? Mr. Bryan's Latest Visit. The friends of Mr. Ilryan. and thoy am mulllltldltious. would have been Interested In tho uuolllclal re ception which ho received in Wash ington on his return to the capital early this wet Is. I sat with him for more than three hours In the marble room of the senate and every democratic senator on the floor c.uno out to shake his hand and to con sult with him upon democratic poll cles. The day define he lunched with lion. John Sharp Williams, lead er of the democracy In the house. The next day ho breakfasted with Senator W. J. Stone of Missouri. It Is the common concensus of opinion among public men In Wash ington that there never has been so much unity among tho democrats In public life as t inlay. Not necessarily that their unison Is absolutely for Mr. Ilryan as a candi date, rather they are united In support of tilt! principles which he. advocates, and respect for 111. 4 as a man. Ills reception In Washington has been marked by a degree of en thusiasm not really known since the days of 1S9G. If there Ls any an tagonism to him here. It Is an un dercurrent so far under that It would take one of the diamond drills used in digging an artesian well to discover It Aiouni the capital they were point ing today to the double-leaded edit orial ogf e Umlsvlllu Courier-Journal of November 2th, In which at last after capering long outside the reservation, Col. Watterson declares his adhchlon to the democracy of Ilryan and to Ilryan himself. The editorial Is too long to reproduce hero, but I hummnrlzo It. If there Is a challenge to ho read between the lines, the democracy of today will accept that challenge: "It may 'be that the old democracy of strict construction has passed from tho scene never to return, and that a new democracy" very latl tudlnous In Its methods and Its alms has arrived upon the stae to stay. In the latter event It cannot be doubted that Mr. Ilryan Is Its proph et. He will surely bo In tho next presidential campaign Its leader, and so, going back to the midsummer of last year, wn recall tho acclaim with which wt! welcomed his home coming, and In perfect good faith wo repeat: 'Hurrah for' Ilryan!' " We hope In W0S that we shall have to make no discounts as to the platform. As to Mr. Ilryan personally, he Is wholly agreeable tmd aceptable to us, ami It will cost us not tho least sacrifice of feeding to labor for his election, It cannot be denied that Mr. Ilryan has made a steadfast fight, that ho ls a clean typical American, that his following Is compact and en thuslastlc, and that even among tho masses of the republicans he is well considered and well liked, all of which may bo set down as so many political assets at a time when tho public mind Is so unfixed ami va rlable, party lines and discipline so loose, and the popular mood and tense to Impressionable, "Tho practical and sensible thing for dotnocrats to do now Is to close ranks and tfej tftep to the drum heats of destine which announce tho third coming of the man from Nebraska. It Is Idle further to dls jiuto his leadership. The Courier-Journal has In the past had no reserves and has done Its duty as It taw It. As to tho future, casting never a lingering look 'behind, it will do Its hornswaggledest " 'Angels can do no more.' " To those who know tho style, this Is from tho pen of Marse Henry Watterson. "Ono blabl his bugle horn Is worth a thousand men."
