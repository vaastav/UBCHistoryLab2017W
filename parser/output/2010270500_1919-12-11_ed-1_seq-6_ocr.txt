BUDGET SYSTEM IS URGED Necessity of Increased Production to Help Decrease Cost of Living Imperative Need of Definite Program Concerning La"bor. Washington, Dec. 2. President Wll son'H message, which was read to both houses of congress today, only Inci dentally mentioned tho pcaco treaty, blaming tho delay In ratification as one of the causes of nation-wide un rest. Tho president said: I hope that congress will bring to a conclusion at this (tension leglilatlon look ing to thu establishment of a. budget sys tem. That thero should bo ono slnglo au thority rcsponslblo for the making of all nppropilatlons and that appropriations should be made not Independently of each other but with rofercnpo to ono slnglo comprehensive plan of expenditure prop erly related to the nation's Income thoro can be no doubt. I belluvo tho burden of preparing the budget must, In the natura of the case, If tho work Is to bo properly done and responsibility concentrated In stead of divided, rest upon the executive The budget so prepared should be sub mitted to and approved or amended by n single committee of each house of con gress, and no single appropriation should be made by the congress, except such as may have been Included in tho budget prepared by the executive or added by th particular committee of congress charged with tho budget legislation. Another and not less Important aspect of tho problem Is the ascertainment of the economy and efficiency with which the moneys appropriated are expended. Under existing law the only audit Is for the purpose of ascertaining whether ex penditures have been lawfully mado with in the appropriations. No one Is author ized or equipped to ascertain whether the monoy has been spent wisely, eco nomically nnd effectively. Taxation Question Taken Up. I trust that the congress will give Its Imtncdlato consideration to tho problem of future taxation. Simplification of tho incomo und profits taxes has bocomo an lmmadiate necessity. Those taxes per formed Indispensable service during tho war. They must, however, be simplified,. not oniy to save tne taxpayer inconven ience and oxpenso, but In order that his liability may be made certain and definite. With reference to tho dotalls of the revenue law, tho secretary of tho treas ury and tho commissioner of internal rev enue will lay before you for your consid eration certain amendments nocessary or desirable In connection with tho aumlnls tratlon ot the law rocommondatlons which have my UDDroval and sutmart It Is of the utmost Importance that In dealing with this matter the presont law should not bo disturbed so far as regards taxes for tho calendar year 1!0, payable In tho calendar year 1921. Tho congress might well consider whether the higher rates of Income and profits taxes can In peace times be effectively productive of revenue and whother thoy may not, on tho contrary, be destructive ot business activity and productive ot waste and In efficiency. There Is a point at which In peace times high rates of Incomo and profits taxes discourage energy, remove tho Incentive to new enterprise encourage extravagant expenditures und produce Industrial stug. nation with consequent unemployment am) other, attendant ovllii. The messugo then discussed the fa Torablo balauco of trade and tho need of adjusting our economic life to tho changed conditions and of abandon ing the policy of Isolation. In tho matter of recognition and relief for returned soldiers tho president re puted the recommendations In his last message. Ho also urged tariff revision to protect our chemical und dyostuff Industries. He continued: Farmers Are Praised. During the war tho farmer per formed a vital and willing service to the nation. By materially Increasing the production ot his land, he supplied America and the allies with the In creased amounts of food necessary to keep their Immense armies In tho field. 11 indispensably helped to win tho war. But there Is now scarcely leas need of Increasing the production In food and the necessaries ot Ufa. I ask the congress to consider means of en couraging effort along those linos. The Importance of dolnr everything possible to promote production along economical llnosi to lmprovo marketing and to make rural life moro attractive and healthful, Is obvious. I would urge approval of the plans already proposed to the congrcus by the secretary of ag rloulturo, to secure the essential facts required for the proper study of this qusstlon, through the proposed en Urged programs for farm management studies and crop ostlmates. I would urge, also, the continuance ot fedoral participation In the building of good roads, under tho torros ot ex isting law and under the direction of present agencies; the need of further action on the part ot the states and the federal government to preserve and develop our forest resources, especially inrougn tne practice or better forestry methods on private holdings and the extension of the publicly owned for ests: better support for country schools and the more definite direction of their courses ot atudy along lines relatod to rural problems; and fuller provision for sanitation In rural districts nnd the building up ot needed hospital and medical facilities Blames Government for Unrest. 1 would call your attention to the widespread condition of political rest lessness In our body politic. The causes of this unrest, while vorlous and complicated, are superficial rather than deep seated. Uroadly, they arise 

HOME OF THE CIRCUS. A school teacher was reading an ex citing story to her group of young sters about tho Jungle. In order that each child might understand clearly what tho story was about, she B?ld: "Which ono of you can toll me what the Junglo Is?" Ono bright Uttlo boy waved his hand In tho air and tho teacher told him to give his definition. Lie stood up before tho class with a great deal .of Importance and Bald: "The Jungle l whero the circus lives." from or are connected with the failure on the part of our government to ar rive speedily at a Just and permanent peace permitting return to normal con ditions, from the transfusion of radical theories from seething European centers pending such delay, from heartless profiteering resulting In the Increase of the cost of living, and, lastly, from the machinations of passionate and malev olent agitators.' With the return to normal conditions, this unrest will rap Idly disappear. In the meantlmo It docs much evil. It seems to mo that In dealing with this situation congress should not h! Impatient or drastic, but should seek, rather, to remove the causes. It should endeavor to bring our country back speedily, to-a. peace basis, with ameli orated living conditions under the min imum of restrictions upon personal lib erty that Is consistent with our recon struction problems. And It should arm the federal govornment with power to deal In Its criminal courts with those persons who by violent methods would abrogate our time-tested Institutions. With the free expression of opinion and with tho advocacy of orderly polit ical change, however fundamental, thoro must bo no Interference, hut to ward passion and malevolence tending to Incite crime and Insurrection undor guise of political evolution thero should be no leniency. Should Extend Food Control, I renow and strongly urge tho neces sity of tho extonston of tho present food-control act as to tho period of time In which It shall remain In opera tion. Tho attorney general has sub mitted a bill providing for an exten sion of this net for a period of' six moriths. As It now stands It Is limited In operation to tho period of tho war and becomes inoperative upon tho formul proclamation of pence. It Is Impor.-xtlve that It should be extended nt once. Tho department of Justice has built up extcnslvo machinery for the purposo of enforcing Its provisions; all of which must he abandoned upon the conclusion of peace unless the provi sions of this act are extended. During this period tho congress will havo an opportunity to mako similar, permanent provisions and regulations with regard to all goods destined for Intorstato commerce and to exclude them from Interstate shipment, If the ronulrements of tho law aro not com piled with. Somo such regulation Is imperatively necessary. The abuses that have grown up In tho manipula tion of prices by the withholding of foodstuffs and other necessaries of life cannot otherwise be effectively pre vented. There can bo no doubt of either tho necessity or the legitimacy of such measures. The president renewed his recom mendations that n law be passed reg ulating cold storage and that nil goods destined for Interstate com merco should be marked with the price nt which they left the hands of the producer. Ho also urged the fed eral licensing of corporations engag ing In Interstate commerce. Coming to tho question of labor, the message said : Labor and Capital Peace Renewed. No ono who has observed the march of events in the last year can fall to note the absolute need ot definite program to bring about an improvement In .the condition of labor. Thero can be no set tled conditions leading to Increased pro duction and a reduction In the cost ot living If labor and capital are to be an tagonists Instead ot partners. Sound thinking and an honest desire to servo tho Interests of the whole na tion, as distinguished from the Interests of a class, must be applied to the solu tion of this great and pressing problem. The failure of other nations to consider this matter In a vigorous way has pro duced bitterness and Jealousies and an tagonisms, the food of radicalism. Tho only way to keep men from agitating against grievances Is to remove the griev ances. An unwillingness even to discuss these matters produces only dissatisfac tion and gives comfort to the extreme elemonts In our country, which endeavor to stir up disturbance In order to provoko governments to embark upon a course of retaliation and repression. The. seed ot revolution Is repression. The remedy for these things must not bo negative In character. It must.be con structive. It must comprehend the gen eral Interest, Tho real antidote for the unrest which manifests Itself Is not sup pression but a deep consideration of the wrongs that beset our national life and the application of a remedy, Eight-Hour Day la Big Step. Congress has already shown Its will ingness to deal with these industrial wrongs by establishing the eight-hour day as the standard In every field ot labor. It has sought to find a way to prevent child labor. It has served the whole country by leading the way In de veloping the means ot preserving and safeguarding Uvea and health in danger ous Industries. It must now help In the difficult task of finding a method that will bring about & genuine demonstration of Industry, based upon tne full recognition ot the right ot those who work, In what ever rank, to participate In some organlo way In every decision which directly af fects their welfare. It Is with this purpose In mind that I called a conference to meet In Washing ton on December 1 to consider these prob lems In all their broad aspects, with the Idea of bringing about a better under standing betwoen these two Interests. Rights of Labor Are Cited. The great unrest throughout the world, out of which has emerged a demand for an Immediate consideration of the diffi culties between capital and labor, bids us put our own house In order. Frankly, there can be no permanent and lasting settlements between capital and labor whloh do not recognize the fundamental concepts for which labor has been strug gling through the years. The whole world gave Its recognition and Indorse ment to these fundamental purposes In the League of Nations. To analyze the particulars In the de mands ot labor Is to admit the Justice of their complaint In many matters that lie at their basis. The workman demands an adequate wage, sufficient to permit him to live In comfort, unhampered by the fear of poverty and want In his old ace. II demands the right to live and the right to work amidst sanitary sur roundings, both In homo and in workshop, surroundings that develop and do not re tard his own health and well-being; and the right to provide for his children's wants In the matter of health and educa. tlon. In other words, It Is his desire to make the conditions of his life and the
