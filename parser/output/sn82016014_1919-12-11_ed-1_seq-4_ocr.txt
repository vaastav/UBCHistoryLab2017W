Easkln; L'iector, Washing ton. r. C. Senator Curtis has taken a firm atand against the setting; up of a num ber of boards and commissions, as pro vided In the railroad bills, now pend ing In congress. His attitude probably will be approved by a large majority of his constituents. The senator holds, quita properly, that the in erests of the government, the public and the em ployes and owners of the roads can be handled as well by one commission as by half a dozen, to say nothing of the saving1 of money and time.- While the Interstate commerce commission has made a mess of the transportation business in the past. It la by no means certain that another commission, or several commissions," would do any better. It Is a case in which it may be better to bear the ills we have than fly to others we know not of. The tendency in the states recently has been toward a reduction in the num ber of boards thru .elimination and consolidation. The provisions of tbe pending; railroad bills have the appear ance of a move- backward. The silver lining in the coal strike cloud may not appear nntil the flat dweller who owns a piano begins to break it up for fuel. Isn't it about time for the Mexicans, either to kidnaip or arrest Jenkins again? Their dealings with the United States probably afford them almost as much amusement as a bull fight. An other prod of the bull seems due. Gold has become a drug on the market. It no longer pays to dig 3.22 grains of gold out of the ground for a dollar, and that Is all the miner can get for it, so he has quit and gone Into other business where he can charge more and get it. Contrasting the manner In which Carranza has permitted Americans to be murdered, robbed, and outraged, with tha celerity with which a British citizen wa let loose upon a peremp tory demand from the British govern ment, the parallel speaks volumes in condemnation of the policy of the ad ministration. The. Mexican situation promises to be an Issue In the ap proaching political campaign over shadowing even the League of Nations. President Wilson la opposed to start ing anything In Mexico. Evidently he wants to be off with the old war be fore being on with the new. Probably the coal strike will be the last big walkoat by labor for a long time. Recent lessons must have taught workers the truth that strikes do not pay. Reports by the bureau of labor statistics show something of the magnitude of this disturbance of in dustry. During the months of April. May and June last, the building trades led the list in the number of strikes, furnishing 200 out of a total of 974 of these activities. Metal trades were next with 1 7 strikes, while textiles and clothing furnished 78 and 57 re spectively. Lumber and timber added It to the list. Unfortunately for the Interest of all the people, one phase of our industrial or labor problem is being threshed out to the practical exclusion of all others. This Is the share to be allotted to la bor out cf the Income resulting from productive effort- Included in this struggle is the -question of wages, hours of toll, working conditions, par ticipation in profits and management, and other features affecting produc tion. The question of the distribution of Income Is not the most Important, one that faces us today. The big prob lem, the proper solution of which lone can save the world from the rlims of wretchedness, is production. It may be good strategy from the standpoint of class egoism to fight for wage Increases while employers are struggling with desperation to turn out good's they have agreed lo deliver, when demand is keen and .competent help is .scarce. The threat of a strike is bound to carry- weight when a manufacturer is booked months ahead, when he knows that frantic buyers place primary consideration on the question of delivery. Demands that reach the extreme of uneconomic ab surdity may be granted in, whole or in part under such conditions. But labor gains little or nothing by such tactics. The reaction upon the general public contains the elements of tragedy. good piece op wonx. ,The news-criticism of the police de partment In The State Journal Tues day evening, calling attention to the many "punch board" gambling devices operating in the city despite the gov erning city ordinances, brings to mind the fact that It is only human to criti cise and not commend. The so-called, "punch boards" are in violation of the ordinances, to be sure, but It must be admitted that if the police are out hunting thieves, bandit and other criminals end have found it necessary to neglect petty gambling devices, the department is ridding the city of a much greater evil. In the same spirit "Wf calling atten tion to the lottery The State Journal gladly offers a somewhat tardy com mendation to the police department for the capture of the man who made the sensational ,10,000 theft from the National hotel. This newspaper has been responsi ble for many severe comments on ac tions of the police department of the present and former city administra tions. On this account The State Jour nal wants to play strictly fair and be generous with commendations when Chief Hannan deserves them. The coal miners staged their strike November 1 In the belief that they could win quickly by freezing the peo ple. They were mistaken. If they had struck last spring they might have succeeded. At that time they only would have tied up the industries of the country. Coal operators then had many contracts outstanding, to furnish coal regardless of strikes. They would have granted the miners' de mands and charged sthe costs up to the unprotected industries, which would have passed them on to their customers. In ther efforts to make success doubly certain, the miners failed and brought not only their or ganisation, but labor unions generally, into bad repute. Strikes never again will be won so easily as they have been In the past. i " CAN WE 

HAVE PEACE? There are Indications that Governor Allen will recommend to the legisla ture, at the special session, which he has called, the enactment of a law establishing a court of industrial re lations. This is something that has been uaged by The State Journal as a possible reme ly for existing conditions in the industrial field. A workable law must apply impar tially to both employer and employe. The court should be empowered to en force the fulfillment of contracts be tween labor and capital, just as other contracts are enforced. Either party should have the right to bring the other before the court when a dispute arises. When a case arising under the law has been adjudicated, the court must have the power to enforce its decree. Refusal to obey the court's mandate must be subject to punish ment by fine, imprisonment or both, to be imposed on those responsible for such refusal. There wlll remain the possibility that large bodies of men will refuse to work in obedience to the court's order as in the case of the coal min ers. In such case the leaders and the treasury of their organization must pav thepenalty. On the other hand, employers may decide to close their plants rather than obey the order of the court. In ad dition to being punished for contempt, they can be made to turn their prop erty over toa'receiver who will keep it in operation, until they change their minds. This program, or any other along similar lines, may fail to work satis factorily, but something of the sort seems worth a trial. But a disposition on the part of em ployer and employe, to deal squarely with each other, will do more to bring about industrial peace than all the laws that can be placed on the statute book. The time has arrived when the public is about to Insist on its own protection, and if either labor or cap ital find Itself In a worse position than before, it has only Itself to blame. Congressman Kelley, of Michigan, i has introduced a bill intended to make more effectual the curbing of Red activities.' It provides additional pen alties for conspiring to overthrow the government by imposing a fine of $5,000 upon conviction, or imprison ment -not to exceed five years, or both. After the expiration of sentence aliens are to be deported. Th annual report of the department of labor, submitted to congress on the opening day of the new session, discloses the fact that out of 697 radical aliens arrested during the last two years on deportat.on war rants, only sixy were actually sent back across -he ocean. These figures do not include the recent arre-ts In organized raids thruout the country. But what would be the object in keep ing a Red shut up in jail five years at an expense to the taxpayers? And w here would one of them get 15.000? If TresiVnt Wilson finally decides to encage this country In a war with Mexico, he cannot say that the United States senate pushed him in. TOPEKA STATE JOURNAL - Information Bureau FREDERIC J. BASKIN. Director. Washington, D. C. PRESIDENTIAL: SPECIFICATIONS. Washington, D. C Dec. 8. What ! has become of that seventh son of a seventh son who can always tell you a year ahead who is going 'to be the next president? He is gone, along with the politi cal logic upon which he based his Judgment. It used to be argue-1 hot because a man lived in .Ohio, had an Irish grandmother, fought In the Civil war, and hud never stated a definite pinion avbout anything, he was un beatable. And often he was. The presidential virtues for a Ions time, were chiefly negative. of course, very early In "our history we had some remarkable presidents. In ihat day we had an intellectual aris tocracy. It led us to .success in the revolutionary war, and furnished our political leaders for a generation or so afterward. Of this crew were Washmg'tn, Adams and Jefferson. Hut with tho growth of the demo cratic Idea came the demagogue, and the mediocrity in the presidential chair. The rugged figure of Jackson sta-nd.s out a great demagogue but a demagogue none the lens Admirable ir. hie, courage but terrible -n his ?g-noi-mce. Then came the Civil vxr, stranui-ly produrlng its own genius in Lincol!!, a being unaccountable and unty.Hv After the Civil war, our strange na tional sport of presidential politics reach sd its highest development. Presidential candidates were nothing but pawns used by the great parties in the game which they .played for the stakes of office and power. Men were chosen because they were "safe." Mediocrity was a prime qualification. A man with a marked personality, marked achievement or marked in any other way was not wanted. That a brilliant individuality like that of Cleveland reached the presidency in spite of this system was an accident which politicians deplored. It is only in the last gei1 ?ratlrn that the presidency has been rescued from mediocrity. President Roosevelt taught' the people to regard the pres ident as their personal representative, and not merely as the mouthpiece of a political party, and of the interests which dominate it. Mr. Wilson has carried this idea of the president as the official interpreter of the public still further. Both of them have shown that there is still room in the presidency for a real personality. Another thing which has perished recently is political oratory of the old spread-eagle and sentimor.tal school. It is still practiced in the south to some extent, and in back counties generally; but it is no longer, as it once was, a presidential sine qua non. Nc man is going to win the presidency this time on the strength of his perorations. Who will get the nomination is a mys tery, but certainly neither of them will be captured by a "cross of gold and crown of thorns" speech. Thus,, while it is hard to pick the individual who will be the next presi dent, it is not hard to pick the type. The man will not be a professional politician, a mediocrity foisted on the public by his fellow professionals. It will not make so much difference where he lives. A record of public office will not help him much, but a record of practical achievement will help him a great deal. And he will not be a sentimentalist, a tear squeez er, one who weeps and bellows and waves the riag. The type of the next president is well represented In the leading candidates, and men men tioned in connection with the candi dacy. Two of these men are especial ly significant. Hoover and McAdoo. Perhaps neither of them will even run. but the mere fact that these two have been widely mentioned for the presi dency, and have been more or less ac cepted by the people as men of a type who. might make good presidents. Is iremenaousiy significant. It is claimed of McAdoo that he has a brilliant rec ord as a political executive, but Hoov er has been in no way associated with politics. The fact that a Hoover of unknown politics had' even been mentioned for the presidency is striking proof that the public mind of the United States has changed. Twenty-five years ago, when a Prince Albert coat and a Wide black hat, and the ability to thunder out platitudes n a baritone voice were almost essentials of political success. Hoover would have been as out of place in politics as a bricklayer in a cabaret. Here is a man who has wealth and cares nothing for the ma terial success involved; who shows no slightest craving for publicity for its own sake; who does not seem to rep resent a class or a. point of view; who has nothing to recommend him for the job except a capacity for handling large enterprises and an integrity that seems not to be questioned by anyone. Me is a stranger in our political arena, and ehe fact that we allow him to be there at all is proof that we are chang ing. ' In the forefront of Republican can didates stands Gen. Leonard Wood, of another type, but none the" less quite different from the candidate Drand of the pasti His campaign is not being made on the basis of his helm? a mili tary hero but upon the claim that he is a proven executive, a man who gets things done. The American president for the next four years will find his task logically dividing itself Into two Kreat respon sibilites that of meeting the- indus trial situation at home, and of giving America its proper international posi tion in a re-made world. The indus trial situation at home is a matter of primary interest to the public. It is i The George Matthew Adams 

DIGXITT. There will always be something pe culiarly fine about . the worker or thinker who plants a certain dignity underneath all that he-does. To be dignified just as a pose or as a matter of fact, is to defeat the rea son for dignity. For dignjty must accompany a personality- man or woman who has deserved well of life. Not to hold dig nity as a great asset is to belittle one's personality and cast a shadow upen worth. The one who feels responsibility is always accompanied by a wplendld dignity. But to be dignified is not to be snob affecting every man, woman and" child because It has to do with the dally supply of food and clothing for each and everyone.1 Upon the handling of that situation depend such issues as the pYesence of fire in the grate, the oneration of the transportation .-facili- Fties of the nation, the chance of the Individual to work that his children may live the very continuance of the government itself. . And thin is not the onlyf problem. The shelves of the world are empty World industry has .been paralyzed for half a decade, and will be sorely handicapped -for years to come. The -United States, of all nations, has emerged from the war with enormous industrial capacities, and with un limited financial resources. For her the door of opportunity is wide open, and for her there Is no bar to entrance. Whether or not she makes the best of this, her golden day for gaining a trade foothold in the marts of-the world, will depend largely upon the administration of her affairs .for the next four years. " The public is coming to an appre ciation of these vital facts. The friends one meets' at home, the men he talks to on railroad trains, the edi torials he reads in newspapers, cause him to realize that there is a knowl edge abroad in the land of the respon sibilities that will rest upon the next chief executive. Old fashioned poli tics are in eclipse. The old issues be tween the . parties do not hold good. Where the Democrats were accus tomed to so deport themselves as to ne regarded as the party particularly friendly to organized labor, they are today arrayed in a titanic contest with certain groups of that element.' While the Republicans were of old the party of expansion, the party that favored America's stepping boldly forth and assuming its share of world influence and world responsibility, they are today the party advocating the doctrine of magnificent isolation. The old issues are turned topsy turvy. There are no new ones to take their place. Both parties promise to write platforms based largely on American ism and differing little. So the situation is developing In such a way that the candidate is the matter of dominating interest.' The parties-are following the publio in their expression of desire to find just the right sort of man to handle the big Job ahead. . Questions Answers Q.
