The discussion in regard to tho pro posed amalgamation of East Chicago and Hammond seems to be generally in favor of the idea, but it never goes very far before the question arises as to what the now city should be called. In Hammond there are a number of "old residents who cling to the old name of Hammond for sentimental reasons, but the thousands who have come into the city in recent years do not seem to care much what it is called so long as it Is given an entirely new name. In East Chicago and Indiana Harbor the consensus of opinion seems to be that any good name would do so long as the amalgamated cities are not called Hammond. Tho citizens of the thriving neighboring towns are anxious to go into partnership with this city, but they are a little sensitive about hav ing but ono name appear when there are three actlvo members of the firm. It would bo rather clumsy to call the new city Hammond. East Chicago, Indiana Harbor and company, and so the bust way out of the difficulty seems to be to give tho towns an entirely Hew name. Hammond has lived down a rather unenviable past In a way that is a credit to her citizens, but there is still a stigma attacked to tho word Ham mond that is suggestive of dog fights, prize fights, Robys, and Pullman strikes and some of the other things that hap pened here when Hammond was sowing its wild oats. Go to some other large city or even to Chicago and tell the people that you ara from Hammond and a smile will immediately illuminate their faces as they remark, "Oh yes, its near Roby and that was where they had all of that trouble during the big strike In '93. In spite of Hammond's good behavior during the past few years, and in spite of the splendid progress that has been made It Is still known as a lawless city. There is no question that amal gamation would be a good thing for all three of the cities concerned and it is believed that the people of Hammond are too broad minded to allow a matter of sentiment to Interfere with plans that will result In taking such a long Etep forward. It has been suggested that the amal gamated cities be called Lake City, which would be brief and an appropri ate name but perhaps if the people of all three of the cities get together they can hit upon a name that will be not only appropriate, but will be original and distinctive enough to be worthy of the great Industrial community for which it will stand. 

WITH THEEDITORS. Crumpnoker and the Subsidy. It must be much satisfaction to the people of the Tenth congressional dis trict to note the respect shown Rep resentatlvo Crumpacker in the house and his plan for a subsidy measure. He has had a most conspicuous part In the deliberations of the house and his plan for a subsidy has the endorse ment of the Indiana delegation. The Hoosler representatives have been on their guard against any njeasure that contemplates bonuses to the vessels of the shipping trust. The big steamship companies of the United States have evinced an interest In the subsidy ques tion that can't be explained altogether on the ground of loyalty to American interests. The last session of con gress passed a measure from which it was believed all special and question able benefits had been eliminated. The senate, however, passed a measure that struck the middle west as unfair in the favor icrayated the steamshio compa- nles. This session of congress convened with all republican senators and repre sentatives desirous of doing something to build up the merchant marine. But many contend that the encouragement should not be given if it swells the profits of the corporations. When the Indiana delegation met to consider the question, Mr. Crumpacker came for ward with a suggestion that met their approval. Lafayette Journal. Chaln Letters Illegal. Chain letters are illegal. If our readers receive begging letters on be half of a "little cripple boy," with a request that they copy them and mail to several friends, we advise them to report to the postomce Inspectors, through their local postmaster. Such letters are fraudulent. Northwestern Agriculturist. The London (Ontario) Advertiser in speaking of the president's message, eays: "The one passage in the address hich jars on British and Canadian w feelings is that wherein he charts anadians and Japanese with inhu mane destruction of fur seals. He omplains that the American govern ment has been trying in vain to secme from Great Britain 'such revision and modification of the regulations" as were provided for by the award of the Behr- lng Sea tribunal. Canadian authorities deny the Impeachment of pelagic seal ing, and decline to forego their legal rights in the Behring Sea seal lisherles in the interest of an American trut." THE 

FEDERAL COURT BILL. The fight for a reorganization of the federal court system of Indiana is soon to begin again. As a matter of course South Bend is much interested in the movement, because South Bend is vitally concerned. Indianapolis Is heartily opposed to the proposition be cause If tho reorganization plan should be effected the capital city would lose its "corner' 'on federal court business. South Bend, Fort Wayne, Hammond, Terre Haute, New Albany and Evans vllle would be only getting their just deserts should the proposed bill pass. The cities named are not prompted by selfish motives. They are only stand ing for what seems to be their rights. Why people with federal court busi ness should be compelled to go to In dianapolis to transact that business is a matter hard to understand, unless one happens to reside In that ctiy. From appearances most everybody in Indianapolis knows why, and In the majority of instancoa the answer would be 'because," were they forced to tell. All Indiana is proud of its capital city. but all Indiana does not care to be "worked" by the capital city. South Bend Tribune. INDEPENDENT VINDICATED. Sol Hathaway, editor of the Indian apolis Independent, calls attention to the fact that Guy Van Tassel and Charles Hansen, the criminals who re cently came into notoriety at Ham mond and other places In Indiana, are paroled prisoners. Mr. Hathaway is vigorously opposed to the Indetermin ate sentence law, as he believes that it is an encouragement toward crime and that it is the cause of the state being over-run with criminals. Recent oc currences have at least partially vindi cated Mr. Hathaway's position concern ing this matter. Goshen Democrat. BUYING GOLD BRICKS. The Brazil Democrat gives this time ly advice to its readers: "All the Sunday papers are full of swindling schemes which they run as advertising matter for big pay, but which there is not the least doubt are gross grafting games pure and simple. These tricks to obtain the money of the unwary are not confined to oil stock, gold mining stock or gas stock, but now the latest is a diamond mine that holds out Its fatuous hands and appeals to the man or woman who has a little money saved up against old age or a rainy day, to part with their little all and exchange it for paper at ten cents a "sharo." The advice of the Democrat Is to let all these swindles alone." L Between Trains How Much are Eggsf' "What are eggs a dozen today," a lady asked at the grocer's. "Two more for twenty-four cents," said the grocer, "would make them two cents per dozen less." "Then," said the lady, "I will take twenty-four cents' worth." How many eggs did she buy? Cin cinnati Inqurer. RECOMPENSE. "We members of the upper house have to take lots of chaff," remarked Senator Graball. "That's so," responded Senator Klutch, "but we also manage to pick up a few kernels of wheat, occasionally, eh, boy." Louisville Courier-Journal. A WARNING BY WIRE. While Wilbur Nesblt was finishing Ms humorous novel. "The Gentleman Ragman," he was spending a few weeks In a country town In Indiana. He had sent nearly all of the revised manu script to his publishers, but certain details of the completion of the plot had been the subject of discussion be tween himself and a friend connected with the publishing house. One day a telegram for Nesblt was received at the village telegraph office It read: "What are you going to do about Annie Davis and Finkney Sanger?" Annie is the heroine of "The Gentle man Ragman"; Finkney la the villain. if there is one In the book. The local telegraph operator personally deliver ed the message and Nesblt wrote this reply: "Will marry Annie Davis and shoot Finkney Sanger as soon as I return to Chicago. The operator stared at Nesblt won dering!)' when he read the message, but Nesblt did not fathom that stare until the morning when he took the train home, when the village marshal stepped up to him and said, meaningly: "Mr. Nesblt, I would, advise you as an officer of the law, sir, not to do anything- rash' when, you get to Chi caso." THEATRICAL NOTES. "In Old Kentucky." Again the bills are up for "In Old Kentucky" a welcome sight to the average playgoer, young and old, who likes a real good, American play, full of action and dash and abounding in everything that appeals to the manhood and womanhood of the American peo ple. The story told "In Old Kentucky" Is comparatively a simple one but it is told in a stirring way. The types rep resented by the characters are interest ing as well as human, and what is mure important, the appeal to the heart Is direct and true all through the play. One is not asked to sympathize with any one whose character la improperly sketched by the playwright. The hero is a manly Kentuckian. the heroine a girl of llesh and blood, a product of nature untrammelled, a Mushing bud on a wild rose bush, in whose love af fairs you have to be Interested, wheth er you will or not. Then there is the pickaninny contingent. They form an essential element in the story and are not an added feature to help out the interest. These comical little darkies can sing, dance, play musical instru ments, whirl batons and do about everything that the "grown-ups" can do. They seem to put real zest into their stage work. The production for tills season's tour of "In Old Kentucky" has been gotten up entirely anew by one of New York's foremost scenic art ists and the company engaged will be found in many respects the superior of any that has ever been seen in the piece. "In Old Kentucky' has entered on Its fourteenth season fresher, bright er and better than ever before. Like Lord Tennyson's celebrated brook, it bids fair to go on forever. It will be at Towle's Sunday, Dec. 10. ALL CATS GIVEN SALUTE. For S5 Years Soldiers in India Paid Honors to Pussy. In Poona, at t!ie government house for more than a quarter of a century. every cat which passed out of the front door at dark was saluted by the sentry, who presented srrns to the ter rified pussy. It seems that in 1S38 Sir Robert Grant, governor of Bombay, died in the government house, Poona. and on the evening of the day of his death a cat was seen to leave the house by the front door and to walk up and down a particular path precisely as the late governor had been used to do after sunset. A Hindu sentry observed and re ported this to the sepoys of his faith, and they laid the matter before a priest, who explained to them the mys tery of the dogma of the transmigra tion of souls. "In this cat," he said, "was reincar nated the soul of the deceased Gov. Grant, and It should, therefore, be treated with the military honors due to his excellency." As, however, the original sentrv could not identify the particular cat he had seen on the evening of the day or bir Robert's death, it was decided that every cat which uassed out of the main entrance after dark should be saluted as the avatar of his excellen cy. Thus, for over a quarter of a cen tury, every cat that passed out after sunset had military honors paid to it, not by Hindu sentinels onlv. hut such is the infection of a superstition oy Mahommetan. native Christian and even Jewish soldiers. Smith China Post. TELL STORY OF CIVILIZATION. This Is Declared to Be the Function of the Museums. The aim and the methods of art mu seums ,as well as other phases of life, have felt the vitalizing touch of that spirit of human sympathy, of recogni tion of mutual responsibility and wish for human helpfulness, whose rapid growth and onward speed have been one of the marked features of the last quarter-century, says the Crafts man. It has not been so very long since a museum was something quite apart from the dally life of the peo ple, a place in wThich were kept things beautiful or interesting, whither one might go on an idle half day, as upon a pilgrimage. But now the mu seums are being humanized, made a beneficent party of everyday life, so organized and related to man's activ ities that they not only recount a co herent story of his aspirations toward the beautiful in past ages, but also recognize his present efforts to achieve beauty and show him how he may make other ages and other nations give him aid. And, aside from the advantages on the practical and aesthetic sides of life which are resulting from the new spirit in museum management, there Is also an important ethical influ ence. For, as people realize through museum' collections, so brought to gether and related as to make that realization easy, how the human race haa always striven to give expression to its ideas of beauty and has made that expression a part of its dally life, they get a new sense of the uni versal brotherhood of humanity. And the world advances only as mea feel and respond to the urge of that kin ship. In Japan. Japanese children begin to go to school when six years old. During the first four years they learn Japanese and Chinese; in the next four years every child has to learn English. Her Happy Married Life. A woman who recently secured a warrant against her husband in a London police court said to the judge: "I have been married 27 years, and I have had ten children and sixteen black eyes." or Latest Movements in Industrial Centers, by Exclusive NEW 

YORK LETTER. New York, Dec. 10. high rate for cull loans ing Intiuence on prices The extremely had a depress and retarded trade generally. Although the early prices from London for American rails ranged from one quarter to three quarters higher than the closing iigure here Saturday, our market started the day lower and inclined to weakness. Union and Southern 1'acilic were ex ceptionally weak, the former selling off fiom 185, tlie opening price, down to la3 9s; the latter from 93 down to i3. The continued talk of adverse legisla tion by the government against the stockholders of these two properties is causing considerable liquidation In them by the more timid holders. Heading and St. 1'aui were about the strongest of the higher railroad shares. St. Paul sold up from 1S1-';b to 182 "-a on short covering and new investment buying. Reading also scored a slight advance utter the early weakness at the opening. This issue is more or less subject to manipulation and it has ceased to be a barometer of the tenor of the market. The Frick interests support it whenever it becomes too weak and sell sufficient stock when it is strong in order to stop any wild ad vance. In the industrial group. Copper was the particular feature. It scored an advance of about a point for the day. it was surmised in the street that the Standard Oil Interests were the best buyers and that they were favorable to an advance. The metal situation could not be in better condition, the best grades of copper are bringing closu to 23 cents per pound, which is a record breaking price and means enormous earnings for the Amalgamated Copper company. Call loans opened at 23 per cent., but after the larger loans were made to carry stocks over, the rate eased off at about 10 per cent. There Is talk of assistance by the sec retary of the treasury to relieve the stringency in the money market, but as yet nothing official or dellnito has been made public. In the last hour when the call loan market declined to 6 per cent., a gen eral movement to cover shorts set in. which turned the market from weak to strong and closed the entire list at the highest prices of the day with a substantial rally in St. Paul and Read ing.
