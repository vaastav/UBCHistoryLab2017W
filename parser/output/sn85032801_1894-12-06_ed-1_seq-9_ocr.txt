Washtxgtox, Dec. 3. The following is the president's message to congress: ! Message to the coarresi of the Un ted States: The assemblage within the nations legislative halls of those charred with the duty of makln; laws for ths benefit of a sea erous and free people impre -sively surcests the exacting obll ation and Inexorable re sponsibility involved in their ta-k. At the threshold of such labDr ai w to be undertaken bythecongrefsof tha United States and in the discharge of an executive duty enjoined by the constitution, I submit this communi cation containing a brief statement of the condition of oar nitloul affiirs and recom mending such la -islation as seems to be neces sary and expedient. The history of our recent dealings with other nations and our peacaf ul relations with them at this time, additionally demon strate the advantage of consistently adheriaj to a firm but Jnst foreign pn licy, free from envious or ambitious natlornl schemes and characterized by entire honesty and sincerity. Durin? the past year, pursuant to a law of conjress, commissioners were appilntel to the Antwerp indmtrlil exposition, though the participation of American ethlbltors fell far short of comp-'etely l lustratinj our national Ingenuity and indm trial achievement', yet it was quite creiitable in view of the brief time allowed for preparation The termination of the civil war in Brazil has been followed by the general prevalence of peace and or ler It appearin at an early stase of the Insurrection that its course would call for unusual watchfulness on the part of this government our naval force in the harbor of EIo de Janeiro wis strengthened This precaution I am satisflei, tended to restrict the Usue to a simple trial of strength bet weea the Brazilian government and the ImurmH and to avert complications which at timej seemed imminent Our firm attitude of neu trality was maintained to th9 end. the In surgents received no encouragement of event ual asylum from our commanders and such oppositson as they eicountsred was for the protection of our commerce and was clearly Justified by publio law. A teriom tension of relations havia : arisen at the close of the war between Brazil and Portugal by reason of the escape ef the insurgent Admiral De gama and his followers The friendly offices of our representative to those countries were exerted for tho protection of the sub jects of either within the territory of the other Although the rovernment of Brazil was duly notified that the commercial arrangements existing between the United State and that country, based on the third section of the tariff act of 1893, was abrogaied on Au,-. 2i 1891, by the taking effect of the tariff law now in force, that government subsequently notified us of its intention to terminate su.h arrange ment on the first day of January, 189, in the exercise of the right reserved ia the agree ment between the two countries. I invite a mention to the correspondence between the secretary of state and the Brazilian minister on this subject The China-Japan War. Agratifyin? re cojnition of the uniform im partiality of t his country towards all foreign states was man ifested by the coincident re quest of the Ch inose and Japanese govern ments that the a -ents of tho United States should within proper limits afford protection tothesubjestsof the other during the sus pension of dip lomatic relations due to a state of war T his delicate office was accepted and a misapprehension which gave rii-e to the belief that in affording this kindly unofficial protection our a ents would exercise the same authority which the with drawn agents of the belligerents h d exercised, w as promptly corrected. Althou -h the war between Chi na and Japan endangers no policy of the United States it deserves our gravest consideration, by reason of its dis turbance of our crowin? commercial interest In the two countries and the increased dangers which may result to our citizens domiciled or sojourning in the Interior of China Acting under a stipulation in our treaty with Korea, (the first concluded with a Western power) I felt constrained at tho be,'i nnin of the controversy to tender our good offices to induce an amloable arrangement of the Initial difficulty growing out of the Japanese demands for administrative retorms in Korea, but the unhappy precipitation of actual hostilities defeated this kindly purpose Deploring the destructive war between the two most powerful of the Eastern nations Bnd anxious that our commercial Interests in those countries may be preserved and that the safety of our citizens there shall not be Jeopardized. I would not hesitate to heed any intimation that our friendly aid for the honorable termination of hostilities would be acceptable to both belligerents. The German Meat Prohibition. Acting upon the reported discovery of Texas fever in cargoes of American oattle the Ger man prohibition against importations of live stock and fresh moati from this country Ins been revived It is hoped that Cermany will soon become convinced that the inhtjitionis as needless as it is harmful to mutual in terests. The German govarnment has protected against that provision of the customs tariff act which Imposes a discriminating duty of one-tenth of one cent a pound on su ars com ing from countries payiaj an export bounty thereon, claimin? that the exaction of such duty is in contravention of articles five an I nine of the treaty of ls w.th Ptiui In the Interests of the connnroj of both countries and to avoid even the a:cuntioa of treity Tiolatioa I recommend the repeil of so much of the statute as Imposes th it duty and I 'in Tite attention to the accompaavin? report of the secretary of state contains : a discussion of the questions raised by the German pro tests. The Hawaiian Incident. Since communlcattn? the voluminous cor respondence in regard to Hawaii and the ac tion taken by the senate and house of repre sentatives on certain questions submitted to the judgment and wider discretion of congress the organization of a government in place of the provisional arrangement which followed the deposition of tie queen has been an nounced with cvidan.-e of its effective opera tion. The recocnition usual in such cases has been accorded the new government UlueQelds Affair. Prominent anion the questions of ter ritorial jurisdiction of the year was the Blue fields incident-In what is known as the Mosquito Indian strip, bTderln? on the At bntlc ocean and wtthin the JurUdlciion of Nicaragua. By the treaty of ISM between Great Britain and Nicarajua, the former government expressly recojnized the sov erel;nty of the latter over tin strip and a limited form of self government was guarantee! to the Mosquito Indians to be exercised accordinr to their customs for themselves and their dwellers within its limits. The so-called native government which grew to be lar.-ely made up of aliens for many years disputed the sov ereignty of Nicaragua over the strip ind claimed the rhht to maiatiin therein a practi cally independent municipal "government Early in the past yeir eff orts of Nicaragua to maintain soverei.nty over the Mosquito ter ritory led to serious disturbances cslminatia in the suppression of the native government and the attempted substitution of an impract icable compact administration in which Nicar agua and alien residents were to partlcipati Failure was followed bj? an Insurrection which for a time subverted NIearaguan rule, expell ing her offl.-ers and restoring the old organization. This in turn gave way to the existing local government established and upheld by Nicaragua. Although the alien interests arrayed ajalnst Nicaragua in these transactions have been largely Amenean and the commerce of that re.-lonfor some time has beon and still is con trolled by onr citizens we cannat for that reason challenge the rWhtful sovereignty of Nicaragua over tab important part of her domain For some months on and d url n; part of the term, two of our naval ships have been .stationed at Bluefields for the protection of .'all legitimate Interests of our citizens. In September last the government at Managua expelled from its territory twelve or more foreigners including two Americans for alleged participation In the seditious or revolutionary movements against the republio at Bluefields already men tioned Throujh the earnest remonstratloa of this l overnmeni tie two Americans have been permitted to return to the peaceful nnnire ment of their business Our naval commanders at tho scene of this disturbance b their con stant exhl iltion of firmnen and itood judg ment contribute I largely ta the preveatlon of more s-.rious consequences as to ttis restora tion of quiet and orJer I re ret that In the nJdst of thrse occur rences there opened up a mostirave irritatln: failure of Nicara uan justice An American citizen named Wilson, nsidin? at Kama, in the mosquito territory w.u murdjrei by oae Arsuello the acting governor of ths town After some del iy the murdorer was arrested, but so insecurely coadaed or guarded that he escape!, and nouitastaailn: our repeated demands it is claimed that his rcaoture his been Impossible by reason ot his fll:ht beyond Nicariiuan Jurisdiction. The Nicarajuan authorities havlnr given notice of forfeiture of their concession to the oanal company on grounls purely technical and not embraced In the contract receded from taat pos'tlon Peru. I rerret ta siv ihavvmnnm nf domestio disturbance, due probably to the aiowness or her recuperation from the war of 181L Weakened la resources, her difficulties in facing int?rnatioaa! obligations invite our kindly sympathy and justify our forbearance in pressing ion pending claims I have felt constrained to teitify this sympathy in con nection with certain demands urgently pre ferred by other powers The recent death of the czar of Russia called forth appropriate expressions of sorrow and sympathy on the part of our government with his bereaved family and the Uu-slan people As a further demonstration of resoect and friendship our minister at St Petersburg was directed to represent our government at the funeral ceremonies. Under our pre ent treaties of extradition with Italy mtsoarria.es of justice have oc curred owing to the refusal of that govern ment to surrender Its own subjects. Thus far our efforts to negotiate an amended con vention obviating this difficulty have been un availing. Apart from the war in which the Island em pire is engagod, Japan attracts Increasing at tention In this country by her evident desire to cultivate more liberal intercourse with us and seek our kindly aid in furtherance of her laudable desire for complete autonomy in her domestic affairs and full equality in the family of nations. The Japanese empire of to day is no longer the Japan of the past and our rela tions with this progressive nation should not be less broad and liberal than those with other powers. Relations With Mexico. Good will fostered by miny interests in common has marked our relations with our nearest southern neighbor. Peace bcinr restored alon? her northern frontier, Mexico has askei tho punishment of the late disturbers of her tranquility. There oujht to be a new treaty of commerce and navigation with that country to take the place of the one which terminated thirteen years ao. The friendliness of the inter course between the two countries is attested by the fact durin; this Ion? pDriod, The com merce of each has steadily Increased under the rule of mutual consideration, being neither stimulated by conventional arrangements nor retarded by jealous rivalries or selfish desire i. An indemnity tendered br Moxico as a gracious act for the murder in iS7 of Leon Baldwin, an American citizen, by a band of marauders in Durango, has been accepted and is beln: paid Inlaitillmeats. The problem of the stora -e and use of the waters of the Rio Grande for irrhation should be solved by appropriate concurrent action of the two interested countries. Rts in,' In the Colorado heUhts the stream flows intermitting, yieldinr little water durin? the dry months to tho irriratin? channels already constructed along its course This scarcity is often severely felt in the regions where the river forms a common bound ary. Moreover the frequent changes in its course through level sand often raise embarassin ; questions of territorial jurisdic tion. Treasury Department.

The message reviews and comments on the report of the secretary of war. The president does not believe there Is any necessity for ln creasin; the army to 30,00) men. as recom mended by Secretary Lamont He advises aralnst the creation ot new military posts The secretary's plai of the adoption of the batallion system is recommended The stride troubles of last summer are briefly referred to and the action of the military commended In recognition of the loaf and distinguished military services and faithful discharge of delicate and responsible evil duties by Major General John M. Schofleld now the general commandlnr the army, it is suggested to con gress that the temporary revival ot the grade of lieutenant general in his behalf would be a just and gracious act Department of Justice. The report ot the attorney general notes the gratifying progress made by the supreme court in overcoming tho arrears ot its busi ness and ia reaching a condition in which it will be able to dispose of cases as they arise without any unreasonable delay. This result is of course very larrely due to the successful worklnr of the plan lnau:uratlng circuit courts of appeals. In respect to these tribun als the su;?estlon is made In quarters entitled to the highest consideration that an addi tional c rcuit jud -e for each circuit would greatly strengthen these courts and the confidence reposed in their adjudications and that such an addition would not create a i.reater force of judges than the increasing business of such courts requires. I commend the suggestion to the careful coaslderatr n of the congress. Other Important topics are adverted to the report accompanied by recom mendations, many ot which have been treated at lar-e In previous messages, and at this time they need only be named, I refer to the abolition ot the fee system as a measure of compensation to federal officers. The en largement of the powers of United Statos cemmlssloners In the territories the allowance of writs of error in criminal cases on behalf of the United States and the establishment of degrees In the crime of murder A topic dealt with by the attorn ey general of much import ance Is the condition of the administration of justice in the Indian Territory. The perma nent solution ot what is called the Indian problem is probably not to be expected at once, but meanwhile such ameliorations of present conditions of the existing system will admit ou,-ht not to be neglected. I am satis fied there should be a fedoral court estab lished for the territory with sufficient judges and that this court should sit within the ter ritory and have the same jurisdiction as to territorial affairs as now vested In the federal courts sit tin.' In Arkansas and Texas. Eight years a;o la my annual message I urged upon the congress as strongly as I could the location and construction ot two prisons for the confinement ot United States prison ers A similar recommendation has been made from time to time since aad a few years ago a law was parsed providing for the selec tion of sites for three such institutions No appropriation has, however, been made to carry the act into effect and the old and dls creditible condition still exists Another subject of pressing moment re ferred to by tho attorney general Is the reor ganization of the Union Pacific railroad com pany on a basis equitable as regards all pri vate interests and as favorable to the gov ernment as existing conditions will permit The operation ot a railroad by a court t hrou , h a receiver is an anomalous state of thin ;s which should be terminated on all grounds, public and private, at the earliest possible moment. Besides not to enact the needed enabling legislation at the present session, postpones the whole matter until the assem blage of a new congress and inevitably In creases all the complications of the situation and could not be regarded as a sig nal failure to solve a problem which has practically beon before the present congress ever since Its organlnlon It is not my purpose at this time to repeat the considerations which make an impre nable case in favor of the ownership and man agement by the government of the penal in institutions in which federal prisoners are confined I simply desire to a?aln urge former recommendations on the subject and to particularly call the attention of the con gress to that part of the report of the secre tary ot war. In which he states that the mil itary prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, can be turned over to to the government as a prison for federal convicts without the leas difficulty and with an actual saving ot money from every point of view. Pendint a more complete reform, I hope that by the aioption of the suggestion of the secretary of war this easy step may be taken in the direction of the proper care of Its con victs by tne government ot the United States. Tostal and Savy Departments. The message next takes up the report of the postmaster general and strondy urges the recommendations ot that official looking to the correction ot the abuses of the second class mail matter privilege ty publishers of advertising matter, who send tons of papers through the mill and defraud the government out of millions of dollars postaje annually. The free carriage of seeds of grain through the mails is also condemned It these abuses were rectified the department would be self: sustaining. The report ot the postmaster general which his already been published. Is reviewed at length. Attention is called to the report of the sec retary of tae navy which shows very gratify in; progress in the construction ot ships for our new navy. I recommend that provision be made for the construction of additional battle ships and torpedo boats The secretary recommends the manufacture not only of a reserve supply of ordnance and ordnance material for ships of the navy, but also a supply for the auxil iary Beet Guns and their apurtenanses should be provided and kept on hand for both those purposes We have not to-day a single gun that could be put upon the ships Paris or New York of the International Navigation company or any other shlpot our reserve navy. The manufacture of guns at the Washington navy yard Is proceedln; satis factorily, and none of our new ships will be required to wait for their tuns or ordnance equipment. Interior Department The report of the secretary of the Interior exhibits the siuitlon of the numerous and in teresting branches of the pnbllo service con nected with his department I recommend this report and the valuable recommenda tions of the secretary to the careful attention of congress I fully Indorse the recommendation ot the secretary that adequate protection be pro Tided fer our forest reserves aad that a com prehensive forestry system be lnanrnratel The recommendations ot the secretary In regard to dealing with the Indian question is concurred in and .has already been published. I'tntlooa. The barefaced and extensive pension frauds exposed nnder the courageous and cenerous veteran soldier now at the head of the bureau leaves no room for the claim that no purgation of our pension roll was needed or that con tinued vtdlanco and prompt action are not necessary to the same end The accusation that an effort to detect pension frauds is evi dence ef unfriendliness towards our worthy veterans and a denial of their claims to the generosity of the cov ernment, suggests an unfortunate indlffr enco to the comlssions of any offense which has for its motive the securinr of a pension and Indicates a willingness to be blind to t he existence of mean and treacherous crimes which play upon dema;o;io fears and make sport ot the patriotic people. Agricultural Department. The secietcryof agriculture in his report reviews the operations of his department for the last fiscal year and makes recommenda tions for the further extension of its useful ness The recommend stions of the senate are concurred In The prohibition of free dis tribution of seed by the department Is a;aln ureed. The work done by the department of agri culture is very superficially dealt with in this communication and I commend tan report of the secretary and the very important Inter ests with which it deals to the careful atten tion of the congress Anexceedln.ly Important recommendation of the se:retary relates to the manner in which contests and litlgsted cases growlnr out of efforts to obtain government land are determined. The entire testimony upon which these controversies depend in all their stages is taken before the loaal redsters and receivers and yet the ie olcers have no power to subpoena witnesses or to enforce their attendance to testify. These cases, numbcrlnx three or four thousand annually are sent by the officers to the commissioner of the general land office for his action. The execencles ot his other duties oblige him to act upon decisions of the registers and re ceivers without an opportudty ot thorough personal examination. Nearly iOO) of these cases are appealed annually from the commis sioner to the secretary of the inte.rjor Burden ed with other Important administrative duties, his determination of thee appeals must be almost perfunctlonary and based upon tho ex amination of others Throu h this determina tion of the secretary operates as final adjudica tion upon rUhts of very Importance. 1 concur in the opinion that the commissioner of the general land office should be relieved from this duty of deciding UtUated land cases that a non partisan court should be entreated to pass on such cases and that the decisions of this court should be final at least so far as the decisions of tho department are final Civil Service Reform. The advantages to the public service of an adherence to the principles of civil service roform are constantly more apparent anl nothing is so encourasting to those In official life who honestly desire good government as the increasing appreciation by our people of these advantages. A fast majority of the voters of the land are ready to insist that the time and the attention ot those they select to perform for them important public duties, should not be distributed by doling out minor offices and they are growing to be unanimous In regard ing party organizations as something thit should be used m e itabllshing pai ty principles instead of dictating the distribution of publio places as rewards of partisan activity Numerous additional offices and places have been brought within civil service rules and regulations and some others will probably soon be Included The report of the commis sioners will be submitted to the congress and I Invite careful attention to the recommen dations It contains National Board of Health. I am entirely convinced that weouihtnot to be longer without a national board of health or national health officer charted with no other duties than such as pertain to the protection of our country from the Invasion of pestilence and disease I earnestly recom mend that the inau;uration of a national board of health or similar national Instru mentality believing the same to be a needed precaution a iainst contarious diseases and in the interast of safety and hea th of poor people. Strike Communion. By virtue of a statute of the United States passed in m I appointed in July last Hoi. J. D. Keen of the state of Ne Yor' and Hon. Nicholas E Worthln.-tin. of the state of Illinois, to form with Hon. Carroll D. Wright commissioner of labor, who was des ignated by said statute a commissioner for the purpose of mikln? careful inquiry into the causes of the controversies between certain railroads and their employes which had re sulted In an extensive and destructive strike, accompanied by much violence and dangerous disturbance with considerable loss of life and great destruction of property. The report of the commissioners has been sub mitted to me and will be transmitted to con gress with the evldonco taken upon their In vestigation. Their work has been well done, and their standing and intelligence give as surance that the report and sugf estlons they make are worthy of careful consideration. Tariff Amendments Urged. The tariff act passed at the last session of congress needs important amendments it it Is executed effectively and with certainty la ad dition to such necessary amendments as will not change rates of dutv. 1 am still very de cidedly In favor of puttin? coal and Iron on the free list So far as the su ;ar schedule Is con cerned, I would be glal under the exlstinr ag gravations to see every particle of deferential duty In favor of refined surar stricken out of our tariff law If with all the favor accorded the sugar refining interest in our tariff laws It still languishes to the extent ot closed re fineries and thousands of dlscharred work men It would seem to present" a hopeless cese for reasonable legislative aid Whatever else Is done or omitted I earnest' repeat here the recommendation 1 have made In another portion of this communication that the additional duty ot one tenth of a cent per pound laid upon surar Imported from coun tries paying a bounty on Us exsort be abro gated It seems to me that exceedingly Im portant considerations point to the propriety of this amendment With the advent of a new tariff policy not only contemplated to rel.evo the consumers of our land in tho cost of their daily life, but to Invite a be'.ter development of American thrift and create for us closer and more profitable commercial relations with the rest of the world It follows as a lo.'l. cal and imperative necessity that we should at once remove the chief It not only obstacle which has so lonr prevented onr participa tion In the foreign carrying trade of the sea. A tariff built noon the theory that It is well to eheck Imports and that a home market should bound the industry and effort of American producers, was fitly supplemented by a re fusal to allow American registry vessels built abroad thou ;h owned and navigated by our people, thus exhibltln ? a willingness to abandon all contest for the advantages of American transoceanic cirrla-a Our new tariff policy bUl upon the theory that It Is well to encourage such Importations as our people need and that our products and manufactures should find market in every partot the habitable globe is consistently snpplementel by the greatest possible liberty to our citizens In the ownership and naviga tion of ships in which our products and man ufactures may be transported The millions now paid to foreljners for carrying American passengers and products across the sea should be turned into American hands. Ship building, which has teen protected to straniulatton, should be revived bv the pros pect of profitable employment for ships when, built and the American sailor would be resur rected and azain take his place, a sturdy and Industrious citizen in time of peace, and a pat riotic and safe defender of American interests in the day ot conflict The ancient provision of onr law deny In; American re i Is try to ships built abroad and owned by Americans, ap pears. In the Uzht of present conditions, not only to be a failure for rood at every point but to be nearer a rolls ot barbarism than any thing that exists nnder permission of statute ot the United States. I earnestly recommend Its prompt repeal The Gold Reserve. Daring the last month the gold reserves in the treasury for the purpose of redeeming the notes ot the government circulating as money In the hands ot the people became so reduced and Its further depletion In the near future seemed so certain that In the exercise ot proper care tor the publio welfare It became necessary to replenish this reserve and thus maintain popular faith In the ability and determination ot the government to meet as agreed. Its pecuniary obligation It would have been well it in thlsemer:eacy authority had existed to Issue the bonds ot the govern- meet bearing a low rate of Interest and maturing within a special period, but the congress ha via; failed to confer tuch authority resort was neccetanly ha to tne resumption act of 1875, aud pursuant to its provision, bonds were issued drawing Interest at the rate ot five per cent per annum and maturln ten years after their issuing, that being the shortest time authorize! by the act I am glad to av. however that oa the sale of these bonds the premium received operated to reduce the rate ot interest to be paid by the e- vernment to less than three per eent Nothing could be worse or further removed firm feasible finance than the relations ex isting between the currency the government has Issued, the cold held lor Its redemption and the means which must be resorted to for the purpose of replen ishing such rcdempt'on fund when impaired. Even it the claims npea this fund were con fined ta the obligations originally Intended and If the redemption ot these obligations meant their cancellation the fund would be Terr small But these obll atlons when re ceived and redeemed in gold are not cancelled but are re-Issued and may do duty many times by way of drawln: gold from the treasury. Thus we have an endless chain in operation constantly dopletlng the treasury's gold and never near a final rest As If this was not bad enough we have a statutory declaration that it Is the policy of the government to maintain the parity bet wean cold and sil ver aided the force and momentum of the ex naustlnr process and added lar.ely to the cur rency obligations claiming this peculiar gold redemption. Ounmill gold reserve Is thus subject to draw from every side The de mands that lncroass our dinrer also increase the necessity of protecting this reserve azalnst depletion and it is most unsatisfactory to know that the protection afforded Is only a temporary palliation It is perfectly and pal pafcly plain that the only way under present conditions by which this reserve when dangerously depleted, can be replen ished, is throu ;h the issue and sale of the bonds of the gov ernment for gold and yet congress has not only thus far declined to authorize the Iisueof bonds best suited to snch a purpose, but there seems a disposition in some quar ters to deny both the necessity and power for the issue of bonds at alL I cannot for a moment believe that any of our citizens are deliberately willlnr that their government should default in its pecuniary obligations, or that its financial operations should be re duced to a sliver basis At any rate I should not feel that my duty was done If I omitted any effort I could make to avert such a calamity As long therefore as no provision is made for the final redemption or the putting aside of the currency obligation now used to repeatedly and constantly draw from the government Its rold and as Ion? as no better authority for bond issues is allowed thin at present exists suoh authority will be utilized whenever and as often as It becomes necessary to maintain a sufficient old reserve and in abundant lime to save the credit of our country and make .ood the financial declarations of our tovern ment Questions relatln - to our banks and currency are closely connected with the sub Je;t Juet referred to and they also present some unsatisfactory feature New Banking System Advocated. Prominent amont them are the lack ot elas ticity In our currency circulation and Its fre quent concentration in financial centres when it is most needed in other parts ot the country. The absolute divorcement of the government from the business ot banking Is the Ideal rela tionship of the government to the circulation of the currency of the country This condi tion cannot be immediately reached but as a step in that direction and as a means of secur ing a more elastic currency and obviating other objections to toe present arrange ment of bank circulation the secretary of the treasury presents In his report a scueme modify In? present bankln; laws and providing tor the Issue of circulating notes by -tate banks free from taxation under certain limitations The secretary explains his plan so plainly and its advantages are developed by him with such remarkable clearness that any effort on my part to presea t arguments In Its supports woald be surpuflous I shall there tore content myself with an unqualified in dorsement of the secretary' proposed chan.es In the law and a brief and Imperfect statement ot their prominent features It Is proposed to repeal all laws providing tor the deposit of United States bonds as se curity for circulation to permit national banks to issue circulating notes not exceeding In amount 75 per cent ot their paid up and un impaired capital provided they deposit with the government as a guarantee fund in United States legal tender notes lnoludlng treasury notes of iwO, a sum equal in amount to 8) per cent of the notes they desire to issue, this deposit to be maintained at all times but whenever any bank retires any part of Its cir culation a proportional part of Us guar antee fund shall be returned to it: to permit the seretary ot the treasury to prepare and keep on hand ready for issue in case an Increase In circulation Is desired blank national bank notes for each bank hav ing circulation and to repeal the provislohs of the present law imposing limitations and re strictions upon banks desiring to reduce or In crease their circulation, thus permit llnr such ncrease or reduction within the limit of iseventy-flve per cent of capital to be quickly made as emerge icy arise In addition to the guarantee fund required It Is proposed to pro vide a safety fund tor the immediate redemp tion of the circulating notes of failed banks bv lmoosinr a imall annual tax i nnn hair of one per cent upon the avera re circulation oi eacn Dan it until the fund amounts to fire per cent of the total circulation outstanding When a bank fails its guarantee fund Is to be paid into this safety funds and its notes are to be redeemed in the first instance from such safety fnnd thus au meutel any Impairment of such fund caused thereby to be made good from the Immediately available cash assets of said bank, and ij these should be Insufficient, auch impairment to be made good by pro rata assessment among the other banks, their contributions commuting a first lien upon the as ets ot the failed bank In favor of the contrbuting banks. As a further security it Is contemplated that the existing proposition flxinr the Indi vidual liability of stockholders is to be re tained and tbe bank's Indebtedness on ac count of Its clrculatln r notes is to be made a first lien on all its assets For the purpose ot meetlnr the expense of printing notes, offi cials, supervision, cancellation and other like charges there shall be imposed a tax of say, one-half ef one per cent per annum upon the average amount of notes in circulation. It Is farther provided that there snail be no national bank notes Issued ot a less denomination taan ten dollars: that each national bank, except in case ol a failed bank shall redeem or retire its notes in the first Instance at its own office or at arenciestobedesbnated by It thit no fixed reserve used be maintained on account of de posits. Another very Important feature ot this plan Is the exemption of state banks from taxa tion by the United St ites in eaes where It U shown to the satisfaction of the secretarr ot the treasury and comptroller of the currency, by banks c alming such exemptioa thai they have not had outstandln; their circulating notes exceeding aeventr-five per cent of their paid op and unimpaired capital that their stockholders are individually liable for the redemption of their clrcu atin; notes to the full extent of tbe ownership of stock, thai the liability of such banks upon their circulating notes constitutes under their stole law a first lien upon their assets that such banks have kept and maintained a guarantee fund In United States leral tender notes in eluding treasury notes of UsQ equal to thirty per cent of their outstanding circulating notes, and that such hare promptly redeemed their cin-ulatint notes when presented at their principal or branch office It is quite likely that this scheme may be usefully amended In some of lis details, bot I amsatUfiedlt furnishes a basts tor a very great Improvement la onr present banking and currency system. I conclude this eommonleatloa. fully appre ciating that the responsibility for legislation affecting the people of the United States rests upon their representatives In conrress and assuring them that whatever accordance with recommendations I have made or not I shall be glad to eo-operate ta perfecting any legisla tion that tends to the prosperity aud welfare ot onr people.
