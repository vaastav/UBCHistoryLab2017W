IBBSSBE Opinion of President's Message Congressman Higgins Declares it is No Disappointment to President Taft's Friends Reform of Currency Law Important Merchant Marine Should Receive Attention and Custom Better Times Looked For Washington, Dee. 10- Congressman Higgins in an interview on President Taft'a message spoke as follows: President Taft's message is no dis appointment to his friends. It shows the marked characteristics of the man. Wise, searching, conservative and broad gauged, it not only merits the closest analysis and consideration by congress, which it will command, but answers fully the requirements of the executive under the constitution to give congress from time to time in formation of the state of the union and recommend such measures as he shall Judge necessary and expedient. Doubt less much legislation during this ses sion will be introduced and debated. Some of it ought to pass and will. The country is not ready for all of it, but had rather see a more rigid enforce ment of existing laws. The reform of our currency laws Is one of the most Important matters be fore the country and this with the problem of keeping our expenditures within our income will of itself keep congress busy. The establishment of postal savings banks needs careful consideration. If all the country had as well managed savings banks under such restrictions as Connecticut, the need of a postal savings bank would not be as great as it appears now to be in some sec tions. No state in the country has better savings banks than Connecti cut. The neglect of our merchant marine is hardly short of a national disgrace Its rehabilitation will, I hope, receive the serious attention of congress. A large producing and exporting nation should carry its products in its own ships. . Let our merchant marine be built up at the same time we are deep ening our rivers and harbors. While we cannot legislate honesty Into men, something ought to be done to prevent a recurrence at some later time of the contemptible and abhorrent conditions disclosed in the New York customs house, particularly with reference to the sugar frauds. With no desire to form a hasty conclusion, they never theless seem to me to exceed in the

Coit gave an enter taining account of her most enjoyable experience during her trip abroad last summer. This was the exciting Jour ney of twenty-two miles up the moun tains from, the Rhone to Zermatt and the still more fearful climb- six miles further to Gorner Grab at an elevation of 11,000 feet. Zermatt is the highest village in all Europe 6.000 feet and Is a quaint old village of 1,200 inhab itants In a pretty green valley foil of Interest in itself and surrounded by towering mountains peaks, among them the famous iMatterhorn. From higher up at Gorner Grab was unrolled a wonderful panorama of mountains, with fifty glaciers in sight Here the party Indulged in a snowball contest, it being the first day of August. She also told of a visit up an ever steeper railroad to Meuren. where one gets a view of the Jungfrau ctoud of the Alps. Mrs. Edward D. Fuller read an ex tremely Interesting paper describing the events and places visited each Sun day during her summer's Journey. The first two were spent at sea.

STAFFORD SPRINGS MAN WANTS NEW APPOINTMENT. Likely That Frank A. Warfield Will Be Named Deputy Commissioner of Pension Office. Frank A. Warfield of Stafford Springs is an applicant for appoint ment as one of the .deputy commis sioners of the pension office, and his chances for the place are said to be yery good. There, are two of these deputies, and the recent promotion of the first deputy to be commissioner has necessitated a change all around. Sen ators Bulkeley and Brandegee on Fri day morning called on President Taft to present Mr. Warfield's name and he also has the endorsement of all the members from Connecticut in the house. Mr. Warfield has been for nearlv thirty years in the pension office, and Is at present chief of the western di vision, to which place he was appoint ed In 1897. This place pays a salary of $2,000 a year, while the deputy gets $3,600. Mr. Warfield was a candidate for the same place he Is now seeking about ten years ago, but failed to land the plum.

House .Frauds Prevented V existence of corruption the findings of the Armstrong insurance Investigation and are more deplorable because they affect the public service, Wl the first requirement or service must no integ rity. I feel any effort to open a general tariff discussion with a viewttfi amend ing the new law will retard business anil result in no improvement in the present law, which before amendment ought to be given a fair trial. A general revival of business will follow the New Year and the confi dence of the country in. the ability of Mr. Taft to administer his great office will greatly contribute to that end. New London Port of Entry. Representative Higgins has intro duced in the house a bill making New London a port of entry, which was re ferred to the committee on ways and means. In speaking of this bill Mr. Higgins said: "The bill which I have Introduced proposes to extend to the port of New London the privilege of immediate transportation of merchandise Import ed from abroad. Under the law mer chandise destined for immediate transportation shall be transferred, un der proper supervision, directly, from the importing vessel to the car, vessel or vehicle in which the same is trans ported to its 'final destination. This right was granted to a number of ports in the act of June 10, 1880. "I have always believed that a greater use could and should be made of the splendid shipping facilities both by water and rail at New London. The congestion at New York and the high rates prevailing there for warehouses ought to operate to the advantage of New London. This bill must receive the favorable recommendation of the ways and means committee, who will undoubtedly refer it to the treasury department, who may raise some ad ministrative objections, or decide that the commerce of the port of New Lon don does not warrant the amendment proposed. Under any event, I shall work for its enactment."
