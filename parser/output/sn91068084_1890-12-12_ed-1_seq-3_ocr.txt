mission of written communications is. I bo iieve, upon proper terms quite desirable. The Government ioes not own or o oarate the railroads, and it should not, 1 think, own or operate the telegraph lines. ft does not, however, seem to be quiet practicable for the Government to contract with the tele graph companies, as it does with the rail road companies, to carry at specified rates guch communications as the senders may designate for this method of transmission. I recommend that sued legislation be enacted as will enable the Postoffiee Department fairly to test by experiment the advantages of such a use of the telegraph. THE ELECTION LAWS.

The killing of a United States Marshal carrying a writ of arrest for an election offense is full of prompting and suggestion to men who are pursued by a city marshal for a crime against Ufe or property. But it is said that this legislation will re vive race animosities, and some have even suggestbd that when the peaceful methods of fraud are made impossible they may Da supplanted bv intimidation and violence, if the proposed law gives to any qualified elector bv a hair's weight, more than his erual influence, or detracts by so much from any other qualified elector, it is fatally impeached.
