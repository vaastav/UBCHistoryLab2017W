Having taken the scent strongly outside the assessor "followed his nose" and soon came upon a siili and all tue paraphernalia belonging thereto, be sides a quantity of wet grain, molasses and the other deiightlul ingredients that, after due process, con stitute the essence called whiskey. A number of milk cans Oiled with grain were about, and it was evident that the proprietors of the establishment, whoever they were, meditated a descent on some other looulity, at present in spiritual darkuess. The assessor, singular to say, does not know who "ran the mill" next door to him. nor who the distillers were. A uiaa was left on the premises iu lull eujoy meut of the society of tho milk cans.

Murderous assault.?As Michael Adams was proceeding to his home, through Flushing avenue, between ten and eleven o'clock on Saturday night, he was asiaulted by an unknown man, who struck him upon the head with a club and felled hnn to the sidewalk. The cowardly assailant, it is said, came out of au oyster saloon ou Flushing avenue, near classon. The blow was a murderous one, and may possibly result in the death of the unfortunate man.

The other two buildings, which are believed to be In a shaky condi tion, are guarded by the police of the Forty-second precinct, who will not allow any one to pass near ttiem. Fortunately the accident happened yesterday, wlien tuere was nobody on the premises, or it might have been attended with serious loss- of life.

When the gold fever broke out in uallfornla, about eighteen years ago, a vigilance committee was the means of ridding san Frauclsco of the many rogues that infested the city. The citizens of that city Took charge of even .the Mayor's office and stteuded to all oases, and gave every man his Just due. Should not the citizens of this city do tne aamer Now, thersfore, I, Charles Van Dusen. of the State, county and city of New York, do hereby give, for the purpose of organising a vigilance committee for this city, ths sum of |M),0X); ti e name to be handed to the treasurer of said commutes when so elected.

The present la the lut week of the leuon of Kng llsh opera under the direction of Mrs. Kichinse-llef nard at the Orand Opera House. The operas pro duced at thla houae up to the present time have been rery creditably performed and hare been liberally patronized by our music-loving citizens. Not con tent, however, with the flattering success which has thus Tar attended her effort*, Mra. Bernard has de termined to wind up her operatic aeasou in this city lu a blaze of splendor. Wltn thU object in view she presents to us this evening Meyerbeer's grand opera "The Huguenots," which has never before been done in Eugllah in this country. It is to ?>e given upon thla occasion with a strong cast, new sconory, a double chorus and all tho accompani ments of stage pageantry, and will probably hold posHesslon of the boards during the entire week. Mr. James H. llackott, as that Jollleat of bhak spearian knights, Hir John Falstaff, is still tho attraction at Booth's theatre, which, by the by, Is nightly flllea with large and fashionable audiences. Mr. Hackett's impersonation of this character is one of the most enjoyable auil thoroughly artistic pieces of acting upon the mimlo stage, and that tt is appreciated by our cltizeus is fully attested by the applause which Its representation always ovokos. ?The last nights" of Mr. Hackett are already an nounced, active preparations being made tor the production ol "Hamlet," with Mx, Edwin Booth In the title row. The sprightly little Lotta appears this evening In a "learrangeil" version of tho lltt.e turce act drama entitled "The Lutle Detective." The drama will be loliowed by the laughable farce "An Object of ln lore.xt," in wlitoit 1-otta will also take part, assuming lu both plays no less than seven dlifcreut char acters. Both pieces will be produced in the genuine Nibiouian style, with strong casts aud appropriate scenery, and as this is "Hie last week but one of tue vivacious little Lotta lu this city it is more than probab:e that the theatre will be crowded during the remainder of her engagement. The pleasing little comedy of "Home," alter a lonir and successiul run at Wallace's theatre, makes way for a week or novelty aud varloty. This even ing tho sterling ootnedy of "The Wouder" will be pre sented at this house lor tne ilrst time this season; aud as It has already had the benefit of quite a number of rehearsals it will doubtless pass oil with that smooth and artistic completeness for which Wallack's Is JusUy tamous. To-morrow evening we are to havo "lne captain of tho Watch" and ??Woodcock's Little Game;" on Wednesday evening. "Home" and "A Regular Fix;" Thursday, "Uenry Dunbar;" Friday, "The Wonder," and on Saturday, "Home" ft flint n The drama of "London" la meeting with good en couragement at tue French theatre, aud will be retamed on the boards until after the Christmas holidays. This evening the piece will be presented in a reconstructed form, In which the best points of "Time and Tide," the original of the drama of "London," will be blended and presented under Its new title. The story la unchanged in outline, but has ha 1 more spirit and humor infused into It. A new a iditioti has also been made to the cast, In the pernou of a Misa Augusta Schott, recoutly from the London theatres. _ _ inchuaid's live net comedy, "Wives as They Were, Mauls as They Are," will be the principal attraction this week at the Fifth Avenue theatre. It la so many yean since tuts piay was acted in ibis city thai its production now is almost as novel as a "bran new" sensation. The piece la strongiy cast, including the veteran comedian (jeorge iioilaud, who will appear as Oliver, a character acted by him with marked success in London some forty years ago. On 1 hurs day and Friday evenings "The Irish HelresB" will be given, with the full strength or the company attached to this theatre. At the Olympic theatre the sonsatlon of the week will be the revival of "Under the uasllght." The play has been revamped aud rewritten to suit the times, and has otherwise been improved aud strengthened. The cast haa also been rcinforced with ueveral now additions, Including Miss Marie Longmore, who has been engaged expressly to play tho part or l'eachblossom, a character just suited to her peculiar stylo of acting. Mr. J. K. Mortimer sustains his original rote of Snorkey; Mr. C. 1.1'ar aloe, Jr., his original character of Peanuts, aud Mr. J. B. Studley lus original part of Byke. I'he piece will be produced with new and elaborate sceuerv, and considering tho care and attention that has been bestowed upon It by the management a long aud successiul run may be anticipated. l - The success which has attended the burlesque of ??Kenliworth" at Wood's Museum warrants the management in announcing the same bill for repe tition" Aside from its dramat'.c performances, how ever. the Museum this weeit will be doubly attrac tive. The great Onondaga Giant has been here pro vided witu suitable quarters and can now i>e seen "at all hours of the day and night;" the mena eerie has received several acquisitions of savage nature; an ornithological hail, filled with beauti ful living birds, has been added to the attractions, aud a full (lodged brass band has also been engaged to discourse promenade music whilo visitors mean der througn th > various galleries and aaioona to in ?pect tue wonders hero on exhibition. The great wigwam of Tammauy, like so many of its more pretentious nelghoors, comes to the surface this week with a new bill of attractive novelties. A new burlesque entitled "Bad Dickey," rounded upon the comical English burlesque ot "Klchard 111.," is tue chiel feature, besides which there are a score or lesser entertainments, all without extra charge. Tne new burlesque will be given with all the acces sories of new music, new scenery and gorgeous cos tumes, and will Include such favorites as itoso Mas soy Fanny Herring and Mr. M. W. Hake lu tne cast. Tammany, we are glad to see, shows some signs at last of waking up- . .. _ . '?The reconstructed church"?the New York theatre?reopens onco more for dramatic and ope ratic service this evening, and, If the fates are not in league against it, the present management will en deavor to keep It opea dunug the remainder of the season. The performances at this house will be given by a French dramitlo and operatic company, comprising many old favorites. The bill for tills evening comprises "Mattre I'atheiln," opera OonjTe, dj Bazin, and a comedy aud vaudevillo. Another entiro ohange of bill is announced at the Bowery theatre. "Paul Clifford," a sensational drama of the highwayman stripe, will be presented this evening, witu something rare lor tho Bowery in toe way of mountings, including a very largo ship under mil sail. Tue drama will be followed by the afterpiece or "Every Inch a Sailor." The Theatre comique also indulges in a new pro gramme this week and now offers Its patrous a groater variety of attractions than evor beiore. Air. Burnett will do his wonderful transformations, "the Heart broken Lover" will sigh, tbe ballet will prance and nimbly caper in short skirts, and, in short, every thlug calculated to amuse an audience fond ot varietr is announced for this evening. A galaxy of "now stars" will shine in peculiar spe claltTei to-night at Tony Pastor's Opera llou e. A programme replete with fuu and Jollity is oQered at this house, Including a new sensational play, by tho Irrepressible Poole, entitled "The Yankee Official," U> which the entire company will appear. Minstrelsy, too, is looking up, but no special ehaoge of bill is announced for tne present week at anv of the halls. The tact Is they all continue to be patronized so liberally that scarcely any change is at present necessary. Fun, frolic and nonsense are toe features at each, and so long as these are kept Xrash. just so long will onr minstrel halls continue to be crowded. At Bryant's w? have tho great ??Shoo Fly" soug and dance; at the .san Irancisco Allen and Leggett still leg it, and at the Waverley "the grand combination" 3o all sort of things in the wav of song, dance and sketches. Aside from the regular "houp la I" attractions of the "sawdust arena," several novelties In the per formance will be Introduced this evening at the New York Circus. Chief among these will be a performer known as "The Man Monkey." who has periormed in China, Australia and Europe, with decided suc cess Another feature will oe "The Amazonian Kaid," in which six lady equestriennes will take the Park theatre, Brooklyn, Miss Kate Reign olds commences a suort engagement this evening, appearing in her new seusationai play, "the bcrpeut on the Hearth." The piece will Here nave tue advan tages or appropriate eceaory aud a strong company to interpret it. _ , ... _ llooley's Minstrels, Brooklyn, are also out with a new bill for tue present weei. with "Nobody's Daughter" aa the principal attraction. The Iitedcrkrnnz Concert. Last night tho Llederkrauz Society, at their nail on Fast Foarth street, gave their first grand concert for the soason, and an unusual success it was. It can no louger be said that New lork does not culti vate tno classical In music, for the prestige which tbe Philharmonic, the Arlon, and now the Lleder krauz, have won among the public by their artistic rendering or the works ot the classics in muslo shows that the people know how to bestow recognl lion where It is ?ue. The great feature of last evening's concert was the "Fesst of A.exauder," by Haudcl. written by him in England some 130 years airo. It Is a cantata, in two acts, witn solos lor soprano, tenor and basso, and full mixed chorus and orchestra. Old as tills cantata is, it is no exag geration 10 say that the t nought w an in almost every body's mouth, U this oe the music of the past oue ought to he satisflod with It and long not lor the valrsrles of the music of the future, so sweot and meiodious a composition, of such simplicity in in strumentation and yet ao effoctive In couioinlng . he human voice with the orchestra lu their different modulation, has seldom been heard in thla city, and iv is to the credit oi the Liederkranz to have pro duced It, ami well. Miss Jackson, tho soprano; Mr. Honst, the basso, and especially Mr. Frltsch, the tenor and the chorue of the Liederkrana merit especial mention. Nor should the musi cal director, Mr. Agricoi Paur, be forgotten, whose directing Intelligence supervised the whole, though he did hold at too alow a metre the recitative nf tiift to nor *?\Var bi luiiK in toil and trouw?. Miss Anna Mehlelg, of atuttgardt.

Force aud sweetness, tender touch and stormy ovu lution of melody are not often combined in Bucn a degree, and the 1,500 persona present were impelled to call her back to the Stein way grand piano, when slie performed a notturno from Chopin with equal and nnsurpaaaed perfection. A ohorus, well ?uutr. tbe "Hoffnung," followed by the Llederkrauz, aud 1 a grand banquet ended the whole. 

WASHINGTON. Reassembling of Congress?A Busy j Session in Prospect. Monster Petition for According Belligerent Nights to the Cuban Insurgent*. Probable Release of tho Spanish Gunboats. W\sniNOTON, Dec. 5, 1889. Reassembling of Congrcna. Senators aud members contluue to arrive slowly and tlie crowd which usually congregates here on the eve of the meeting of Congress is surprisingly small. It is estimated that there is not a quorum of either House ait yet in the city, and It will require the arrival by the early trains to-morrow of a largo number of members, particularly of the Bouse. Owing to the short session last spring neither the Senate nor llonse of Representatives will lose any tluie in organization. Aoominlttce wlil be appointed to Inform the President that their respective bodies are readr for business, alter which, according to the present determination, the I'resident will immedi ately seud in lus Message and accompanying docu ments. A careful canvass of the leading men of both bouses shows that the few who direct and influence legislation are undetermined among themselves as to what course they will pursue or what legisla tion they win urge. They seem to be waiting to see what form matters will tase after the message Is in. Senator Wilson gave his opinion to-day that the coming session would be strictly business, and more so than has been the case lor some years. It is also generally thought that all the leading measuros which will come up for discussion will be first con sidered in caucus and be there well matured and then be brought before the Senate for debate. It is not known to any Senators of prominence that a caucus Is to be held to morrow, and to use the language of several, there is nothing to hold a caucus about. As for making a change of officers In the Senate, there seems to be no foundation for sucn a statement. Secretary Gorham and Sergeant-at-Arms French are both satisfactory and therefore will not be disturbed. The principal features In the legislation of the Senate, as now talked of, will be the funding of the national debt and tinkering on the revenue and tariff laws. Foreign questions will come up, but in what shape is indefinite. Action In regard to Cuba grows more doubtful every day,and it seems that unless the Presi dent makes suggestions the subject will not be taken up. It is admitted that the sympathy of the people is on tbe side of Cuba, and some extraordinary popular pressure might effect an expression of opinion from the legislative branch of the govern ment. Completion of the President's Message, The President** message was completed yesterday. Neither it ner the report of the Secretary of the Treasury is printed.

The Paris Exposition?What Became of the Appropriation for tho American Depart" ?tent. Information being wanted as to where the money went that was appropriated by Congress for tbe American department of the Fiench Exposition, a resolution will In a few days be introduced in Congress calling on the Secretary of state for a full and complete statement of the manner in which the large amount of money appropriated by congress in aid of lhe American department of tbe French Exposition was expended. It is re ported that a lsrge amount of this money was entrusted to a particular favorite of Mr. Seward in New York, and that no satisfactory account of how it was expended has yet been given to the proper department. Another person, also a particular favorite of Mr. Seward, was entrusted with a con siderable anient of the money, and tbe people would like to set an account of his stewardship.

There are two prominent republican politicians looking out for the place, backed by con siderable influence. When Barlow resigned and bis deputy, Mr. Harlow, succeeded, it was generally be lieved that the thing was settled;|but oue Important point had been overlooked, and that was that the Senate had not passed upon tbe question, and would desire to have something to say about it. it appears now that General Slgel and Daniel D. Conovor are opposed to permitting Harlow to rest In his place without first having a lively little brush In tbe Senate. Slgel is said to be backed by tireeley and Conkllng, who believe that tbe German hero abould have some recognition for his berolo political campaigns in the cause of true radicalism. John Coohrane and James W. Taylor also fight ??mlt Slgel," and Slgel undoubtedly stands a goo 1 chance of "Barkis (that Is Fen*bn) Is wlilln."

Dr. Collter, of Chicago, preached In the Uni tarian cnurcb here to-day on the subject or hypo crisy. In the course of bla reman* be allnded to the Hiobardson-McKariand affair, and took occasion to denounce tbe conduct of Uenry Ward Beecher and (). B. Frothintrbam. Referring to Vice President Colfax, he said that the aecond officer of the govern ment bad shown his hypocrisy by going to Utah to denounce the Mormons, and then going to New York to uDpiaud spiritual adultery and polygamy. The conduct of the Vice President was inexcusable, lie must hare been aware of the facta In the case of Mrs. McFarland and Mr. Richardson, and yet he could send telegrams condoling with the latter In the effects of bis crime and stand by his deathbed in agony at his dccotute. It was time tbe people, to whom Mr. Colfax Is responsible, took notice of these facts and administered to him tbe proper rebuke. Among tbe auditors at this discourse were secretary Boutwell and Attorney General Hoar, together with a large number of members and Senators, liOkbrlibi and Jobbers at their Posts.
