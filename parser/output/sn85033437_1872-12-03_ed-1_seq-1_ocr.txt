ADDRESS TO DEMOCRATIC llliJXlOUs. XewiYokk, Dec. 2. The following let , ter has been issued by the National Dem ocratic Committee : . HEJk DQUAKTERS NATIONAL ' DEMOCRATIC Committee, New York, Dec. 1S72. The National Democratic Committee do not regard it as within the scope of the authority delegated to them to advise the 'electors of the several States who favor the election of the candidates nominated at the Baltimore Convention, as to the liauks' proposed retirement from the Chair manship of the Foreign Allaire Commit tee, the house refused to accept Mr. Banks' course -which they fcUall pursue in" View' of the death of Horace ' Greeley. : i Such an event was unprovided for by action of the Convention. Succeeding conventions will, ttithqut doubt,1 make provisions for a simi lar .contingency, and as no practical result can follow the establish naent of a' prece dent by this committee, it is. deemed inad visable.that this committee, should make any recommendation to the electors. : : xt f rsTrs BcirExii, ' j,,;.!

An Able Paper frcia Secretary Soahvell SYN01-&IS OF THE 1'KESl UfcNT S MESSAOE, Washim;ton, Dec.J?JsTiM , After a short recess the President's mes sage was at 1.10 p. m. received and read. It commences with a recognition of the blessings which the American people have enjoyed within the past year, the only ex ception being the great tij;e in Boston. It refers to tho Geneva Arbitration and ita satisfactory results,which left the two Go v ernmcnts.the American and English, with out a shadow ou their frieudjy relations, which-it is sincerely hoped may orvyer re main tmclouded. It rechnimeiuW the im mediate creation of a board of commission ers to decide on the amounts lo be paid to individuals for damages 'eii?cuncd by thfc Confederate-7 privte. rs.'!; . oUIl i'EACE TKIL'MI'jIS. It compliments Hon. Charles Fran cis Adams thu American Arbitrator at Ge neva, and Mr. Bancroft, Minister at Ber lin, fori heir earnest services in the matter of the Geneva and the San Juan Arbitra tions, the decision in the latter leaving the United States for the first,-time, without any question as to disputed boundaries. In regard to the fisheries and to our rela tionswith the British North American Provinces, the President says that he has received notice that the Imperial Parlia ment and theDomiuion Government have passed laws to carry the provisions of the Treaty of Washington into operation, and lie, therefore, recommends a legislation of Congress in the same direction. He speaks of the friendly relations of tho United States with all the Governments of Eu rope. He refers to the Vienna Interna tional Exposition, recommends the lilting up of two national vessels to convey the goods of exhibitors to Trieste and suggests that a proposition; be. made to have the next great exposition , in this country in 187b", at the time of the Centennial Cele bration in Philadelphia. 1 

CUBA.' , , V,T' ' " He refers to the disturbed condition of Cuba, and says that no advance to wards pacilication in that island has been made, while the insurrection had gained no advantages and' exhibited no more of the elements of power or prospective suc cess than a year ago. Neither had Spain succeeded in repressing the insurrection. Tlie parties to the strife were standing in the same attitude as for a long time past. The continuation of slavery in that island he regarded as among the strongest causes of the continuance of the strife, and he thinks that the abolition of slavery and the institution of other reforms there, could not fail to advance the restoration of peace and order. It was generally to be hoped that the present liberal government of Spain will voluntarily adopt that view. . He, referring to our relations with China and ' Japan, the President - recommends provides for maintaining .four American youths In each of these Countries as a part of the diplomatic family of our Ministers. OUli 

FINANCES. i i " l lie irives details of the revenue received in the past year "and of the reduction to the amount of over one hundred millions of the public debt.- He expresses a . doubt whether any further reduction in taxation is practicable for the present and he recom mends that no more legislation be had ou that subject except to correct errors of omission or of commission in-the present laws until sufficient time shall.have elaps ed to prove that it can be done and still leave sufficient revenue to meet the cur rent expenses, to pay interest on the pub lic debt and to provide for the sinking fund. He suggests, also, that the currency shall be as soon as possible brought to a par with Gold. 

INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS. He says that various enterprises will be brought to the attention of Congress for the cheapening of the transportation of produce from the Wet to the Atlantic sea coast, and Suggests ? that steps- should be taken to gain all available information to ensure equitable rind judicious legislation. In this connection he refers favorably to the proposed route to connect the' Missis sippi Valley with the Atlantic at Charles ton and Savannah, by way of the Ohio and Tennessee Rivers, also to the proposed extension of the Kanawha and James River Canal qid he Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, and to the proposed canal around Niagara Falls. He says that there should be an almost continuous system of land locked navigation from Maine to the Gulf of Mexico, nature having provided 1. a greater part of the . route and the obstacles to bo overcome being within the skill of, engineers. OUR NAVY' AND COMMERCIAL 3IAH1NK. He calls attention to the weakness of the American navy and endorses the coc ommendations of the , Secretary of the Navy in that, respect. He recommends subsidies for steamship lines to Brazil and between San Francisco, New Zealand, and Australia ; also an increase of the salaries of heads of bureaus. He favors the abo lition of. the franking privilege and rec ommends a modification of its existing ievilw. He also recommends the adontion j by Congress of the best method of acqui ring title to all telegraphic lines now.in operation, and of connecting that service with tho postal service. It is not proba ble that the subject can receive proper con sideration at this session, but he thinks the movement might be iniatiated so that future action may be had fair to the gov ernment, and to the private parties con cerned. . He calls attention to the alarming falling off in the Amer ican carrying trade, and pays that a yearly expenditure of five million dollars for the next five years to restore that trade would be a profitable invest ment. THE KUKU'X AND THE INDIANS. Referring to KuKlux outrages,the Pres ident expresses his conviction that the time is not far distant when the obvious advantages of good order and peace will induce an abandonment of all such com binations, and when it will be unnecessary to carry on prosecutions or to inflict pun ishment in order to protect citizens from the lawless men of such combinations. He makes suggestions in regard to the Indians, that they shall all be confined to the territory South of Kansas, and that farms be secured to them in fee and severalty. He recommended that a further census be taken in 1875, but that no reapportion ment of members of Congress be made un der it in only one of the territories. A ULOW" AT POLYGAMY. Utah is in a condition of affairs regarded by the President as unsatisfactory. It had seemed to be the policy of the Utah Leg islature to evade all responsibility to the United States Government and even to hold opposition hostile to it. He recom mends careful revision of the present laws and the enactment of laws that will secure peace, equality of all citizens before the law and the ultimate extinguishment of polygamy. Ho reeommenus an appropriation to re imburse the city of Washington, for work done in front of the public reservations and for the embellishment of the public building. and grounds. He favors action to give greater eclat and success to the ob servance of the Centennial Anniversary of American Independence. . . In' regard to Cival Service, he says he will carry out the rules during his term of office, but suggests that there should be the direct acting of Congress to make the system binding on his successors aud to secure to the public service a practical method of obtaining faithful and efficient officers and employees. Tho reading of the message was complet ed at 12:50 i. M., having occupied one hour and twenty minutes, , ; fc'L'CRETAIvY 

JJOI T WELL'S REPORT. The Treasury report says that necessity exists for a new issue of national bank notes. The Secretary exonerates Assistant Treasurer Hillhouse from neglect of duty in the stamp division defalcation in the Assistant Treasury aj New Yrork. The Secretary again recommends the passoge of a bill to amend and consolidate the navigation and customs collection laws of the United States. As the leading pur suits of the country are now stronger than ever before, in the possession of adequate capital and a supply of intelligent laborers there may be a moderate reduction from time to time in the rate of duties as the diminishing expenses of the Government shall permit without either alarming at that or injuring labor. He says the circulation of the banks should be fixed and limited and that pow er to change the volume of paper in circu lation within the limits established by law should remain in the Treasury Depart ment. A degree of flexibility in the volume of currency' is essential for two reasons. First the business of the Department can not be transacted properly if a limit is made and the power to raise tho circula tion above or reduce it below that limit is denied. Secondly', there is a necessity every autumn for moving the crops with out delay from the South and West to the seaboard that they may be in hand for ex port and consumption as wanted. The problem is to find a way of increasing the currency for moving the crop and dimin ishing it at once when that work is done. This is a necessary work and inasmuch as it can not be confided to the banks the power should be retained in the Treasury Department. Believing that the country is not pre pared to sustain the policy of contraction the Secretary considers the means by which the value of our currency may be improved. The basis of a policy of im provementsmust be found in a steady re fusal to add to the paper in circulation un til it is of the same value essentially as coin, this being accepted as the settled pur pose of the country, there can bo no per manent increase of the difference between paper and coin, and an opportunity will be given for the influence of natural causes, tending upou the whole to a better financial condition. All legislation limit ed in its operation to the paper issues of the Government, whether bearing interest or not, and which in its effects shall tend to diminish the market value of coin, will be found upon analysis to contain a plan for contracting the volume of paper curren cy, and all legislation so limited which does not contain such a plan will prove in effectual. " . The Secretary, without proceeding to the discussion of the general subject of resum ing specie payments, thinks all will have been gained that is of value, when the treasury shall be prepared to pay the de mand notes of the Government in coin, and the banks shall be prepared to pay their notes either in coin or legal tender notes, and then our good fortune will clear ly appear in this, that our paper currency is not exclusively of National' Bank notes, nor exclusively of United States notes. THE DTIXG WIFE. The following beautiful piece of poetry was" s out id us ; by j "A Header? of the Cubokicib, suggesting that in view of the late sad bereave ment in our city it would be appreciated by many readers. We cheerfully give it place and thank "a reader' for his or her thoughtfulness: L-y the gem upon my bosom, Let me feel her sweet warm breath ; For a strong chill o'er me passes, And I know that it is death. : , ' I would gaze, upon the treasure . Scarcely given ei e I go Feel her rosj', dimpled lingers Wander o'er my cheek of snow. . I am passing through: the waters," r y But a blessed shore appears ; Kneel beside me, husband dearest, Let me kiss away thy tear". Wrestle with thy griet, my husband, Strive from midnight unto (lay, It may leave an angel's blessing When it vanishes away. Lay the gem upon :nybosonv ? ?z ' 'lis not long she ciirj be. there See! how to my heart she nestle? , , 'Tis the pearl 'I love to wear. : . ' If in after years beside thee, Sits another in my chair, Though her voice be sweeter music, And her face than mine more fair; If a cherub call thee "Father i Far nioro beautiful than this, Love thy first-born ! oh ! ray husband ! Turn not from the motherless. Tell her something of her mother You may call her by my namo! Shield her from the winds of sorrow ! If she errs, oh ! gently blame. Lead her sometimes, where I'm sleeping; I will answer if shocahs, .-P ' -And my breath will stir her ringlets, When my voice in blessings falls, Then her soft, black eyes will brighten, And shall wonder whenee it came, In her heart when years pass o'er her She will find her mother's name. It is said that every mortal Walks between two angels here ; Unc records the ills, but blots it, If before the midnight drear Man repenteth if uncancelled,. Then tho right hand angel weepetb, Bowing low with veiled e es. I will be her right hand angel," Sealing up the good lor neaven ; 1 Striving tbt the midnight ;watches Fixed no misdeeds unforgiven. You will not forget me, husband, When I'm sleeping 'ncath the sod ! Oh, lovo the jewel lo us given, As I love thee next to God ! TH. PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. We give in this issue of the Chronicle a synopsis of the President's Message as read to the two Houses of Congress yester day. Like allf ff President Grant's state papers it is written-in a plain, straightfor ward style, vigorous, sensible and pointed. On all questions legitimate before Congress or the people it speaks out boldly and une quivocally. He favors a postal telegraph, maps out a grand system of internal im promvements to bind the Lakes and the Gulf; wants to increase our merchant ser vice on tho Ocean ; proposes to cany American ideas to the far Eastern Empires of Asia, and asks Congress to aid him in establishing for the country a perma nent and practical reform for the Civil Service. He expresses the hope that the South may be forever rid of law less bandits, and favors a grand canal to join the Ohio and Father of Waters with the Atlantic at Charleston. This project, if carried out, would aid largely in re-naturalizing the South, by joining its commercial interests more directly with the Central States of the North. The message will be read with interest everywhere, and the people will take from it new assurances of the President's deter mined purpose to give us in the future as in the past an honest administration, one that will tend to re-unite our people into a homogenous, prosperous nation.

Packers re fused to pay the askingprices in most cases, and holders were very firm in their views and unwilling to concede anything. At the other yards the pressure to sell caused many holders to accept lower prices, the market closing dull and weak at about ?3 73 to 3 00 for bacon hogs. At Cincinnati on the LHJth, the report was as follows : There has been a large increase in the re ceipts since Monday, and . prices declined about 2-5o. per cental, closing dull, with sales at $3 G5a3 S-5 gross, for common to prime, and some left unsold.
