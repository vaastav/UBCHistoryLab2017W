The tt?kes came down thick nnd fn-t for it *?hort time but ceased too coon to eaootirage the br*pe Of ftoytbiug likte good fclei^hiojr. It cnme, however, while ft diilcornp. in cMrtiedi* covering with the ro*'c ?>t i uriiy. roofv tree, pavement and field Alike. As the white winged messengers from the clouds fell thick and fast, and as they kissed tbe cheek in their descent low wbispering might have been beard if you had listened atten tively. "To the young and gay they mur mur of winter's delight?of the dashing ride behind quick glancing hoofs and "jin gularly" bells?of social gatherings where love speaks love to eyes which return the salutation, and all goes merry as a married belle?of the substantial pleasures of the thanksgiving turkey, the Christmas stuffed chicken, and the baked goose of the New Years' table. To those whom years have sobered, and who, ceasing to eojoy the present and anticipate the future, receive their greatest delight in recalling the past, the snow flakes whisper of the olden time, when the blood waB young in the veins and gave a responsive glow to the wooings of pleasure. They lore to recall the winters they once knew, and if they seem heedless of the Hakes that touch their cheek, it is because their thoughts are traveling swift* lyover memory's railway, back to those halcyon scenes which the falling snow re calls. The old times rarely come back again, but so long as memory consents to occupy a front seat "in this distracted globe," we cau go back to the old times, and nothing causes one to take that well-trod den route as readily as tbe first snowstorm of winter. There are those on whose cheeks the airy snow-flakes strike like blows from an an gry fist. They are the destitute poor. Tbe falling snow brings tbem no anticipations of pleasures to come, for they know that winter will add to their sufferings, and if they are reminded of tbe past it is of past misfortunes and privations. The liny white particles that bring smiles to the faces and light to the eyes of many, pro duce in others far different results; and scowls are seen instead of smiles." 4?* A Goal Thibf Pkppkbbd.?A gen tleman residing in tbe Third Ward has been a great sufferer in the loss of coal. A few daya ago be discovered, much to his astonishment, that it took about twice as much coal to do him as usual and be had fewer fires going. On Sunday night be accidentally discovered an individual walk ing away from bis coal bio with a bag fnll of black diamonds upon his shonlder. Tbe owner of the coal said nothiog at tbe time, but tbe next day be loaded up an old musket which be had used in drilling with the miiitia, and filled it to the muzzle with rice, pepper and beans. He laid in wait on Monday night but the thief did not come. On Tuesday night, however, as tbe solitary sentinel was standing watch in full view of his coal house be heard stealthy footsteps approaching. Grouching in his hiding place he permitted tbe thief to enter the coal bouse, fill his gunny bag, and as the rascal was in the act of shoul dering tbe diamonds, drew up tbe musket and aiming at the rear of his burley person, drew the trigger and let fly! The thief jumped about fire feet high, carrying the bag with him, and while up in tbe air gave a roar like a wounded lion and fell upon the earth kicking and struggling like a person in the last agonies of death. The gentleman supposing that there might have been a bullet in tbe musket and that he had killed the man rushed up to tbe 8truggliog thief and spoke to him. The fellow upon hearing the voice was sudden ly revived and jumping to nis feet scam pered away with the rapidity of the winged winds, leaving bis bag, which was tied at the mouth with a dirty pocket handker chief bearing the name of tbe gentleman whose coal house he had been robbing, perhaps, for weeks. The fellow had black ened his face with soot so effectually that the gentleman, (being somewhat alarmed by tbe thought that he had killed tbe raseal,) did not recognize him. taSf-KsLEi?i!> Pruoxku.?Ten released prisoners from Camp Chase reported them selves yesterday to the Governor and were ?ent on to their respective homes. Quite a number of the Western Virginia prison ers?those wno were arrested for minor offences?hare been, or will be ieleased. Many were arrest^ for discouraging en listments. It was thought necessary to abridge the liberty of such persons. The necessity no longer exists and the prison ers have been released. In many instan ces, we regret to say, men have suffered confinement without sufficient cause, but at the time the arrests were made, it was I next to impossible to get at the facts. In times like these, as in times of peace, ma ny comparatively innocent persons suffer while the gnilty escape. We are glad to ?ee that the facts in relation to these ar rests are being diligently enquired into, and to be assured that justice will be done, as far as may be, in all cases. Athbx.vum.?There are now only about seventeen prisonera in the Ath enaeum. They are still coming io In con siderable numbers, but they ar# seat on to Camp Chase the same day they arritfei or as ?ooa thereafter as possible. ?^Th* Upi^AirTamrpr appeared last flight at Washington Hall to a delighted ?tad appreciative auditneej 1o Bellini's pop. alar opera of La Sounambuln or the Vil ?ag? Phantom, which was produced with signal aod brilliant effect. It Is a beautiful piece, and almost indlscrlbable. It was produced with superb scenery and ingeni ous mechanical devices which together with the capital acting of the respective artists engaged in it created a sensation which has had few if any equal on the Wheelingatage. The performance concluded with Mrs. Par tington, or Home for the Hollidays, in which the charming little Julia as Ike, kept her tudience in one continual out-burst of laughter and Applause. At the request of man/ friends the same programme is re produced for this evening, and we are con tident that the announcement will be a welcome one to that portion of our citizens who wish to avail themselves of so pleasing a source of entertainment and instruc tion. The Uiykk.?There were about six feet five inches water in the channel of the Ohio yesterday and rising. TheBaker.and Ingomar were tb* only arrivals. The Pittsburgh DUpatch of yesterday says: The weatbnr during the past twenty-four hours has been very changable, with rain, snow, and cold winds at intervals. The river continued to swell rapidly yes day, and last evening there were six feet by the pier marks, and still ristog* The Allegheny river is again in good navigable condition, and the Belle and Echo left for Oil City, with full trip. There had not up to four o'clock last evening, been any arrivals from below, although quite a number are due.? The Key West, Starlight, Melootte, Empire City, Americus, Kenton and 8henango, will doubtless arrive to-day or to-morrow. Capt. Mason's new boat, the St. Patrick, had arrived at Cincinnati from Gallipolls. She is expected here this week. Slippkrt ?The anow which fel( yeaterday gave occasion to the youth of the citj to resurrect their last year's sled ges and commenced the exhilirating and exciting exercise of sliding upon all of the inclined planes capable of being converted into tracks. Broken shins and excoriated backs are nothiug In comparison to the amusement which the boys derive from these wild rides. Country chickens sometimes get their toes frozen. The sidewalks were so slip pcrjr yesterday that the aclion of-pedeatri ans in moving along the streets might have likened unto fowls thus afflicted. J?9*Thie Bluk Blouses.?The Provost Guard were going about yesterday strip ping civilians of the blue blouses which are so plentifully worn by citizens. Whenever a citizen is seen wearing the blouse he is stripped at once. Yesterday a contraband was stripped almost to the buff, and several other parties were deprived of different parts of the uniform. In many cases the most intense indiguation is manifested by parties who are thus deprived of the blouseB. ? ? fjjy Tun following parties supposed to be in or near this city are wanted at the office of the Provost Marshal: Edward Frender, Co. FT.a 6th Virginia Volunteers. fgnatius Pappert, Co. H., Gth Virginia Volunteers. Win. B. M'Murray, Co. D., 2nd Virginia Volunteers. If arrested, they will he treated as deser ters. T. Scott & Co.?It-is scarcely necessary to call the attention of the read er to the flaming advertisement of J, T. Scott and Co. The readers who "can't see it" must be near sighted indeed. We bcattily commend this enterprising firm to all who want anything in their line. Their stock is as large and excellent as it is va ried uud choice.

AFTKR\00\ DISPATCHES. Withdrawal of Union troop* from Frederickiburg Nxw York, Dec 17.?The morning pa pers are filled with detailed accounts of Saturday's fighting of too extended a na ture for telegraphing. They contain no real newa but comprise mainly incidents relatlog to the affair. The Timtt gljes the following account of the withdrawal of our troops trom Fredericksburg:? It says the movement commenced at dark on Monday night. All the sick and wound* ed were removed during the day to hospi tal tents this side. Gen. Burnslde inspected the position of the troops in the afternoon and the general activity indicated another Ibattle as immi nent. Surgeons were ordered to be in readiness to care for a large number of ad ditional wounded. The withdrawal of onr forces, however, was determined on at council Of nil corps commanders. During the day the undertaking was regarded as perilous but if successful would resene the army from another battle which would ac complish little except destruction of valu able lives. The troops had received no intimation of retreat and had laid down their arms for the night when order was given to fall in, the troops supposed it was for a night as sault on the enemy's works and were not undeceived until they found themselves on pontoons crossing the stream. The Bridges covered with earth to dead en the sound of Artillery. High wind and darkness prevented the rebels from hearing or seeing the movements. Franklin's division moved as soon as it was dark, also Sumner and Hooker's from under very heavy guns of the eoemy. Many officers and soldiers expressed great regret, saying they preferred dying in front of the rebel batteries. Very few wounded were left on the field. Two Brigades occupy the town as advanced pickets, and our Ar tillery on higher bank, will co-operate in keeping possession of the place. Our heavy guns opened on the rebel batteries on Tues day morning, eliciting little response. The Times' correspondent thus describes the rebels position our forces were ex pected to storm and take: There is a bare plateau of a third of a mile which the storming party will have to cross. In doing so they will be exposed to the fire, first of the enemy's sharp-shoot ers posted behind a stone wall running along the base of the ridge, a double rifle pits on rise of the crest, heavy batteries behind the strong field works that stud the top of the hill, a powerful iufantry force now lying concealed behind these, of a plunging fire from the batteries on the lower range, and of a double enfilading fire from cannon to the left of them. Se bastopool was not half so strong. The Times1 account of the battle show* that Hooker's grand division was on this side of the river antil 4 o'clock. At 4 o'clock Iloooker, who had not yet been across the river, proceeded over, remarking to a friend that be was going "to pat the thing through." In half an hour a prodig ious volley of musketry announces that Hooker with the reserves is engaged. This last assaulting column consisted of the divisions of Humphrey, Monk, Howard, Getty and Sykes. They uad hardly got fairly engaged, however, before the son went down and night closed around the combatants From Tennessee?Movements of Jeff. Davis. Nashvillk, Dec, 15.?A special to the Tribune says : Jeff Davis promoted Morgan to a Major General. The latter in a speech appealed strongly for the defense of Southern rights asserting that Lincoln's Proclamation was reducing the whites and negroes to an equality, and that he was glad Kusecrans was superceded by McGook. His speech was elicited by aserenadeat Ready's house where Morgan was married by Bishop Polk to Rendy's daughter. There is a large number of negroes at Tullaboma. The Governor of Georgia was j sending up men. Bragg issned an order to conscript every exiled Kentuokian and Tennesseean.? Breckinridge, Buckner and Hansen, threat ! ened to resign if this was done. Jeff. Da | vis took the matter under advisement.? There is a great hostility on the part of Kentnckians and Tennesseeans against j Mississippians. | A despatch from Ool. Bruce at Russell ville, confirms the reported disbanding of Woodward's Cavalry. The Murfreesboro (rebel) Banner of the 15th says: Jeff. Davis left Murfreesboro yesterday for Mobile. The Banner says that while the visit of Davis to the west possesses no military significance, it will have an Inspi ring effect upou the people and troops* Thousands will feel reassured of auccess, and strike hands again in determination to maintain glorious Arkansas of liberty. HBADQtTABTBB8 ARMY OK TUB POTOMAC, Falmouth, Dec. 17.?Yesterday morning the enemy seemed astonished to find as on this side of the river. About 9 o'clock the enemy advanced skirmishers along the line and established pickets near the river bank. We had a large number of dead lying on what was regarded neutral ground, and the rebels were plainly seen robbing the bodies At 11 o'clock ladies were seen walking in the atreets of Fredericksbunr. Oo Monday, Franklin lent a flag or trace for an exchange of dead, which was done. Yesterday Lee sent a flag of trace to Burnside asking him to detail men to bary his dead in front of Sumner's division.? Daring the flag of truce the rebel General Stuart, in answer to a question, said that Banks had gone South, but did not know where. Our entire army is now eucamped on the ground previously oconpied. It has been I considerably reinforced. It is the opinion of military men that it we had taken the first ridge of the rebel works, their opportunity for slaughtering us would hare been greater then previ ously. No troops in the world conld with stand such a concentrated fire of ordnanee and musketry. Suocefttfttl Foraging. Fobtbkss Moitrok, Dec. 15.?A. foraging party sent out from Vorktown last Friday, returned this morning with large droves of cattle, sheep and swine, having been very successful. The Richmond Examiner, of Dee. 10th, says, yesterday the detectives seised and detained a large lot ot goods valued at $10,000. The goods had entered Rich mond via. Petersburg, from Norfolk, and were owned by Thomas Smith, dry goods merchant of Norfolk. Smith was placed under arrest for disobedience of orders in forwarding goods to Richmond. He gave bail. A Tot Of coltoo goods and other ar ticles of prime necessity, were seized at the same time and belouged to ihe same lot. The advance of the enemy on both sides of Abbieville, made it necessary for Pens bsrton to withdraw bis whole force to Grenada to prevent the enemy from gaining hie flank and rear. LA8T NIGHT'S DISPATCHES. XXXVHth CongTMs?2nd Session. HOUIK. Washington, Dec. 17. Mr. Bingbam introduced a bill amenda tory of tbe confiscation acta, ao that io all casea pending or wbicb may hereafter arise, wherein ao y ship, Teasel or any other prop erty mar be condemned, tbe Court render ing judgment, shall before making awarda first providing for the payment of anyfrona jide claims filed by any loyal citizen or friendly foreigner, where proof of claim can be established. Referred to Committee on Judiciary. Tbe House then passed tbe Senate joint resolotion instructing the Committee on the conduct of the war to report thereon with all convenient speed. Mr. Stevens from the Committee on Ways and Means reported a bill makiog appro priations for invalid and other pensions, but its consideration was postponed till Monday next. Mr. Stevens also reported a bill to sup ply tbe deficiency in appropriations tor 1863. which was made the special order for Tuesday next. Tbe House then went into Committee of the whole on tbe President's message. Mr. Noel, of Missouri, argued that the present organized Democratic party did not render an unqualified support to tbe war, but was continually throwing obsta cle! io tbe way of its prosecution. He undertook te say that it was a delusion to think that this war might have been pre rented by tbe adoption of tbe Crittenden Compromise. It was true that some of tbe leaders of tbe rebellion had voted for that compromise, but the history of sub sequent events shows that if tbe 10 or 12 votes bad been necessary to defeat that measure tbey could have been procured. He would go further and say that there was nothing in the Crittenden Compromise that would have prevented theflrebellion. Tbe enemies of the administration held oat the idea that the war was not for tbe resto> ration of peace, but tor tbe abolition of slavery. But this was untrae, tboogb sncb migbtjbe the result. They assert that tbe administration tramples on tbe Constitu tion, and all tbe rights and privileges un der that instrument are to be swept by tbe board, and that the Union is to be coo I tended for without tbe Constitution. He I had witnessed some of these so-called vio I lationBof tbe Constitntion. When the war broke out the enemies of the country were not confined to rebel States but were scat tered all over the land. Never was a conspiracy so well concoct* ed. Notwithstanding the opinions of Judges Taney and Story as 10 tbe Presi dents being guilty of a violation of tbe Constitution in suspending the privileges of tbe habeas corpus, he justified President Lincoln in doing so. It was his duty to , use all meaus to suppress the rebellion. Confiscation of rebel property, is anoth er pretext for making war on the Adminis tration. Men of tbe Border States, who have been trampled in tbe dust, take it as unkind that the euemies of the war expend their sympathies only upon the wives and cbildred of men engaged in the rebellion. The border States wish to see retaliation visited on the rebels (or their crimes.? Again tbe enemies of this war exhibited a frightful picture of tbe financial condition of tbe country but those who got up tbe rebellion are responsible for every drop of blood, every dollar of extraordinary expen diture, and for all irregularities commit ted. Mr. Noel proceeded to contrast tbe coarse of tbe anti war party of 1812 with that of tbe present aay, insisting that tbe parallel was perfect. In this connection he quoted was tbe po sition of the Federalists of Massachusetts at that time. Mr. Thomas, of Mass., interrupting said, if tbe gentleman from Missouri desired io anyjway to give character to the class of men whom both of them condemned, j namely, tbe peace Democrats, be could not have pursued a more effectual course for tbe old Federalists of New England were tbe most honest and patriotic party that ever lived beneath the throne of God. Mr. Noel resuming said, be started with the proposition that tbe present organised Democratic party was inconsistent. When slavery comes io as an element of rebel strength and the question is presented be tweeo its population and preservation of tbe Union, then let the former die. He would so act that io suppression of tbe rebellion that slavery sboald never produce results similar to those how witnessed. He was against compromise with men who were now endeavoring to break up tbe government. He would agree to nothing but absolute submission on tbeir part. He spoke tbe opinions of tbe straight ont loy al men of the border States. In conclu sion be advocated emancipation in border slave States. He stood by the government, by such men as Andrew Johnson. There were but t?ro parties, one for war, the oth er for compromise. He would not lend himself to any scheme to produce strife among people, to deride national conneils, and weaken and unnerve tho arm of tbe government and strengthen the cause of tbe enemy. The Committee rose. Tbe resolutions under consideration were reported and agreed to. They refer various branches of tbe President's annual message to appro priate committees. Adjourned. The Arkantaa Victory. St. Louis, Dec. 17.?Gen. Herron tele graphs that Geo. Curtis'* victor/ at Prairie Grove was much more complete, and the enemy's loss far greater than first reported. Over 1500 rebels were killed and buried by as. Tbej were fonnd scattered tbiongb the woods for miles in the rear of tbeir posi tion, wbere tbey bad been carried dnring the action and left when tbej retreated.? Many consequently died for want of atten* tion. Oar Cavalry pursued tbe retreating rebels closely, driving them beyond Van Briren. Tbe position and condition of our forces are excellent. The campaign has been most brilliant, reflecting great credit on tbe officers and men of tbe army of tba frontier. PdiLADiLFBfa, Dec. 17.?a en. Meagher's wound was slight. Be was atrnck by a spent ball in tbe tbigh. It is reported that Brig. Gen. Lyle, of tbe 90th Penna., ?ras killed. Tbe Philadelphia fr?i publishes a dis patch from Born tide to Hal leek, received at 9 o'clock last night. Bam side says i feeling fully convinced that the position ' in front could not be carried, and it was a military necessity either to attack or retreat, for a repulse would bave been dia astrous under tbe circumstances, tbe army was withdrawn without the loss of a man or property.

Important From ^ -triniTU Fitettitillk, Ark., *U. Eluou, Dec. 17.?The following Additional particular* or the battle at Prairie Grove, hare been received. The official report pats tha loss in killed and wounded of Oen. Herron's command, at 843; in Geo. Blnnt's 152; totai 995. Latest accounts increase the rebel loss to 2700 killed and wounded and nearly 6,000 bj desertion; and 35 commissioned officers of Herron's command killed or wounded. Latest information bj spies, places Hind man on tbe south side of the Arkansas river with all his infantry and artillery.? Marmaduke is on the north side, with a beavj cavalry force. Our outposts are within 20 miles of Van Buren. The forage south of Boston Mountain is said to be entirely consumed. Great activity prevails in \he federal ar my. A campaign of much interest is on the tapis. Gen. Herron had only 3,500 men in the battle. The remainder of bis foroe failed to come np on account of excessive fatigue. Maj. Hubbard, l?t Missouri Cavalry, who was a prisoner in tbe hands of the enemy the day of the battle counted, twenty-two regiments of Infantry, ten regiments of Cavalry, twenty.two piccct of Artillery on tbe retreat. Hindman yesterday bad the impudence by a flag of truce to request the privilege to send a topographical engineer, to make a drawing of tbe battle field of Prairie Grove and its approaches. Gen. Blunt replied be would grant the requrst, when be was al lowed an engineer to make a sarvey of Van Bureo and surroundings. Important from Washington. Special to Cincinnati Commercial. Washington, Dec. 16.?There is not as much gloom here as people at a distance would be led to imagine from tbe events of tbe last few days. Prominent members of the Administra tion declared to-day that there would be no winter quarters for the army, and that inaction will not long succeed the late clash of arms. There is great doubt about tbe President signing tbe bill admitting Western Virginia. Senators understand he has grave consti tutional objections to tbe bill. Secretary Smith retires from the Cabinet on tbe first of tbe new year, and will, with out doubt be succeeded by Judge Holt, though some Indiana politicians aspire to the position. Affairs on the Rappahannock. Headquarters Army or the Potomac, Dec. 17.?Tbe weather is cold, with a northeast wind. Last night the uuemjr increased their en. trenebments on the terraces in the rear of Fredericksburg and threw up rifle pit* near the river on the left of the city.
