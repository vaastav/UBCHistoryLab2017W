The production of gold is on the increase in the United States. In the three greatest gold producing areas, Colorado, Alaska and Cali fornia, the yield in 1908 was nearly six millions more than in 1907. The total yield for the.se districts was $62,000,000. Reports from other countries indicate a similar increase. In his recent message President Taft attributes the prevailing high prices in part to the constant production of gold. Without doubt there is a direct relation between prices and the volume of gold, but whether this is sufficient to explain the excessively high prices on most of the commodities which increase the cost of living at the present time is open to question. The savings made by the sugar trust in defrauding the government should have led to a reduction in the price of sugar but it evidently did not. THE 

TARIFF COMMISSION FORMED. President Taft said at Winona thai one reason why he signed the tarilf bill was that it gave him an opportunity to appoint a tariff com mission that would go into every essential fact 'about tariff making. This commission, he believed, would have work enough to do during the remainder of this administration, when, presumably, the country would be ready for another revision based upon scientific data. Some members of the senate have tried to scare the president off this track by representing that the tariff act did not give him power to appoint a roving commission of experts, but merely a board to ad vise him whether any country was unduly discriminating against the United States. But the president docs not seem to have receded. Re (•ailed in the members yesterday and gave them a talk which indicated that they will form a real tariff commission. Senator Hale and some members may think tjiat the president is going farther than he was authorised, but they will learn when con gress assembles that the choice is between the acceptance of the presi dent's commission and a protracted debate over the Beveridge bill. The president may be playing high politics in going ahead with the broad commission idea. He will be able to show that he is saving the time of congress, and merely anticipating what congress iteslf will eventually have to do by sending out the commission to "make a glos sary of the tariff." instead of confining it to discriminations. —Minne- apolic Journal.

DECEMBER 9, 1909 ASKS COIN FOR IRRIGATION SENATOR BORAH OF IDAHO IN TRODUCEB BILL IN CONGRESS ASKING FOR $30,000,000 IN 8 PER CENT BONDS. Washington, Dec. 9.—Provision for a $30,000,000 revolving fund to be used in the completion of gov ernment irrigating projects is made in a bill introduced today by Senator Borah. It provides for the issuance of 3 per cent bonds to the amount named, payable out of the reclama i tion fund at any time not earlier | than 10 years from date of issue and | not later than 20 years.' The irrigation commission, which ! visited virtually all of the projects | during the summer and fall, has not ! indorsed the Borah plan and a sharp | controversy is expected in the ef ! forts to have it enacted. Senator Borah declares the public land fund, aggregating revenues of I about $9,000,000 a year, is sufficient !to complete within a reasonable time the many projects under construc tion. The Borah bill does not contem ] plate any appropriation from thei j treasury for the redemption of the bonds.
