Sai fe Mew RexiGan ThE NEW MEXICAN PRINTING COMPANY Entered as Second-Clasn matter at ihe Santa Fe PoBtnfflce. . The New Mexican is the oldest news paper in New Mexico. It Is sent to ev ery postofflce in the territory, and has a large and growing circulation among the intelligent and progressive people Tf the southwest. FRIDAY, DECEMBER 0. New Mexico Dciniimlc State beotl of tlie anil Coiijirenn. Or Right and In Justice New tlexlco Should Mo State. The fact" thaThaving been born in Ohio seems to be no longer a sure pass-port to federal office. Times change. Lord Kitchener reports that he needs more soldiers. No doubt about that. This has been apparent to the average looker-on for some time. Undaunted by defeat -Mr. Croker now aspires to be chairman of the Demo cratic national committee. When Mr. Croker wants anything he is none too bashful to ask for it. A St. Paul man knocked his wife down with a poodle dog and now the St. Paul newspapers are fighting over the question, which animal suffered the worst. The Democratic leaders and states men in New Mexico have the best of the Republican leaders and statesmen in one respect. They need not worry about the offices. Colonel Jack Chinn, of the sovereign state of Kentucky, says he no longer carries a pistol. If this is true the colonel has given up active participa tion in Kentucky politics. Copies of the same old charges against Governor Otero have been filed again. The men behind these charges are evidently of the opinion that a He well stuck to is as good as the truth. Work on the isthmian canal will be gin in less thatf-a year. It will mean the employment of thousands of men for a number of years and the expen diture of about $200,000,000. One or two of New Mexico's citizens now in Washington -are doing the ostrich act, but that does not prevent knowledge of their doings and actions In due course of time this will become apparent. There are still some Texas Demo unts in the house of representatives who have received no knowledge of the fact that the silver question is dead. But then Texas is such a great state that news there travels slowly. When it comes to getting up a row the Democratic members in the nation al house of representatives are all right. They do not have much to quarrel over, but what little they have they do up in good style. Indian agents will soon be scarce. They are to be superseded by superin tendents of Indian schools, these lat ter to be in the classified service. This is a change that it is believed, will prove of material benefit to the Indian service. On account of a rate war, the railroad fare from Colorado Springs to Cripple Creek has been reduced from some thing like $8 to 10 cents. It seems the railroad combinations have'nt as yet extended to the region around Colora do Springs and Cripple Creek. Mayor Seth Low announces that he has selected the man who is to be po lice commissioner of New York City. The new police commissioner announc es that the first thing upon taking of fice will be to remove the Tammany chief of police. This is as expected. Reports sent to the New Mexican by its correspondents in various sections of the territory show conclusively that times are prosperous and that the population of New Mexico Is steadily Increasing. What is more, people ex pect these good times to continue. Officials of the department of justice have been gently reminded by the at torney general not to take too active part in politics and not to take or re ceive money for campaign expenses. The administration seems to be in the civil service reform movement in dead earnest. Delegate B. S. Rodey informs the New Mexican that he will keep up hi3 fight to obtain statehood for the terri tory. The people of New Mexico are with the delegate in this matter, and that without reserve. They want Btatehood and want It as soon as it possibly can be had. Signs of the times are that the pres ent prosperity in the country will ob tain for some years to come. One sign in that direction is that the great Pennsylvania Railway company will build 400 locomotives during the year 1902. There must be good business ahead. No effort should be spared to appre hend and convict the men who enter ed a store in Lincoln county, killed the proprietor and his guest, looted the store and then set it on fire. It is one of the most atrocious crimes committed In late years In New Mexico and should nnt ern unaveneed. Lincoln county should offer a reward for the capture of the robbers ana murderers. After allowing for the slight deficit In one or two minor funds, which could not have been foreseen by the last legislative assembly there Is a surplus of-between 6,000 and $7,000 In the terri torial treasury at the end of the 52d fiscal year. There are 35 per cent of taxes for that year still to be collected. It certainly looks as if prosperity and economy are going hand In hand in the management of territorial affairs dur ing Governor Otero's administration. Captain Perry of the United States battleship Iowa, held Colon just long enough to protect American interests, and to show the Colombian govern ment that the United Stales means business whenever the time arrives. He did the right thing at the right time. A resolution has been introduced In congress by Hon. William H. Moody of Massachusetts, to investigate election methods In Louisiana. It is not only Louisiana election methods which should be investigated however, but also the disfranchisement of thous ands and even millions of voters in the whole south. It is to be hoped that the Investigation, if one should be made, will not be upon a sectional ba sis nor intensify the race feeling which unfortunately still exists in the south. The Stephens bill has been introduced in congress again with the familiar provision that there shall be no appro priation and storage of the waters of the Rio Grande or its tributaries to which others have right by prior ap propriation. As the proposed internat ional dam is to claim right to all unap propriated waters of the Rio Grande and its tributaries, the fate of New Mexico would be settled by its passage for no additional reservoirs could then be built along the Rio Grande or any of its tributaries such as the Santa Fe, the Pojoaque, Santa Cruz and scores of other streams tributary to the Rio Grande. - Naturally New Mexico must fight such a proposition tooth and nail. Governor Otero has appointed W. M. Robbins of Hillsboro, sheriff of Sierra county, vice J. C. Chandler, the present sheriff, who has resigned to go Into business at San Marcial. Mr. Robbins is an old resident of Sierra county and a well known and respected citizen and fully competent to perform the du ties of the office to the satisfaction of all concerned. Mr. Robbins is a Re publican in politics. He was highly recommended by the leading and in fluential citizens of the county, who spoke of him in very complimentary terms. He Is engaged In the mercan tile business at Hillsboro. He will take office on the first of January, 1902, as it will take him that length of time to qualify and furnish his bonds. Major W. H. H. Llewellyn of Las Cruces, is now in Washington, on u project whereby the Mescalero Apache Indians in Otero county are to receive certain lands of their reservation in severalty, the remainder to be thrown onen and added to the public domain for homestead settlement. Major Llewellyn is thoroughly posted upon the question and it is believed that the time to carry this project into effect U now at hand. The Mescalero reserva tion contains many thousands of acres of fine timber ' land and it is stated much mineral land. Throwing the ma jor portion of this reservation open to settlers under the homestead laws and to prospectors under the mineral laws would prove of material and speedy benefit to Otero county in particular and to New Mexico in general. The census of 1900, according to a bulletin just issued, shows the remark able fact that only two per cent of the men of voting age who were born in the United States of foreign parents are classed as illiterates; while of the white men of voting age in the country born of native Americans 5.8 per cent are illiterate, while of the native negro men above voting age 47.3 per cent are illiterate. This shows that, as undesir able as was the large per cent of the immigration which came to the United States in the past decade, the children of immigrants generally make good and intelligent citizens. The nation as a whole is a direct gainer by immigra tion and while it is wise to restrict Im migration, it would be unwise to ex clude It altogether or even to draw th-s line of restriction upon too narrow a basis. Should the Stephens or Culberson bills to build an international dam at El Paso become law the person who would take out any additional ditch or build an additional dam in the Santa Fe river or any other stream in the great Rio Grande valley, would be fined $5,000 and be sent to the peniten tiary for one year in addition to hav ing his works taken out of the stream. President Roosevelt has given posi tive assurance that he will sign the New Mexico statehood bill should it be passed by congress. New Mexico has a number of friends at work, in-r-iurilngr Senator Elkins, who will help Delegate Rodey and the New Mexico statehood delegation to push the ena bling act through congress. It is pos sible however, that New Mexico will be the only territory to receive state hood from this session of congress ana that Oklahoma and Arizona will have to wait another year or two. That there is an end to the -race issue in sight is again shown by the census figures which prove that the white pop ulation of the south is growing at a much more rapid rate than the negro population. Thus, there are now just about as many negroes in Pennsylva nia as there are In Missouri, although twenty years ago Missouri had twice as many colored people as Pennsylva nia. There are now more negroes in Massachusetts than there are In Dela ware,, which twenty years ago had 50 per cent more negroes than Massachu setts. New Jersey has doubled its ne gro' population while In Maryland the white population has in twenty years increased 230,000 and the colored popu lation only 15,000. Virginia in twenty years has gained in round figures S12, 000 white people and only 29,000 negroes. North Carolina gained 400,000 white nponle and only 93.000 in negro popula tion. Tennessee has gained 400,000 white neoDle and only 77,000 negroes Missouri has gained 922,000 white peo ple and less than 16,000 negroes. Ken tucky has gained almost 500,000 white nennle and only 13.000 negroes. These figures should be taken as evidence' that the race problem is not destined tn continue formidable, from a political, social or industrial standpoint. There are only two states, Mississippi ana South Carolina, where the negroes outnumber the whites and in South Carolina the white population is grow In so much faster than the black that in twenty-five years the Caucas ian race will predominate. - .. 11 . 1 i
