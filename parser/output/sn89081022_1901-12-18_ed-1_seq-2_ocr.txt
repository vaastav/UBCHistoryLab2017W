BEPOBT OF EOCKHILL Special Commissioner Tells of His Negotiations with China. a Pl ayed toy he Unite State In he S of in he Kast—Report Submitte to Congress Washington Dec. 1 2 he long ex pected report of Special Commissioner Rockhill to the secretary of state on the results of his in connection with the Chinese negotiations in Pe king has been submitted to congress along with the full text of he protocol which has been already published and a mass of detailed statements I as upon this report that the president based his commendator reference to Mr. Kockhill's work in his recently pub lished message to congress. Beginning by detailing the condi tions under which he came to be ap pointed in July, 1900, United State Commissioner to China Mr. Rockhill tells of visits he made to the viceroys of Shanghai and Wuchang which, he said, did not a little to further the in terests of peace. Mr. Rockhill says that he further concurred in all the meas ures that Minister Conger had been and was advocating. These negotia tions extended' over a period of 14 months and Mr. Rockhill thus sum marizes the results in addressing Sec retary Hay "The circular note which you telegraphed on July 3, 1900, to our embassies in Europe and to our missions in Vienna, Brussels, Madrid, Tokio, The Hague and Lisbon, de fined the policy already then adopted by the United States in the settlement of af fairs in China and from which they never departed. Bearing these instructions al ways in mind| the task of the agents of our government in Peking was a comparative ly easy one. Throughout the negotiations our object was to use the influence of our government in the interest of justice and moderation and in a spirit of equal friend ship to the powers negotiating jointly with us and the Chinese nation. "The 12 demands made by the powers on China, the accomplishment of which was deemed necessary for the restoration of normal relations with that country and which were embodied in the joipt note of December 22, 1900, may be classified under four principal heads: "l. Adequate punishment for the authors of and those guilty of actual participation in the anti-foreign massacres and riots "2. The adoption of measures necessary to prevent their recurrence "3. The indemnification for losses sus tained by states and foreigners through these riots: and "4. The improvement of our relations, both official and commercial, with the Chinese government and with China generally. Save Many Heads I "As regards the punishment of the re sponsible authors and actual perpetrators of the anti-foreign outrages, the govern ment of the United States, while insist ing that all such should be held to the utmost accountability, declined to deter mine in every case the nature of the pun ishment to be inflicted, and maintained that the Chinese government itself should in all cases carry them out. Owing to efforts of the United States towards mod eration, the demands for capital punish ment were finally reduced from ten to four, and many names, erroneously or on insufficient evidence, placed on the lists, were removed, or lighter forms of punishment asked for numbers of those left on them. "While seeking with the other powers the best means to prevent the recurrence of such troubles and to guard in the future American residents in Peking from such dangers as they had passed through, the United States did not lend its sup port to any plan which contemplated either the prolonged occupation by for eign -troops of any portions or points in China or the erection of an interna tional fort in the city of Peking from which to carry on friendly relations with the Chinese government. Our policy has always been in favor of a strong, inde pendent and responsible Chinese govern ment which can *and will be held ac countable for the maintenance of order and the protection of our citizens and their rights under the treaties. Through out the negotiations we strictly adhered to this just principle, with results which have proved beneficial to all. he I it "As regards the third point of the ne gotiations, the equitable indemnification of the various states for the losses and expenses incurred by them in China and in sending expeditionary forces to relieve the legations and foreign residents at Pe king and restore order, and also the se curing of indemnities to societies, com panies and individuals for their private losses through the anti-foreign riots? the government of the United States advo cated that the sum total of these in demnities should not exceed a reasonable amount well within the power of China to pay. "Though it became necessary, after pro tracted discussion in the conference, to accept the proposition of the other pow ers to demand of China the sum total of their losses and disbursements, reach ing the enormous sum of $333,000,000, over insistence in pressing for a much lower sum, and the weight of the arguments adduced' in favor of such a policy, re sulted in closing the indemnities at the above lump sum, when they bid fair to' go on swelling indefinitely. This and the acceptance of your suggestion that the indemnities be paid in bond& issued at par and bearing a low rate of interest (four per cent, was finally agreed upon), and running for 40 years, resulted in sav ing a vast sum to China, hastened the evacuation of the country by the expedi tionary forces and the restoration of or der and of normal relations with the Chinese government. All Affreed on Last it "No divergence of views existed for .tunately between the representatives of the powers on the question of Improving the channels of direct communication between them and the Chinese government. The long vexed question of the ceremonial to be observed in the public audiences grart ed by the emperor of China to foreign rep resentatives was finally settled by the plenipotentiaries on lines 'perfectly satis factory to all parties to the negotiations. The taujig-li-yamen, or bureau of .foreign affairs, which the experience of 40 years had shown Chinese and foreigners alike was unwieldy and Incapable of discharging the duties devolving upon it. was altered in the way suggested by ,the conference, changed into a responsible ministry of foreign, affairs and organised on lines sim ilar to those adopted In-every other coun try-of'the world. "Such, in brief, has been the role played by the United States in the conference of Peking. While we maintained complete in- f* .^^|5 dependence we were able to act harmoni- ^§p, ously in the coneert'of powers the existence 4^1 of Which was so" essential to the prompt and peaceful settlement of the situation, we retained the friendship of all the nego tiating powers, exerted a salutary influence in the cause of moderation, humanityand justice, secured adequate reparation for Wrohgs done our citizens, guarantees for their future protection and labored suc cessfully in the interests of the whole world in the cause of equal and impartial trade with all parjts of the Chinese empire."
