South Caroline* free-trade being thrown on the heap, might stay in the Union four years more. EXPLANATORY AMENDMENTS. Sir. Buchanan's proposition to settle the pending difficulty between Freedom and Slavery, by incorporating the Breckinridge Platform into the Constitution of the Uni icdStates, in “three explanatoiy amend meats,” is not vciy likely to be accepted by the Republicans or Douglas men of the Nonk TVequote from the Constitution itself, to show the popular ordeal through wliich the proposition will be forced to pass, before it accomplishes the purpose in* tended: “The Congress, whenevertwo-thirdsof both houses phnll deem it necessary, shall propose amendments to this Constitution, or, on the S plication of the Legislatures of two-thirds of e several State*, shall call a Convention for proposing amendments, which, in either case, shall be valid to all intents and purposes, as part of this Constitution, when ratillcd by the Legislatures of three-fourths of the several States, or by Conventions in three-fourths thereof os one or the oilier mode of ratification may be proposed by the Congress.”—Comiitu tion,AH. r. In neither one of the ways pointed out for the amendment of the Constitution, can "Mr. Buchanan's proposition be carried. In the Lower House of Congress, the be lievers in the Breckinridge Platform are in a meager minority, as they arc in the Leg iSiaturcs of sixteen free States; hence the scheme will not be able to advance a single stop; but if, by the complacency of the law makers, it should bo referred to the people for.their decision, it would never be seri ously beard of more. The men who have .given Lincoln 183 electoral votes hy unpre cedented majorities, would see to it, when electing members of a Convention, that the Breckinridge heresy had but a feeble rep resentation in that body. That Sir. Bu chanan submits a plan so ridiculous, is evi , donee of the ignorance of popular sentiment, and of the demands of good government, winch has made his the most disgraceful Administration known in American poli tics. THli KANSAS SCARE. "We were informed, some days before the explosion of the Kansas mare's nest, by a gentleman whose means of information arc usual y good, that Capt, Montgomeiy had not been away from his farm, except on peaceful errands, for a twelvemonth. We were Informed further that the whole dis turbance in Southern whatever it amounted to, was committed by Jennison, and sixteen men associated with him; and that their movements had been confined to the sum mar}’ arrest and execution of three or four kidnappers and desperadoes. This statement, so much at variance with the letters, dispatches and rumors from the scene of the alleged conflict, we did not sec fit then to publish. But it turns out ihal our informant was substantially cor rect There is no evidence that Montgom ery has been engaged in any lawless enter prises whatever. There Ls no evidence that the officers of the United States have been in any way molested, interfered with or threatened. There is no evidence that any persons engaged in lawful avocations have been put to death. But there is abundant evidence tliat President Buchanan has ap pointed a lunatic to the Important office of *‘Judge of the Tliird Judicial District, Kan sas Territory,” and that the telegraph au thorities have appointed another as opera tor or news agent at Warsaw’, Missouri. These seem to be the net results of the outbreak—not very important indeed, con sidering the damor wich has been raised, but nevertheless acquisitions to the stock of human knowledge. Doubtless Jennison and Ills sixteen men committed grave crimes—for whidi w’e trust they may meet the full peajdty of the law. Heinous as we deem the crime of man-stealing to he, *wc cannot excuse or exculpate him who takes the law into his own hands—more especially where he follows it up by the summary execution of his victims. But where, we ask, arc the four hundred men in buckram who levied war against Mis souri three weeks ago? Where arc the smoking villages which they left in their devastating march? Where, oh where, arc the gallant legions which SL Louis sent forth to hurl back the invading foe ? When last heard from they wore toiling slowly, wearily on, in search of the four hundred phantoms, with empty stomachs and sore beds. Probably the number of those who curse the fools that sent them on such a chase, is exactly equal to the roll call of the army. And we doubt not the St Louis Hepuhlican is the best abused newspaper in that corps of misguided •warriors, that ■ever issued from the American press. But lids affair has a serious os well as a ludicrous side. If the. news-mongers and letter writers in and around Warsaw, Mo., are not to be believed as to matters trans piring in Kansas, it is to be presumed that they know what is transpiring at home. And if they are to be believed in this re gard, a considerable portion of Western Missouri has incontinently taken flight. Towns and farms have been deserted; car avans of men, cattle and household goods have beat driven into the .Interior. Large gangs of slaves have been sent away from the border. The whole country round about has been thrown into a panic. What is the meaning of all this ? Are thcpeoplc of thafscction such cow ’ ards as to run away in droves from sixteen jn&randera? Arc they so naturally timid as to take fright from groundless and im - probable rumors? We have hud a better opinion of the average bravery of the An glo-Saxon race. .We know of border pop ulous which would calmly await the on set of-iony forcc”which 'might be mustered against them from a neighboring Slate, and let the hardest fend off We know of few communities in- our jjlder" settled . States -which would betray such symptoms of in grained fear from the threatened invasion 'of new -an’d ‘-sparsely settled Territory. In point of tot, Kansas behaved herself much better whfen Missouri not only threatened but actually Invaded Jxer. She fought it .out and maintained her ground from the beginning to the lend.' 'What is it then, which has no undermined and extinguished .the native valor of our brethren in West ern Missouri ? Is it the presence of slavciy among them ? From this distance U looks pp indeed. : 

PERSON AL LIBERTY BILLS. The President in hla message arraigns the Personal Liberty Bill, enacted by some of the free States, as the greatest among the “outrages” perpetrated upon Southern rights. The dlsunionlsts of' the South as sign to these laws, no less prominence in the category of causes which they assert furnish cause for secession. It is assungdt hat they are an outgrowth of Republicanism, that they are unconstitu tional, that they nullify a law of Congress, and that they are so highly offensive to the South as to afford ample ground for a vio lent disruption of the Union. Itwillnotbc amiss to examine these various grounds of complaint, with the view of ascertaining whether they furnish any justification of the course adopted by the secessionists. 1. It is]not true that these Personal Liber ty Bills were first adopted by Republican Legislatures. Some of them date-hack more than a quarter of a century. A ma jority of them were adopted by Whig and Democratic Legislatures. The Ohio Taw was enacted In 1831; the New Jersey law in 1840; that of Rhode Island in 1848. On the adoption of the last-named law, only one-third of the Whigs and less than one-seventh of the Democrats in the Legis lature voted against it The Massachusetts law was not adopted by a Republican Leg islature; and some of its most stringent features were on the point of being repealed by a Republican Legislature, when the bru tal assault upon Senator Sumner by Brooks, of South Carolina, effected a change of their purpose. In each of the States named, there have been both Democratic and Whig Legislatures since the enactment of the laws In question, but In no instance has any attempt been made to repeal them by either of these parties. 2. It is only oflaleyears,'and since the dis unionists per se. have sought for a pretext to cany out their that objections have been raised against these Personal Liberty Bills. The decision of the Supreme Court of the United Stales in the case of Prigg vs. The State of Pennsylvania, dear ly recognized two principles which appear to lie at tho basis of all such State law.*, 1. That the legislation of Congress in re lation to the rendition of fugitive slaves, not only superseded all State legislation up on the same subject, but “by neccasay im plication prohibited it” [See 17 Petess, page 017.] 2. That the State Legislatures may prohibit all State officers from aiding in the .execution of the Fugitive Slave Law. [See 1G Peters, page 022.] And this last point seems to cany with it the right of the States to withhold the use of their jails for the confinement and safe-keeping of fugi tives. At all event-, these Personal Liber ty Bills were recognized in their ear lier history as in perfect acccord with the above named decision of the Su preme Court, and the South acquiesced in them without a word of protest. So much for the histoiy of these laws and of the sup posed constitutional right of the Slates to enact them. 3. But it is now said that they arc un constitutional. The President, in his last Message, goes even farther Ilian Hits, and asserts that they are “Null and Void.” If the President is right, he places his politi cal friends in the attitude of attempting the disruption of the Union onnccount of amcrc nullity. But suppose the laws to be unconsti tutional, as is now claimed—is secession the remedy? The South can certainly trust thisjnattcr to the decision of the Supreme Court as it is at present constituted. And if the Supreme Court decide against the constitutionality of the Personal Liberty Bills, no one of the States in which they exist will attempt thereafter to enforce them. 4. But it is further said that they arc in the nature of nullifying laws—that they practically’ defeat the execution of the Fu gitive Slave Law. How? Has not the Federal Government the ability to execute a law of Congress, unless it can have the co-operation of State officers and the use of Slate prisons ? To assume that such is the fact is, to say the vcit least, a poor compliment to the efficiency of our Gov ernment. But admit that it is so—is seces sion the remedy ? South Carolina once at tempted to nullify the laws of Congress> but General Jackson, with the aid of Con gress, soon brought the refractoiy Shite to terms. Cannot the Executive and Con gress do the same now with respect to any free State that may attempt nullification V Nay, in the fact of their greater loyalty to the Union, is it not reasonable to infer that the free States would much more readily abandon the ground of nullification, in response to the demands of the constituted authorities, than would any of those South ern States which have been so long restive within the Union, and solicitous for a pre text to get out of it ? 5. But if these laws arc neither uncon stitutional, nor of the nature of nullifying enactments, then, according to all received notions of the doctrine of State rights, tiic States which have adopted them have an indefeasible right to maintain them; and it is a gross impertinence, an unjustifiable breach of Stale comity, and in derogation of popular sovereignty, for any other Stale to ask their repeal With the citizens of the States which have placed these laws upon their Statute-books, it is a mere ques tion of choice and expediency whether they retain them or not It is their busi ness, and theirs alone, and they would be unworthy of freedom if they tolerated any outside interference. 6. That they may be offensive to some of ihe people of the South is probably true. There is a class there who, like the Irish* man at Donnybrook Fair who begged some one to tread upon his coat-tail, are exceedingly anxious to have offence given them. But it cannot be that the slavehold ing Slates generally regard these laws in any such light. If they did, we should have heard of it long ago. They would have complained as soon as the offence had been given. Nor should wc now find upon the statute-books of some of the slavehold ing States just as stringent Personal Liber ty Bills as the most “offensive” of those complained of by the secessionists. Vir ginia has a Personal Liberty Bill which, if taken as a pattern by the free States, would add much to the stringency of their present laws. But admit that they are “ offensive” to the South—what then ? Is the fact that one State enacts a law which is “ offensive” to another State, a sufficient ground %or thi latter to secede from the Union? If this doctrine be admitted, the free States ought to have seceded long ago. There are fifteen States of this Union by whose laws men and women and their posterity forever, are compelled to hopeless life-long bondage, than which nothing can be more abhorrent or “offensive” to the people of the free Stages. Nevertheless the latter have bowed to the doctrine of State sov ereignty, and have never once assigned these offensive laws as a justification for se cession. It remained for the Secessionists to promulgate a doctrine which, if lived up to rigidly, would at once explode our con federacy and forever prevent any two of the States from uniting again under a com mon government. —Such are the conclusions to which an analysis of this sabject most inevitably lead. The whole thing is the result of an after thought—a mere trumped-up pretext for contemplated treason and for new demands upon Northern servility. We do not pre sume to pronounce upon the constitution ality or the expediency of these laws. It is not necessary that we should. Illinois has not adopted them, nor has she the right or the desire to interfere with those States that have. As a constituent member of this Confederacy, it is enough for her to know, that if any of the .States have been wronged, they’have a fall and complete remedy under the Constitution and within the Union. Let those remedies beapplied if there IsJhe least occasion for them; if .there is not, let the Secessionist*citherhold their peace, or have the manliness to-put their action upon the true ground. Let us hayo no mors whining over grievances that may be remedied, if they have an exis tence, and no more hypocritical pretences for bald and unmitigated treason. IN OP AN 

ENEMY. Hardships of Hie Missouri Militia* Tbs largo force sent by the Governor of Mis souri to drive back certain mythical invaders from Kansas, arc having a rough time.. Wo quote from tbo Missouri Democrat' t article, headed “ The Military Expedition This huge blunder Is still persisted in, ns tbe correspondence of the morning papers but too plainly sb. ws. Tet Oov. Stuart must have abundant information that the Commonwealth over which he presides is wholly Intact—has not been invaded, nor is in any danger of be ing invaded. The reconnoissancc made by Col, Snyder, and which Is reported by tele graph lids morning, officially establishes these essential points, and gags the foolish newspa pers which have been trying to manufacture a panic out out of the yams spun by Judge Wil liams. As for as Missouri Is concerned, the story of the fugitive Judge turns out lobe pure fiction; but the t'to ardent soldiery 1 of St Louis found it anything but a joke. It' is known that the rank and file arc travel soiled, fotigued, foot-sore, and in many Instances, lamed and sick. Were they Rus sian Zouaves, equally accustomed to the rigors of an arctic climate, aud severe physical exer cise, these forced marches in December, alter nating with days of comparative inertia, would use them up, tiAry mau... The lino of country along which they arc moving, necessitates, we arc told, such marches; but that fact should have served to restrain the rashness of the Commander-In-Chief and the General In com mand in precipitating them forward. We ven ture to say that such prodigal and wholly use less waste of human energy and military ar dor has not been witneaseom the country from the beginning, as this Southwestern expedi tion. The men arc experiencing all the hard ships of war. unrelieved by anyone of its Illu sions. What do we sec ? Six or seven hun dred men marching, in the depth of winter, through the enow, over mud roads interspersed with half-frozen sloughs, carrying heavy knap sacks and muskets, and sleeping at night on the cold frost-baked ground, yet so fcvcicd by the exhausting toils of the day that tbe plunge lor relief Into the ice-running streams as soon os a halt Is ordered. No doubt it Is very heroic; but what good will it do—what useful purpose will It serve, we ask ? The disciplining of our citizen soldiery, answers a writer in the Buße tin, who would doubtless shrink with horror from the shower bath these mornings, how ever much bis brain-pan might require such an application. Sitting at home by tbo fire, we may be os loud os we please In praise of the worth of discipline; but fatigue, hunger, lameness and sickness are very ugly focts, and very aggravating ones to the sufferers, not withstanding all that theoretical ascetics and stoics may say to the contrary. Common sense always demands that the cud proposed to be accomplished should bear some proportion to the efforts and sacriliccs made to attain it; but efforts and sacrifices directedtono object, orto one confessedly impossible, arc a pure waste of force, and as little to be applauded as any oth er senseless extravagance. Some undertakings which fall, compensate for their failure by the Incidental benefits resulting from their prose cution ; but ibis military undertaking can be productive of no incidental good whatever to those on whomitsprinclpalburdcns fall,much less t ’ the end for which it was ostensibly or ganised. We told the soldiers at the outset that it would place them in a very absurd po sition, and we doubt not they realize the truth of the prediction now. They must be conscious that the whole thing isacolloseal humbug, springing from tbe barbaric vanity of certain Generals and Colonels. Neither Montgomery nor any of bis gang lias dared to come inside the Stale line. It is therefore Im possible for Gen Frost and bis command to chastise or capture the bold outlaw, while it Is* but certain Gen. Harney will do both. We must thcrcfojc continue to protest against a movement which can accomplish nothing bnt to subject the State to heavy expenditure, and the citizen soldiery of St. Louis—the flower of our population— to great physical hardship. 

FBO.TI WASHINGTON Various Facts and Speculations [Special Dispatch to the N. Y. Time?.} Washington, Bee. 2.18C0. A quorum of both branches of Congress is present, and business will therefore commence at once. All the New England, Pennsylvania, and nearly all the Western, New York and Cot lon State members have arrived. Senators Chesnut and Hammond arc nut here, and will not be. South Carolina will not reappoint them nor choose successors. There arc two hues of policy marked out and discussed in political circles respecting the course to be pursued by the Republican and Democratic parties in Congress at the opening of the present session. Among the Republi cans, one Is to propose compromises, aud make leading conciliatory speeches, as men tioned in the dispatches vesterdnv; the other to maintain silence aud allow the South to speak, and, if possible, let the two parties from the South discuss the matter themselves, and settle it among themselves exclusively. The Union party in the South is strongly represented on the floor of Congress, aud tlTey having all their interests involved, can speak freely and without fear of provoking their op ponents. But it is feared that the Southern men, both for purposes of intimidation and effect,will pursue exactly the same line ofpohey, keeping silence, and declaring, in the language ofthclrlcadiug urators.that “the lime for words i» iiast—they desire and intend immediate, un compromising action. The Union men of the South, however, will not permit this on the part of either party. They have deter mined to call for prompt explanations, and a settlement of the present ditllcultics between the North and the South, aud will put bolh sec tions on the defensive, thereby making them speak. Such 1 find to be the opiniou of lead ing men with whom I have conversed. It begins to look as though a majoritv of the Republicans would compromise in any honorable way; but Keit, of South Carolina, says distinctly that South Carolina will not compromise except upon her mm terms; that she will not yield an iota; that she desires ser>- aration, peaceably if she can, forcibly if she must," All the Republicans I have talked with any they will not yield the right to take Slavery into the Free Territories; if it comes to that iw»nc alone, all the Cotton States may go and welcome; neither will they yield the re-opening of the African Slave-trade, nor the right of Mr. Lincoln to the unanimous support of the country, aud to make up his Cabinet as he sees tit. without explanation or reservation. I am satisfied that they will bland firm and unflinchingly by their party principles, al though the lael stares them In the face that the Cotton Stales will, beyond doubt, attempt a rupture and nullification. Every one looks so ber, in view of the great events which must probably soon transpire. Many gentlemen think the present session will not continue three weeks. This is not plausible, however, as supposlngnll the South ern members retire, there will elill he a quo rura, and business will proceed. A resolution already prepared will be thrust in at the earliest moment, declaring the right of a State to secede at will. The preamble sets forth the grievances put upon the South bv the North, aud the necessity for an independ ent Government. The whole subject will thus be opened. It is urged by some, however, that the movement Is undignified, and it mar he abandoned. The resolution would be over whelmingly rejected, and the South Carolina members would then withdraw. It is not vet settled who shall Introduce it. No State will vote unanimously for secession but South Carolina. An attempt will be made by the Republicans to get the Appropriation bills through first. Several gentlemen advise the withholding of the pay of members until these bills pass. Mr. Sherman, Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means, is fully pre pared to press them. Several persons appeared yesterday sporting the cockade and Palmetto, although most of those possessing them have sense enough to carry them in their pockets. The new badge to be worn on the coat is a silver Palmetto with a blue background. It is neat and showy. Mr. Leach of North CarolinS says his State will stand by the Union under all circum stances. Mr. Bouligny, of Louisiana, says all his cor respondence indicates undivided Union senti ments, and that the North can no more repeal their obnoxious measures under threats than the South can remain in the Union under force. Messrs. Anderson of Missouri, Adams of Kentucky, and Burnett of Kentucky, are stronglyUniou. Messrs. Nelson and Etheridge sav that Ten nessee cannot be forced out by actual Northern aggression. It is stated on the best authority that Messrs. Cobb and Thompson have Instigated the re ports that they were going out of the Cabinet to keep themselves before the public, and at tract attention from the condition of the Treasury. Cobb’s report is not ready, lie can no longer cover ap his miserable failure, ex cept by a new loan, aud, In the present condi tion of affairs, it is doubtful if the loan would be taken. The Republicans hare generally decided to maintain silence as to secession, as it cannot properly be discussed until some action af fords n cause for it. The Pacific Railroad Committee are ready to vote two lines of road—one Central and the other extreme South. This may have some condliatiug effect. A revised tariff bill has been prepared during the recess by several gentlemen well acquaint ed with the subject. The “ Marsellaisc” has been adopted as the air of the revolutionists, with the hope, proba bly, of cxcitiug the sympathy and friendship of the French people.* The nullifying acts in the Georgia Legisla ture arc creating a reaction against them here. Testimonial to Col. Baxeu.— -The San Francisco correspondent of the New York World relates the following incident, which will bo read with interest by the numerous friends of Col. Baker living in this city: ‘ Hon. E. D. Baker; the new Republican Sena tor from Oregon, was among the eastward bound passengers to-day. On the night of the Bth instant, (November,) CoL Baker "was pre sented with a magnificent set of silver plate from the merchants of San Francisco.

It was not a testimonial to political prominence, but simply a compli mentary token to a gentleman who has done much for the advancement of the literary In stitutions of San Francisco. The plate bears ths following inscription : “ Presented to E. D.

IVOW AND THEN. NULLIFICATION IN 1832 AND SECESSION IN 1860. Ucvlnr of the History of the Kalllfl* cation Movement In 1832—Public Sentiment at the South Then and Now, [From the X. V. Times.] Those whose lives have been so protracted as to enable them to remember the crisis of 1833-33, cannot fall to be impressed with the various points in common, and points of con trast, between thb events of that period snd those of the present day. Acting upon con victions of more or less'sinecrity and Intensi ty, South Carolina twenty-eight years ago felt herself compelled to question the impartiality and Impugn the authority of the Federal Gov ernment, and misinterpreting and misapply ing the platform of Southern Republicanism contained in the Virginia resolutions of 1798- 99, asserted the right of a State to set at defi ance the enactments of Congress, and, if nec essary, to withdnnvfrom the Confederation. The origin, character and event of the conflict provoked by those positions throw so much light upon the actual condition of things, that It cannot be otherwise than instructive to re call their leading historical points. THE 

TARIFF OP 1810. The nullification contest of 1833 bad Its sonreo In that sectional jealousy which seems now to have reached Its culmination. Upon emerging from the war of 1812 with Great Britain, with some glory, but withthcachievc ment of the objects for which the war was de clared, the principal result of value left to the American people was the lesson taught by its deprivations through the long period of non intercourse, the embargo, and the actual con flict. Without any individual resources at the commencement of this epoch, throughout this period of commercial suspension, the utmost inconvenience and even suffering were felt for the want of the necessaries and comforts for which the country had been dependent upon English factories and markets; and all classes and all sections joined in the demand for the adoption of such measures of encouragement to home industry, ns In any similar contingen cy should render ns Independent. The protec tive Tariff of 3SIC was the product of this na tional wont. Adopted with the free consent of all the States, it at once gave the anticipated impetus JLo domestic manufactures; but ow ing to the peculiarities of Southern labor, and the superior enterprise, energy and ingenuity of the Northern States, it was soon found that the impulse was felt almost exclusively at the North, while the South, by Us absence of com petition, Lad simply exchanged dependence upon Old for dependence upon New England. It was also asserted that the enhanced price mid for the commodities of Northern manu facture, under the tariff, was paid by the con sumers at the South and elsewhere; and an additional reason for jealousy was discerned In this fact. There were not wanting Southern orators to point to three pence extra upon the yard of cotton cloth, which the South had to pay for the advantage of Hie North; and the Impossibility of obtaining a ton of Welsh iron without a tribute of five dollars to furaaccmeu in Connecticut or New Jersey. At each suc cessive revival of the tariff during the Admin istration of Presidents Monroe and Adams, these complaints became louder; and were accompanied, on the part of leading men from South Carolina, with threats of nullification, and new doctrines of State rights pointing to the policy of secession. THE 

TARIFF OF 1823. The protective tariff of IS2B gave a fierce and more menacing tone to these popular mutter ing The election of Andrew Jackson, with Mr. Calhoun upon the ticketas Vice-President, in the fall of that year, served to calm the ex treme agitation—-for Gen. Jackson was chosen upon the strength of his opposition to tbuAd :uu*’policy; while Mr. Calhoun, who had. In 1816, been the foremost advocate of protec tion, had now avowed his predilections for Free Trade. In those days, the revision of the tariff was a prime electioneering Instrument, put to use invariably on the eve of a Presiden tial contest. Prior to the quadrennial discus sion of 1832, an event had occurred which alarmed the South. A personal quarrel had taken place between the Vice-President and the Chief Magistrate, arising out of events which had occurred during the administration of Monroe; it had produced a rupture of the Cabinet, and a violent pamphlet controversy. It also gave rise to a faction in Congress, known as the friends of Mr. Calhoun, whose prominent doctrine was Free Trade. The ef forts and the threats of this small but formida ble faction were not without effect in procur ing some trifling reduction in tbc tariffof July 14,1832; but the concessions were insufficient to satisfy a population, who, for merely politi cal purposes, had been inflamed beyond the possibility of sudden calm; and besides, it was the hope of Mr. Calhoun and bis friends, hv keeping the agitation alive until November, to turn the election unfavorably for Gen. Jackson. This desire was all the stronger, for the reason that Mr. Calhoun had been refused a renoml nation for the Vice-Presidential chair, that honor having been given to Mr. Van Karen, the object of especial vengeance with the Cal houn party, which regarded him as the subtle source of its humiliation, and as the “ Mordc cai who sat within the While House gates.” The cries of Free Trade and State Rights were therefore kept up with all practical vigor; and the South was given to understand that both these cries would have to be hushed, should General Jackson, a staunch Unionist, cam'the election. THE 

FIRST CONTENTION. On the 25th of October, 1832, summoned by the advice of Mr. Calhoun and Gen. llayue, and by the call of Gov. Hamilton, the Legisla ture of South Carolina met iu special session, aud passed a law authorizing a State Conven tion to be held, a month later, to consider the action proper for the State, in view of the usurpations of the Federal Government. The Convention met, Gen. Jackson having in the interm obtained the popular vote tor the Presidency, aud at ouee, Nov. 24, adopted uu ordinance, reciting the hardships resulting to the State from the revenue laws, especially the Acts of May 19,1823, and of July 14,1832: re viewing the fruitless efforts of South Carolina to procure some mitigation of those oppres sive laws, and declaring that nothing was then left but resistance. The method of resistance was set forth. The Acts iu question were de claret to be null and void. It was made a penal offence for a Federal or State oflicerto attempt to enforce them after Feb. 1,1833. The Legislature was required to pass laws to protect the citizen in Ills refusal to pay duties. An appeal in any civil action arWng before the State Courts was in no ease to to go to the Supreme Court of the United States. And any attempt of the Federal Gov ernment to enforce the revenue laws, either by armed force or by closing the ports, was to be considered a severance of the ties which bound South Carolina to the Union, and os au thorizing a resumption of her sovereignty as an Independent State. The ordinance was ac companied by a justificatory address to the people of the United States. gov. Hamilton’s message. The adjournment of the Convention was fol lowed, Nov. 27, hy the meeting of the Legisla ture, to whom Gov. Hamilton, in submitting the ordinance, delivered an Inflammatory ad dress. The wrongs suffered by the South at the hands of the North: the 'special acts of legislation complained of; the propriety of having well undestood that should the United Statespersist in collecting revenue after Feb. 1, 1533, that South Carolina would secede; the necessity of authorizing Custom-House clear ances by the State; and of levying an army of at least 12,000 men, were prominent topics of the Governor’s Message. The Legislature re sponded to its suggestions. A series of acts was passed,providing for “the security and protection of the people of South Carolina.” authorizing an oath of exclusive obedience to the State laws required by the ordinance.” and a variety of other enactments of a revolution ary character. JACKSON'S PROCLAMATION. In the mean time, the Federal authorities had not been unobservant. The annnal Mes sage of Gen. Jackson, Dec. 4, 1832, had briefly rclerred to the course of events in South Car olina, adding a pledge that the laws, at the proper time, should be duly enforced, and ex pressing his belief that 'the Constitutional powers of the Exaentive were suflicicnt forthc crisis, without legislative assistance. On the 10th of the same month appeared the Presi dent’s Proclamation to the People of South Carolina, in which he argued the question of nullification and secession; and gave his judg ment strongly against the right In either ease; and after warning the people to desist from their revolutionary plans, he declared his in tention to use the utmost power assigned him to enforce obedience to the laws. -THE FORCE BILI Iu the meantime, Gen. Haync, whose une qual contest in the United States Senate with Mr. Webster, is bis principal claim to recol lection, had been Inaugurated as Governor. In bis address on the occasion he employed all the eloquence with which he was so richly gifted, to inflame still further the spirit of re sistance, and bis proclamation of December 20, in response to that of the President, after re-stating the arguments relied upon by the imllificre to justify their views of the Federal compact and its obligations, bade the people take arms in preparation for the that was plainly inevitable. While, however, the enrollment of troops under this invocation was proceeding very slowly, the President was ac tive in moving troops and vessels to the vicin ity of Charleston, and In otherwise demon strating bis resolute intentions. On the Hth of January, 1833, Mr. Calhoun laid on the ta ble of the Senate absolution calling upon the President for information with regard to the South Carolina difficulty, with copies of all collateral documents. Two days later these were sent In, accompanied bya message enter ing with detail into the historical and consti tutional question connected with the subject, and suggesting at the same time some conces sions to the demands of the South, and some additional measures for strengthening the bands of the Executive, antecedent to a final appeal to arms. The latter suggestion gave rise to the measure very absurdly styled the “Force BUL” It was a*measure Introduced hythc Administration party, authorizing the President, In case the collection of revenue should be interfered with at any established port of entry, to close such port, and to trans fer the Custom-honsc to some other point. It also gave protection to United States Marshals In the performance of their duties. This bill became a law March 1,1833, three days before the dose of that Congress. TUB 

QUEST COMPROMISE. It was preceded, however, by another meas ure, of a pacificatory character, the parentage of which was due to Mr, Clay, and its success to Mr. Clayton. On the 12ih*of February, ISIS,, the former Introduced Into the Senatca'billfor the modification of the tariff, which became known as the Compromise bill ' It provided for the gradual redaction of the dnties to a revenue standard through a period of eight yean and a half. A violent but not prolonged contest ensued. Mr. Calhoun and his partisans were brought to Us support, by a knowledge that the President contemplated the arrest of that leader upon a charge of high treason, and a demand forhis impeachment. Mr. Webster, sustained by other Northern Senators, opposed the bill, because they believed it derogatory to the Federal Government thus to make conces sions to rebels with arms In their baud?. The bill, however, passed both Houses with slight amendment, and became a law Feb. 25, 

EFFECT OP CONCILIATION. In the presence of this conciliatory legisla tion, the vitality of the nullification movement disappeared. There was still a display of mil itary, and a profusion of cockades; but the revenues were collected on and after Feb. 1, end South Carolina did not secede. The Inter mediation of Gen. Scott, who was promptly sent to Charleston, in a partly martial and partly mediatorial capacity, did much to pre vent collision; and the knowledge that the idea of concession bad been suggested by the President, and accepted by such men as Clay, Clayton and Calhonm did still more. The storm gradully subsided. It was no longer necessary to maintain on extraordinary armament at Charleston. Gov. Hayno dismissed his troops, with a rhetorical flourish on the victory they had gained over the Federal Government, and the winter of Southern discontent bad before May of 1833 yielded to a glorious summer. South Carolina boasted of its triumph over the North; it was only Mr. Calhoun and a few of the more Intelligent of his party who under stood howmneh had been sacrificed, and bow transient was the security they hod gained. In thus hastily recapitulating the chronolog ical data of this period, we have refrained from measuring the popular sentiment then preva lent by what we witness to-day. It will better serve onrpnrposc to present this aspect of the .subject singly. 

THEN AND NOW, The actual movement at the present time at the South presents the entire body of the peo ple of South Carolina In a state of hostility to Federal authority, and determined to throw off its yoke. In the grievances which are al leged os the origin of this determination we find fifteen Southern States sympathizingwith more or less Intensity; while in Alabama, Florida, Mississippi and Georgia, there seems to be a practical unanimity in favor of follow ing at once the lead of South Carolina. In the remainderof the Sontbem States the disunion sentiment, though not in the ascendant, has obviously a very wide and dangerous preva lence. TOE 

DIFFERENCE. In 1832, however, the case was greatly dif ferent. Then the cause of discontent was as at present, a jealousy of the North, and a belief that the burdens of Government were unfairly distributed, andThc rights of the South disre garded: and the remedy proposed was anala gous; for, when challenged to draw a distinc tion between nullification and secession, the leaders of the movement were constrained to admit the phrases to be equivalent. But the remedy now so generally approved was then accepted by a mere handful of the Southern people. In the Congressional election at Charleston in the fall of 1832, the nullification candidate, the editor of the Mercury - then, as now, the organ of secession—was elected bv only 130 majority. The Charleston Cvurur was a strong advtftatc of the Union. A Union State Convention was held at Columbia, Sept. 12,1832, at which multitudes were present, and nullification was denounced chiefly because it was subversive of the Constitution and of the national liberties. A irreat popular Union meeting at Columbia, OcL 25, used even vio lent language In condemnation of the nullifi era; and at Lancaster Court House, in the month of December, a mass meeting, presided over by Major Gibson, an influential planter, protested in energetic terms against the ordi nance of nullification, and approved the coer cive measures threatened by Gen. Jackson. Among the leading men pledged to the cause of the Union were Chancellor Harper, Joel K. Poinsett, CoL Drayton, Judge Pettigrew. In the popular elections of the autumn of 1832, according to the Charleston Here ary, there were 45,000 rotes cast, and the nullification majority was but 8,000. In the Legislature, at the special session of October, the act calling a Convention had a vote of 31 to 14 in the Sen ate, and 97 to 27 in the House; and a I rge number avowedly voted with the majority, who deprecated any extreme act ion on thepart of the Convention. And that the sense of the Slate might be tested, the Union party deter mined to put forth candidates for cverv seat the Stale was entitled to in Congress.
