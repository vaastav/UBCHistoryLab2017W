AGAINST EXPANSION. W. J. Bryan Interviewed About Re cent Territorial Acquisitions. HE FAVORS RATIFYING THE TREATY. Americans Mait Dljiiifaish Between Ex paoglon la the Western Hemisphere and Eipo?loo la the Or'.ent Which. Brings Ua Alien It ice. Savannah, Ga., Dec. 14. CoL Wil liam J. Bryan, upon leaving his com mand yesterday, the Third Nebraska, gave the following interview: My reason for leaving the armv was set forth la my letter to the adju'.ant general tendering cay resignation. Now that the treaty of peace lias been conclude 1. I beii-ve that I can be more useful to my country as a civilian than a soldier. CoL Bryan then proceeded to the dis cussion of public questions, saying: The poo pi-; of the United State3 having res cued Cuba from foreign control, may now re sume the discussion of the domestic problems wmcn confront this nation and to the consid eration of the new questions arising cut of the war. I may be in error, but In my judgment our nation is in creater danger just now than Cuba. Our p?o?le defended Cuba against for eign arms; cow thez must defend themselves and their country against a foreign idea the colonial Idea of Kuropcan nations. Heretofore jrreed has p.-rverte 1 the government and used its instrumental interference for private train: but now the very foundation principles of our government are assaulted. The imperialistic idea is directly antago nistic, to the iiea and ideals whl.:h have been cherished by the American peopl-; since the signing of the declaration of independence. Our nation must five up any intention of en tering upon a colonial policy isuch as is now pursued by European countries), or it must abandon the doctrine thit governments derive their just powers from the consent of the gov erned. We may believe that governments come up from the people or we may believe that govern ments come d wa to the people from those who possess the h?aviest cannons and the largest ships but vre car.not advocate both doctrines. To borrow a Bible quotiti n: "A house divid-M aeainst itself cannot stand:" paraphrase? Lincoln's declaration. I may add that this na tion cannot endure half republic and half col ony half free anl half vassal. Our form of government, even trad;' ions, our present in terests and our future welfare, all forbid our entering upon a career of conquest. Jefferson has b ;.;n quoted in support of im perialism, but our opponents must distinsruisa between expua-ion in the western hemisphere and aa expansion that involves us in the quar rels of E.iropj ati l thj orient. Tbey must still further distinguish, between expansion which secures contiguous territory for future settlement an 1 ip;n-iia which secures us alien races fr future subj jiration. Jefferson favored the annexation rf accessary contigu ous territory on ihi No: ta American conti nent, but he wa opposed to wars of conquest and expressly con l.-innei the acquiring of re mote territory- hen asked how the colonial policy could be prevented Col. Bryan said: Some think that thi 8,-ht should be made against ratification of the treaty, but I would prefer another p'.aa. If the treaty is rejected negotiations must be reaewed and Instead of settling tfce question according to our ideas we must settle it by diplomacy, with the possi bility of international complications. It wi.l be easier. I think, to cad th3 war at once by ratifying the treaty and then deal with the sub ject la our own war. Th is-; jo can be presented directly b7 a resolutioi ol c j ress decl.irln the policy of the nation up n this sut'jei.'t. The president, in his mesrr. says that our or.iy purpose in talcing poss s-.ion of Cuba is to es tablish a stable covornji at and then turn that government over to tb people of Cuba. Con press could re-afn-m this i:rpo;e in regard to Cuba and nscn the san:e p-.rpose in regard to the Philippine islands ar.d Irlo Kico. Such a resolution wou d m .i:e a clear cut is sue between the Uoctr'a; if self-government and the doctrine of i-itp.-iu'lsm. We should reservj a harbor and coiiin: station in Porto Kico and the Pailippin . ; in r -' urn for services rendered ani I think .v wou.d be justied in askinz the same com '.'-..i from Cuba. Ia the case of Porto ilijo. where the people have as yet expr ?ssed ni d sire for an inde pendent government. w mi?ht with propriety declare our willin mess to annex the island if the citizen, des.re annexation; but the Phil ippine islands are too fir away and their peo ple too diiJercnt from ours to be annexed to the United States, cvta if they desired it. Col. Bryan left Savannah last night for Washington. He intends to enter actively into the fijht against the colonial policy.

EDUCATION OF INDIANS. MUl Reel, Superintendent of Indian Fchool, Urges Com pn lory Education 31 ore Attention to Manail Training. Washington, Dec. 13. Miss Reel, superintendent of Indian schools, in her annual report, makes a strong plea for the industrial feature of educa tional work among the Indians. In her report she says: The government has upon its various reserva tions about 2.V) day and boarding schools, in which there are over 2,000 teachers employed. The government has not yet adopted compul sory measures for the education of the Indian children, and the fact is that the dark-skinned sons of the forests do not take to education very readily. Some res ervations withhold the rations until the parents place their children In the schools, and so strong is the opposition to this that many families have held out against it until their families were on the verge of starvation. But this feeiin? is not general, and during the past year the attendance percentage was very fair. Industrial education and the neces sity of furnishing employment for the Indian student upon his return from school are dwelt upon. Compulsory education and more attention to man ual training are strongly urged. Fatrlotlc Demonstration at Her West. Key West, Fla., Dec. 12.

War with Spain Formally and Legally Brought to a Close. Docament Signed tn Paris Fatorday Even In tr and Consist of 17 Article Pros pects of Ratification Thought to Be Bright. Paris, Dec 12. Last week was an eventful one in Paris and, from an American point of view, the most im portant of all the incidents was the signature, late Saturday evening, at the French ministry of foreign affairs of the treaty of peace, which brings to a close the war between Spain and the United States and adds to the territory of the latter the Philippines, Guam in the Ladrones, the Sulu islands and Porto Bico, while it marks the final termination of the oppressive thraldom which Spain ha3 yielded over Cuba for close upon four centuries. The Amer icans are to pay for the repatriation of the Spanish troops from all the col onies. The Spaniards are to return all prisoners held by them. They are to retain possession of all military stores and munitions of war in the Philip pines and of such ships as have not been captured. The commercial trea ties between the two nations which the war ruptured are to be renewed at the convenience of the two nations. The treaty as signed consists of 17 articles, it having been found advisa ble to subdivide two or three of the articles in the draft agreed upon at the last meeting. The commissioners of the two nations wrote their signa tures ou two copies of the treaty, one copy being for the archives. Now that the treaty is signed, the next step will be to have it ratified by the cortes, which is to meet for the purpose early in January, after which an appeal will probably be made to the country in the shape of a general election. The ratification will be a pure formality, as the commissioners have already received from the present cortes full power to sign and to seal the treaty. Fropect for RatiGcatlon. Washington, Dec 12. A cable dis patch from Judge Day reached the white house Saturday, informing the president that the peace treaty had been signed. This piece of good news has been so thoroughly discounted that it caused very little excitement. The president received it with an ex pression of satisfaction. The official document will come to the president in the form of a Christmas present According to conditional arrange ments the American commissioners will sail next Saturday. They will have to make a speedy passage and to be expeditious upon theirarrival inorder to put the results of their labors in the hands of the president by the 25th, but they may do it. The assuranaes which the president has received from senators republic ans, democrats and populists leave little room to doubt that ratification of the treaty, without change, will take place this session. The disposi tion, even on the part of those sena tors who are opposing annexation, is to let the treaty go through. Presi dent McKinley will send the treaty to the senate soon after the holidays. In the course of a couple of weeks the committee on foreign relations will report it back to the senate in secret session, with a recommendation for ratification. The report of the com mittee will be almost unanimous. 

MORE SHIPS FOR DEWEY. Cnrle 8ams Fleet at Manila Wilt Soon Be Augmented by -everl Gunboat Pol icy of the Navy Department. Washington, Dec 12. Admiral Dewey's fieet will be strengthened shortly by the addition of some service able gunboats. The Bennington, now at Honolulu, has been ordered to pro ceed to Guam, in the Ladrone group, and make a survey of the harbor with a view to the establishment there of a naval station. This done she will join Admiral Dewey's fleet. By that time or before the IleleDa will have arrived at Manila and the Con cord and Petrel, now cruising around in Chinese waters, will have returned and altogether the admiral will have a sufficient force of small vessels under his command to carry out the president's policy respecting the Philippines and to bring into submission any of the islanders who may prove refractory, and to release any Spanish prisoners h.ld in confine ment by the insurgents. The navy department is now convinced that it will not be practicable to carry oat a project it entertained at one time looking to the reduction of the United States naval force on the Asiatic sta tion, and has settled down to the con viction that the fleet must rather be considerably reinforced if the attempt is to be made to maintain law and or der in the 1,200 Philippine islands and still afford proper protection to the important interests of the United States along the great Asiatic coast. Xtrran Wlil Resl?n from the Armr. Savannah, Ga., Dec 12. Gen. Keifer, who is in command of the remaining troops of the Seventh army corps since Gen.

COST OF KANSAS SCHOOLS, Interesting PI cares TaJu from the It port of State Superintendent Stryker Teachers Salaries I n cress 1 ox. Topeka, Kan.. Dec 5. Kansas paid 54,543,445.70 for the support of its com mon schools in the school year which ended last July. These figures have just been compiled from the reports oi county superintendents to the state superintendent of public instruction. During the school year which ended la 1337 the schools cost f4 -50.". 445, or tlJj.OX) less than was paid out la li'.'S. Yet there were 4J more schools in the state ia 13(7 than in The difference in the cost of the schools is princi pally in the salaries of teachers, the tendency being to Increase teachers salaries and get better teachers la most of the counties. There were employed dur ing the year ia the common schools 5,3aJ male teachers ind 7.131 female teachers. Men teachers were paid salaries that averaged 3J.03 a month, while women teachers received i01 as average salary. The average age of persons who were granted certia.-ates in IS. 3 is 22 years. The number of inexperi enced teachers who got certificates was 2.621 As the report wi J show the number teaching on state cenifl.-ates this year is 22; number teaching on first grade certificates, l,2o; oa second grades. 3.7j7; on third grades, 3,071; on temporary certifl :ates, 21L The average leng.a of the school year for all the schools in the state Is a small fraction less than 25 weeks, or more than six months, as school months are counted four weiks to tha month. There are in vhe state 49 -,9 9 persons of school age between 5 and 21 years of age. Of this number are white and 18.953 ara negroes. One year ago the total school popula tion of the state was 425.250. Indicating a very slight increase la school population in the last year. An interesting fea ture is the fact that in extreme western Kansas the school population is continually failing off. while the voting population is. in many places, increasing. It is due to the fact that families are moving out and stockmen with their cowboys are taking their places. The total bonded indebtedness of school dis tricts is shown to be $2533,123 a d?creasj of nearly 8 0,X from last year. This record on the decrease in the bonded indebtedress in the state is featured in the report. Mr. Stryker mentioning It particularly in his introduction. Superintendent Stryker makes many recom mendations to the legislature in the forthcom ing report. He declares for free text-boois and school supplies. He recommends, further, that every child in the state be given free tui tion in a county or city tigh school. He also recommends that the terra of oflice of county superintendents shall commence at the begin ning of the school year. As it is now, superintendents who go out cf office are pre vented from getting a school because all are taken. The visitation of schools as rciuired by law Is dividel on election years so that the best results are not obtained there from. Finally, S jperintendent StryltT re ommends that school meetings be held early in March or April. This plan as it Is followed in the cities gives the teacher and thi school an opportunty of arranging early the work of the coming season.

Short Sketeh of the Man Wbo Was the Original Conaplrltor In the Uprising of the Cabsnt Arslnit Spsla In 1863. Washington, Dec 12. Gen. Calixto Garcia, the distinguished Cuban war rior and leader and head of the com mission elected by the Cuban assembly to visit this country, died here yester day morning shortly after ten o'clock at the Hotel Ealeigh, where the com mission has its headquarters. The sudden change from the warm climate of Cuba, with the hardships he there endured, to the wintry weather of New York and Washington is respon sible for the pneumonia which result- GEX, CAX1XTO GARCIA. ed in his demise. The arrangements for the funeral have not yet been com pleted. The expectation is that serv ices will be held in one of the Catholic churches here, possibly St. Patrick's, on Tuesday, after which the remains will be placed temporarily in a receiv ing vault pending final interment in Cuba. Gen. Garcia, whose name will be ever linked with those of other patriots who have fought against unequal odds for the freedom of his sountry. has had a most active and varied life, much of which has been spent in fighting for the cause of Cuban liberty, which he had the satisfaction of seeing accomplished so short a time before his death. He was a man of culture and refinement, of splendid education and :ame from a distinguished family of Jiquani, of Santiago de Cuba province. He was born in Cogquin. October 14. 180. and was therefore la the sixtieth year cf hi4 age. He wa3 educated In Havana and in Spain. He was the original lonspirator In the uprising of the Cubans against Spain in 1S68 and in that war, under Somez he attained the rank of brigadier gen eral. For his participation in the revolutionary aovement Gen. Garcia was sent to Spain, where four years he was confined In castles and fortresses, remaining there until the peace of Zon Jon. He then returned to the United States and, together with Jose Marti, attempt ed another revolution. He landed in Cuba with a few followers, but the country was tired 3f war and wanted to try the home rule olTered by Spain. He capitulated to the Spanish forces in order to save his few remaining followers and was again banished to Spain in 1831. where he remained under surveillance until 1S9 when the last revolution broke out in Cuba. Then he escaped to France and later to New York. His movements since that time and his active participation in the war are familiar to many newspaper readers. Aft.r coming to this country he endeavored to get an expedition to the island of Cuba in the steamer Hawkins, but this met with ship wreck in a storm and the cargo was lost. Gen. Sarcia was the last man to leave the vesseL Undaunted by his failure. Gen. Garcia made another attempt to ship stores for the insur gents, this time obtaining the ship Bermuda. He was Intercepted, however, by United States authorities and was arrested on the charge of filibustering, but was re leased on 3.0X) b-viL He forfeited this bail and in a final attempt landed on the east ern coast of the island with one of the largest expeditions that ever reached Cuba. After landing he succeeded Gsa Antonio Maceo in torn m and of the troops of the eastern depart ment holding the rank of major general. Gen. Maceo marching west with his men.
