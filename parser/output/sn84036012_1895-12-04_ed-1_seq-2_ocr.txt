Yesterday at noon, In Washington, congress assembled and, after a few fosesslttes, received from President Cleveland his annual message. The clerk of the house read it and the sen ators and representatives read for themselves from printed copies with which they are furnished, or lounged and chatted in the cloak rooms. Its reading of the message has become a matter of form in congress, for the rep rssentatives of the people are given copies which they may read for them selves, instead of listening to the clerk. Yet this annual reading goes on and for an hour and a half the clerk reads eloud arousing only the echoes in the balls of congress. This morning the Standard places in the hands of its readers a verbatim copy of the message as it was read yesterday in Washington. The handling at a president's message is one of the triumphs of modern journalism, and of modern times. In former days it was weeks and months before the policy of the president was known, but now the world reads the message a esoon as mot of the congressmen. This is due to a great extent to the recognition of the power of the press by the chief executive of the nation, who supplies the press associations of te country with advance copies, under conditions best explatned by the follow lag telegram, which was the introduc tion to the message as it came over the wires Tuesday morning: "New York. Dec. 3.-The following message of the president of 'the United States is sent to the press of the coun try through his courtesy, in advance of its presentation to congress. and is transmitted free with the compliments of the Western Union Telegraph com pany, the only conditions being that managers are required to get a written gurantee from a responsible person Connected with 'lch paper or press as sociation that the mesage will net in any way be made public or used ex oept to be put in type until a release message from our manager at Wash ington, M. Marean, is received, and managers are hereby instructed to withhold the message from any paper or agent refusing to give such written guarantee until such release message has been received. "W. R Somerville, Supt. Press Service, W. U. T. Co." The written guarantee is promptly forthcoming and then the message fol lows. How it came over the wires is an interesting story. The telegraph operators at the Stand ard office didn't go to bed till 9 o'clock yesterday morning. The president's message each year causes quite as much flurry in telegraph offices as a general election. It can easily be imagined that the transmission of from 15,000 to 20,000 words in addition to regular press re ports to every daily newspaper in the United States involves an amount of telegraphic labor and wire facilities that is astonishing. There is a certain class of telegraphers who work only on two occasions each year; one 4s election day and the other the night on which the president's message is sent. The balance of the time they are on the "block." It may be Interesting to some to trace the message from its origin in Wash ington to its final resting place on the Standard's pages. When it Is filed in Washington it is sent at once to New York, which office supplies the New England and Eastern states. New York sends it to Chicago, which is the main telegraph office of the United States. At Chicago probably 100 or more copies are taken and these are distributed among the different sec tions-the South, North and West. Thus while it may be received in Chi cago by only a sufficient number of men to make the necessary copies, it is being flashed by a hundred fast senders to Florida, to New Orleans, to Denver, and in fact to all points where a tele graph line runs. The copy which was hung on the "West hook" was sent to Omaha, and is the one that the people of this sec tion are reading this morning. Omaha sent it to Ogden, perhaps by human machinery, but more likely by means of the Wheatsome automatic telegraph. The latter system is capable of a wire speed of 300 words a minute and is op erated by means of long strips of tape punched full of holes and slits-the holes for the dots and the slits for the dashes. The holes and slits are repro duced at the receiving end on similar strips in ink. The characters are then copied by young women into plain Eng lish and given to the "'Morse" opera tors in Ogden. It will require a little exDlanation of how it came from there to Anaconda. One wire in the Standard's telegraph department is used for the associated press reports from the Ogden office. That made one wire. The Standard's special wire to Butte was connected at that place with a "quadruplexed" wire to Ogden. Willie Wheaton received on the first mentioned wire, and Johnnie Derks on the latter. The message was sent to Butte and Helena at the same time it was sent to this office. The transmission began on the "quad" at 12 o'clock and on the "sin gle" at 2 o'clock. The senders at Og den were evidently pretty sleepy for they didn't average much more than 20 words a minute. while it should have come at a speed of 50. The message was divided into sheets of about 120 words each; there were 134 sheets. These 'were sent in a very badly mized way; for instance. 98 would come and an hour later sheet 10 showed up. When the 196 sheets were all in they were given to the editors to be arranged in rotation and the telegraph operators' weerk was done. THE

Corpses were breugbt by the wagon load and tossed yeal tse mund La beeps. Aside from the rtiing of the bodies by the perpetra tonu of the slaughter, a hyena-like horde of barbarism pounced upon these beeps and stripped the dishooored moreasses of what poor clothing they had, leaving them in all degrees of nudity. Finally, about noon. a score of Armenians headed by a priest. went. under the protection of soldiers, to bury the corpses. Eiglty three of them were laid in a single trench. Probably about a hundred of them were killed.

Chicago, Dec. 3.-Three-quarters of a million dollars has been stolen from the campaign fund of the democratic party, raised for the years 1356. 1864 and the spring of 189%. The charge is made by IM. C. lMcDonald and Alderman John Powers. It is sustained by the newly elected chairman of the county central committee, Thomas (lahan, in the statement that the funds of the past two years have not been accounted for. The money was raised for the cam* paign which resulted in the election of John Hopkins over George B. Swift, as mayor, for the county commissioners' campaign following, for the aidermanic campaign. for the winter contest and for the drainage canal campaign. but recently closed. The democratic ad ministration of the central committee born out of the asmassination of Carter Harrison, is charged with the misuse of this money.

"There is one good thing that the new woman has accomplished," re marked a daughter of frivolity, who is most provokingly not new in any thing save fashion. "She has abolished the old maid." Of course al her hearers irnialmed. "How abeurd!" "What nonsense!" and one started to prove "from the latest statistics" that there never were so many old maids em now, and that this increase was largely due to the abom inable theory and praotloe of the new woman. When the objections had all been urred. and the excitement began to quiet down. the young person remark ed calmly. "Nevertheless, I tm x'ght. There are no more old maids, for as soon as one gets into that debatable land she becomes a new womrn!"
