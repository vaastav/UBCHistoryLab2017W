His reported that the officer charged with the Bi-Icction ot those children mighlhhave bad thousands of young Indians sent with him had it been possible to make provis eion lor them. I agree with the Sec retaryofthe Interior in saying that "the result of this interesting experi ment, if favorable, may be destiped to become an important factor in the advancement of civilization among the Indians." The question, whether a change in tiie control of the Indian service should be made, was, at the last ses sion of Congrefcs, referred to a Co'u nr.ltee for inquiry and report. With-C'-:t desiring to anticipate that re port, I venture to express the hone that in the decision of so importaul a question, the views expressed an mv r.nt lx lost sisbl of. and t the decision, whatever it may be, will arrest further agitation of lU'.s sub lecL such eeitation being apt to pro dace a. disturbing effect opon the ser vice as well as on the Indians them selves. HOT ErUISGS RESERVATION. In the enrollment of the bill mak ing appropriations for sundry civil expenses, at the last session of Con gress, that portion which provided for the continuation of the Hot Springs Commission was omitted. At the Commission Lad completed the work of taking teotimony on tLe many conflicting claims, the suspen sion of their labors, before determin ing the rights of claimants, threaten ed, for a time, to embarrass the in terests, not only of the Government, lint also a larcre number of the citi zens of Hot Springs, who were wait- riir for final action on their claims before beeinninc contemplated im nrovements. In order to prevent diflicultics. which were ap prehended, and at the solicitation of many leaJingcitizcns of Hot Springs, and others interested in mc w enure of the town, the Secretary of the In terior was authorized to request the te Commissioners to take charge of the records of their proceedings, and to ncrform such woik as could nrorjerlv be done bv them under such circumstances, to facilitate tLe future adiudicalion of the claims at an early day, and to preserve the sttus of the claimants until their rights should be finally determined. The t.t Pnmmicfciontrs complied with that reauest. and report that the tes timony, in all the cases, has been written out, examined, briefed, and o arranged as to facilitate an early settlement when authorized by law It is recommended that the requisite anthoritv be given at as early a day in the session as possible, and that a fair compensation be allowed the late Commisbioners lor tiie expeuse in nrred. and the labor performed by t)um ainre the 25th day of June last. l-t DLIC LAN'PS. I invite the attention of Congress to the recommendations made by tie Secretary of the Interior with repaid tn tliR nreservfttion ol luc liuioer on the public lands of the United States The protection of the public projterty is one of the first duties of the Oov era ment. The Departmentof the In terior should, therefore, be enabled by sufficient appropriation, to enfortv the laws in that respect. But this matter appears still more important as a question of public economy. The rapid d-?stiucton of our forests is an evil fraught with the gravest consequences, especially ia the moun tainous districts, where the rock slopes, once denuded of their trees, will remain so forever. There the in jury, once done, cannot be repaired, i fully concur with the Secretary of the Interior in the opinion that, for this reason. legislation leaching the public timber in the mountainous Stales and Ter ritories of the West, should be espe cially well considered, and that ex isting laws' in which the destruction of the lorc.U is not sufficiently guard ed against, should be speedily ooui fiied. A general law concerning this important subject appears to me to 1 matter of urgent public necessity. AGRICULTURAL AFFAIRS. Frosi the organization of the Gov ernment, the importance of encourag ing, by all csible means.lho increase of our agricultural productions has been acknowledged and u'ged upon the attention of Congress and the people as the surest and readiest means of increasiug cur substantial and enduriug prosperity. The words of Washington are as applicable to-day, as when, in his eighth annual message, be said: "It is not to be doubled that with refer. ence either to individual or national welfare, agriculture is of primary iai nortance. In proportion as nations advance in population and other eir cumstances of maturity, this truth becomes more apparent, and renders tLe cultivation of the soil more and more an object of public patronege Institutions for promoting it grow up, supported by the public purse and to what obiect can it be dedicat ed with greater propriety ? Among the means which have been employed to this end, none have been attended with greater success than the estab lishment of boards composed ofprop cr characters, charged with collecting and diffusing information, and enab led, by premiums and small pecuniary aida,to encourage and assist the spirit of discovery and improvement, this peeks of establishment contributing doubly to the increase of improve ment by stimulatiug to enterprise and experiment, and by drawing to a common center the results every where of individual skill and obser vation, and spreading them thence over the whole nation. Kxperience Accordingly bath shown that they are very cheap instruments of immense national benefit." 

STATISTICS Or THE SOIL. The great preponderance of the agricultural over any other interest in the United Slates entitles it to all Che consideration claimed for it by Washington. About one half of the population of tbe United JS tales is engaged in agriculture. The value of the agricultural products of the United Stale for the year 1878, is estimated at three thousand millions of dollars. Tbe exports of agricul tural products for the year 1877, as appears from tbe report of the Bureau of Statistics, were five hundred and twenty-four million! of dollars. The great extent of our country, with its diversity of soil and climate, enables us to produce within our own bor ders, and by onr own labor, dot only the necessaries, bat most of the lux uries that are consumed in civilized j countries. Yet, notwithstanding our ad vantage! of toil, climate, and inter communication, it appears from the atatistical statements in the report ol the Commissioner of Agriculture, that we import annually from foreign lands many minions of dollars' worth of agricultural products which could be raised in our own country. Numerous questions arise in the practice of advanced agriculture which can only be answered by ex periments, often costly and some times fruitless, which are beyond the mean of private individuals, and are a just and proper charge on the whole nation for the benefit of the nation. It is good policy, espec ially in time of depressioin and ca certainty in other business par suits, with a vast area of uncul tivated, and hence unproductive ter ritory, wisely opened to homestead settlement, to encourage, by every proper and legitimate means, the occupation and tillage ot the Boil. The efforts of the Department of Ag riculture to stimulate old and intro duce new agricultural industries, to improve the quality and increase tLe quantity of our products, to deter mine the value of old or establish the importance of new methods of cul ture, are worthy of your careful and favorable consideration and assist ance, by such appropriations of money and enlargement of facilities as mav seem to be demanded by the present favorable eonditions for the growth and rapid development of this important interest. The abuse of animals in transit is widely attracting public attention. A ational Convention ot societies esp-cially interested in the subject has recently met at iialtimore, ana the facts developed, both in regard to cruelties to animals aud the effect of such cruelties upon the public health, would seem to demand the careful consideration of Congress, and the enactment of more efficient laws for the prevention of these abuses. 

EDUCATIONAL MATTERS. The report of the Commissioner of the Bureau of Lducation shows very gratifying progress throughout the counlrv. iu all the interest commit ted to the care of this important oi- fioe. The report is especially en couraging with respect to the exteu sion of the advantages of the common school system in sections of the country where the general enjoyment of the privilege of tree schools is not yet attained. lo education uioie Uaa to any other agency we look, as the resource for the advancement of the people, in requisite knowledge and appreciation of their rights and responbthiiilies as citizen, and I desire lo repeat the suggestion contained in my former message in behalf of the enactment of appropriate measures bv Lougress for the purpose of supplanting, with national aid, the local systems of education iu the several States. Adcqu&ts accommodations for the great library, which js overgrowing the capacity of the rooms now occupied at the Capitol, bhould be provided without further delay. This invaluable collection of books, inanu scripts aud illustrative art has grown to such prooortioiis. In connection with the copyright system of th country, as to demand the prompt and careful atteution of Congress to 8a ve it from injury in its present crowded and insullicient quarters As this library is national in its char acter, and must from the nature of the case, increase even more rapidly in the future than in the past, it can not be doubted that the people will sanction any wise expenditure to preserve it and to enlarge its useful ness. The appeal of the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution fur the means lo organize, exhibit, and make avail able for the public benefit of the ar ticles now sloied away belonging to the National Museum, I heartily rec ommend to your favorable considera tion. lilSTRICT OF COLUMBIA. The attention of Congress is again invited to the coudition of the river front of the city of Washington. It is a matter of vital importance to the health ct the residents of the Nation al Capital, both temporary and per manent, that the low lands in front of the city, now subject to tidal over flow, should be reclaimed. In their present condition, these flats obstruct the drainage of the city, and arc a dangerous 60uree of malarial poison. The reclamation will improve the navigation of the river, by restricting and consequently deepening its chan nel ; and is also of importance when considered in connection with the extension of the public ground and the enlargement of the park, west and south of the Washington monu ment. The report of the Board of Survey, heretofore ordered by act of Congress, on tbe improvement of the harbor of Washington and George town, is reopectfully commended to consideratiou. The report of the Commissioners of the District of Columbia presents a detailed statement of the affairs of the District. The relative expenditures by the United Slatea mi the District for local purposes are contrasted, thow inir that the prnecditurea be Mip npn. pie of the District greatly exceed! those of the General Government. I he exhibit is made in connection with estimates for the required re pair of the defective pavements and sewers of the city, which is a work of immediate necessity, and, in the same roonection, a plan is presented for the permanent funding of the out standing securities of the District. WnONQS AND REMEDIED, The benevolent, reformatory, and penal institutions of the District are all entitled to the favorable attention of Congress. The Reform School needs additional buildings and teach ers. Appropriations which will place all these institutions in a condition to become models of usefulness and bencficense, will by regarded by the country as liberality wisely bestowed. Ibe Commissioners, with evident justice, request attention to the dis crimination made by Congress against tbe District in the donation of land for the support of the public schools, and ask that the same liberality that has been shown to the inhabitants of the various States and Territories of the United States, may be extended to the District of Columbia. The Commissioners also invite at tention to the damage inflicted upon public and private interest by the present location of tbe depots and i awitchiug tracks of the several rail roads entering the cilv, and ask for legislation looking lo Ibeir removal. The recommendations and sagges. tions contained in tbe report will, I trust, receive the careful considers tioo of Congreaa. Sufficient lime has, perhaps not elapsed since the reorganization of the Government of the District, un der the recent legislation of Con gress, for tbe expression of a confi dent opinion as to its successful operation; but tbe practical results already attained are bo satisfactory that tbe friends of tbe new Govern ment may well urge upon Congress the wisdom of its continuance, with-jif out essential modification, until by actual experience, its advantages and defects may be more fully ascer tained. R. B. Hatch. Executive Massiox, December 2, 1878. . oi'R wAsnisvioa letter. Washington, Nov. 25, 1879. It is the fashion to personify a city, to say that she is in mourning, or has donned Ler holiday attire that she is doing thi or that and, following the fashion, I may say that Washington is just now cleaning house, or, to speak accurately, clean ing boarding house, with a hurry and confusion that betrays too little ac quaintance with cleansing processes, and a reek of dast and dirt that pro claims long dUce:nde of soap and water. All this means that Congress is expected, (though to wash anything for Congress seems like a work of Euperirrigalion) with its , immense cucntelle, its long reunoe of heralds and followers, attend ants, dependents, defendants, plaint iffs, lobbyists, babbjuts, jobbists, snobbists the motley mob. fashiona ble, genteel, demi-genteel, and vul gar, that assembles each winter at the only great court in this hemis phere, that little ourt at Oitawa that will Boon be beaded by the daughter of the Empress of India ad the Marquis of Lome not except- ed. How lone and lorn thev will feel it, that . bleak little Canadian town this winter! What a contrast it will oresent to the splendors of London salons, tbe fashion of Rotter Row, Hydo Park, aad all the heavy pageantry of the richest city of the richest empire that tbe world has ev er known! What a contrast with the favorite winter resort of the wealth and nobility of Europe gay, holiday Tan's, ten hoars distant!

Bp virtue of this little malaria plagued city being the capital of tbe only great government oa this side of tbe world, it has poorer to attract and will Lave until tbe sea', of govern ment is removed westward. Not until then will Washington ecae to be the rival of Alexandria as a fish maiket. Just at this moment tLeir is little ti indicate the approach of the season except iLe scrubbing, leansiag, carpet tscking, going on in every boarding house, from the plain, chop house, u an unfasbiona ble quarter, occupied by southern Congressmen, to the fciost preten tious pt'nxions affected by loubvists and female government clerks Here and there about the depart ments, looking after the interests of their fair government pensioned pro teges, or trying to gnd or make va fancies for more proteges, may be seen a Senator or member of the lower House, but it takes more than one swallow to make a summer.

This was what the trustee of the district said to my friend Harry Flo tee, when he made application for the vacant position of a teacher. "Let me try. I know I am slen der, but I am tough, and have nrong will," said Harry. "Jest as yoa like ! There's the Bcbool bouse, and Til have notice given if you want it done," said the trustee. "I do 1'' said Harry. And I'll open next Monday at 9 a. m. The notice was given, and there was a good deal of excitement in th gulcb, and along the Yub fiat?. More than fifty young people of boih sexes made an excuse to drop into the tavern to get a sight at tbe ftl- low who thought he could keep school in tnat aistrict, ana many -a con tcmptuoua glance fell on the Blender form and youthful face of tbe would be teacher. fcignt o'clock on Monday morning came, and Harry rlotee went down to tbe school bouse wub a kev in one hand and a vapse in tbe oiber band. "Heady to slope if be bads we re too much for him," said a cross-eyed, broad shouldered fellow of 13. The school hoase was unlocked, and tbe new teacher went to the desk. Some of tbe young folks went ia to see what be was going to do, though school was not called. Harry opened his valise and took out a largo belt. Then, after buck ling it around his waist, he put three Coli a navy revolvers there, each of six barrels, and a bowie knife eighteen inches in tbe blade. "Thunder! He mesas business," muttered tbe cro3s-eyed chap. Tbe new teacher now took out squtre card about four inches each way, walked to tbe other end of tbe school hoiue and tacked it up against tbe wall. Returning to hia desk, be drea revolver from bia belt, and quick as thought sent ball after ball into the card, till there were six balls ia snot not much larsor tbao a silver dollar.

He spoke to the crusa:pye4 boy, ibe bully of the crowd, and tbe bjy rang the bell witbout a word. "The scholars will take ibeir seats; I open ecbooi with praver," h said sternly, five minutes later. Tbe scholars sat dowu, tilcnt, al most breathless. Af.er the praver tbe teacher ac ed a revolver and walked down on tbe floor. "We will arrange the classes " be said. "A'l who can read, write and spell, will rise. Of them we will form tbe first class." Only six got up. He escorted teem in upper seats. Ana men ne begsa to examine the rest. A whis per was heard behind him. In a sec ond he wheeled, revolver iu hand "No whispering allowed here!" he thundered, and for an instant hia re volver lay on a level with tbe cross eyed boy 'a head.

The re- Sort of the Commiaaioner of Internal Revenue makes the most favorable showing of efficiency of various col lection districts presented since the organization of the bureau. Tbe los ses from defalcations are trifling. Tbe collections amount to about $1 13,000,000, or $1,000,00.) more than during the previous year. Commis sioner Rauni argues against the de crease cf the tobacco tax, and does not recommend any change in the tax on spirits. He recommends, as one of the means of removing causes of trouble with tbe small distilleries of the South, that where the capac ity is only 20 gallons or under, the owners of these stills be allowed to manufacture ia tbe old way, withoat the use of the numerous contrivan ces and methods ordered by tbe laws. That portion of the report which refers to tbe violation aad general defiance of tbe revenue laws in tbe South presents a full review of tbe Southern bituation so far as it relates to revenue affairs, and sets in strong light tbe official records of resistance to law. During the year five reve nue officers have been killed ia the South, and thirteen have been woun ded. As to tho general disposition manifested by tbe people in large sections of tho South, the Commis sioner says the officers of tbe Gov ernment have been treated as if tbey were tbe emmsaries of a foreign and bostile nation sent to imposd and col lect tribute. Tbe Commissioner feels compelled to say that it is not ouly robbers aod outlaws who resist and attack Federal officers, but those claiming to be among tbe best citi iens sometimes take part in resist ance by force, and are constantly ex tending sympathy. Tbia support has even manifested itself among Judges ia the State Courts. Tbe killing of revenue officers or deputy marshals excites little atten tion, aud seldom stirs S.ate cffiVers to action. The murderers are free from arrest, and are openly shielded by State authorities It tbe revenue officers, when attacked while ia the discharge of their duty, defend them selves efftfcluallv and kill anv of their assailants, whole communities rise against tbe c Ulcers, and tbe en tire machinery of tbe State Govern ment is emploved to punish tbe offi cers. To illustrate this matter tbe Commissioner recites tbe killins: of Deputy Marshal Spriggs ia North Carolina by tbe noted desperado Redmond. This affair caused no excitement, but wben a man who was trying to shoot revenue officers while in discharge of ibeir duties was killed, the whole State of South Car olina was aroosed. Tbe Commis sioner recommends that Congress pass a law making all who partici pate in resisting revenue officsrs guilty of murder ia case tbe resist ance resulis ia the killing o( aa of Geer. Tbe report ends wuh a statement showing the receipts from the several objects of taxation for the first four months of tbe present fiscal year as compared with the same pe riod of tbe last fiscal year. This shows a decrease of :493.53 on spirits, an i acre use of $272,346 on tobacco, an increase of $32C,204 oa fermented liquor, a decrease of $04, 821 on banks and bankers, aa ia cieaso of $194,7-36 on adhesive stamps, a decrease of $45,174 in tbe amount of psualties, and a decrease of 81GJ64 ia the amount received for taxes on articles and occupations formerly taxed, bat now exempt. Tb9 net increase of revenue has therefore been $545,427. Happy Hollow is so named from the contentednegs of mind of its in habitants. Tbe poor make tbeir own peculiar locality almost exclusively. Half-way up the valley we sat down to rest by the door of a house wbich was full to overflowing with colored people, principally childc9n.

"Ob ! law, no ; me and my husband live ia that bouse," sbe replied, pointing to a filthy little pea that I actually tbougbt was a dog kennel. - sbe was ooor. but she was contented. She did not appear disagreeably coarse, either in manner or conversation, but is evidently aa illustration cf what shiftlcssaess will do frany one.

Still it is cherished aod loved, worn throughout life and worn in the passionless grave. Some day tbe unclean bodv of Ibis woman of Happy Hollow will be found in her miserable hovel, and though ber clothes will be mean aqd uat-idy, the gold ncg will be seen to glisten on ber band.

Tbe worthy docto finding his patient regaining his health with wonderful rapidity, was very anxious lest be might take too much encouragement, and be led to undertake too much and overtax bis 8trengm. lienee tne doctor was con stat) ly warning him, saving; Now, you must not try to go too fast. Be prudent and patient. 1 am afraid jou will overdo yourself, etc etc." i oese warnings were repeated ao often, tbat finally tbe patieat re s ponded : "Now, look here doctor, I bave laid on tbia bed for six weeks, and haven't even winked witbout vour permission. If you tell me to lay ou my left sido for fourteen hours, with my right eye open and the loft one shut, I ob?y you to the letter, aad yet yea keep telling me, 'Now be careful ; don't go too fat ; don't un dertake too much. You remind rap, doctor, of the proprietor cf a livery stable, to whom a youog man ap: piied for a horse and buggy. Tbe team was ordered bitched up, and meanwhile tbe livery man was con stantly cautioning tbe youog man 'to be very careful with the horse,' 'not to drive too fast etc. The team was soon ready, and as tbe livery man was banding tLe reins to the young man be repeated bis advice about not driving too fast, wben tbe young man, witb some impatience, replied : "Now, my friend, I want you to understand tbat I have hired this team to go to my step-mother's fuee ral, and I iuteDd to keep ap with tbe procojsion if I kill your daraed old horse.'

The wretched, empty, aimless, unhealthy life led by thous ands of women is a most sorrowful subject. We do not feci icelined to joke about it, for it is a sad lecture of our times, and one on which little light has yet dawned. Bid times for nieu mean doubly bad times for wo men. Seme women attempt too much, and, therefore make bad fail ures. A great deal might be done for health if people ia straitened cir cumstances would, wiih a good grace and witbout any sense of humilia tion, give up tbe li'.tie fripperies witb which life bas become encumbered, chiefly owing to our late commercial prosperity. A more simple, frugal mode of living would restore health to many mothers who are now strain, iog every nerve to keep a position among people as foolish as them selves, out who would be wise enough to fpliow suit if tbey bad the encouragement of an example which tbey could quote to tbeir friends' Lady's Journal A rich mm inblers-.Taa HHI'd St. Loris, November 27 The Globe Democrat's despatch frcm Leavenworth states that Maj r Broad bead, Paymaster United States Army reports a figbt between tbe members of bis escort and some gamblers at Springer's rsoche, on the Canadian river, o the Pan Ifaadle of Texas some days ago, in wbich Springer, tbe keeper of the rsncbe, and a young man named Ltadbcf.er were killed aod two soldiers wounded.
