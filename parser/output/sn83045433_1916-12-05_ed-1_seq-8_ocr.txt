Just pause &while. -Bit down and for a moment smile. Why try to carry all the wrack Of this whole world upon your back?

And what they cannot carry leave To other shoulders to retrieve And-hist!-those Souls have furthest trod Whove left 80M part of It to God. Today's message may offer the last opportunity President Wilson will have to address "Gentlemen of the Congress." Mrs. Wilson must share her honors as first lady of the land with others who have gone before, but Miss Jean nette Rankin is alone as the first lady of Congress. "Uncle Joe" Cannon is not yet Speaker, but the rapidity with which the moving pi'cture men ground at at the Capital when he appeared yes terday makes it certain he figures large among the reel people. Those handshakes were so numer mus on the flsor of the House and Senate yesterday that it was hard for the Impartial observer to tell whether they were congratulations on victo ries or defeats. Now comes the New York Medical Journal with a suggestion to boost the cost of being ill. If put into effect, we pause to wonder if a boy cott would succeed in lowering prices. Representative Cy Sulloway, of New Hampshire, may have been call ed many things by the, Democrats of his State, but he hardly will resent those political slaps as much as the remark of a certain woman in the gallery, who inquired of her escort, "Is that Carranza?" Those who were disappointed at the failure of Congresswoman-elect Miss Jeanette Rankin, of Montana, to exercise her right and take a seat on the floor of Congress as a mem het-elect were not confined to the feminine sex, even though the fair ones predominated in the galleries. There were many men among those who scanned the faces of members for the first woman to appear on the floor of Congress. The fact that 5w men of the Thirtyeecond Michigan Infantry re volted and demanded that they be sent home from the border Indicates a very serios atuation. Col.

The most interestinj feature of the fAet day of the session was the sub mission to Congress by Secretary o the Treasury McAdoo of the esti mates of the money that will be need ed for the conduct of Federal and District governinents for the fiscal year ending June 3o, 19A For the Federal government the great amount of $,654,8g,654 was asked. This sum is $annoanao in excess of the estimates for the pres ent year. For the District govern ment $i6,96xo92 was asked. This sum is $4,oooooo in excess of the estimates for the current year. ' It is evident that the high cost of living has be come an important factor in the household of Uncle Sam. Study of the estimates reveals that a large percentage of the increases in the estimates are due to recommenda tions to Congress for higher salaries. The Commissioners of the District are prominent among those for whom increases are asked. The Commis sioners now are paid $5,ooo a year and they ask for an increase in salary ot $2,5oo each, which, if granted, will raise their compensation to the level of that received by members of the Senate and House. There is no doubt that it is diffi cult for a man occupying the positiom of Commissioner to meet the demands on his pocketbook on a salary ol $s,ooo, but the man who receives that amount has not been as hard hit by the increasing living cost as the man wBo receives less. Congress prob ably will take this fact into considera tion and is likely to give moje atten tion to the recommendations for in creases for the small-salaried employe than to recommendations for in creases for those whose salaries are sufficient to garantee them againsl actual privation. The failure of the Commissioners to recommend a horizontal increase in salary for all government employes is certain to cause much disappoint ment, especially among those whose salaries in connection with a much higher living cost have been reduced to wan). The Commissioners have recommended more pay for a large number of District employes, but have ignored many who are in the greatest need and whose compensa tion is most inadequate fog the ser vices they render. The same policy has been followed by the executives in the different branches of the Federal government. Instead of advocating a horizontal increase they have recommended ad vances in pay only in individual cases, If all of the increases in salary that have been asked are granted Con gress will do much for the relief ol the government workers, but the only way by which full justice can be done is to provide for a horizontal increase in salades for all government em ployes. Higher Pay Advocates. The Washington Herald today publishes In its news columns a list of 264 members of the House of Rep resentatives who are on record as favoring an increase in pay for gov ernment employes to meet the new demands raised by the higher cost of living. Of the 264 Representa tives listed, 204 are on record as fav oring the enactment of Representa tive Nolan's bill providing for the establishment of a minimum wage ol $3 a day for all government em ployes. The remaining sixty favos salary increases, but in most cases they advocate methods different from that proposed by Mr. Nolan. This list was procured by Mr. No lan In a poll of the House during the first session of the present Congress when the minimsum wage bill was pending. It is true that Mr. Noar made the record prior to election but it Is hardly likely the fact thai the campaign has ended will cause any of those listed to reverse them selves. On the contrary, the promi nence given to the increasing cost of living since the election probably ha. won more advocates in the House for higher government salaries. Perusal of the list of Representa tives who have told Mr. Nolan they favor higher salaries probably will convingqe many skeptics that the higher cost of living has furnished as argument which Congress cannot ig nore and that there is an excellent chance for legislation for the relief o1 -the government workers during tii~e present short session.. The Colonel is quite sight when he In sIsts that his friend "the average man" would not "remnaIn morally obtuse It he eould he shown In convincing fashloe whie hIs duty lay." The average un did not need to. be shown where his duty Iay, and he was not morally ob tus. Prom his poInt of iew the Roose velt-Old Guard operatIon was just as morally efrensive In Its way as the Ger man operatIon In Belgium.

The co-operation of State ties has been asked for ibis work' Special efort will be msade to secure men for the Saval reserve foree, pro vision for which was made by Con gress when it passed the naval ap propriation bill last August: The pur pose of the reserve is to have a large number of qualified men ready in time of war or national emergency. Each member of the reserve receives annual retainer pay in addition to ac tive duty pay. To be eligible for the reserve a man must be a citizen of the United States and obligate himself to serve in the navy throughout a war or dur ing the existence of a national emer gency, should either arise during his term of service. There are six classes in the new reserve force, which provides for the organizations of volunteer patrol squadrons and for the civilians who went on the training cruise. In ad dition to the reserve force the navy will need 40,0oo men for active serv ice in 1017. We have now in the yards three super-Dreadnoughts that are al most ready for launching and work has just started on two more. Other vessels building for the navy include nine destroyers, twenty-nine subma rines and several fuel and supply ships. Three of these destroyers are almost finished, five are about half completed, and one has only just been started. Thirteen submarines are nearly completed and the rest are well under way. The three big ships and three of th'e destroyers are being built in government yards. There is a good chance for civili ans now to get into the navy as offi cers. The Secretary has been em powered to appoint annually for ten years thirty ensigns in the engineer ing department. The first examina tions for these appointments will be held next January. Any of these ap pointees who completes a three-year probationary period, two of which are to be spent on board cruising ves sels and ohe at the Naval Academy, is then to be commissioned as lieu tenant of the'junior grade. The offi cers so promoted will be required to perform engineering duties only, but will be eligible to advancement to the higher grades in the manner provided for line'officers assigned to engineer ing duty. Formerly when an enlisted man in the National Guard changed his residence in the State and was unable to attend drills at his armory, he re ceived a discharge from his regiment. This has now been changed. If he removes to another city in the same State, instead of giving up his mem bershp in the National Guard, he is transferred to another organization near his new home. If there is no National Guard organization near his new residence, he is furloughed to the reserve and isa member of the militia anyway. An enlisted man has now -a chance to leave the National Guard only by removal to another State. If he doesn't want to leave it, the adjutant general will make some arrangement to keep him in. It should work nicely both ways. All food is now high priced, but the highest priced of all is the diamond back terrapin. The Baltimore American explains that a full-grown terrapin makes Just about four good portions, but not a meal, for other edibles are usually served with it. The American says that the terrapin costs in the neighborhood of 110. It is not said whether this means $10 to the caterer or $10 to the bonsumer; but suppose it is the price to the on sumer; then this feast starts out at 81.0 a plate, and nothing said as to wines or other accessories. It must be admit ted that terrapin travels on the ridge pole of the high cost of living.-Mobile Register. If Germany is not winning any victortes of account from the air, it might be thought, from the announcement that shipping in the amount of over 11,500 tons was sunk yesterday, that the renewed activities of her submarines were tending to laosen her enemy's grip on the sea. But examination fails to show any achievements of substantial value to her cause. The victims were either neutral crafi or British merchant ships of com paratively small tonnage.
