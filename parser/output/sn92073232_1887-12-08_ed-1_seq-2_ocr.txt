He was known and loved in almost every village and hamlet throughout North Carolina and there are friends from the mountains to the sea coast who grieve for his loss. This writer knew him to love him. We considered him a type of grand, manly character. He spoke what he believed the right on all occasions, without fear and without favor. His was a character so strong, so nobly formed.that Duty over rode all thought of self. With him Right was above Might, and a clear conscience above the plaudits of a multitude. We do not believe we have ever known a more fearlsss man and at the same time a warmer heart. That trite sayirjg "Death loves a shining mark" was indeed true in his case, or as .Horace beautifully expresses it, "The lightning, sparing the humble shrub creeping on the ground, rives the majestic oak, towering to the skies." Apart from his deep piety and un doubted religion, he was a man whom the world could not help but admire, so strong, so powerful. We believe the best epitaph and the most express ive would be: "This was a man," and yet it scarcely expresses ali of what Dr. Burkhead was. He was a true Christian and as such we believe his is the reward "that paseth all human understanding. That thought, relieves the sorrow and dulls the pang that all hia friend must feel in thinking of so grand a life so suddenly ended. decided on Monday that the restrain ing order was in conflict with the ele venth amendment of the constitution and ordered the release of the State officers. This is a slap in the face to Bond, just what he deserved, and is a vir tual admi33ion that the States have a sovereignty that the circuit court judges can not and hereafter dare not over-ride, for which let us congratu late ourselves and our own s!ate. PCKITT IX POLITICS. "Now they'vs gone and nominated that blather skite Jim Sikes and I don't believe he's worthy of my vote or anybody else's" is the remark we very frequently hear good, honest men make after a convention, and then they complain and rail at the party when, if they only knew it, they aidr el Jim Sikes to his position by stay ing away from the caucus. Good souls, they "ain't going to have anything to do with politics," oh no, they are go ing to attend to their merchandise, or farmiue. or preaching and let Jim w I CD written : Butyamler, whiff! there couida a sudden heat. ine gravest citizen seems to lose a:s head, The king is seared, the sol.lier will not fight, The little boys begin to shoot ami stab, A kingdom toppled over with a shriek Like an old woman, and doivu rolls the wo.-ld In mock heroics stranger than our own ; Revolts, republics., revolutions, most No graver than a school boys' barring out; Too comic for the solemn things they are, Ton solemn for the comic touches in thorn.

Fin- i 1 1 , ny a waru politician arose ana an nounced that if the red-nosed gentle man were nominated tnere were two Hundred and fifty gamblers in the city who vould supjvart him and spend money on the election. The bummer was nominated with a loud huzzah! Such a scene, such an act, was a disgrace and a atiarma uDin whom? Certainly not upon the round abouts and toughs, "the world loves its own," but upon those decent re spectable men who didx t go to the convention. They had rather see a red nosed bully lead the ticket-than to soil their preciom skirts in the mud of apolitical meetiug'opposiug him. We haven't got quite that low in North Carolina yet, but we have had men nominated because it would flat ter our worst element. This is a mis take. It won't do to suppose because a man ia respectable that he will vote for any man whatever his character, simply because he happens to be nom inated by his party, whatever it be We must recognize the best element in our conventions and to do this that best element must attend the primar ies and see that honest, reliable men are sent to the nominating convent ions to represent them. Next year we are going to have a warm tima of it. We will need the most perfect "mir rors of integrity" we've got in our party on the ticket, and the way to get them is for every good citizen to take part in the primaries. Organize, go to work, re member that the toga of citizenship imposes other duties besides casting your vote on election day. Go to the primaries, put in,solid men and keep out Jim bikes DEATH OF 1R. BURKHEAD " Jnstfft iksTiiidst of the Methodist Conference at Fayetteville, 'at week, Death called one of its most hojored and useful members. He was the iisv. l)c. Li. b. Burkhead. pastor of the Ceutenary M E. Church, of Win ston. On Friday he was apparently well, but in the evening, while taking sup per at the residence of Mr. J. W. Welch, he complained of illness, went to his room, grew worse and expired at 7:lo p. m., surrounded by lov friends. lhe Bishop appointed Drs. Robey and liobbitt, and Rev.. Normau and Mann and Prof. Carr, a Committee to take charge of the remains. They were cart led to Raleigh and interred Sunday. Short and appropriate ad dresses were made by Revs. Bobbitt, INorman, and Maun on his church work ; Dr. Eugene Grissom, Eugene Gray, and O. W. Carr on his pastoral and educational labors, and then the remains were followed to the cemetery by his family and a host of friends. The following gentlemen acted as pall-bearer: Dr. Eugene Grissom, Dr. J. W. McGee, W. J: Young, G H. Belvin, O. W. Carr, Eugene E. Gray, Z. T.. Bynum', . aud Josephus .Daniels. mi i , , - j.ne ioiiowipg. representatives of .Centenary M. E. Church, Winston, N were present: Jas. A. Gray, M. W. JNorfleet, Geo. W. Hinshaw, E. E. Graj.Z. T. Bynum, Geo. D. Hodgin and J. i. Vaughn. A number of gen tlemen, representing the Methodist church in Durham were also present. among whom were Messrs. J". S. Carr, and E. J. Parnsh. . Lingnon Skidmore Burkhead was born in Davidson county, May 17th, 1824, and xtm the son of William THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. We have before us the President's message, but it is too late to make copious extracts. He goes to the point at once and discusses the sur plus. He handles the subject with a statesman's grip. He tells Congress in plain English that it ought to stop its time-killing, equivocating policy, and relieve the people. He says : "We are not dealing with theory, but with a condition." He favors a reduction of the tariff on raw material first. He fully recognizes the crisis and shows Congress how to meet it. So wise, so able, so brave a public document we have never read. While he believes in point of.' time, the reduction of the tariff should pre cede that of the internal revenue, thereby conflicting with the opihjqns of North Carolina, Virginia and Ken tucky, still we honor and admire him for his outspoken braver'. He has. proposed a plan to relieve the people at once and he should be honored for what he has done, not blamed for "his method of doing it Brother Burkhead, of the Durham Plant remarked after reading it "Well, he must have been reading the Plant's editorials he asrees with us exactly." We believe he also asrees banks exceeding $250,000 capital : al with the majority of the people and that the semi-annual duty of circu the papeis of North Carolina as well Jatioa be hereafter, charged only or as with the Plant, and that .they .will horses of pure white heads that are pronounced red without qualifications or excuses will be assembled in the House on Monday, and will light that body on it3 way to wisdom. There is a superstition which causes many members to hope great things from a Congress possessing this striking feature. Many Congresses have been noted for their gray and buld head?, and some, it is said, for their pig heads, but no Congress be fore could bosst more than half a dozen red heads. As there are 47 standing committees there will not be enough to go around, so there may be a pretty sharp rivalrv. One suggestion to avoid complica tious that now threaten, is that the committees on ways and means and appropriations be composed entirely of red headed men. It is suggested also that all the mounted messengers be required to ride white horses So many red heads assembled together is sup posed to mean good luck, and this Is expected to turn out a "Red Letter" Congress. Hon. John S Henderson is North Carolina's contribution to the red headed brigade. THE

It shows that the total number of national banks or ganized up to October 31, is 3,805, of which i)lo have gone into liquidation, 119 have failed, leaving in operation sit that date 3,061. The total number of new banks established during the lust year is 225, ' the total number closed' is 33, of which 25 went into voluntary liquidation, and 8 failed.

It is customary to call the names of the new benators alphabetically and swear them in, four at a time, in that order, but unless the Democrats are assured that there will be no objection made to the swearing in of Mr. Tur pie, who is last on tie list, they will insist on swearing in all the Senators at once.
