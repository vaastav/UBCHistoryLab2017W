President's Message. AMENDMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION. . I recommend the adoption of the fol lowing resolution and urticles amendato ry to t h e constitution of the United States : Resolved, By the senate and house of reprssemntives of the United States of America in congress assembled, two thirds of both houses concurring, that the following article! he proposed to the legislatures or conventions of the several states, as amendments to the constitution of the United States, all or any of which articles, when ratified by three fourths of the said legislatures or conventions, to be valid as part or parts of the said con stitution, viz : Article . Every elate wherein sla very now exists, which shall abolish the same therein at any time before the first day of January in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred, shall receive compensation from the United States as follows, to wit : The president of the Uni ted States shall deliver to every state bonds of the United States, bearing in terest, at the rate of for each slave shown to be therein by the eighth census of the United States, said bonds to be delivered to such stale by instalments or in one parcel at the completion of the abolishment, accordingly as the same shall have been gradual or at one time within such State, and interest shall begin to run upon any such bond only from the proper time of its delivery as aforesaid and afterward. Any stale having re ceived bonds a? aforesaid and afterward introducing or tolerating slavery therein shall refund to tho United Slates ilie bonds so received or tho value thereof, aid all interest paid thereon. Article . Ail slaves w ho shall have enjoyed actual freedom by the chances of the war at any time before the end of the rebellion, shall be forever free, but all owners of such w ho shall not have been disloyal, shall be compers-itcd for them at the same rates as is provided for states adopting abolishment of slavery, bet in such a way.that no siave shall be twice accounted for. Article . Congress may appropri ate money and otherwise provide for col onizing free coloud persons with their own consent, at any place or places with out the United Slates. I beg indulgence to discuss these pro posed articles at some length. Wilhout slavery the rebellion could never have existed, without slavery it could not con tinue. Among the friends of the Union there ia great diversi'y of sentiment and of policy in regard to slavery and the African race among us. Some would abolish it suddenly and without compen sation, some would abolish it gradually and with compensation, some would re move the freed people from us and some would retain them with us, and there are vet other minor diversities. Because of these diversities we waste much strength in struggles among ourselves. By mu tual concessions we should harmonize and act together. This would be a com- promisa among the friends and not with the enemies of the Union. The articles are intended to embody a plan of such mutual concessions. If the plan should bo adopted it is assumed that emancipation will follow, at least in sev eral of the states. As to the first article tho main points are : First, the emancipation ; second, the length of time consummating, (thirty seven years) and thirdly, tho compensa tion. The emancipation will be unsatisfac tory to the advocates of perpetual slave ry, but the length of time should greatly mitigate their dissatisfaction. The time spares both races from the evils of sud den derangement, while most of those whose habitual course of thought will be disturbed by the measure, will have pass ed away before its consummation. They will never see it. Another class will hail the prospect of emancipation but will de precate the length of time. They will feel that it gives too little to the now liv ing slaves ; but it really gives them much. It saves them from the vagrant destitu tion, which must largely attend immedi ate emancipation in localities wheie their numbers are very great, and gives the inspiriting assurance that their posterity 6hall be free forever. The plan leaves to each state choosing to act under u to abolish slavery now, or at the end of the century, or at any inter mediate limp, or by degrees extending over the whole or any part of the period, and it obliges no two states to proceed alike. It also provides for compensation and generally the mode of making it. This, it would seem, mutt further miti gate the dissatisfaction of those who fa vor perpetual slavery, and especially of thoso who are to receive compensation. Doubtless some of those who are to pay and not to receive will object j yet, that the measure is both just and economical is certain. The liberation of the slaves is the de struction of property property acquired by descent or by purchase, the same as any other property. It is no less true for having been often said that the peo ple of the south are no more responsible for the original introduction of this prop erty than are the people of the north, and when it is remembered how unhesitating ly we all of us use cotton and share the profits of dealing in them, it may not be quite safe to say that the south has been more responsible than the north for its continuance. If, then, for a common object this prop erty is to be sacrificed, is it not just that it be done ai a common charge ? and if with less money, or money more easily paid, we can preserve the benefits of the Union by this means than we can by the war alone, is it not also economical to do it? Let us cousider it, then ; let us ascer tain the sum we have expended in the war ever since compensated emancipation was proposed hist March, and consider w helher,if thr.t measure had been piompt-1 ly accepted by even some of the slave states, the same sum would not have dune more to close the war than has been oth erwise dune. If so, the measure would save money, and in that view would be a prudent and economical measure ; cer tainly it is not so easy to pay something as it is to pay nolhing. But it is easier to pay a Luge sum than it :s to pay a larger one, and it is easier to pay any sum when we are able than it is to pay it before we are able. The war requires them at once. Tin iiggreg-ite sum ne cessary for compensated emancipation of eour-f. Would l1 lul'ljur, lui it voul.l pa quire really no cash nor bondsmen any fater than emancipation progresses. This might not and probably would not close before the end ot the thirty seven years. At that time we shall probably lave one hundred millions of people to share the burd-.n, instead of thirty one millions as now ; and not only so, but the increase of our population may be expect ed to continue for a long time after that period, as rapidly as before, because our territory will not have become full. I do not state this inconsiderately. At the same ratio ot inert aso which we have maintained on an average from our first national census, in 1790. until that of 18C0, we should in 1900 have a popula tion of 103,208.115, and why may we not continue that ratio far beyond their period. Our abundant room, cur biuad national homstcad is our ample resource. Were our territories as limited as are the British Isles, very certainly our popula tion could not expand as stated. Instead of receiving the foreign born as now, we should be compelled to tend part of the native born away, but such is not our condition. We have 2,9G3,000 square miles. Europe has 3,800,000, with a population averaging 73 1-3 persons to the square mile. Why may not our couutry at some time average as many ? Is it less fertile t IIus it more waste surface by mountains, rivers, lakes, deserts, or other causes ? Is it inferior to- Europe in any natural advantage ? If, then, we are at some time to be as populous as Europe, bow soon ? As to when this may be, we can judge by the past aud the present ; as to when it will be, if ever, depends much on whe ther we maintain the Union. ' Several of our 6tates are above the av erage European population of seventy three and a third to the square mile. Massachusetts has 157, Rhode Island 133, New York and New Jersey each 80; also, two other great States Pennsylva nia and Ohio are not far below, the forhier having C3 and the latter 59. The states already above the European average, except New Yoik,have increa sed in as rapid ratio since passing that point as ever before, while no one of them is equal to some other points of our country in national capacity for sustain ing a deuso population. Taking the nation in the aggregate, and we find its population and ratio of increase for the several decennial periods to be as follows : 1790, 3,929,827; 1800, 5,305,937 3.5502 percent, ratio of in creases 1310,7,239,8143.645 percent ratio of increase ; 1 820, 9,638,131 3-313 per cent, ratio ef increase; 1830, 12,800,0203.319 per cent, ratio of in crease ; 1850, 23,191,8703.587 per cent, ratio of increase ; 1800, 31,413, 790 3.558 per cent, ratio of increase. This shows an average decennial increase of 3.400 per cent, in population through tho seventy years from our first to our last census taken. It is seen that the ratio of increase at no one of these seven periods is either two per cent, below or two per cent, above the average, thus showing how inflexible, and consequently how reliable tho law of increase in our (asa !n. Annuming Unit it will continue it gives ths following results: 1870, 42,323,311 ; 1880,50,907,210; 18110, 70,077,872; 190, 103,208,115 ; 1910, 138,918,526; 1920,180,984,335; 1930, 251,G80,914. These figures show that our country may be as populous as Eu rope is at some point between 1920 and 1930 say about 1925 our territory at 73 1-3 persons to the square miles being at the capacity to contain 217,130,000 ; and we will reach this, too, if we do not ourselves relinqui.-h tha chances by the lolly and evils of disunion, or by long and exhausting wars springing from the only great element of discord among us. While it cannot be foreseen exactly how much one huge example of secession, breeding lesser ones indt finitely, would retard the population, civilization and prosperity, no one can doubt that the ex tent of it would be very great and injuii ous. The proposed emancipation would shorten the way, perpetuate peace, in sure this increase of population, and pro- portionubly the wealth of tho country. With this we should pay all the emanci pation cost, together with our other debts, easier than we should pay our oth er debts without it. If we had allowed our old national debts to run at G per annum, simple interest, from the end of our revolutionary struggle till to-day, without paying anything either on prin cipal or interest, each man of us would owe less upou that debt now than each man owed upon it then and this because our increase of men through the whole period has been greater than 0 per cent., and has run faster than the interest upon tho debt. Thus time alone relieves the debtor nation, so long as its population increases taster thr.n unpaid interest accumulates on its debt. This fact would be no ex cuse for delaying the payment for what is justly due but it shows the great im portance of time in this connection the great advantage of a policy by which we shall not have to pay until we number a hundred millions, what by a different policy we should have to pa)' now when the number is 31,000,000. In a word, it shows that a dollar will be much hard er to pay for the war than will be a dol lar for emancipation on the proposed plan, and then the latter will cost no blood no precious life. It will be a sa ving of both. the FLTcr.i; of t;ie emancipated
