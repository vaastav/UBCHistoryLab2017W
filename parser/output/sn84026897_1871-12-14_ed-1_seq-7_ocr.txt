THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE / For the greater convenience of our patrons we ?ondense President Grands Third Ainual Message, leaving out much thajt would fail to interest the general reader but incorporating everything of value to the mass pf the public of our section. The President begins by assuring Congress that during the past -year success has generally attended the effort to execute all la vs found-upen the statute books. The policy h ts been not to enquire into the . w is Jo cu of the laws already enacted,, bot *> learn their spirit and intent, and to enforce them accordingly. How well this selfish ?nd partisan Chief Executive has failed to en quire into the wisdom of the atro cious Ku Klux law, enforcing it bitter ly for his own purposes, we South Carolinians can attest , to ,our cost. Grant is not a fool, j bnt her is un doubtedly an ungenerous and little minded man. . 

STATE' OF THE COUNTRY. The past year has, under a wisc Providenc?, been one of general pros perity to. the nation. It has, . how ever! been attended with more than usual chastisements in loss of life and . pror^rty.by storm and nre. These disasters "have served to call forth the best elemente of human , mature Jin'our country, and to develop fa j '.friendship for us ?n the part of for eign nations, which goes far towards alleviating the distresses occasioned by these calamities. . FOREIGN. RELATIONS. The relations of the I United States with foreign powers ?continu?- to be friendly. The year has been an event ful one in witnessing two. great na tions, speaking one language and h iv arf ?tration ?ispute?'?f fo'n^' studing, and liable at any time to bring f ft^j^?m? into) *?CK)d^Mco8tly conflict. I transnut^Bgmth a copy of thS-treaty alluded to, which has been qgnci?deu stoce^he adjournment pf Congress with her Britannic Maj Ad ' a> ?pgfcM the -protocols t cpjifgepces. of .the Commis-' by whom it was/negotiated. THE VrASHJ^GTONi^OATSi|T*? j ^n&liJtrellyl^Widee' ?meti?M&Kt \ adjusting the questions pending7 Be tween tb? two nations. Various ques tions are to be:.adjusted by arbitra-^ tion. I recommend Congress at an early day to make the necessary 'pro vision for the tribunal at Geneva and for the several commissioners on the part of the! United States called for j by the treaty. His Majesty, the King of Italy, the President of* the. Swiss Confede ration, and His Majesty,, the Emperor of Brazil, have each consented on the joint request of the two powers, to name an arbitrator ?for the tribunal at Geneva. I have caused my thanks to be suitably expressed for the read ine>ss with which the jcint request has been complied with by the appoint ment of gentlemen of eminence and learning to these important positions. : His Majesty, the Emperor of Ger many, hiss beer, pleased to comply with the joint request" of the two Governments, and has consented to act as the arbitrator of the disputed water, boundary between the United Slates and Great Britain. The cdh tractingp?rties in the treaty have undertaken to regard as between themselves certain principles of pub lic law for which the United States have contended from the "commence ment of their history. They have also agreed to bring these principles to the knowledge of other maritime powers anil to inviie . them tb: accede to them. Negotiations are going on as to the form of the note by which the invi AJtSoh is to be extended to the other "powers.*' I recommend th? legislation necessary on the part of the United States to Bring into operation the ar ticles of the treaty relating to the fisheries, and to thc other malters ? touching the felatious of the United Statos ''towards; the British North American posseaaioas, to become op erative as soon as, .proper legislation shall Jbe haddon the part? of;. Great Britain .audits possessions. It is much ..to'jty:repaired . that: this legislation may. become operative before : the fishermen of the United States begin to make their arrangements for the coming- season. .,

After the passage_ of this ^w formation was received from time time that combinations, of the cl acter referred to in this law exis aud were powerful in many, parts the Southern States, particularly certain counties of the State of So Carolina. Careful investigation . made, and it was ascertained that .nine counties of that State such c bihatione were active and power embracing a sufficient portion of citizens, to control the local. ?uth tie-5, and having, -among other thii the object of depriving the ema: pated class of the substantial bene of freedom, and of preventing free political action of those citiz who did not sympathize with .tl own views. Among their ?per?ti were frequent scourging and bccaei al-as?assinat?ons, generally perpel ted at hight by disguised persons, victims in almost all cases being c zens of different .'political sen time from their own, or freed persona v had shown a. disposition to "ch equal. - rights, with other ^citizc Thousand-*" of inoffensive kn? v disposed citizens were the sufferers this lawless violence. Thereupon, upon the 12th of Qc ber, 1871, a proclamation was issi . in; the terms of the law, calling uj members of those ' combinations disperse within five- days, and to i liver to the marshal Or military-: c cerS of the United States all an ammunition, uniforms, disguises, a ? other means and implements used them for carrying out their urilaw purposes. . This warning not havi been heeded, on the 17th of Octol another proclamation was issued, s pending the privilege of the writ Habeas Corpus in nine counties that S?tate. Direction was given tl within the counties so designatedp ,sons supposed, upon creditable formation, tOybe members :of such t lawful combinations should be arre ed by the military forces of, the U ?ed States, and delivered to the Mi shal, to be dealt with according, law. " In two of said counties, Yo and Spar tan burg,, many arrests ' ha . been made. - At the last account t number of persons thus arrested w one hundred and sixty-eight. Several hundred, whose criminal! was ascertained to be of an inferi :degreev were released for. the presei These. have .generally made co nit sions of their; guilt.

BEHOVAL OF DISABILITIES. More, than six years having pa-se since the last hostile gun was fire between the two armierf then arraye against each other-one for the pei petuation, the other for the destruc tion of the Union-it may well i> considered whether it is not now tim that the disabilities imposed by th i 4th amendment should be removed That amendment does not exclnd the ballot, bat onlv imposes the disa bility to hold office upon certaii classes. When the purity of the bal lot is secured, majorities are sure t< elect officers reflecting the views o: the majority. I do not see the advantage or pro priety of excluding men from offici merely because they were before th< rebellion, of standing and characte: .sufficient to be elected to positious re quiring them to take oaths to suppor tue Constitution, and admitting tc eligibility those entertaining precise ly the same viewa, but of less stand ing in their communities. It may bi said that the former violated an oath while the latter did not. The latter did not have it in their power to do so. If they had taken this oath it cannot be doubted they would have broken it, as did the for mer class. If there are any great criminals, distinguished above all oth ers for the part they took in opposi tion to the Government, they might, in the judgment of Congress, be ex cluded from such amnesty. This subject is submitted for your careful consideration. The condition of the Southern States is, unhappily, not such as all true, patriotic citizens would, like to see. Social ostracism for opinion's sake, personal violence or threats to wards persona entertaining political views opposed to those entertained by the majority of the old citizens prevents-immigration and-the flow bf much needed capital into the States lately in-rebellion; It will be a hap py condition of the country when the old citizens of these States will take an irterest in public affairs-promul gate ideas honestly entertained, vote formen representating their views, and tolerate the same freedom of ex pression and ballot to those entertain ing different politicial convictions.

If'bad men have secured pla ces it has baen the fault of the sys tem established by law and custom for making appointments, or the fault of those wno recommend tor t?overn ment' positions persons not sufficiently well known to them . personally, or who give letter endorsing the charac ters of office-seekers without a prop er sense of the grave responsibility which such a course devolves upon them. Civil service refoirn, which can correct tmVahuso, is much de sired. In mercantile pursuits the business man wjbo gives a letter of recommendation to a friend to enable him to obtain credit from a stranger .is regarded as morally responsible Tor the integrity of hi* friends and his ability to meet his obligations. A reformatory law, which would enforce this principle against all j endorsers of perseus for public place, would insure great caution in making re commendations. A salutary lesson has been taught) the careless and the dishonest public servant in the gjreat number of pros ecutions and convictions of the last two years. It is gratifying, to notice the favorable change which has taken place throughout the.country in bring ing to punishment those who-have proyed recreant to, the trust confided to them, and in elevating to public office none but those who possess-the confidence of the honest and virtuous, who,, it will alvays be found, com prise the maj ori ty of the comm uni ty in which they live. * * * * TJ.
