J tn t there Is one matter with which the Congress should deal at this ai lon.' . -el should no longer he any paltering with the question of taking care of tin; wuge-workeis who, under (ur present industrial system, become killed, crippled, or worn out as part of the regular in cidents of a given busliie.-s. The ma jority of wagewoikeis must have their rights secured for them by slate action; but the national government should legislate in t homughgolng and far-reaching fashion not only for ail employes of the national government but .for all peisoiiH engaged in Inter state commerce. The object s night for could he achieved to a. measur able degree, as far as llnsc killed or crippled aie concerned, by proper employers' liability laws. As far u cunt-em those who have btn worn out, 1 call your attention to the fa.'t that detiult" Hrps toward provl ling old-age pensions have been taken io many or our private iiidiif-i. s.

Jt is humiliating that al Kiiropc.i n international congt esses on accidi'tits thu I'liitcd StHtes should h" singled out as the most belated among the nations In respect to employer.-' liiibllity leglsiiitioti. This government is Itself a large employer of labor, and in Its dealings with Its employes it should get 11 standard in this coun try vv hl. h w ould place it on a par witli the most progressive conntiles In Kuropc. The livvn or the l"V,it d State In tliis respect nnd the law of European countries have been -um-maiized in a recent bulletin of th" bureau of labor, and no American who reads this summary can fail to be struck by Die great contrast be tween our practices and their.- i contraot 11 1 it in any si iifo to our credit. The ('ongreK. should without fur ther delay pass a model i-mpinyi r -' liability iavv for the District of Co lumbia. The employers' liability a t recently declared iincnnst'itutlnna!, 011 account of apparently Including m Its provisions employes engaged in intrastate commerce as well as tip's engaged 111 Interstate commerce, has i.ei-n held by the local courts to bo si ill in effect so far as its provisions apply to the District of Columbia. There should be no ambiguity on th.s point. If there is any doubt on the subject, the Inw should be reen.ictcd with special reference to the Distrift of Columbia. This act, however, ap plies only to employes of common carriers. In all other occupations the. liability law of, the district Is thu old" common law. The .seventy and injustice ol" the common law In this matter has been in sonic degree or another moduli l in our slat'-s, and the the niajotity of only Jui i.-.diction under the exclusive Congress should be control of the ainad and nt behind the states t,f the rnion In thi respect.

Such a crude and vicious a'tirk upon thi courts, even if it wire temporarily Kueeesriil, would inevitably In the 1 rid cause a violent reaction 'and would band the gnat, in us 4 of citi 7.eim together, forcing them lo stand by all the Judges, competent ami in competent alike, rather than to se tlie wheel of Justice Ktonned. A movement of this kind can ultimate ly result 'in nothing but dum.ige to those in whose behalf It. is mini iiully undertaken. This Is -a most hen liny truth, which it is wise for all our people to Irani! Any' movement based on that da.- hatred w hlli at times asisumiH the name of "cl.os consciousness" la certain ultimately to fail, and if it temporarily succeeds lo do fur-i caching damage. "Clas cunscbnusiiess." where i ;w merely another num.- for tin odious vice of class seltlshm as, is equally noxious whether In nn emplojeis' a-s:o, iation or in a Workingmaii's association. The movement in qu.stion wis "ti - 01 which the appinl was mule , a) workinmneii lo vote primari y. not : American citizens, but as individuals of a certain class in society. ucli an appeal In t'he first place rcv.dn the more bigh-mindi.i and far-sigiit-ed among th,. persons to whom it .s addressed, and in the second place tends to arouse a strong antagonism amqng all other classes of citizen-, whom It therefore tends to unit anain-o-t the vety organiz Hlon 011 whose behalf it is ls.sucd. Thu 11 sult is therefore unfortuiiHte from every siiiiidpolnt. This hnilthy truth by the way, will be learned by the socialists if they ever succeed in es tablishing In this country an import ant national party oa-ed on -uch class eonsclousiiets and sclllsli clas4 interest. .1 ' The w age workers, the woi klngmen, the laboring, im-u, the country by the way in w hich they repudiated the effort to get them to cast their votes in response to 11 n appeal to class hatted, have emphasized their sound patriotism and Americanism. The whole country lias cause to feel pride in tli is altitude of sturdy independ ence, in the uncumpromising insist ence upon acting simply as good citl 11 lis, as good Americans, without re gard to fancied and improper class Interests. Such an attitude is an object lesson in good citizenship 10 the entire niition. Put the extreme reactioiini li s, the persons who blind themselves to the wrongs now and then committed by the courts on laboring men. should also think seriously Hs fo what such 11 movement as this portends. The Judgi's who have shown themselves able and willinu' elfcctivel v to cheek the dishonest activity of the very rich 111.11. win works iniquity by the mis management of corporations, who have shown themselves alert to do justice lo the wage worker, and fm pathetic wiih the needs of our peo ple, so tliat the dueibr in the ten emeii; houses, the man who practices a diiiig. :-c us trade, the man who is crushed by excessive hours of labor, led that their needs ate understood by the courts these judges are the leal bulwark of the courts; those Judges of the stamp of the President elect, who have been fearless in op posing labor when it has gone wrong, but fearless also In holding to strict tidount corporations that work in 1'Iiiily, nnd far-sighted in seeing that tlie working-man gets his rights, are the men of ail others to whom we owe !l tb.it the npp.nl for tu.-h violent ail'l nics-aliu legislation has fallen on deaf cars, thit the agitation for Its passage prove-d lo be without sub slintial basis.

Ihe nn. b rstanding of the facts to which It is o be applhd. The gri at mas. of our Judicial i.tli,-,.,', are I believe. alive to these change r.f conditions which so materially affect Ihe per il. nuance, of 111. ir judicial duties. our Judicial system Is sound and ef- fectlve t corp. and It remains, nnd must ever be maintained, as the safe guard of those principles of liberty and Justice which stand at the T0U11 dation of American institution; for, a Hurke finely said, wh'-n lib, rty and Justice ore separated, neither Is safe. There are, howi vcr. some members of (he Ju.liciil h oly who have luirced be hind in their iinilcrstatuliiig of these great and vital changes in the body politic, whose rpitlds have- never been 1 1 etied to the new applications nl the old pilncipl.s made necessary by the new conditions. Judges nf this stamp do lasting harm by their de cisions, because tiny convince poor nn n in need of protection that the courts of the land ui" profoundly ig r.iraut of and out of s 111 p., t hy with their needs, and profoundly indiffer ent or hostile to any proposed rem edy. To such men it seems a crnd mockery to have any court decide against thein 011 the ground that It 1I1 sire's to preserve "liberty" in a purely technical form, by withhold ing liberty in any real nnd construct ive sense. It Is desirable that the leg islative body jdinuld possess, and wherever nee'essary I'X.rciie, toe power to determine whither in a given caso cmploycis und employes ere mil on equal footing, so that 1 1 10 necessities of the latter compel them to submit to such exactions ns to hours antl conditions of labor as un eliily to tux their strength; and only mischief can result when such de termination is upset on the ground that there must lie no "interference with the liberty to contract" -often ti merely ueademlc '".I hefty " the ex ercise of which is the negation of real liberty. There are e-ertain eiec-lsiona by various courts vvnii h have been ex -- - edlngly detrimental to the rights of aee-workcrs. This w tn 1' n M cc wage-workers. This Is true of all tin. decisions that decide that men ami women are, by the constitution, "guaranteed their liberty" to contract to inter a dangerous occupation, or to woik an undesirable or improper number of hours, ur to work in un healthy surroundings, and therefore, innnot recover damages when maim ed In that occupation and can not be forbidden to work what the leg islature decides is an excessive num ber ol hours, or to curry on the work under conditions w hich tlio legisla tuie decides to be Uiihcaltliv. The most dangerous occupations are eiflen i Ihe poorest paid and those where the boms of work are longest; and In many cases thus,, who go Into Hu m are driven by necessity so great that they have practically no alternative. Decisions such as those alluded to above nullify the legislative effort to protect the wage-workers who most need protection from those employers who take advantage of their grind ing need. They halt or hamper the movement for securing better nnd more equitable conditions of labor. The talk about preserving t the mis ery hunted beings who make eon tiacts for such service as "liberty" to make them, is either to speak in a spirit of heartless irony er else' to show an utter lack or knowledge of the conditions of life among the great masses of our fellow-countrymen, it lack which urillts a Judge to do good service just as it would un lit any executive or legislative otllcer. There Is ulso, I think, ground for Ihe- belief that substantial injustii'e Is often suffered b.v employes in con sequence of the custom of counts is suing temporary injunctions without notice to them, and punishing them for contempt of court in instances where, as a matter of fact, they have no knowledge nf any proceedings. Outside of organized labor there is widespread feeling that this sys tem often works great injustice to wagc-vv orkei s w hen their efforts to better their working condition result in industrial disputes. A temporary injunction procured ex parte may us a, matter of fact breve all the effect of a permanent Injunction in causing disaster to the wage-workers' side in such 11 dispute. Organized labor is ii.liiiiii nn. or 1111.: unjust resiraiiii wnicn ionics 1 mm lrpcalcit resort to this plan of procedure. its discon tent has been unwisely expressed, and often improperly expressed, but there is a sound basis for it. and the orderly and law-abiding people, of a community would be in a far .strong er position for upholding the courts ir the undoubtedly existing abuses could be pun ided against. Such proposals as those mentioned above as advocated by tlie extreme labor leaders, contain the vital error of being class legislation of the most i-IYi'iisive kind, und even if enacted into law 1 believe that the law would rightly be held unconstitutional. .More-over, tin- labor pcple are them selves now In ginning to invoke the use of th.- power of injunction. Dur ing tlu- last ten years, and within my own knowledge, at least lifiy in junctions have been obtained by la bor unions in New York city alone, most of them being to protect tin union label ta "property right"), but some being obtained for other rea sons iig.lnst employers.

The decision of the courts on economic and 'social questions depend upon their economic and social philosophy; nnd for the peaceful progress of our people during the twentieth century we shall owe m -st to those Judges who hold to a twentieth century economic, and social philosophy and not to a long out-grown phllos .pby. which was itself the product of prim itivo I'coriomle cind it ions. of course a Judge's views on progressive K"ilal philosophy are entirely second In Importance to his possession f high slid line character; w hich means tln possesion of such elementary Virtues as honesty coma,! and fair mindi dncs.s.
