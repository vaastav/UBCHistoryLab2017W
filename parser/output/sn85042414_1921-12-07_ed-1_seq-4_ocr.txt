PRESIDENT'S address.- Bringing Following the constitutional provision that the '3:~ president sha^l from time to time inform congress of the state of the nation, President Harding ha& ad dressed the sixty-seventh congress at the opening of its regular session. It is natural that he should {give first place in his address to the prospects for international agreement for limitation of armament and for the elimination of causes likely to produce war. This work has been very near the president's In was-on his initiative that the conference r«o was called, and the success which has attended its proceedings thus far has been so much greater than —,lH SJ what was popularly anticipated, that there is every reason for making this the principal feature of an *l?'w address to the lawmaking body of the nation.
