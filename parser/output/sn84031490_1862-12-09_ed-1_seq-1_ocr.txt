The war in Virginia still waits and offers no new phase. The rumored crossing of the Rappahannock turns out to he a table, Meanwlillc the season does net wait, and •winter has fallen with severity upon our -camps. From Fortress Monroe we have an ex ceedingly interesting and important: bud get of Southern news by kite Richmond papers. From these accounts there is season io look for some stirring news Shortly from the several points embraced in these reports. It is stated that Mobile is threatened, that Charleston, Wilmington, Weldon, and other places are to be visited by land Or naval forces. Gen. Foster's North Caro lina army is being largely reinforced. The rebels take occasion to notice greater Stringency, also, in the blockade. From Nashville we have the news of ahu- Smliating affair, in which Morgan surprises a Federal brigade, under Col. Moore, at Hartsville, Sumner county, Tenn., on the Cumberland River, forty-five miles in a northeasterly direction from Nashville. On no hypothesis stated, do the dispatches relieve the affair of. disgraceful features that should secure for it an early investi gation, and the punishment of the officers in fault. The situation in Gen. Grant's command is not clear. For nearly even* possible re lation of affairs there seem tc be two state ments at least. Thus wc may or may not be in possession of Grenada. It isnot cer tain where the Appeal has gone. It is not demonstrated fully whether the rebels will make a stand or evacuate Mississippi Without a blow. It is inevitaaly tree that to one or the other re sult they must speedily come, and the probability is that the Mississippi will b*e re-opened without a blow being Wherever our armies more the rebels gjvc Way. Report says Rear Admiral Porter is moving to save his share of the laurels, un willing to let the land forces have all the glory. From Minnesota, we learn that the in habitants, enraged at the tardy action of the Federal Government, essayed to take auto their own hands the execution of the miscreant Indians, and were only held back irom their purpose by military force. Gov ernor Eanij-ey has issued a proclamation Counselling moderation. SHE kattional finances. On the second page of this issue we pre sent an abstract and extracts which will give the main features of the report of Sec retary Chase, a full exhibit of our national finances. It possesses a commandingiuter est at this lime, both as a record of the past, and an augury of the future.

Burnside has returned from Washing ton, and grevloaslv disappointed the m.iw ivonns here, who have been swearing that M* head would be off nest,'” What may have transpired In the private interview between the Commanding General and the authorities at Washington—'what may have been demanded, and what promised on the one side and the other—is, of course, not sx matt or for present discussion. This much, however, I can freely say: The result of the interview seems to have been entirely satisfac tory to General Burnside. He wifi now be •‘let alone”—allowed to follow out his own plan?. In his own time and way, free from bureaucratic dictation at Washington, and confident that he will have from the govern ment all the assistance he asks for. Every one, of the least insight, could see that the attempt of the Washington'authori ties to cany on the campaign must end in a miserable failure. Already the most impor tant operations have been baulked by official ■blundering and stupidity. Take, for example, the affair of the pontoons —Instructive episode 3n the history of this eventful campaign. Gen. Burnside had arranged that the pontoons trains should leave Alexandria on the 11th of November, and he here simultaneously with our arrival here. (The right grand division reached Falmouth on the 17th of November.) We should thus have been able to cross the liver immediately, and would have gained possession of Fredericksburg without a'strug glc. Its purchase may now cost us a fearful price.) They v-rrr to leave on the 31th. They did not leave till the Ibth, and they did not ar rive until the enemy had so lined the opposite ■bosks with butteries that the possibility of transit here at all becomes a matter of verv serious doubt. This was not the only deficit. Ammuni tion, too, was wauling—and, in fact, supplies and stores of every kind. No steps whatever bad been taken to rebuild the wharves and 'Storehouses at Aqnia Creek, or put the rail road in running order. It became necessary, therefore, to haul everything over the wretched roads from A quia Creek and Belle Plain. A single night’s rain rendered the Toads all but Impracticable. Ton can imagine ourplight. The men were on half rations, the horses for two days without a bit of fodder. It was iu this condition of things—without bridges to cross the stream, or mod where with to supply the army fora day’s march beyond it—that the administration pledged itself (historical fact —not a joke) that Iti 4 tten days the army of the Potomac would be in Richmond!” While such madness ruled the hour, one could see nothing but disaster in the foreground. Burnside worked manfully at a hopeless task, endeavoring by his own ezhaustiess energy to remedy the futures of others. But the situation was radically Vicious and untenable, it was doubtfol,even, whether the commander would long be able to sustain himself To nil! who were in close relations with Gen Burnside it became per fectly obvious that he must soon sink under a burden too heavy for him to bear—physi mentally broken down. It is a that, in this, pass, there was wisdom enough In the adminis tration to see that the remedy lay in giv ing up a system which was fundamentally false. It would, of course, be absurd to assume that the rebel leaders are in the dark as to what our intentions are. It needs no prophet 

VOLUME XV. to’tell Gen. Lee that Gen. Burnside will prob ably not throw his troops over the river di rectly in theliice of the batteries (masked and otherwise) placed to receive us. It needs no prophet to tell him that wc shall feint here and here, and cross there or there. But will it be above Fredericksburg or below, and at what imint, whether above or below, will it be ? Here come in the elements of uncer tainty: and the confederates are for this rea son obliged to detach a considerable portion of their force as a corps of observation to guard a long line of river from surprise at any point and at every moment. They seem to be doing this effectually, for wherever our rcconnoitering parties have gone for miles up or down the river, they find rebel pickets posted opposite. It is a notable fact in military history, that, though, the crossing of a river iu the face of an enemy 5s justly esteemed as one of the most difficult of tactical operations, there is no example on record of ihe passage of a river being successfully defended against a determined assailant. Napoleon crossed the Danube at Essling and at Wagnim, in the presence of an army of 120,000 men, provided with 400 pieces of cannon, and at a point where the bed of the stream is broadest. This may be owing to the fact that, on ac count of its very difficulty, it is rarely at tempted without good hope of success. The necessity of subdividing the force and dispos ing it over an extended line is of course au clement of weakness for the defensive, while, if the line should not thus be guarded, the force would all the lime be exposed to flank and rear assault? from the enemy. Depend upon it, the rebel leaders arc sensi ble of all the weakness, as well as of all the strength of their position at Fredericksburg; and you may at any lime expect to learn that they have taken advantage of the opportuni ties before the operations of Burnside are fully developed, to retreat, ere retreat is ren dered perilous or impossible. They hare already derived from their occupancy all the benefit it is capable to afford them; they have delayed the army here now nearly three weeks, which is triumph enough for Fred ericksburg. As soon as they find themselves seriously exposed to a flauk movement which will bring us on their rear, they will hasten to evacuate. Indeed, we know that al ready their chief force is not al Fredericksburg itself, but at Bowling Green, twenly miles south of that place—and which you will observe to be sig nificantly placed with relation to the roads leading obliquely soulh from what you will perceive, from a topograpleal study of the map, to be the mftsi available point of assault from this place. ■ There is, therefore, good reason to hope that Frcderickfburg—imlispensible to ns as a dc-pot of suppliesforhospital accommodations, —will ye! f-ll into our hands without a fatal-encounter. If so—that is, if we do and rout the enemy, which it will aim to prevent—wc may rely upon being again met at one or more points between and Richmond. The next ■place st-hcted by the rebels for a eland will probably be the North Ann River, thirty miles south of Fredericksburg, and about a mile and a half north of Sexton's Junction. We shall have here a stream equally formidable*with the Rappahannock to traverse, at the same time that the strength of the rebel positon, the shortness of their lines of communication, ;md the length and exposed condition of ours, will work powerfully on the rebel slue. Re lying, probably, on tbal same “want of enter prise'’ on our part, on which Lee, to our shame, has lately said hehasprofccdcd in many operations, they will expect to detain us at the North Ann for an interval coital to that which has kept us at Fredericksburg. A* *he main ol ject of “their maneuvers is umk-rst ood to be to delay ns by second rate operations and sieges, till all the good weather shall have been exhausted, and the labor of movement shall have been an hundred fold increased,'! his will be in the direct line of their present de sire. But they will miscalculate, or I am areally mistaken, if they rely upon any supposed want of enterprise in Burnside. Il" does not enter into his calculation.- to delay one hour beyond the time imposed by material conditions but to push on steadily,"duvetly anti unUinchiugiy toward Richmond. Dismiss with contempt all reports you hear of winter quarters hero. They are nonsense. We arc to have an active, vigorous Winter campaign against Richmond. The army believe they are going there, and they have faith that they can put it through. Burnside thinks it just a*s well to employ the army In marching southward —even If'tlicr should advance but at the rale of a mile a dav, (oven then they could get In front of Rich mond in the course of a conple of months,) as to allow them to rot of inaction in camp. Wc have much to hope from the practical push ing, tireless temperament of Burnside, of which we have new illustrations every dav. Be goes evety where, sees everything/ with*a bright, quiet, creative energy—'“still achiev ing, still pursuing.” Let the great impatient, wearied, disgusted, despairing people of the loyal States, there fore, have faith yet awhile.

It ma v be that n victory will be'won in another way than the laborious process of the siege—that the rebel stronghold shall be stormed and taken in the gim-y and clamor of the assault.

SBEU§ TSIATT - S A. CXJTvIOIj S XIEE’OXiT. Burnside’s Vigilance Exemplified. [Special Dispatch to tlic Evening Post.} WA°niXGTO3f, Dec. 5,1882. There is a curious report here to-day to the effect that Burnside's late visit to Washington was not so much connected with the move ments of the army or the plan of campaign as with a curious deficiency he discovered in the department of Gen. Meigs. It is said that some 10,000 shells were lately forwarded to Falmouth, to be in readiness for the expected bombardment. They were good looking destructives enough, but Burnside never trusts to looks alone; he peers about and examines; and when he came to put his >osc in these shells he found that not one in ion was likely to explode. As he is one of the warrior* who mean to hurt the enemy, he raiglitway hied him to Washington to learn Ie reason of this systematic deficiency.

A special to the Inquirer says: Among the important papers secured bv the government at Richmond, are notes of some letters which passed between Gov. Moore of Louisiana, and Jeff Davis. About the second week in November, an urgent appeal was made by the Governor to allow the people to trade with New Orleans, exchanging cotton and sugar for salt, clothes, and some of the necessaries of life, saying there was great suffering among all dosses, mostly for salt. Davis refused, and stated that itjras impos sible now; that no proposition of the kind could be entertained until after the Ist of Jan uary, when Lincoln’s policy would be devel oped; then he might consider it. The Governor replied that the people would not stand it until then; that sickness and death were raging, and they were powerless to help themselves; that they must have salt and medicines, or die. This letter, Imploring Jeff to relent, closed with a defiance of his authority if ;t was not granted. MATTERS AT THE CAPITAL The Stolen Treasury Orders. IMPORTANT FROM TREAS URER SPUJEER.

No certificates like these have ,en issued from this office, and none will ever be issued. The true certificates of the ■lenomiualiou of $5,000 have their numbers written on the face in red ink, in the upper corner directly under the marginal border. The word? “if the order to be not filled up, this certificate issued to will be paid to bearer,” arc printed on the back of the certifi- cates in red ink. All that have been issued ince about the Ist inst., commencing bout the number 11,800, have ihe large denominations, $5,000, printed on the face in red ink. All certificates that will issue from this of- dec in future, will be like those issued here tofore.

Attorney General Bates is preparing and signed. has nearly completed a most important and elaborate opinion, affirming the citizenship of persons of African descent, under the Consti- tution. and laws of the ‘Cqjted States, the Drcd Seott decision to the contrary notwith standing. The question to which Ills opinion is to be the answer arose ont of an applica tion by a’negro, as master of a vessel, for a clearance, which wa§ the Attorney General by the Secretary of the Treasury. It Is also said that the same general ques tion was raised by the Secretary of State in referring an application for a passport by a negro to the Attorney General. Major General Schcnek, having recovered fr«»m the effects of his severe wounds received at the last Bull Run battles sufficiently to be able to transact ordinary business again, leaves In the morning for his new Held in Bal : timore. He made his tir~t appearance in pub lic since he was wounded to-day, visiting both branches of Congress, where he was warmly received by his hosts of friends and former fellow members. The hill for the admission of Western Vir- gin!:'., which passed the Senate last session, comes up in the House to-morrow. Senator Wade and other friends of ‘Western Virginia have been canvassing the House for tlie bill to-day, and express confidence that it will finally gel through. Complaints are made in some quarters that Halieck is attempting to control the appoint ments of Brigadier Generals asMcClellan did, and out of a lot of over thirty whom he has recommended and whose names the President is likely to send to the Senate, every man is a Breckinridge Democrat. If any such discrimi nation against Republicans has been attempt ed such nominations will ncvCr get through the Senate. The committee to examine the case of Ash ley of Ohio, concerning his land speculation letters, consists of Blake, Shanks, Xoell, Cre scy and Haight. Richardson-of HI., from the Commute of the Whole, made a dead set against the ad ministration in a formal speech. Twenty-seven more prisoners -were nncon ditiouolly released from the Old Capitol to day. They had been confined weeks, some times months, without examinations and without cause or crime. An evening paper here has the following about Banks' expedition: While it now seems generally believed that this expedition is not designed to approach Richmond, the outside world remains as much llic darlc as ever ■with reference to its de. tination. Its composition, storesbips, &c., arc such as to' baffle ail attempts at the shrewdest guesses in the premises. The Senate Military Committee were in structed to-day to bring in a bill to aid in suppressing the rebellion in Missouri, the Idea being to make provisions for helping Emancipationists there. Official statements show that there arc now over 60,000 sick and wounded in our hospitals aside from the Immense number convalescent but not yet able to return to their regiments. Inquiry has been made directed from tbe House Military Committee to tbe Secretary of VTarand Surgeon General to ascertain whether some method cannot be devised for rendering it easier to procure furloughs and discharges for the more scrions of these cases without detriment to the service. lu the convalescent camp near here arc now 13,000 to 15,000 soldiers onlypartially recover ed from wounds or diseases. PorthU nnmber up till to-day there have been but live surgeons. One mau was frozen to death there on Saturday night. Some Congressmen who had visited the camp, having called the attention of the authorities to its condition, twelve more surgeons were sent there early this morning, and 2,000 of the worst cases were returned to the hospital. Large numbers of these troops are from the west. Certain 2few York members of Con* gross arc said to have been detected in receiv ing fees for procuring commissions in the army, In one case charging as high as §4OO for services in procuring a single commission of low grade. Democrats and Border State men did their best in the House to-day to defeat the bill in demnifying the President from all legal prose-. cutions for arbitraiy arrests, but Tbad Stevens outgencralled them in parliamentary tactics I and carried the bill through. On this subject of arrests, the policy of the I Bepublican party for this session begins to be I pretty well defined. They will insist on the President’s clear right and duty to make the arrests, and will maintain that his great error has been tn being too lenient , and not mairing enough arrests, hut will not deny that occa sional mistakes may have been made, or that some of the President’s subordinates may have exercised this unwonted power injudi ciously and tyrannically. As this is to he the main point of Opposition attack, this line of Bepublican defense is specially important. It was pretty fairly foreshadowed in the Senate debate on Mr. Saulsbnry’s resolutions about 1 arrests in Delaware. • Lovejoy and "Wickliffe had a set to In the House to-day on stealing of negroes In Ky. 

CHICAGO, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1862. Mr. Wickliffe wanted soldiers compelled, to give up negroes when masters came after them and recited deplorable losses he and his fellow slaveholders had suffered. He said he had lost ten negroes himself Lovejoy replied that when the people of Illinois and the North west were sending their tens of thousands to protect the gentleman from Ky. and his neig i borhood, they should not keep bawling “ne j gro” in their cars. “Wc did not need any [ of your protection in my section of the State,’’ I said Wickliffe. “Oh I” said a voice from the | Republican side, “the rebels would prtect j you carefully enough.” “Who said that,” roared Wickliffe. “Whoever he is he is a rebel himself, to the Constitution and laws.” Lovejoy resumed in a sarcastic vein that left Wickliffe in very bad humor. New Yobk, Dec. S.—Washington specials state that Senator Wilson of Mass., will intro duce a bill for giving aid to Missouri towards emancipation. It will offer $10,000,000 as its first instalemcnt.

Grant’s Command. SMSMISH KEAE OXFOED, MISSISSIPPI. Interesting from MempMs and Vicinity. tee caxssErss puij&sskinw BBUSiaWBSACKEStS. [Special Dispatch to the Chicago Tribune.] Cazuo, Dec. S, 1302. By the arrival of the steamer Roweua we have Memphis dates to Saturday afiernoon. The news of most interest is from Oxford, Thursday morning; When my informant left Jackson, the Con federate cavalry were contesting the advance of the Union Troops, not COO yards from, the limits of the town. Jackson was supported by a battery. The main body of the Confed erates had passed through Oxford twelve hours previous to the appearance of the Fed erals. The rebels were said to be 40.000 strong, with many sick and wounded men to care for. The Confederates were much demoralized, and thought they could not make a stand against the Union troops in the State of Mis sissippi, audio consequence that Yicksbnrg and Jackson must Hill without a struggle. This impression is from citizens of Oxford. Another report, said to come from a man just from the vicinity, haslt thattheUnion ar my has actually possessed Grenada. In tills confusion it is difficult to decide as to the truth or falsity of any one report over an other. Rumor says that Jackson repulsed the Fed eral, on Thursday, at Oxford, the latter be ing only in small force. Tour correspondent at Memphis reports that Gens. Pemberton and' Price are certainly at Grenada, and there they will make an at tempt lo stay the progress of theU nionarmy. You may regard this as entirely reliable. The rebels are conscripting recruits within nine or ten miles of Memphis. At White’s Station on Friday last, they took even* man they could find nuder forty years of age. ... The small pox has again broken out at Cairo and Is reported to have commenced spreading among the citizens. It is not supposed there is any occasou for a pauic, however. A man was murdered in a gambling house just in the rear of the Provost Marshal’s of fice, Saturday night. His throat was cut, and he was slabbed in the heart also. The victim was a stranger here, and his name could not be learned. [Special Dispatch to the Chicago Tribune.] Cairo, Dec. 7,1802. A number of heavily loaded steamers have atcly passed through this place bound for mints south of Helena, having Secretary Chase's permission to trade upon the Missis sippi in prescribed localities with the suffer ing and impoverished inhabitants of Arkan sas and Mississippi. Tins action, it is sup posed, will have a concilliatory effect upon the men whose pressing wants may be reliev ed. Some sticklers are finding fault with the movement, thinking it will be very difficult to trade with the inhabitants without also succoring those in arms against the govern ment. This is yet to be tried, however. That it will have a good effect upon some is cer tain. I have conversed with a gentleman well posted upon the number of rebel troops in the Slate of Arkansas, who says that Gen. Curtis’ statements are highly colored, to say the least, and that an army of 6,000 or 7,000 Union troops could sweep the State from north to south, from centre to circum ference. It is certain the most effective troops have evacuated the State for service in Mississippi. Grant and his entire army, consisting of Shcnnan's division and the expedition under Gens, llovey and Washburn, are at present in Grenada, and still moving after the fleeing rebels. Thus has the plan matured at Colum bus been fully carried out with the best of success, excepting catching the Confederates. Forty-seven prisoners were captured by Col. Lee’s advance into Tallahatchie. I have it upon pretty good authority that Rear Admiral Porter will not much longer de lay his departure to rejoin his flotilla intended to operate upon Vicksburg. It is reported that he proposed starting yesterday. Later information changes somewhat the manner in which Gens. Hovey and Washburn moved for Grenada. It seems that after start- jug from Delta on Friday of last week, the forces struck the Coldwater. The second day at noon they followed it to the month, reach ing it that night, where the infimtiy, under Hovey, remained. Gen- Washburn, in charge of the cavalry, pushed forward, and on Sun day struck the Mississippi Central Railroad, five or six miles from Grenada, towards Holly Springs. He took up the track and burned two bridges. The report at this point was that the rebels were in force at Grenada and strongly fortified. So he determined not to go there, and fell back to Hardee's Station, on the Mississippi and Tenuesseeßailroad, where the railroad was so injured that It will take a month to repair it. Then the force returned to Coldwater, On the ensuing Tuesday, the cavalry went ;o Panola and burned the bridge. They then returned to the mouth of the Coldwater, wncre Gen. Hovey, with infantry, awaited them. Dispatches were sent to Helena, reaching there at 2 o'clock Thursday morning. Thus the report regarding Gen. Sherman's headquarters was incorrect. The expedition did not go to Grenada; yet it is true that Grenada was evacuated on Saturday. General Washburn was within a few miles, and but for misinformation might have occupied the place, there being no force to prevent it. It Is reported now that the Gren ada Appeal, instead of going to Ma rietta, Ga., has located at Canton, on the Central Mississippi Bailroad, twenty miles from Jackson, the capital. The last number in Grenada is dated Saturday, and calls upon the people of the State to arouse and aid Gen. JosephE. Johnson, Incommand, to drive the Yankee hordes from the country. The Appeal's Richmond dispatches have been anticipated, doubtless from Fortress Monroe. Alluding to the anticipated attack of McClcr nand by land, and Fairagut and Porter by water, upon "Vicksburg, the Appeal uses the following significant language; “If Government has neglected to provide for the emergency that- will be surely forced upon us, it will permit a blow to be struck at a vital portion of our country, the conse quences of which may be so' serious as to be dangcroue'to all our purposes.” Lieut, Lavigne, of the city of Memphis pro vost guard, with ten men, went out to White Station to hunt for a band of robbers which has been doing such successful business there for some time post. They caught three of them on the 4th, one named Lynel, pretend ing to belong to the Bth Missouri, regiment, another saying he was a member of the 40th Illinois, but refusing to give his name, and Chas. Hannon. The two first named were recognized by Mr. Brooks as engaged in rob bing him. They were given over to the citT zcns, who, by court of Judge Lynch, adjudged they should be shot. Thej* were accordingly taken to the seven mile bridge and executed. They had robbed Brooks of $2,000. The third, Chas. Hannon, was taken and lodgedin Irving prison. The Eclipse, wharf boat, was sunk here yes terday. It was loaded with Government sup plies, most of which were saved. There is no cine to the peipetrators. Cairo, Dec. S.— By arrivals from Memphis we get Oxford news to Thursday morning. The rebel Gen. Jackson, with cavalry, some infantry and a battery, had a skirmish that morning near the town with the Federal ad vance guard. The main body of the rebel army was about 40,000 strong, and had passed through Oxford about twelve hours before. The number of sick and disabled with the army is said to be large. Cairo, Dec. B.—The force which left Helena to cut off the rebel retreat from Abbeville, ; Miss., was not so large ns stated, yesterday. It consisted of 10,000 iumntiy under GenHovey, and 2,000 cavalry under Gen. Washburue. It left Friars Point, on the Mississippi, on Fri day. On Saturday nigHt it had reached the mouth of the Coldwater, where the infantry remained. Gen. 'Washbume then posted ahead and struck the railroad five or six miles north of Grenada, but fell back to Hardie Sta tion, where he again destroyed a portion of the road, and a portion of them returned to the mouth of the Coldwater. On Tuesday he again went to the railroad near Panola, and destroyed a long trestle-work and a bridge. Several persons have reached Memphis! who left Grenada on Tuesday. They report the place defenseless, and nearly deserted. There was nothing to prevent the Federal troops from takinjTpossession of it. Two regiments of conscripts arc said to have marched into it Monday, but these are hardly worthy of men tion. Gen. Grant doubtless occupies ihetown ere this. Rebel cavaliy were near Germantown on Thursday, gathering up conscripts. Three of the robbers on the State line road, near Mem phis, were captured a few days since, and : wo, who were handed over to citizens were shot; the other is a prisoner. A gang of robbers have been infesting the roads near Memphis for some time. A few days since three of them were captured. Two of these were recognized as having been en gaged in several robberies, and, being handed over to the citizens,'were shot. One gave his name as Lynel, and said he belonged to the JSth Missouri. The other said lie belonged to the 40th Illinois, but refused to give his name. The third, Charles Hannon, is now confined in Memphis. The 30th Missouri, part of Gen. Blair’s brigade, passed down this evening on the wav to Helena. Gen. Ellet, of the ram fleet, arrived here this morn? ig. The Memphis PuUftiu has news from Ox ford, Mississippi, to Thursday morning, at which lime, it says, Jackson’s rebel cavalry, with some Infantry and u battery, were skir mishing with the Federal advance, a short dis tance from the town: The main body of the rebel army had passed through twelve hours before. Pemberton’s army is represented as being greatly demoralized. It is about 40,000 strong, and this about the entire force that Mississippi is able to raise to resist Grant’s advance. Their number of sick and disabled is said to be very large. It is nownsgoodas demonstrated that Grant will have no general engagement, and that Jackson and Vicksburg will be abandoned with feeble or no resistance. The importance of Gen. Grant’s movements does not seem lo be fully appreciated by the country. Guerrillas are still at work near Memphis, carrying off every man they can find under forty years of age. The reason the citizens do not organize and resist the cut-throats, is that they are unarmed, while the guerillas are armed and organized. 1 this morning saw fi gentleman direct from Bloomfield, Mof He says robbers and thieves overrun the country, murdering, thieving :md destroying. Neither age nor sex is re spected. They break doors down, and shoot men at their firesides or in bed. He gives the particulars of more than a dozen instances where this has occurred. If any ouc is sus pected of Union sentiments lie is killed, his family driven out of doors, and some seecsh robber moves into his house and uses his property. St. Louis, Dec. S.— Advices from the South west to-night say the enemy, under Generals Hindman and Marmaduke, 25,000 strong, at tempted to force Gen. Blunt's position at Caue Hill, Arkansas, yesterday, but were driven back. This morning they drove Blunt’s pickets three miles, but on the arrival of re enforcements were again repulsed. Blunt's opinion is that the demonstration was made to cover their retreat, ns they were lolling timber sill night, probably to obstruct the road and prevent pursuit. Blunt held the enemy in cheek four days. Gca. Herron's command will reinforce him to-morrow. 

FHO^MIHMESSTA. The Citizens Attempt to Destroy the Guilty Indians. [Special Dispatch to the Chicago Tribtme.] Advices from St. Paul of the Sth state that Gen. Sibley received a dispatch from Col. Mil ler, commanding at Campt Lincoln, near Man kato, that a body of citizens numbering 150 or 200, arrived armed withhatchets, knives and other weapons, and had forced their way through the guard with the avowed intention of murdering the Indian prisoners. Col. Miller, being forewarned of their in tention, was prepared, and before they could effect anything they were surrounded and taken prisoners. He afterwards re leased them on their promise to abstain from anymore attempts of the kind. Gov. Ramsey issued a proclamation, urging upon the citizens of Minnesota not to throw away the good name Minnesota has hitherto sustained by any rash act of lawlessness, - which is neither necessary to the ends of jus tice, of personal security, or even of private vengeance. He says: U our people, indeed, have had jnst reason to complaiu of the tardiness of ex ecutive action in the premises, hut they ought to find some reason for forbearance in the absorbing cares which weigh upon the President. If he should decline to punish them, the case will then come clearly within the jurisdiction of the civil authorities.” St. Paul. Dec. B.—A body of 150 citizens, armed with hatchets, knives and otherweap ous, forced their way through the guard, with the intention of murdering the Indian prisoners confined at Camp Lincoln, at Man kato; hut were surrounded, captured, and re leased on their parole. Gov. Ramsey issued a proclamation urging the people of Minnesota not to throw away her good name by such acts of lawlessness.

C., Dec. 3. —A schooner this morning attempted to run the blockade at New Inlet, but was chased ashore by tic United States steamers Mount Vernon and Cambridge, and soon destroyed About eight a. m., the Cambridge returned with tiie schooner Emma Tuttle, of Nassau, also attempting to run the blockade. At noon the schooner Brilliant, of Nassau, was chased by the United States steamers Daylight and Mount Vernon. This makes three vessels lost to the rebels in one day. This is the eighth vessel either captured or destroyed by the Cambridge, Mount Vernon and Daylight, within thirty days. Newbebn, Dec. 4.—From information re ceived through what is deemed a reliable source, we learn that the rebels of late have become suddenly and unusually active in and about Wilmington. They are ruining the roads leading to the city on the Topsail Inlet side. In Wilmington the rebels are actively engaged in moving heavy guns. Whether these guns areheing moved out of town with a view of the evacuation of eastern North Carolina, or to new positions orfortificatlons, we don’t know. THE WAR si VieeiMlA. Weather Matters with the Army. All Quiet on. the Eappakaanock. [Special Dispatch to the Chicago Tribune.] "Washingtox, Dec. S, 1360. We have advices from Fredericksburg up to noon to-day. The army is quiet aud roads good, but no signs of a movement. All the talk we have had for a day or two past about our forces crossing the Rappahannock is mere bosh. Reports from the river stations note several deaths from exposure during the last forty eight hours.- Large quantities of supplies are prevented from loading from Aquia and Potomac Creeks by low water and ice. The latteris two inches thick. Notwithstanding this the army is generally provisioned twelve days ahead No movements of importance have oc curred.to-day. Slimy regiments are Industri ously engaged in erecting huts as if preparing to spend the winter hereabouts. Thcimpres sion however is prevalent that the present quiet will be of short duration. New Yobk, Dec. S.—The New York Tnb- une says: “Although we have no newsof importance from the army of the Potomac by telegraph, it can do no harm to repeat the announcement made in a Washington paper, and doubtless known In Richmond, that a Sortion of the array had probably crossed the appahanuock at Port Royal, below Freder icksburg.” Washington specials state that six of our pickets in the army of the Potomac froze to death, ou Saturday night, and seven died from the effects of’the cold at Camp Misery, Alexandria. An army letter dated December 4th. says Franklin’s corps struck teats that day and occupied Bell Plain. This movement is un doubtedly the commencement of active ox)c rations. The following dispatches are published to- day: Akmtof the Potomac, December S.—A lady who came over the river yesterday, under a flag of truce, reported the condition of the rebel army as destitute beyond description, and that they cannot possibly retain'their po sition during the winter. Quite one-third of the army are without shoes, and hundreds almost wholly without clothing. Hard work upon entrenchments, insufficient food and scarcity of clothing, are sending regiment af ter regiment to the hospital. Many citizens of Fredericksburg, men, wo men and children, are encamped in the woods back of the city, and dare not return for fear of being shelled from their houses. The rebel camp-fires have almost entirely disappeared immediately in front of F:\lnvmtlT. No troops can be seen behind many of the en trenchments. Notwithstanding these indica tions, the ford? and all naturally weak points of the Hue,are strongly guarded. The weather is intensely cold. Three inch es of snow on the ground! frozen hard. There is no army news that can be telegraphed. A Washington special to the Now York J3(raid says: Information has been received here that Stonewall Jackson’s corps forms the left wing of the rebel army. Stewart’s cavalry is on this side of the Rappahannock, and operating bnween the positions of Sigel’s corps and Burnside’s army. 

FROM THE SOUTH. HAT THE RICHMOND PAPERS KAYE TO SAY. Movements on Mobile, Charleston, Wilmington and Suffolk. Rumors of Active Work Ahead. Fortress Monroe. Dec. 7.—The following is taken from the Richmond papers of Satur day. The Dispatch says reports from Fred ericksburg yesterday were that pretty severe skirmishing’occurred in the neighborhood of Port Royal yesterday morning, hut with what success could not be learned. The general aspect of affairs is represented to be such as to indicate a battle. The columns of the ene my have heen moved to the front, and much activity is observable along their lines. Gen.’Walker telegraphs from Poceahdigo that a fleet of twenty Federal vessels sailed from Hilton Head on Friday last. George town and Wilmington, N. C”, are the points aimed at. Our troops everywhere arc put under marching orders, to be' ready fora move on the shortest notice. Several large vessels passed Charleston bar- bor Sunday, going southward. It is thought they have gone to aid the Gulf squadron inan attack on Mobile. Five additional vessels were off Charleston bar on Sunday, and four bloekaders off Stono Point. The dispatch also says the Yankees at Suf folk were last week reinforced by one full brigade and one battery of field artUlen*. The Yankee forces at Suffolk and in this vicinity Milwadkee. Dec. S, ISG2. are estimated at 30,000 by their own men, who slate this force is to march against Peters burg, while the force at Newbern, North Car olina, is to operate simultaneously against Weldon. The Examiner says the rebel Navy Depart ment has issued peremptory orders for the mounting of a formidable piece of ordnance on Drury’s Bluff, where Fort Darling stands, the novel construction of which Inis excited the attention of military men for some time past. An interesting correspondence lias recent ly passed between Henry A.Wise and General Keyes relative to the treatment of lunatics in the asylum of Virginia. Wise assumes to believe that these unfortunates were cruelly treated by Union officers, and makes a very pathetic complaint of the same. Keyes re plies that no harm was done or intended to be done to inmates of the asylum; bnt on the contrary, every comfort was extended to them by our Surgeons and other officers. 'Moorehead City, N. Cm Dec. 3. —At Beau fort, on the 2d inst.,' Gen. Banks was nomina ted for the next Presidency by Eastern North Carolina, in a Free Labor resolution, at a large and enthusiastic meeting of native North Car olinians. The Union troops who belong to this organization strenuously insist upon the vigorous and prompt enforcement of the con fiscation act passed by the last Congress. Gen. Banks’ Texas expedition is the theme of considerable comment in Southern paper: recently received here. Fortress Monroe, Dec. 7. —The Richmond' Dispatch of Dec. 6th has the following items: Reports from Fredericksburg yesterday are Important. It is stated that Burnside has been superseded in command of the Yankee torces, and that fighting Jo. Hooker hastakeu Ids place. Burnside will have no cause to re gret this change, if the radicals insist upon an early advance. A dispatch received yesterday states that the partisan rangers of Col. Imboden had a skirmish with the enemy near New Creek, Hampshire county, a fewdays, in which Brig. Gen. M. L. Bose, of the Federal forces was killed. There are no other particulars. The Fincastle Express learns from a gentle tleman from Lewisburg, that one day last week, through the carelessness of our scouts, the Yankees captured 105 of our cavalry, as many horses, and destroyed the camp epnlp age of the forces. New Tore, Dec. S.—A Fortress Monroe dispatch to the Philadelphia Press, 6tb, says that a division, commanded by General Eme ry, sailed South from here last night. Its des tination is to reinforce Gen. Foster in North Carolina. The rebels threaten to prevent him advancing, by way of Weldon, to Suffolk. The reinforcements consist of over 4,000 men. Sav Francisco, Dec. S.—Captain Water man has .returned from the wreck of the Golden Gate. He reports that the Mexicans residing on the neighboring shore have saved from $150,000 to "$200,000 of the treasure.

[From the Cincinnati Commercial, Sth.] Mr. Robert Carter arrived in this city night before List, direct from Greenville. He re ports very few troops in Upper East Tennes see. All the available force in that section of the country had been ordered to Xuliahoma and Murfreesboro. An order had been issued for all the cavalry in East Tennessee to report at Knoxville to be dismount ed. There were some 300 cavalry in Hancock and Hawkins counties, who gave out that they were goin? to Big Crek Gap to occupy it: biu Mr. Garter thinks they were going lb*Knoxville to be dismount ed in pursuance of the order to that effect. There were some 400 troops at Greenville, but they were under orders forTullahoma. There are some two regiments at Kingston, Roane county, and a heavy force at Chattanooga.

Washington, Dec. $, 1562. HOUSE. The Speaker announced the appointment of McPherson to the vacancy in the Committee on Military Affairs, in place of Blair of Mo., and Seaman of the same committee, in place uf Jackson, deceased. Messrs. Fessenden and Walker were appointed to till vacancies in the Committee on Private Laud Claims. The other standing committees remain a; heretofore. • The Speaker appointed the following gen tlemen as a special committee to investigate the charges derogatory to the standing of Representative Ashley’of Ohio, as published in the Toledo Blade and other papers, viz: Blake of Ind., Noell of Mo., Casey of Ky.and Haight of N. Y. Mr. WICKLTFFE of Ky.. introduced a bill for the protection and relief of loyal citizens whose property and slaves have been taken, seized and abstracted by officers of the army of the United States.’ Referred to the Judi ciary Committee. Other business of minor importance was transacted, when Mr. Stevens’ series of reso lutions referring to various portions of the President’s message was referredto the appro priate committees. Mr. 

RICHARDSON severely criticised the message, saying that most of it was about the ucgroj’aud nothing about the bravery of our soldiers. On motion of Mr. EDWARDS of N. H., it was resolved that the Committee on Indian Affairs be instructed to enquire whether any further legislation is necessary in relation to Indian funds held by government, and report by bill or otherwise. *On motion of ROSCOE CONKLING of N. Y., the President was requested, If In lus opinion, it was not incompatible with public interest, to transmit to the House the last official report of Gen. Buell. Mr. VAN WTCK of N. T. introduced a bill to provide for the immediate payfhent for clothing lost in service by soldiers of the United States army: also a bill Increasing the pay of x>rivates, non-commissioned officers and musicians. Both bills were referred to the Committee on Military Affairs. Mr. 

STEVENS of Pa. introduced a bill to indemnify President Lincoln and other persons for suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, and for all acts done in pursu ance thereof. ' The bill is the same as that of fered last week. Mr. VALLANDIGHAM of Ohio objected to reading the bill a second time. Therefore, under the rule, the question oc curred, Shall the bill be rejected *? The House refused to reject by a vote of 31 against 90. The bill was then read the second time. Mr. 

STEVENS moved to postpone farther consideration till next Thursday, and make it the special order for that day. Mr: VALLANDIGHAM objected. Mr. COX desired to refer it to the Judiciary Committee. Mr. STETENS then asked that the bill should be put on its passage. The main ques tion was ordered passed—S3 against 47. Mr. OLIY expressed surprise that any ob jection should be made to postponement, when an opportunity for its discussion should be afforded. If postponed until Thursday it could be examined with care and wisdom, which the House should bring to bear upon the subject. What he objected to especially was that a measure of such great importance upon which there was snch diversity of opinion should be so hurriedly thrust through the House. The President takes authority by law to exercise all the power he had exercised with regard to writ of habeas corpus. He concurred with the gentleman from Penn sylvania, (Stevens) that a bill of this character was proper, but while he thus concurred he should recret to see the bill hurried through the House without ten members knowing us legal provisions. It was-discreditable to the House ahd country. He should feel ashamed to return to his constituents and say that Conercss had passed an act without permit ting'”i word yea or nay to be said on the sub ject. He hoped for the credit of the House and country the matter would be postponed. Mr. 

YALLANDIGHAM saidihehad objected only to the bill being made the special order of to-day. Mr. COLFAX differed from Sir. Olin, he did not think the immediate passage of the bill would be discreditable tothe House. In stead of this it would be creditable. Hus question had been discussed all over the land as to whether the President had the power to suspend the.writ of habeas corpus during the rebellion. He stood ready to vote for the bill to indemnify him. He hoped that it would pass at once. [Mr. Stevens was abontto ad dress the House on the subject when Vallau fltghnm raised a question that Stevens had no right under rules to do so.] Mr. 

STEYEKS ashed for three minutes to explain. * Mr. YALLANDIGHAM objected unless others have a similar privelcgc. Mr. HOLMAN moved to lay the bill on the table. Not carried—4s to SS. Mr STEYENS explained that it was not his. intention to put the bill on its passage, but a postponement was prevented. Mr. Stevens in further explanation, said he doubt ed tiie authority of the President to suspend the habeas carpus, except from absaLatene- i cessity during the recess. He held that Liott eress was the sovereign power—not the Pres ident He had carefully copied the hill from the precedents of English parliament, for the last two centuries, not adding a word except what, was necessary under present circum stances of the country.

Mr. DOOLITTLE of Wis., laid that he un derstood that in all these cases of arrest the offer of liberty had been made if the persons arrested would take the oath of allegiance. He would like to have the issue lie over. Mr. SAULSBURT said ho referred to these two persons because he had never heard any charge against them. They had been arrested in a loyal Slate and for no' offense whatever. Peaceable citizens in Delaware and Maryland had been arrested and dragged from their homes and ho thought they Had at least the right to inquire into the matter.
