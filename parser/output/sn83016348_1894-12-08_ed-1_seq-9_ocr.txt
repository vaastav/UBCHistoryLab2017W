The Pains of Catarrh According to the best authorities.originate in a morbid condition of the gelatinous and ( albuminous tissues, circulates with the blood and attacks the fibrous tissues, particularly in the joints, and thus causes the local manifestations of the disease. The back and shoulders are the parts usually affected by rheumatism, and the joints at the knees, ankles, hips amf wrists are also sometimes attacked. Thousands of people have found in Hood’s Sarsaparilla a positive and pornufnent cure for rheumatism. It has had remarkable success in curing the most severe eases. The secret of its success H'*m in the fact that it attacks at once the cause of the disease by neutralizing the luetic acid and purifying the blood, as well as strength ening every function of the body. 

CONGRESS IN SESSION. The Opening: Proceedings of the Usual Routine Character. BIG DISPLAY OF FLOWERS. Close Attention Given to the Reading of the President's Message. Washington, Dec. 3.- Bright sunshine, with an atmosphere slightly tinged with frost, I combined to produce a typical autumn day ; and brought large crowds to the Capitol to witness the opening of the third session of the Fifty third Congress. The galleries were tilled to their utmost capacity fully an hour before the hour appointed for the assembly, and notwithstanding the faetthat it was well understood the proceedings would j be commonplace and routine in character, tin* crowds lingered until the last lines of the Presidents message were read and the first legislative session was officially declared at an end. The House side of the Capitol was the main point of attraction. The early arrivals having filled the galleries, those unable to secure admission to the lofts swarm ed over the floor of the House and remained until warned of the approach of the time for the formal commencement of business. THE 

USUAL SCENES. The usual scenes that attend the opening of a session were enacted. Members exchaug ed greetings with gamine warmth and evident sincerity, ai d the results of the recent political struggle were talked over with no suggestions of exaltation on the part of tin* victorious and without acrimony on the part of those vanquished. The Democrats i took the good-natured chaffing in the best of humor, consoling themselves with the reflection that their successful opponents wen* not without experience in adversity, and that they were not unlikely to undergo similar feelings in the future. There was the isual liberal display of flowers, and neither side was neglected in these floral •ontributions. On the desk of Linton, of Michigan, rested the model of what was Intended for a school house, composed of red and white immortelles, a fringe of bine flowers extending around the cornice and surmounting impossible chimneys. It was .•mitribufed by the A. P. A., in acknowledg ment of the defence of that organization made at the last session by the re Ipient, \ legend informed anxious inquirers that the structure Wi'.' ‘the little red school house."

I was favored with a ship of Slate. ■•• imposed of choice II W r.-. which completely oy- red his desk and winch bore a 1.-g-'iul assuring the big man from Maim that, if properly guided, it would carry him to a most desirable haven. An immense hors - shoe also expressed the hopes of Mr. ReedV. admirers and was propped against the ship of state. Mr Reed entered the hall soon after half p.ist 11, un las he proceeded to his seat was given a • - dial reception by his political associates and applauded by the gal! Ties. Mr. Wilson of West Virginia, entered s- .n after Mr. Reed ami was also greet' d warmly by his political associates. There vas nothing in the manner of Mr. Wilson to indicate that he had suffered lefeat at the recent election. A marked improvement is noticeable in his physical appearance since tic adjournment. BUSINESS BEGINS, At precisely 12 o’clock Speaker Crisp came into the hall, and, as he passed to ids place, members on both sides of the aisle which di vides the parties joined in giving him a warn welcome. The House was immediately called to order, ami the routine business proceeded with as though there had been no long inter ruption of its sittings. After the presence of a quorum had been ascertained by calling the roil, a resolution was adopted to appoint a committee to wait upon the President, in con junction with n similar con mittee on the part of the Senate, and to inform him that Congress had convened and was ready to re ceive any communication he might be pleased to make. Messrs. Wilson, Holman and Reed were the committee appointed, ami a recess was taken until one o’clock, which was subse quently extended to half-past one. the Senate having taken a recess to that hour. IN THE 

SENATE. Tim proceedings in the Senate did not differ materially from tlio.se of the House. There was agr at crowd in tlie galleries, but. while there was less confusion on tho floor than on that of the House, there was the same profuse display of flowers and the same degree ol liberality exhibited by the donors in their distribution. The attendance of Sen ators was remarkably largo’ only 15 failing to answer the roll call. Senator Hill was among the delinquents. The committee appointed to wait on the President reported at 1.30. and the report was followed immediately by Sec retary Pruden, who presented the President’s . message, first making his appearance in the ' Senate and proceeding directly therefrom to the Hall of the House, The reading of the message was ot once proceeded with in the Houses and was given close attention by both sit les. —— Shall Women be Delegates?
