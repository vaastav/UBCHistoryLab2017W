'li —Atlanta Constitution, 1} -•j THE MESSAGE. 1 No editor can read the president's message without wishing that every citizen would read the document thru. President Roosevelt addresses the "'^American people in his annual mes sages almost losing sight of congress. His official utterance Is made a com plete editorial discussion of the princi pal issues of the day with jthe editorial signed by the president of the United Utateg. It deserves to be read by everybody. The message read before congress and published to the world today is notable for its frankness as much as for any other one quality. Without a moment's hesitancy and supported by forceful argument the president fav ors sjiip subsidies, an inheritance tax, a graduated income tax, frfee trade jniih the Philippines, an eight-hour day, asset currency, LaPollette's em ployers' liability bill and a permanent •vfederal arbitrary commission to in vestigate labor disputes, while with equal posltiyeness he denounces the proposal to abolish, injunctions, lec tures the people of the south most vig orously about their lynching, makes another plea against race suicide, and advises congress to amend its pack ing house law by requiring dates on the labels and assessing the cost of inspection to the packers. He grows 'vehement in his denunciation of the people of 'San Francisco for their un fair treatment'of Japanese and he very -blandly suggests a startling innova tion by'announcing that he had with drawn all government coal lands from entry or sale and hoped congress would keep undeveloped coal fields un der government ownership in the fu ture to be worked upon the royalty plan with regulation of the price by the government itself. Regarding ship subsidies the presi dent favors the bill now before the house and 'which Secretary Root de fended before the trans-Mississippi '-'commercial congress at Kansas City. In-the main it authorizes the postmas ter general to subsidize fast mail steamers to-South American ports. The president urges an inheritance tak as a means of breaking up the enormous fortunes which are a men ace to the public. He favors a graduated income tax •because it tends to distribute the bur den1of taxation in accordance with the citizen's ability to pay. He favors all Just measures for the benefit of the wage worker and the uplift of men, but is not afraid to point out the need of injunctions and the fallacy of seeking to do away with it because at times it has been abused. In referring to the race prejudice against Japanese, the president points out a very grave danger of war being precipitated by the unreasonable frenzy of a very few people and he calls for legislation which will give the federal government more authority in enforcing the rights which it guaran aliens ....Jn. ..its hHernatjonnJ jfeatie'! I 11 L-'^On the subject of corporations the Resident lectures Big Business quite ^erely upon tHe danger of forcing %ynirent ownership and other forms ^cialism unless moderation is prac jl. He announces it as the estab •d policy of his administration to ••j-.^jcute rebaters and other violators commerce act under the crim inal stiiiutes as was successfully done in the case against the New York Cen tral railway and he asks for even more law .making greater penalties possible. If congress makes even a start on the program thus laid down for it there will be plenty to do, but it Is apparent from reading the message that the president was addressing primarily the American people, knowing that thru them and thru th6m only would he get action out of congress on what he wanted done. THE 

PROMISE OF DES MOINES. A Davenport paper noting the pres ent united movement among the var ious interests of Des Moines toward a larger city, thinks that Iowa has been and would be better off without a great city and points out the political danger In the overwhelming vote o.* a metropolis. Up to the present time Iowa baa been very largely free from city domination and the Davenport editor would be pleased to have it re main so. The possibility that a great city in the center of the state might seriously affect and confine the operations and growth of the group of good towns known as the Tri-Cities is scarcely in argument. However, it is a con tingency not likely to be overlooked at Davenport. What is pointed out polit ically is true, but the purist in politics has never been able to stay the rise of cities. Business conditions and oppor tune locations and the grit and hustle of their inhabitants build metropoli on the sites of country towns. With the increasing density of population Iowa is certain to have at least one big city. Logically it is Des Moines. Materially it is to the advantage of the state to have it at the confluence of Iowa railroads, and in the center of the state. If we are to feed a city of a half a million sometime witihiin the next half century let us have t'hem handy amid accessible from every corner of Iowa. Moreover there is hope for better tihings. Dr. Chapman says he seledted Des Moines as the seat of his evangel istic endeavor because of the great op portunity. Everyone will agree with the evangelist as to the opportunity for an- evangelist to keep busy there and add their hope to his of ultimate regeneration. Perhaps Des Moines may yet lead in piety as in population. Here tofore the push has been toward, an in crease in the city census more than In that of the New Jerusalem, -but we may now expect -better things. Possibly when the evangelists get thru witih Des Moines even her police "will have been reorganized i'f not regenerated, its newspapers bound together in a frater nal tie that shall take no heed of circu lation except, possibly, to tell the actual truth about it, its street car company out of politics, its property owners re fusing to lease to the Immoral, and Liafie Young and Jim Berryhill support ing -a. progressive republican ticket. But the promise'of Des Moines to be come a big city is no pipe dream. ,• THE 

BLVDENBURGH UASE. The case of Dickinson and the phy sician who Is accused with him of re sponsibility for the death of Irene Biydenburgh is scheduled to come up this week at Des Moines. Unless the court sees fit to grant a continuance these men. will b£ placed on their trial for the untimely taking of a life that promised much and ended in shame. This Is a case where a continuance should be granted grudgingly. Time enough has elapsed between the crime, the accusation and the date set for both the defense and the prosecution to prepare themselves. Whether or not these men are guilty as charged in the indictment their trial should pro ceed without the delay that has become common In cases involving serious' crime and earned much of the criticism directed at courts and criminal pro cedure. The case Is peculiarly the state's from the circumstances sur rounding it. The girl lacked the nat ural protectors of maidenhood. She was fatherless and motherless and her immature brothers were her care and not her shield. The violated laws of the state were her only protection. They failed to protect, but they should not fail to punish. Whoever is guilty as principal or accomplice of the ruin and death of this girl must suffer for it or the state, the community and the citizenship of Iowa stand convicted of gross negligence. This Biydenburgh case is distinct. It is the public cul mination of hundreds that have been hushed and hidden. It has aroused a general determination that the blood hounds that follow the trail of inno* cense shall no longer be permitted to pull down their quarry unheeded in Iowa. Stensland stole the savings of the poor and defenseless. He is behind bars serving a just sentence. Why should men whose -crime against the weak and undefended is infinitely greater walk abroad? Topics of the Times If Mr. Depew really means to write his memoirs and plays fair with his memory there will be something doing when the book is published.

James Garfield, son of a noble sire, can not complain of the opportunity this country has afforded him. If he has the making of a statesman in him he has his chance to show it. Mr. Cortelyou has risen rapidly from presiding over one typewriter to be boss over many type writers. 9 According to the local weeklies far mers near Ute are in serious difficulty. All this year's ears of corn are too long for the corn shellers. The district court at Des Moines must pass on the question of how fat a policeman should be permitted to get. One applicant before the Des Moines board weighed fifty-four pounds more than the examiners con cluded was good for him and they "shrunk" him SM per cent on his ex amination papers, a process familiar to1 farmers and others who sell live stock. The policeman asks the courts to decide between his adipose and the police commissioners of Des Moines. George Fitch tells of an individual who once on a time entered Hades and sat around without showing any signs of discomfort for eleven years. Satan finally asked him how he liked the place. "It's fine." said the spirit. "I was a traveling man and spent most of my life waiting for trains at small town stations." The inhabitants of an industrial town seeking to abandon it in a body— a strange incident of modern times—is now to be witnessed in Spain. The town is that of Bejar, near Salamanca, whose people are using their utmost endeavor to have themselves distrib uted—men, women and children, among the South American republics. Bejar was once a flourishing town with a reputation for its cloth fabrics. Fifty years ago the population numbered 22, 000, but the place has gradually de clined, and, today has only 9,000.

ICWA CPiKIONS AND NOTES. The Davenport Democrat Is urging "that laws be ipassed which will prac tically suspend immigration." It la convinced that "the swift occupation of "the lands of the United States by aliens, many of them unfitted to re ceive the peculiar blessings of liberty with which this nation is Irradiated, amounts to the exclusion of future Am ericans from their righteous opportun ities, and constitutes a menace far ex ceeding the good that may come from the denser .peopling of the country. Plainly the idea is growing that we are giving away entirely too much, and that much of it is being given to the wrong person." "Postal savings banks and a' system of savings b.inks insurance are two things essential to the protection of the earnings of the poor, and innova tions which must come in time," as serts the Dubuque Telegraph-Herald. Noting the market report that "stor age eggs are stronger," the Keokuk Gate City says: "The announcement is unnnecessary. There are some thing3 that can be taken for granted as mat ters of course." The Burlington Hawkeye, speaking of the shortage of school teachers, says: "Kvidently there is but one thing to head off school consolidation, and that is an increase in the salaries of teachers, and a pretty respectable in crease it will have to be." The Nevada Representative thinks the discharge of the colored soldiers "does not accord with the American idea of fair-play," and its opinion of President Roosevelt is that "if he were called upon to be an informer upon his asociates, he would be very backward about responding to the call." The Representative recalls "when he was at Santiago he was credited with being the one to suggest that the officers there join in a 'round-robin.' protest against certain conditions there, the idea of adopting that form of signa ture, with the names in a circle, be ing so as to divide the responsibility that no one might personally be held accountable." Brvan's call for the democrats to get together is understood by the Council Bluffs Nonpareil to refer "to those he has been pledged to retain in the party and not to those whom he has elim inated." "Of what account would the circle on the ballot have been this year?" asks the Woodbine Chronicle. "To the average voter in Harrison county it would have looked like a deserted rat hole." "But a primary law may be enacted, and it will be if the platforms of boih parties are lived up to." concedes the Cedar Rapids Gazette. "In which case there need be no strife."

GROVE'S signa ture Is on each box. 25c. *"l"l"l"l-l I LOOKER-ON IN IOWA 11 Appllngton, Dec. 4.—'Recent.y the writer met an Iowa druggist, and in conversation the druggist remarked, "The wonder is you newspaper men don't take up the question of adulter ation of white lead, linseed oil and mixed paints. Our citizens are buying every day these articles, and in many cases pay two prices for what they really get. Have you seen what North Dakota is doing to expose these fraud ulent articles? At your leisure look over this pamphlet issued by that state." It has so much of general interest, especially as all of us use more or less paint, that copious excerpts will be made from it in what follows: Under the date of February 26. 1306, there was issued by this department the following circular notice: The North Dakota paint law has been declared constitutional and valid. The decision was rendered February 24, by Judge Amidon. o0 the United States district court. The paint law is, therefore, now in force, and it is ex pected that the manufacturers and jobbers who ship paints Into the state from this time on will comply with the requirements of the same and label the products where such labels are found necessary. It will be news to some that they pay from 85 cents to $1.25 for a gal lon of water when buying paint, but this bulletin says: "We emphasized strongly in Bulle-i tin No. 67 the evils of the presence of a large amount of water in palnls and showed that some of the paints upon the market in the liquid portion con tained as high as 24 per cent. It is not our purpose to repeat what was said at that time, but refer the reader to the original. We may, however, in passing, state that paint materials, lin seed oil,' various pigments and other products that enter into the composi tion of paint must naturally carry a small amount of hygroscopic moisture. We have, therefore, held that paints which contain not to exceed 1.5 per cent of water In the fluid portion are to be considered as pure, in this re spect, and that such water is to be classed simply incidental to the pro cess of manufacture, "A number of commercial brands of white lead, found in the state, have been examined, and outside of the rec ognized makers of white leads^ not one has been found which did riot contain a large amount of inert matter, and in some instances they have ben found to contain no white lead whatever." "Watering" paint is bad enough, but It's not all of the tricks of the trade. They "short weight" us. North Da kota found: "Not only is there a wide variation in the composition of paints but the paints of certain houses are frequently short in measure, sometimes to the ex tent of 10 to 13 per cent. Thus, a man paying for a two quart can of some of the mixed paints may receive bu: 1.75 quarts thus loosing 12% per cent which gives a very considerable profit to the benefit of the manufacturer of this paint as compared with the manufact urer who gives full measure. We have, therefore, in the following pages tried to give the true measure of each and every sample of paint which has been examined by this department. It is be lieved that this publicity will,have a tendency to force all manufacturers to bring the standard of measure more nearly to what it Should be. All the white leads and so-called white leads, examined by this depart ment, have been found to be short weight. That is, the kegs supposed to contain 12% pounds will actually con tain in each eight kegs which should have shown 100 pounds only 83 to 83 pounds. Publishing one analysis, it says:: "From an inspection of the above table it wil be observed that none of these, products contain an amount which the purchaser assumes to be present. It i§ true that for a number of years this condition has prevailed, but in making corrections of evils now existing it seems a good time to place this product on a basis of the true net weight. Why should a man pay for 12% pounds when he receives but 10%? It i9 claimed that this additional price pays for the pail or keg but the man who Is calculating on the amount of material Is misled and has right to expect-that the product shall be la belled truthfully not only with regard to the actual composition, but to the weight as well. While the paint law does not apply to weights under the general law of the state, it is believed there is sufficient ground for demand ing that this change be made on the part of those who would send their products into North Dakota. Some of the paints furnished by cat alog houses, and others who do busi ness of a similar nature, cost to pro duce less than one-half that for good paints, even tho the good paint, con tains a considerable percentage of inert material, that is, the pigment in one of these catalog house paints per gallon has been estimated to cost -12% cents, while in another paint the pigment in each galloon would cost not less i.hai 57 cents on the same basis of estima tion. There are other cheap paints costing less to produce even than the one indicated 'above and, too, in the liquid portion there is even a wider variation in the cost of the two classes of paints." "Water and benzine are not to be classed in cost with good -turpentine and linseed oil. Neither are they to be considered as adding anything of vir tue to the paint. Three pounds of sal soda, one and one-half pounds glue, one and one-half pounds of borax and two pounds of sugar of lead in fifty gallons of water when mechanically combined with the pigment to the ex. tent of 12 to 24 per cent of the fluid of the paint might make a good profit for the manufacturer and furnish a "dope" deceptive ,to the consumer, but nevertheless it is a shameful fraud. It would not be strange, however, if this did' not fairly represent some of the 'jelly-in-the-pail' like paints. "The size of the can does not vary greatly for the leading manufacturers of standard paints. There Is. however, a noticeable difference in the size of the cans used by the leading catalog houses doing business in the state. Not only are these paints as a rule notor iously cheap and inferior products, but one does not secure full measure, as shown by the following: Size of 'Can. Contents. Qts. Qts. 185 Montgomery Ward & Company 1.9.t -f: 1.82 184 Montgomery, Ward 'CLP? ELP! PA-RTS of PouTiCJ BWb & Company (U. S. Pt. Co.) 1.94 1.78 183 Sears, Roebuck Co. (Seroco) 1.95 1.70 154 T. M. Roberts -Com pany 1.93 1.7o 155 T. M. Roberts Com pany 1.95 1.92 170-1 Chase 3.'90 3.41 "It will be observed in the column headed "contents" above that there Is a very material shortage, and, in the case of Chase, the paint as purchased, instead of getting the full gallon one actually receives 3.41 quarts. Here is certainly a good margin of profit for the paint producer, without taking in to consideration the character of the product which enters into the can." Our new pure food law going into effect will remedy some of these evils. But these paint compounds will still be on sale in Iowa with labels thereon none too clear, giving actual contents. But hereafter If the purchaser of "cheap" paints in Iowa buys water at 80 cents a gallon and loses 15 per cent in quality, he can only blame hims'elf. Cb/° ftuwyjLAtS Grinned Woman On Schoolma'ams. Editor Times-Republican: The lamented scarcity of teachers is artificially created by the state super intendent. Why don't you publish ths examination questions, so we can judge if they were fair and reasonable? Are teachers expccted to be living diction aries? Ten of us mothers with fair ed ucation and an encyclopedia, can pre pare an examination that Mr. Riggs himself would have trouble to pass. We women are ftot to blame if the bal lots did not get scratched more. Will our teachers give better satisfaction at $100 a month? Shall the taxpayers .foot the bill or the smart fellow that tries to start an educational trust and who wants to cure all the ills of our school system, with high salaried teachers. Ask twenty-flve of our girls by what occupation they expect to earn their living. Ask twenty-flve mothers what is first choice for their daughters. And ask our young men, If their first choice for a bride Is not the school ma'am. Now why shall we pay so much for a job they all prefer? I be lieve a competent housekeeper, or hired girl as you call her, ought to get as much as a teacher. I'm as much for a good education as any one but i-t con sists of a head full of booklearning and a ruined nervous system. Or stands education for an improved mini an upright character and an increased ability to earn ian honest living? It is an insult on our county superintendent and the rural directors to hint that they choose teachers for personal rea sons, and not for worth, and ability to conduct the schools. The county super-' intendents are very well able to exam ine the teachers. That is what we have them for. Long live the sweet Iowa schoolma'am, the best product of our farms! And we intend to keep her. Consolidation may be fine, where the majority of the community resides in the center of a township, and where they have not -built expensive new school houses. One plan would be to teach children up to the 8th grade In the country and make an arrangement with the t-own school board to have the 8th and higher grades in the town schools. MRS. F. HEINLE.

[Manson Democrat.] The gambling table has always been a source of trouble in Manson. For that matter it has always beeh source of trouble everywhere and always will be. And in speaking of the gambling table it may not neces sarily be a table at all, but may be anything from an elegant mahogany creation with an artistically padde] top to a greasy and grimy surface of commonest wood, the top of a cigar case, a saloon bar", and office desk or any place where the cards or dice may be turned, face- upward, to tell the fool that fickle fortune has smiled upon his rival. In Manson the gam bling table has played a part irn- many a domestic and financial tragedy. The laborer has lost his week's wages in the dice game, while the business ENGLAND MOVEMENT SUFFRAGE "I'll compel you to notice me, sir!" —Walker in Pueblo Chieftain. man has frittered away his fortune, his home and the respect of his fellow business men by keeping his ear to the ticker, while his "brokers" in Chicago bought champagne and lob ster and paid hack hire with the mon ey he paid for, "margins." In Manso.i the gambling table has been a whip in politics, a club to beat people into submission to lawlessness for fear of exposure, a source of blackmail an.1 bluffing and a thief -and robber in gen eral. In Manson there are many homes which could have been happy had the husband loved his wife bet ter than the green cloth. In Manson there are even stunted young men and women who could have been ro bust and normal had their fathers taken the money which the "kitty" got and bought nourishing food) for their little ones. In Manson there are men today who are "down" and probably always will be for the reason that the gambling table has taken their time from honest pursuits and cursed their lives with an insatiable lust for gaming. In Manson tho gambling table of one "gang" has al way been fish, while the gambling table of the other "bunch" has always been flesh. In Manson it has been a crime for one man to operate a gam bling table, while such an occupation for another man has been a shrewd business polity. And there lies the secret of most of the trouble the gam bling table has caused In Manson. And Manson is only a smaH town. It does not need a public gambling table, nor a private one either. It does not need to, support any lazy scoundrel with a "rake-off." If men must get together and play for money stakes, let them do so privately and not pay their money into the "kitty" of some loafer and blackleg. As the gambling table has always been a source of trouble, a thiei', a robber and an outlaw in Manson, why not do away with it entirely? Why not eliminate it from 'buslnesii, politics, pleasure and everything else? Why not put each separate arid distinct gambling table, of any shape, make or design whatsoever, out of business forever? It can be done, but it must be done thoroughly, for if the slightest atom of seed is left it will surely sprout and grow up into a noxious and troublesome weed of dishonesty and discontent. Let th^ thievss go to work like men or starve litae rats. In Praise of Chamberlain's Cough Remedy.
