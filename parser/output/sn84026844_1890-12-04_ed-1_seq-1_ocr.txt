Washington, I). 0., Doc. 3.?The Democratic Senators lmil a caucus tills afternoon to discuss tho order ot business, Tlio chances of tho passage of tho election hill, it it should reach a final voto, wero canvassed nml individual fionators oxpressed divers opinions as to the ability of the Ropubllcau party loaders to keep their forccs in line. The conclusion reached was to maintain au unaltorahlo opposition to tho passage of the bill. Tho minority will stiza overy opportunity to discuss tho bill exhaustively nnd fairly and to inn cud every objectlonablo tea ture as reached in the detailed conBidera* tlon of tho measure, as was the case with the tariff bill. Tho opinion was expressed that aa the mnjority had not yet signified any intention to unduly restrict reaeonablo debate, it would be premature for tho caucus to uudertake tho arraugemunt of a programme to meet tho presentation of a cloBuro reBOlutiou. To secure harmony of action tbe Democratic members of the Coinmitteo on Privileges and Elections (which reported the bill) will take charge of tho debate and arrange tho order of speaking. Aa to tho further order of business, it was decided that an the Republican Senators had not yet completed their order the caucus would not now undortake to formulate a programme. PROCEEDINGS OF CONGRESS. Tlio Indian Question nud Election llill In tho Sanate? Copfrfght Hill I'tune* the IIouho. Washington, D. C., Dec. o? After tho reading of tho flouso Journal the Speaker stated tho pending business to bo tho further consideration of tho copyright bill. Mr. Simonds, of Connecticut, (in charge of tho bill), stated that tho frieuds of tho measure were willing to havo a vote taken immediately, but expressed his readiness to yield any iirne that its opponents might desire. Tho dobate on tho copyright bill lastod until about 2 o'clock, Springor, Peters, Oates and Kerr opposed the bill while Breckenridge, of Kentucky, Farquahir, McAdoo and Buttorworth spoke in its support. A vote was then taken and resulted yeas 130; nays 95. So tho bill was passed. Iu tho Senate. Washington, JJ. U., Doc. 3.?In presenting a petition for an amendment to tho tariff bill in relation to the rebate on manufactured tobacco in the Senate toiday, Mr. Allison said that the conferees ' on the part of both houses had agreed to that section of the tariff, aa the conforence report, would disclose, but that it Lad been omitted in the enrollment. . He had no doubt that the matter would receive early attention. Mr. Culloin introduced a bill to reduce letter postage to ono cent, and it was referred. A long and interesting discussion took place on the subject of the threatened Indian war apropos to a joint resolution to issue arms to the States o? North nnd South Dakota and Nebraska, Mr. VorheeB having charged tho situation to the fact of tho Indiana being starved, and being replied to by Messrs. Dawes and Pierce. Tho debate was interrupted at 2 o'clock by the Election hill coming up as the unfinished business. Mr. Hoar, in charge of tho bill,said that in view of tho fact that on reporting tho bill at the cloao of the last session he had addressed the Senate upon it ho would now forego any opening of the debate, but would content himself with answering whatever objections should bo made to the bill on tlie Democratic side of tho Chamber. Mr. Turpio thereupon opened the discussion in opposition. Ho said the recent census would show that in the States on Pennsylvania, Ohio and Illinois there were about 250,000 r?:>nri1<V V<>f. in thnon Rrntpa nn -colored myi had ever served us Gov ernoror been ejected to any department ot tho Stato Government. The euppresaion of thn colored vote in the South was a thing p.(firmed on one Bide and denied on the other, hut (he suppression of the colored voter of the North was a thing without question, actual, absolute, unconditional. Tho (supremacy of' tho white race was not peculiar t.o any portion of tho United States South Carolina was not more completely under its fia'isy than ivas Pennsylvania. Ito supremacy was not one whit more firmly established ifi Texas aud Arkansas than in Illinois and Ohio. The man (especially the man of the Whito Honse) who sought to embroil the white and black races for a purpose, he could not conceal aud daro not avow was guilty of an outrage ten fold greater than any of those ho invented or described. The purposo of the pending bill was Hint tho law of the land must be suuoru?d to eat enemity between the white man and the black man. The bill was not artfully framed. Ito only art was its absoluto malignity. ?aes this bill and tho right of tho people to choose their representatives that right so precious anil pricoloeo to every Joyor of liberty wat,' lost?lost beyond" recovery i?r:d beyond .recall. At tho conclusion of his spoecli, Mr. Turpie reonivod tho congratulations of liis Democratic colleagues and tho Senate adjourned.

They sold their proper? ty for almost anvthini.' thov r.nnlil JJ gut, abandoned their homes and ruahed r# to tho nearest railway station, when the fact is that they would be in no more r danger from tho Indiana than wo are q hero in Chicago," The principal cause r. of the Indian troublea is lack of proper , provislona in the way of rationa?prin: J cipaliy meat rations. The latter were reduced 1,000,000 pounds for the ^ Pino Ridge reservation alono, and the authorities there have a practice of j. issuing a steer at tho weight at which it was received. For instance, the agency might kill a steer in the fall that would 0 weigh 1,000 pounds. In tho spring it t wouldn't weigh more than GOO pounds, y but it would bo issued at 1,000 pouuds , all tho same. Of couroo tho Indians ^ would loee tho difference. This is one n great source of dissatisfaction.

"Sultl I'uslin " This popular opera will bo given at the Opt-ra House Saturday evening. As its namo bears witness it is a Turkish opera, giving 6Cope for elaborate costuming. Tito opportunity is not lost, the costumes throughout the opera being rich and tasteful. There isnt much of a story told, most of what there is centering about the forbidden love of an oliicer of the Turkish guard for his superior's daughter and the wanderings of a Mexican in search of ao ideal woman. The Pasha's daughter Serena, in the person of Agnes Sherwood, is the center of interest at all times. She is a charming little sprite and the spectator falls ia love with her from her first appearance. There's only an armiul of her but that little is like a sunbeam, carrying joy and warmth wherever it falls. Her voice is strong and sweet, and she sings the part charmingly. l*rof.
