be that Two aut of list ing $hf ^ftliddlriou'ii transcript MIDDLETOWN. DEL W SCOTT WAY, Editor. SATURDAY MORNING, DEC. 7, 1878 THE MESSACE. President Hayes' second annual transmitted to Congress message was Monday. It is not a lengthy doc ument for a President's message, but. like the boy's butter, "it is mighty good what there is of it, and there is enough of it such as it is. ' After the customary mention that we are at peace with our neighbors. abundant harvests are attended to and it is believed that "general pros perity is at last within our reach." The yellow fever epidemic is reviewed and Congress invited to give quaran tine matters early and careful consid The freedom of eleetiius in our a of is oration. the South is discussed at considerable length and the re-ords of the elections in South Carolina, Louisaim and some Congressional districts in other States to compel the conclusion that **?eem the rights of the colored ^voters have been over-ridden and their participa tion in the elections not permitted to he either'genernl or free." Congress is asked to look into «his matter, hut only the mildest measures mended. Returning Boards] are not alluded to, as the President no doubt feels it a too delicate T subject''to dis cuss. After a review of our foreign relations the public finances are taken up, but no financial legislation is recommended. On the contrary, he thinks the "welfare of legitimate bus iness will be best promoted by abstain ing from all attempts to make radical changes in the existing financial legis Resumption will take place at the appointed time and will be fol lowed by a "healthful revival of busi ness prosperity,The Arroyjs-touched are recom lation.' lightly and several recommendations of the Secretary of War are appended After going through with the remain der of the departments, the President turns his attention to agriculture and urges upon the attention of Congress and the people the importance of an increase of our agricultual production and quotes a passage from Washing ton's eighth annual message. He tells us that about one-half the population of the United States are engaged in agriculture and that the value of the agricultural products of the country for the year 1878 is estimated at three thousand millions of dollars. Our ex - ports of agricultural products iu 1877 were flattering, yet, notwithstanding our advantages of soil, climate and intercommunication, we import an nuatty from foreign lands many mil - n . , bons of dollars worth of agricultural products that we could raise at home. On agriculture the President is sound, and his good suggestions under that head help to make up for his silence . 1 . » TT , on civil service reform. Upon the whole, the message has little iu it that any one can object to, hut on many things that received careful attention „ „„„„ _ _ a vear ago the .President is now as ° , silent as a grmdstone. Perhaps a year's experience has taught him-(he value of saying little when he h a s lit "^ïTtolâÿl^ .he hft^earned more J . .... . . , in oue year than Grant did in eight. None can object to his condemnation of election frauds but he should have directed attention to other sections of the country as well to the South. The , „ , , . message glides along from one head to another as smoothly as an old time ser mon and winds up with "District of Columbia affairs," a subject in which Traveling on the "iron trail" from Wilmington to Delmar one gains a pretty good idea of the Diamond State, her soil, lie*- productions, the "lay of her land," her towns and villages and perhaps, trorn association, some little about her people ; hut to know Dela wareans a « Delawareans ; to know them as a social, hospitable and unos tentatious people woe needs to çross the thresholds of their cyiiet, comfort able homes, where the stranger is al ways welcome and is soon made to feel as much at home as though he sat hy his own fireside. In truth, the hospitality of Delawareaus is prover bial, but that is not what your corres pondent started out to write about. In the by-ways of our State, lying beyond the shrill shriek of the loco motive, are many'quiet, happy, culti vated and prosperous communities where the financially solid, though un pretentious and hospitable Delawarean may be seen in all his glory. Up and down the State such communities are to be found, but it is only of one of these that we are now going to treat and that ifl Frederica. It is six miles from the r railroad at Felton to this quiet, cozy village—six miles through a level stretch of pretty farm-lands to the narrow main street that, after one or iwo uncomfortable bends, goes down to the spacious warehouses on the hanks of the Murderkill, out of which the grain-ladetied vessels have sailed for almost a century. Here, six miles from the bay and six miles from the "neigh of the iron-horse' we find a neat, ( we cannot say prettv) quiet, pleasant and prosperous village ofi eight hundred inhabitants, who no one is interested save the President, Congress, the lobbyists and residents. The message is hy no means an ag gressive document; rather, it is as mild as a hoy's first composition on temperance, and neither Democrats nor Republicans will find much in it to condemn. I'orresponitence of the Transcript. 

DOWN IN KENT. Frederica, Del., Dec. 3rd, 1878. BJtie are hospitable from the heart, c!e;uo eratio clear through aud satisfied with one mail in each and every twenty four hours. Here thedifferent brajfohes ai>l the giftceries of trade are well represented display of dry goods and at through open doors at every corner would seem to argue that there might be a lively competition for the trade that centers here, and the handsome residences of several of the merchants show them to be financially well fixed. Two neat and well stocked drug stores (one of them presided over by a pleas aut and communicative gentleman who believes in enterprise and rail roads) supply the community with pills, powders, castor oil, etc. Some of the buildings here show that they have passed through many changing seasons, and there are many evidences that the village belongs to the long list of Delaware's early settlements. Recently,however, it has been improv ing at quite a healthy rate, among the recent improvements being a hand some brick Methodist Church and a number of commodious dwellings on the street that leads "toward the bridge." Frederica's industrial enterprises are Here is a phos a quite noteworthy phate factory where many tons of fer tilizer are annually turned out, a fac tory for preparing husks for matresses, a ship-vard where not only old hulls are put in a seaworthy condition but where trim and staunch new vessels built and launched on the bosom of the Murderkill ;Ybut Fchief among the enterprises of the village, and per haps the most important of them all, is the canning factory of Mr. S. W Hall, where no less than 570,000 3-lh. of tamatoes and many thousand of peaches, corn and apples put up during the past season. The whole process of putting up fruits and vegetables in air-tight caus is very simple, and, outside of the manufacture of the enus, requires very little machinery. Mr. Hall, as we stepped upon a large plat form in front of the factory, " is where the tomatoes are received from the wagons and weighed, then just here at the entrance of one wing of the factory they are poured into scald after -vliich they are skinned and cored by women who stand in front of these long troughs. Next, the water is carefully strained from them, they dipped into the cans piled around the operators ready to receive them and carefully capped and soldered up. Now r comes the bath—an immersion in boiling water. This is done by placing the caus in large racks and sinking them in tubs of water—kept constantly boiling by steam pipes. For tomatoes, from ten to fifteen minutes is consid ered long enough for the bath, while requires about three hours boil cans cans were "Here," said MV corn ing.' After the bath the cans are low ered to the testing room and carefully examained by au expert who tan tell a leaky can just as you would test a watermelon before pulling it—by a simple tap. The testor does this with little stick, and those cans that do not have the "right ring" are sent to the soldering room, carefully exam ined and the leak stopped. Now the cans are ready for labeling and box ing,which is done by boys who handle the cans and labels' like chain light In the tin room of Mr. Hall's - mutr factory are to be seen all the most ap proved machinery for the manufacture calis - Here the several parts cou , prising a can are cut out at a single frow.lnd the soldering done with the greategt rapidity. The cans are made up during the winter, and last season 3,000 boxes of tin were used iu this department. Mr Hall contracts for his tomatoes in the fall, giving out about 300 acreB to be p i ante d. Last season he paid forty cents per hundred pounds, and as the average crop per acre * s 10,000 lbs. the reautf will see that tomatoes pay much better than as , J - , , . . T ., cor«'üoes at 40 cents a bushel. Iu the a height of the season two hundred hands are employed in the factory lit- and turn out 31,000 cans of fruit or vegetables per day The annual clis , tnbution of money directly from this t' ac tory must be considerable, and, as j t m0 etly goes among the farmers and laboring people, it may be safely said of that it is put where it-will do the most |uch a factory as Mr Hall has in Frederica you should by all to mans have in Middletown, of This canning factory, an enterprise of which Frederica is justly proud, was established by Mr. Hall about six years ago, and the proprietor, though putting up other goods, has made a leader of tomatoes and earned a repu tation for his goods second to none in the country. His brands are now to be fouijd upon almost every grocer's shelves,and when the can is opened and the contents poured into a dish they look and taste like fresh tomatoes from the vine. The factory stands close by the j hank of the Murderkill, and the ship ! ping is done exclusively by water, j The cases are sawed at Saulsbury, re ag as on it | eeived in "shucks," and nailed togeth at the factory as needed. At the I time of our visit to the factory a lot of 2-lb. he of to of j visit to the cozy little vill ! Murderkill.

It is perhaps unnecessary for me to j tell vour readers that S. \V. Hall is the son of our next Governor, who will he inaugurated at Dover, on the The Governor came 17th instant here as a clerk in a store, aud, as they grew up with the place" and is universally beloved aud respected by his friends aud neighbors. We understand that an effort is to made? to get a railroad from Dover .Milford, a distance of seventeen miles, passing through this place, and as here arc to be found many live bus iness men who. have good bank ac counts qnd belieVe in enterprise we see no feast» why'"they should not have it It sëerfls to be the * ' that such a road would pay lately, but of that your correspondent is'u t able to jddge. . \ One of the most* enterprising firm# here is Reyuolds & Postles, dealers in general merchandise and grain buy ers. They do a flourishing trade, we are informed, and have the largest share of the grain business, running a line of vessels to Philadelphia and New York. I should like to give a more ex tended notice of Frederica and its business enterprise hut must defer it until I can make a more extended on the say out west, to. non j

The opening day of Congress not of special interest in either House. Senator Blaine made an inquiry into the subject of equal rights of voters at elections, and Representative Hood sharply critized that portion of the President's message which assumes that voters in the South were intimidated at the November election. He called attention to the fact that there was intimidation by Government officials unconstitutional officials—in New V ork City, and that Mr. Hayes had omitted to condemn them. Nothing was done proposed as to the contemplated • • ■ of the "cipher des It seems to be understood was or investigation patches." that, unless the radicals precipitate such investigation, the Potter Commit tee will, at an early day, undertake the work. There is, as heretofore said, a disposition on both sides to evade the discussion of disturbing questions until later in the session. Mr. Thurman stated truth wheu saying that under our form of Government there had been and must ever be two parties one a party of the people and the other cf class and privilege Any candid man who reads the annual ' message of Mr. Hayes, or tue reports of his Secretaries, will not fail to see that the party which is not of the people, but of cläss and privilege, is the party to which those gentlemen belong. Even Mr. Schurz, red republican as he was, and tlieoret ical Democrat as he thinks he is, in vents new Federal offices and ask* Congress to appropriate money them. The Secretaries of War and the Navy cling to the old abuses and the old excrescences. The Attorney General asks for money to pay legion of officials unknown spiritJirJfitter of the Constitution. In all the messages and reports ordered printed by Congress yesterday there is not a suggestion that any superflu ous officer may be dropped, that any dollar of money may be saved to the that the methods of profound a for to \]A tax-paver, or Government may in any way be sim plified. Imagine such documents com ing at a time like this from Seymour, Bayard, Hendricks, Tilden, Thurman, and the Cabinet Officers they would have around them ! To consider this is to see the difference oetweeu a party of the people and a party of class and privilege—between Democracy and Republicanism. Secretary Sherman recommends, and the recommendation deserves con sideration. the issue Deposit of ten dollars and upwards, bearing interest at the rate of 3 65 per cent, and fundable in 4 per cent, bonds at any time within a year after issue, and the ptoceeds to be used in retiring the 6 per cent, bonds.

"A series of riots" is reported at Jackson, in Breathitt county. Ky., which began last Monday week.
