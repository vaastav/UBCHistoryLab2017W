URGES CHANGES IN LAWS Present Currency System Declared Imperfect Control of Corporations the Province cf the National Gov ernment Conduct of Labor Lead ers Criticised For Postal Savings Banks. Washington. Tn his message to congress, read in both houses Tues day, President Roosevelt makes im portant suggestions as to what he considers necessary legislation. The president congratulates the na tion on its present excellent financial standing, but calls attention to the need of remedying defects in the cur rency system. lie says: The financial standing of the nation at tho present time Is excellent, and the finnnelal management of tho na tion's Interests by tho government dur ing tho last seven years has shown the, most satisfactory results. But our cur rency system Is Imperfect, and It Is ear nestly to be hoped that tho currency commission will bo eba to propose a thoroughly good system which will do away with tho existing defects. During tho period from July 1, 1901, to September 30, 1D0S, tbero was an Increase In tho amount of money in circulation of $002.09 1,390. Tho Increase In tho per capita during this period was $7.00. Within till. tlmo there were several occasions when It wns necessary for tho treasury de partment to come to tho relief of the money market by purchases or redemp tions of United States bonds; by Increas ing deposits In national banks; by stim ulating additional Issues of national bank notes, and by facilitating Importations from abroad of gold. Our Imperfect cur rency system has made these proceedings necessary, nnd they wore effective until the monetary disturbance In tho fall of 1907 Immensely Increased tho difficulty of ordinary methods of relief. By the mid dle of November tho available working oalance In tho treasury had been reduced to approximately $5,000,000. Clearing house associations throughout tho coun try had been obliged to lesort to the expedient of Issuing clearing houso cer tificates, to bo used is money. In this emergency It was determined to Invite subscriptions for $50,000,000 Panama canal bonds, and $100,000,000 three per cent, certificates of Indebtedness authorized by tho act Of Juno 13, 1S9S. It was proposed to redeposlt In the national hanks the proceeds of these Issues, and to permit their use'as a basis for additional circu lating notes of national banks. The moral effect of this procedure was so great that It was neccssarv to Issue only $24,631,9S0 of tho Panuma bonds and $15, 486.600 of tho certificates of Indebtedness. During tho period from July 1, 1901, to September 30, 1903, the balnnco between the net ordinary receipts and tho net ordinary expenses of the government showed a surplus in tho four years 1902. 1903, 190G, and 1907. and a deficit In the years 1901, 1905, 190S and a fractional part of the llscal year 1900. Tho net result was a surplus of $93.2S3. 113.51. Tho finan cial operations of the govornment during this period, based upon theso differences between receipts and expenditures, re sulted in a net reduction of tho Interest bearing debt of tho United States from (9S7.141.0-iO to $S9 (',253.900, notwithstanding that there had been two sales of Panama canal bonds amounting In the aggregate to $54,G31,9S0, and an Issue of three per cent, certificates of Indebtedness under the act of Juno 13, 1S9S, nmountlng to (15,430,500. Refunding operations of the treasury department under tho act of March 14, 1900, resulted In tho conver sion Into two per cent, consols of 1930 of $200,309,400 bonds bearing higher rates of Interest. A decrease of ?S,CS7.95fl In tho annual Interest charge resulted from these operations. In short, during tho seven years and three months there has been a not sur plus of nearly ono hundred millions of receipts over expenditures, a reduction of the Interest-bearing debt by ninety millions, In splto of the extraordinary ex pense of tho Panama canal, and a saving of nearly nine millions on tlu annual Interest charge. The message reltorates tho well known views of the president that the control of great corporations, espe cially tho railroads of tho country, should bo vested in tho national gov ernment, lie says: I bollevo that It Is worse than folly to attempt to prohibit till combinations as 13 doun lv th Sherman anti trust law, because such a law can be enforced only Imperfectly and un equally, and Its enforcement works al most as much hardship as good. I strongly advocate that lnstca.1 of an un wise effort to prohibit all combinations, there shall bo substituted a law which shall expressly permit combinations which are tn the Interest of tho public, but shall at the same time give to soma agency In the national government full power of control and supervision over them. Tho railways of tho country should bo put completely -lcr the Interstate com merce commlsslo.'. nnd removed from tho domain of tho anti-trust law. Tho power of the commission should bo mado thoroughgoing, so that It could exercise complete supervision and control over tho lssuo of securities as well as over the raising and lowering of rates. As regards tales, at leust. this power should be summary. . . . Rates must bo made as low as Is compatible with giving prop er returns to all the employes of the rail road, from tho highest to tho lowest, and proper returns to tho shareholders, but they must not, for instance, bo re duced in such fnshlon as to necessitate a cut In the wages of tho employes or the abolition of the proper and legitimate profits of honest shareholders. Interests of the Wagcworker. Turning to conditions affecting the wagoworker and tho man of Binall means, the president says: Postal Savings banks will make It easy for the poorest to keep their sav ings in absolute safety. Tho regulation of the national highways must bo such that they shall servo all people with equal Justice. Corporate finances must bo supervised so as to mnke It far safer than at present for the man of small means to Invest his money In stocks. There must be prohibition of child la bor, .minution of women labor, short ening of hours of all mechanical labor; stock watering should bo prohibited, and stock gambling so far as Is possi ble discouraged. There should be a progressive Inheritance tax on largo fortunes. Industrial education should be encouraged. As far as possible we should lighten tho burden of taxation on the btnall man. There should no longer be any paltering with the question of taking caro of the wageworkers who, under otir pres ent Industrial system, become killed, crippled, or worn out as part of the regular incidents of a given busi ness. As far as concerns those who have been worn out, I call your attontlon to tho fact that definite steps toward providing old-age pen sions have been taken In many of our private Industries. These may bo In definitely extended through voluntary association and contributory schemes, or through tho agency of savings banks, as under tho Massachusetts plan. Urgent Need of Reform. Our present system, or rather no sys tem, works dreadful wrong, and 1b of benefit to only one class of people tho lawyers. When a workman Is Injured what ho needs Is not an expensive and doubtful lawsuit, but tho certainty of relief through Immediate administra tive action. No academic theory about "freedom of contract" or "consti tutional liberty to contract" should bo permitted to Interfere with this and similar movements. I renew my recommendation that tho principle of tho eight-hour day should as rapidly and as far as practi cable be extended to the entlro work being carried on by the govornment; tho present law should be amended to embrace contracts on those public works which tho present wording of the act seems to exclude. I renew my recommendation made In a previous message that half-holidays be granted during summer to all wage workers in government employ . Judges Too Poorly Paid. Coupled with a eulogy of the ju diciary of tho nation the president urges that, beginning with tho su preme court, the judges should have their salaries doubled. As was to be expected, the attitude assumed by certain labor leaders dur ing the recent election comes in for bitter criticism. The president as sorts that demands made on congress for legislation were unjust and im practical and could but work harm to tho cause of labor. Whilo declaring that our judicial system is sound and effective at core, tho president says: Thoro are certain decisions by various courts which have been exceedingly det rimental to the rights of wage-workers. Tills Is true of all decisions that decide that men are, by the constitution, "guar anteed their liberty" to contract to enter a dangerous occupation, or to work an undesirable or Improper number of hours, or to work In unhealthy surroundings; and thoreforo cannot recover damaKcs when maimed In that occupation, ,nd cannot bo forbidden to work what the legislature decides Is an excessive num ber of hours, or to carry on tho work under conditions which the legislature decides to be unhealthy. There Is also, I think, ground for I ho belief that substantial injustice is often suffered by employes In consequoneo of the custom of courts Issuing temporary Injunctions without notlco to them, and punishing them for contempt of court in Instances where, as a matter of fact, they have no knowledge of any proceed ings. Organized labor Is chafing under tho unjust restrnlnt which comes from repeated resort to this plan of procedure. Injunction Must Remain. Tho power of Injunction In n great equltoblo remedy, which should on no account bo destroyed. But safeguards should be greeted against Its abuse. In substance, provision should be made that no Injunction or temporary re straining order Issue othorwlso than on notice, except where Irreparablo Injury would otherwise result; and In such ease a hearing on the merits of tho order should bo had within a short fixed pe riod, nnd, If not then continued after hearing, It should forthwith ,lnpio. De cisions should bo rendered Immediately, and tho chance of delay minimized In every way. Moreover, I bollevo that the procedure should be sharply defined, nnd tho Judge required minutely to stnto tho particulars both of his notion and of his reasons therefor, so that the congress can If It desires examine and lnvestlgato tho same. Harm Worked by Law. Discussing measures necessary for the proper control of giant corpora tions operating in defiance of law, the president says: Real damage has been done by tho manifold and conflicting Interpretations oi tho interstate commerce law. Con trol over tho great corporations doing Interstate business can bo effective only If It Is vested with fml powr In an administrative department, a branch of tho feilernl executive, carrying out a federal law; It can never bo effective If a divided responsibility H left In both tho states nnd tho nation; It can never bo effective If left In the hands of tho courts to be derided by lawsuits. The courts hold a piacu of peculiar and deserved sanctity under our form of gov ernment. Rewpoet for the law Is essen tial to the permanence of our Institu tions; and respect for the law Is largely conditioned upon respect for the courts. It Is an offenso against the republic to say anything which enn weaken this re spect, save for the gravest reason and In tl.o most carefully guarded manner. In no other nation In the world do the courts wield such vast and fnr-roaehlng power as In the United States. All that Is nec essary Is that the courts as a whole should exercise this power with tho far sighted wisdom already j.hown by those Judges who scan tho future while they act in tho present. Forest Preservation. The manifest necessity f)r forest preservation is pointed out as a duty the present generation owes to its de scendants, and the president cites the case of China, where reckless defor estation has resulted in creating des erts, as an object lesson. Inland Waterways. Immediate action by the present session of congress for tho improve ment of our inland waterways the president declares to be imperative. He recommends tho creation of a per manent commission authorized to co ordinate the work of all tho govern ment departments relating to water ways, and to frame and supervise the execution of a comprehensive plan. Postal Savings Banks. Urging tho immediate institution of postal savings banks, tho message says: I again renew my recommendation for postal savings banks, for deposit ing savings with tho security of tho government behind them. Tho object Is to encourage thrift and economy in tho wage-earner and porson of mod erate means. It Is believed that In tho aggregate vast sums of money would bo brought Into circulation through the In strumentality of tho postal savings banks. Parcel Post. The much-discussed advisability of the establishment of a parcel post servlco is thus dealt with: In my last annual messago I com mended tho postmaster-general's recommendation for an extension of tho parcel post on tho rural routes. The establishment of a local parcel post on rural routes would bo to tho mutual benefit of tho farmer and tho country storekeeper, and It Is desirable that tho routes, serving more than 15,000.000 people, should bo utilized to the fullest practicable extent. Education. Dealing with tho important subject of education, the president says: With the limited i.ienns hitherto pro vided, tho bureau of o ducatlon has rendered efficient service, but the con grews has neglected to adequately sup ply tho bureau with means to meet tho educational growtli of tho country. I earnestly recommend that this un fortunate state of affairs as regards tho national educational ofllco bo reme died by adequate appropriations. This rocomniendntlon Is urged by tho repre sentatives of our common schools and great state universities and tho leading educators, who all unlto In requesting favorablo consideration and action by tho congress upon this subject. Tho president points out tho neces sity of hotter organization of tho vari ous bureaus rcsponslblo for tho publlo health, and urges tho placing of all soldiers' homes under tho jurisdiction of tho war department. On tho question of statehood tho president says: I advocate the Immedlnto admission of New Mexico and Arizona as stales. This should bo done nt tho present session of the congress. The people of the two ter ritories havo mado It evident by their votes that they will not como In as ono stale. Tho only alternative Is to admit them as two, and I trust that this will bo dono without delay. Country's Foreign Policy. This nation's foreign policy Is based on tho theory that right must bo don between nations precisely as between Individuals, and In our actions for tho last ten years wo havo In this matter proven our faith by our deeds. We have behaved, and are behaving, to wards other nations, ns In prlvato Ufa an honorable man would behave to wards his fellows. I take this opportunity publicly to state my appreciation of tho way In which In Japan, In Australia, In New Zealand, and In nil the states of Houth America, the battle Hoot has boon re ceived on Its practice voyago around the world. Tho American government can not too strongly express Its nppro clatlou of the abounding nnd generous hospitality shown our ships In every port they visited. Panama Canal Being Rushed. Tho work on tho Panama canal Is be ing dono with a speed, efllclency and entire devotion to duty, which make It a model for all work of the kind. The men on the Isthmus, from Col. Goethals and his fellow commissioner through the entlro list of employes who are faithfully doing their dtity, havo won their right to the ungrudging respect and gratitude of the American people. 1 again recommend tho extension of the ocean mall act of 1891 so that satis factory American ocean mail lines to South America, Asia, tho Philippines, and Australasia mav bo established. Should Develop Hawaii. I call particular attention to tho Ter ritory of Hawaii. Tho Importance of those Islands Is apparent, and the noed of Improving their cond'tlon and du veloplng their resources Is urgent. Progress In the Philippines. Real progress toward self-government Is being mado In tho Philippine Islands. I trust that within a generation tho tlmo will arrive when tho Killplnos can decldo for themselves whether It la well for them to become lndcuendont, or to continue under tho protection of a strong and disinterested power, able to guarantee to tho Islands order at home and protection from foreign Invasion. The president urges that national parks adjacent to national forests ba placed tinder tho control of the forest servlco of tho agricultural depart ment; ho also points out tho benoflta derived from pure food legislation. The National Guard. Urging continued efforts to In crease tho efficiency of tho National Guard the president continues: Now that tho organized militia, the National Guard, has been Incorporated with the army as a part of the national forces, It behooves tho government to do every reasonable thing In Its power to perfect Its efllclency. It should bo assisted in its Instruction and other wise aided more liberally than hereto fore. Tho continuous services of many well-trained regular ofllcers will be essential In i Is connection. A bill Is now pending before tho congreas creating a number of extra ofllcers In the army, which If passed, as It ought to be, will enable mora ofllcers to bo trained as Instructors of National Guard and assigned to that duty. In case of war It will be of the utmost Importance to have a largo number of trained olllcern to use for turning raw levies Into good troops. For More War Vessels. Tho navy is tho last subject dealt with. In that connection tho presi dent says: I approvo tho recommendations of tho general board for tho In crease of tho navy, calling especial attention to the need of addi tional destroyers and colliers, and above all, of the four battleships. It Is desir able to complete us soon as possible a squadron of eight battleships of the boot existing typo. I most earnestly recommend that the general board bo by law turned Into a gonoral staff. There Is literally no ex cuse whatever for continuing tho pres ent bureau organization of tho navy. The navy should bo treated as u purely mili tary organization, and everything should bo subordinated to the one object of se curing military efllclency. A system of promotion by merit, either by selec tion or by exclusion, or by botli processes, should be Introduced, (
