Mtoneapolii Tribune. f( 'Loeii-potidas'io' FemUna'ooim^, the senior county of the'Twelfth council and legislative district of Dakota, should, have died out after the eleotipn held on •the 4th of November. We hoped it wotdd.be qo. National politics were so, but local, politics in Pembina county run high to-day. The county commis sioners of Pembina county made r« turns to the district board, but they were sighed by only three members of the county board, the other three members reftoing to sign them. There had been a dead-look for several days in the board of commissioners for the sake of getting the seat in the territorial council for Judsori La Moure. The canr vassing board were bought or persuaded to-thro,w Pembina county out entirely. By .that act nearly 4000 voters were dis -franohised. Indignation among the people runs .high. Frank A. Willson, .to .whom the seat in° the council be longs, has served notice of contest upon Judsbn La Moure, and John Bechtel, to whom .the seat in the house belongs, has served notice of contest upon H. Stong. Mr.- WillSon' and Mr. Bechtel were elect ed by small 'majorities, but they were mqoritios, fairly, justly and honestly elected by the vote of the people^ It is believed to be the most damnable out rage ever perpetrated upon any people outside of the struggling South. This action of the county commissioners and of the district.canvassing board has not .: the- shadow of an excuse. Decision after''decision of the supreme', courts were'cited, to the county board to guide them in their action,.but they would :s*' 'not heed them. District Attorney Ball from F^rgo was there, stayed with, ac companied Judson La Moure, rodewith him,-walked with him and his friends, and .then h^d the consiftnmate cheek to say he was nonpartisan, but when he was asked .a question, or when he ven tured an opinio^, he always gave' his own opinion in favor of La Mouri?, and never cited a oase or a decision to sub stantiate his own opinion. It is believed that District Attorney Ball, has prosti tuted his office for a personal gain. He claimed to act merely in his official ca pacity, and yet could not cite a single decision bear him out in his "o.fficial" .opinions., The people feel outraged. They,,held a large and enthusiastic meeting at Cavilier on the night of the 27th ult. A regular organization was effected'to contest the election. Money WMB subscribed liberally to be used in gatnerihg evidence of the justness of the peopre's claims, and for presenting it to the respective branches of the territorial .legislature at its next session. If there J%,i a^yjusrice,in thelegislature Willson and B^ci^td.wiill be seated. It is high time for La Moure to be sat down upon jpoliticallyw Voice from Iowa.

It would seem* that Republican's up that way have reduood the machinery for de feating the will of the people in cau cuses and in elections to a science. We have read the reasons given by ihe can vassing board for disfranchising Pembi na county in order to count in La Moure, the .regular nominee, and to count out Willson, the independent Republican, who was elected, and must say that the reasons are too absurd to merit respect ful consideration, and if thb people of the district tamely submit to the out rage they do not deserve to be frpe. We sympathize with the INTER-OCEAN in its fight. When to Quality. Section 10 of chapter 5, page 10, of the revised statutes, provides that: "Ex cept where otherwise especially provid all territorial, district, county, town ship and precinct officers shall qualify and enter upon the duties of their office iij the first Monday of January suc ceeding their election, or within ten days thereafter." Section 9 provides the Regular term of office begins on the first Monday of January next succeed ing election. But if the office to which he was elected be vacant at the time of election, even if he was not elected to fill a vacancy, he shall forthwith qualify' and enter upon the duties of his office. It has been held that unless the parties qualify within ten days the office, is de clared vacant, and the official elected cannot afterward perform the duties. Nor hern Eailroad Outlet.

IMPOBTS OP MEBCHANDISE. Mr* Nimmo, Chief of the ^Bureau of Sta tistics, has submitted an annual statement showing the Imports of merchandise, with the rates of duty, and the amounts of duty couected thereon. It appears that the act of March 8,1888, reduced the average ad va lorem rates as follows: On Iron and steel manufactures thereof, 3.04 per cent. cloth ing wool, 11.86 per cent. combing wool, 8. 57per. cent carpet wool,2.83 percent: manufacturers' wool, 2.26 percent: and manufacturers' silk. 9.15 per cent The act mentioned raised the average ad valorem rates as follows:.. On sugar and meiada, L .06 per cent manufacturers' cotton, 2,65 per cent earthen andchipa ware, 14.56 per cent glass and glassware, 0.68 percent elada, ton, 2,6« 14.56 pei percent, spirits and wines, 14.92 per cent. and malt liquors, 3.05 per cent PBOSPKCTS 07 THE BA2TKBTJPT BILL. Representative Collins, of Massachusetts, has charge of thebill reported from the House Committee on the judlcii rudlciary. at the last session of Congress providing for anew bankruptcy law. He sayB an effort is being —y 19 an effort .was made to consider the bill in the House under suspension of the rules or to have a dav set apart for its consideration. A two thirds vote was necessary. The vote stood 187 to 93, and, of course, the object of the friends of the bill was defeated. It will be thirty sure to necessary to secure twenty or from the opponents of the measure votes pass it The greatest opposition is from'the South and West Indiana, Missouri, and Kentucky are almost solidly opposed to it \yltliout securing the necessary two-thirds Tote to get a suspension of the rules there Is no hope for the bilL It is on the calen dar, and In such a position that it will be impossible to reach it at so short a session. An attempt to suspend the rules will be made in the early part of January. Committee will try to pass through the House some bill to secure the National-bank system and avert financial depression. He expects to meet with opposition, but says something must be done. Whatever action is taken, I however, will have to be before the 16th, (or after that time It will be too late to get a day assigned. The Interstate Commerce bill will nosslbly not occupy more than two lays. Mr. Cobb will make an effort to pass soi ue additional land-grant forfeiture bills. Tnere will be an effort made to pass the Bankruptcy bill., The canal men are preparing for a fight to get their bills through this session. The hardest work wlil be done by those interested in the Hen nepin, the Erie, and the Maryland and Dsl tware Canals. The Nlcnraguan. Canal men will attempt to have some action taken by lie House for the advancement of their In terests. There will be an effort made, also. pass the bill restricting the' coinage of Uie silver dollar. THE, WHISK! ITCN. Although there are indications that an earnest effort will, bn made this winter to extend the bonded period for the benefit of persons who are carrying stocks of spirits, the occasion for any such relief is rapidly diminishing. Exportation has afforded some relief and Is now going on at the rate of about 30 per cent, above the exportation forthe previous year. During the first sev en months of 1885, 24,ttl7,5U2 gallons will have to be withdrawn, but during the last five months of the year only 2,ri3,!i94 gal lons will have to be withdrawn, making A , 181,186 gallons for the year. During the first.seven months of 1886,13,900,109 gallons will. have to be withdrawn. .The total amount to be withdrawn in 1883 is less than 40 per cent, of the average amount with drawn and tax paid, exclusive of tho amount withdrawn t'rom export during the five years 18S0-4. So that with a restricted rbductlou for the next six months the djf the whisky men have been com plaining of for the last two yeats will be pretty well over. The Internal revenue bureau was favorable to the extension of relief to the distillers, but it isnow believed in the bureau that the special occasion for relief has passed. If the tax on whisky Is left undisturbed by the next congreus, the bonded period is likely to be made indefi nite. Tobacco does not have to pay tax till it goes on the market The same was true of all the other articles on which internal revenue taxes were levied. The theory of the internal revenue system Is to collect the tax whon the goods are sold, and to thl9 spirits have been the only exception. If spirits could be bonded Indefinitely, distil lers could take full advantage of low prices in grain. This is one of the first modifica tions of the Internal revenue system that Is wanted in the spirit-producing region. THE LABOR BUBKAU. The commission of John Fahrenbatch of Cincinnati as Commissioner of the new La­ qualify and enter upon his duties. There has been extraordinary delay In the ap pointment of .this Commissioner. The point which was raised, that Jarrett, hav ing been nominated and confirmed, but the commission not having been issued to him, the President could not make a uew ap pointment, has been overruled by the At torney-General. The friends of some of the othor candidates raised this question, hoping to defeat the appointment of any of their rivals uptil Congress should meet The President under no. circumstances would issue the commission to Jarrett lag iuld He regarded the speech of Jarrett attacklni hlni.personally as an offense which co not be overlooked. Mr. Fahrenbatch was supported for the position by Secretary Teller and Commissioner Butterworth. Mr. Frellnghuyseu had a candidate. for the place, and was veiy persistent in urging Iiim—so persistent in tact, that the Presi dent was obliged to inform the Secretary of State that he had adopted the policy of not nermttting one department to interfere in the'domestic affairs ot another, and'that he kne,w no reason why he should violate this rule .for the first time in the case of Mr. Teller. Mr. Fahrenbatch has been in the steamboat service for some time. He Is. practical machinist and .mechanical engi neer, and has for years been conspicuous in labor organizations. Tile bureau will be' at once organized, and it is possible that the labor troubles in the Hocking Valley will receive its early attention. Amongthedis appointed candidates are David Healy of the New York Burenu of Labor Statistics, Godwin Moody of Massachusetts, Thomas B. Connery, and Charles T. Hill, Statisti cian of the State Department Tgas

CONGRESSIONAL SENATE. DEC. 1.—When the senate was called to order, the secretary read the credentials of William P. Sheffield, appointed by the gov ernor of Rhode Island to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Henry B. Anthony. Mr. Cullom introduced two Dills in regard to retirements from the army, and one to llelit navigable rivers by means of electric ity. Mr. Ingalls offered bring about the constructed on iioar Introduced a bl fW *,**. a resolution to amoval of fences Illegally, the public domain. Mr. ft to give Dakota two After the read- new supreme court judges." ing of tne Presidents message the death of Mr. Anthony was announced and the sen ate adjourned. DEC. 3.—In the Senate* Mr. Test offered a resolution directing an investigation Into all leases of lands ip Indian Territory tor grazing or other purposes by Indian tribes the number of acres embraced in said leas es, their terms, and the persons or corpora tions becoming le-sees. Also, all circum stances under which the. leases were made, the means used in obtaining the leases, and whether they are authorized hy law.' 1 Mr. Vest said he, had information that these leases were obtained from Indians by corruption, fraud, and bribery, and that some ludian councils had been influenced by. the worst practices',of civilization. Mr. Vest criticised the course of the Interior Department in protecting such leases, they being, lie claimed, In direct contravention of the Revised Statutes. Mr. Dawes said these leases ot Indian lands, while wrong, were no more outrage ous than the authorized inclosure by wire ncesot' thousands of acres of publiclands. Of one tract of 1( 2,000 acres of Indian lands, 85,000 acres were in exclusive posses sion of outsiders, whose herds consumed ev erything that gr.-w on it, while the Indian Bureau liad been obllired to advertise for beef to support the Indians on whose res ervation these herds were feeding. Had the Indians used the reservation for them selves tliey would have supported them selves. In one instance the Indians had In one year sold 17,0u0 bushels of wheat from a reservation now occupied almost entirely by private Individuals, without any power on ihe part of the Government to dispos sess such individuals. The evils consequent on leasinsr Indian lands and fencing In pub lic lands, Mr. Dawes continued, Imposed a grave duty on Congress, li remedial ao tion wt're not taken in time the public do main would pass irrecoverably into the pos session of lurge land-owners, foreign and native. He hoped the matter would not be allowed to end in talk or be confined to In dlah lands alone. Congress' had the power to clothe the executive officers of the Gov ernment with ample authority in the pre mises, and shoula do so. DEC. 8.—There was a slim attendance in the Senate. Senator Vest's resolution di recting tho Committee on Indian Affairs to Investigate' all Illegal leases of grazing lauds In the1 Indian Territory was amended so as to include all reservations, and agreed tft. The select committees of the last ses sion were continued for the present session, and some chauge&agsead upon were made in the.-8tandlng committees. 1 DEC. 4.—In the senate, Mr. Mitchell in troduced a bill for a pension of $5,000 per annum to General Grant. Mr. Gibson pre sented a measure for a public building at New Orleans, to cost $1,000.000. A resolu tion was submitted by Mr. Cameron, of Pennsylvania, for an inquiry into the ex pediency of expending the surplus revenue in reviving the shipping and export trade by the use of American vessels. Frank Hatton was confirmed as postmaster general, and Schuyler Crosby as first assistant An ad journment to Monday was taken.

A bill 'making tem porary provision for the navy was reported by Mr. Hutchins. An adjournment follow ed the announcement of the deatu of Messrs. Duncan and Evans. DEC. 2.—The hou& adopted a resolution presented by Mr. Follett, of Ohio, for an In vestigation into the conduct of Lot Wright, marshal at Cincinnati, and his deputies at the October election. Mr. Reascan offered as a substitute for the bill reported by the Committee of Commerce last season, the bill generally known as the Reagan bill, and entered into an exhaustive comparison of the two measures. Under the committee bill, he said, the liability of a railroad corporation to any person suffer ing wrong by its action was actual dan sustained, while under the substitute It was liable for three times the amount of dam ages. The bill of the committee did not Krohlblt discrimination in freight charges ut the substitute prohibited companies from charging more lor a shorter than for a longer distance for the same quantity of freight The substitute gave complete legal and equitable remedies to a. cltizen forev erylHurv,.withoutdelay and through toe courts of the country.

Hun gary has already entered a remonstrance. liast Snake Story of the Year. A strange story comes to us from one of the counties, down below here, and if it were not for the fact that fact is more strange than fiction, we should feel a hesitancy about relating it. The story is this: A gentleman having befen at work in afield some distance from home had carried his diuner with him. When noon came he took his bosket and went in a piece of woods near by, and close to a creek, to eat his dinner. After finishing the meal he sat down on a log to rest awhile before resuming his work. While thus engaged, hap pening_ to glance at an ola decayed stump just before him, he saw a snake's head protruding from a hole. He im mediately seized a long pole and went up by the side of the stump waiting to see if the snake, which had gone back, would reappear. In a short time the snake, not seeing, him, crawled out, and as he did so the gentleman killed him with a well-directed blow, seeing then, to his horror, that it was that most dreaded reptile, the rattlesnake. To his astonishment another came out and was alpo slain, and another, and another, until 84 had been counted. While still watching the hole he ob served that the last suake had only been wounded and had crawled off, and was, apparently, writhing in the agonies of death some distance off on a sandbar caused by the overflow of the creek. He immediately left his post and advanced toward the hideouB reptile to dispatch him. When he reached the spot the snake was appar ently dead. Looking down on the smooth sand near by he saw, to his utter amazement, the words "no more" traced thereon in plain, distinct characters. He looked at the snake and he looked at the words. He saw tha't a capital N should have been used in' commencing a sentence, and he made the correction, then, seized with a sudden superstitious fear, he hasten ed home and told his strange story. We give it to the public for what it is worth. After all, the snake may have lied perhaps there was more.—Colum bus (Oa.) Times. Punch Bowls. A large punch-bowl is to be found in almost eveiy house in Washington, and S•ne unch-inaking has become a line art. of the most famous punch-makers was the late Charles Astor Bristed. His punches were. neither too strong nor too weak. In other words, one glass would not make you drunk, neith er were jou obliged to drink several gallons in order to reach a point of ex hilaration. This point of exhilaration is the place to stop drinking. Daniel Webster punch is a complicated drink that calls for whisky, rum, champagne, arrack, maraschiho, green tea, lemons, and a very little water. A party of distinguished Scotch gentlemen, who were in Uie city not long'ajjo. during their stay were invited to visit the pri vate residence of. a prominent gentle man. During the evening a light col lation was served in the dining-room, and a huge punch-bowl 'was set out. The head of the party, a Scotchman, who at home occupies the position of provost in his native town, stepped up and tasted the punch, and, turning to an acquaintance, said: "That seems very light I think it would take a man along time to get drunk on thai." This cool liquor glided very gently down the provost's throat, and a sec ond glass followed. Pausing before be ginnings third glass, he engaged in conversation for. a moment, then he shook his head and said: "I don't see what is4he matter with me." His eyes became half shut,, and as he stepped forward he. nearly lost his balance. Turning in the most surprised fashion, he looked at the punch-bowl, and said: "Do vou know, I think that dijnk is -very mseedious. What is it made of?" His friend replied: "Whisky, rum, Claret, champagne, sugar and lemon, and a little water." The Scotchman understood at once, what was the mat ter Washington Cor. Boston Budget. A man in.
