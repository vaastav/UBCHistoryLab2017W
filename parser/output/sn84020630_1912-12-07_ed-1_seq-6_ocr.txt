THE VALLEY RANCH, VALLEY RANCH, N M MORE DAYS TO SHOP PHONES: BUSINESS OFFICE 31 W EDITORIAL ROOMS 31 J MORE PROGRESSIVISM. Alar., land is in the throes (ii a badly mixed fight on tin- senatorial ques lion. Two setiatorships are to be handed out by the next legislature wliicli meeis in l!M I. Tb.e regular sucpession is the term of Senator Smith, and tlie other vacancy is caused by the deuth of Senator Rayner. This seat will lie held by Jackson, a republican appointed by the governor to serve until the I't'Siilar session of the legislature. The meat of tlie centesr is in the scrap between the old liners and ihe progressives in the democratic parly, and may result in the disruption of the old organization, and in a new alignment of politics and add to the sircuglh of the national progressives. .Should Smith, the present snialor. force his election, villi another organisation man. and Ihe progressive element be ignored, the new move ment would have very decided additional strength. That the progressives are growing cannot be denied, and the movement is no lunger regarded as merely a split in tlie republican party. It is a party in itself. It was brought into existence on account of con-, iLiious that were intolerable ami which could not be changed except by a, revolt in which a large percentage of the people became enlisted. , The situation in .Maryland is but typical of that in all parts of the countr. The old organization can no longer demand everything, and expect lo control, as in the past. The idta that progressivism was an evanescent thing, Ihe outgrowth of disappointment and shattered ambitions, has been demolished. The party is today the second party in tlie I'nited States and is not going to be swallowed tip or absorbed by either of the old organizations. It is to be reckoned witli in the future. AS THE

President Taft's "swan four" message sounds as if the swan had got hold of a lot of things tiiat were foreign to its usual menu, but which were highly relishable lo able bodies as well as moribund birds. According to t'ncle ltill about the biggest thing we possess is our foreign trade, notwithstanding that we don't produce enough to fatten ourselves, and the biggest tiling that has been done for us in four years is Bill's Her culean labor in converting the stale department from an "archaic and inade quate machine'' into a powerful and well greased engine for the promotion i)f American sales abroad at lower prices than the American can take ad vantage of. He calls particular attention to tlie fact that in Ihus cleaning tlie state department stables of sloth, inelliciency, impotent- and oilier augean filth, lie ha-.-- retained in office a big bunch of ministers, ambassadors, .consuls, smallei diplomats and other left overs from previous administrations. This note of the song is so full-voiced that one is justified in suspecting the mother swan is either trying to mollify the Bull Moose or to save some ot her own chick-ns from tlie hungry and prowling democracy. However, tlie message indicates that our foreign business is good and that I'ncle Sam is some diplomat all along the line from measly little l.ibeViu to the august court of St. .lames. It is not a state paper that will set Ihe archives afire, but it surely is lull of cheer to exporters. tft). firwmeii ennn bad the blaze un. ! 5?

TAXATION. , , t , itepresentative Cordell Mull, of Tennessee, who is regarded by Ins tel low democrats as an authority on income-tax legislation, takes a hopeful view of tlie effect of such a tax on the public, and insists that it "approaches tlie perfection of fiscal wisdom. " The Washington Post takes exception to the position of Congressman Hull, asserting that the door would only be opened to greater misrepresenta tion, and would only make us. more than ever, a nation of liars, as lawyers, doctors and those called upon lo state their incomes would be guilty of de ception if not actual lying. The Post also fears that bookkeeping will go into decadence and books will be doctored and all torts of evils will come from the attempt to raise greater revenue from a new source. It is diflicult to see why the same objection cannot be urged against form til taxation on anv property. Doubtless, untrue returns are maae tries a "boob." 1 have often wished that the fellow who finds fault with a newspaper could lake the editorial chair and try his hand at the game for a week. By that time he would have had the acid test. 1 1 r n v e passing in. f Did vou ever notice that the job actively Inter in this splendid movement is shown in this truly valuable report and it should have a circular beyond that which it can get under the pres ent circumstances.

J "This week's edition of the Eagle ( was printed Friday," said Mr. Loomis i today, "and no fire was made in the j press room since then. 1 cannot im agine what caused the bla:'.e which 1 1 taxation matters, but it is hardly sufficient cause any at the uresent time on for abolishing taxation. What is needed is just and equitable taxation in all departments and the collection of it. Taxation of one class of property should be as easy of coiieciion as that of any other. s j , rj OUR OWN LEADERS. The "get together" conference planned by the republican senators nnd, representatives at Washington, will excite a great deal of interest, of course, j but the people will not be satislied with a reorganization along old lines. The plan involving Ihe absorption of Ihe progressives will not do. The: part is loo large to be swallowed by the (smaller body. The selection of Senator Borah as leader would appeal lo many as he: is really a progressive, but lo hold the confidence of the party, he must; make no alliance will) the old guard. Senator Lal'ollelte would not be tolerated. He is too small of caliber,; too selfish, loo petty, lie has the confidence of no party any longer. The hope of ihe progressives is to keep their own organization, and to strengthen it in every state. . Let it he the absorber rather than the absorbee. The great, stalwart, growing young party must have leaders of its own faith, and not those picked from the dusty wreck of the old standpat orgaui-1 zation.
