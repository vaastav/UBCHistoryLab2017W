"Ai rcprcM-utativesof the people in t!: legislative hratich of the (tim-rn-mt.-ut. vou huve K.ssomllcl ot a time when (he strength ami excellence of our free institutions and the fitness of our citizens to enjoy popular rule have leeu aiaiu made nianifiU A xlitieal eon test invol vitifT momentous consequences fraught with feverish appreheusion, and creating ajrresivenes so intense as to approach hitterness and passion, has leeu wared thru,rhout our land, and di'tormined hy the decree of free and independent suilrae, without disturb anc? of our tranquility or the least fin of weakness in our National ntru-ture. ''When we consider these incidents and cointcmpiate the ik.-a.eeful obetii enee and manly suhtnissina which have succeeded a heatcvl ciajh of political opinions, we discover :i'.und tut evi-deni-eof a tlctcnuination on thepirt of our countrymen to ahide hy every verdict of the jtopular will, and to be tHtntrolk-d sit all times by au abiding faith in the agencies established for the direction of the a Hairs of the (Sjvern incnt. "Thus our people exhibit a patriotic ui.-jvir.it ion which et titles them to de mand of tho.e who uudcrtake to make and execute their laws, such, faithful and unseliinh service iu their behalf as can only lie prompted by a serious ap preciation of the trust and eonfideuce which the acceptance of public duty invites." The President then expres.s-s his re gret at the unimproved condition of allairs in Turkey. While he says no citizens of the I'nited States in Turkey have thus far been killed or wounded, their safety in future is by no means as sured. Kliorts have not U.'en spared, and will not be, by the (iovernmcnt or the United States Minister at Constan tinople to protect our misioii:tries iu Ottoman territory. "Hut," r:iys the President, "the detp feci i and sym pathy that has levn arou.il a-M :& our p.siple ought not to so far b.inil their reas-jfi and judmciit as to lead them to demand impossible things." An adequate force for protection, would he adds, lie resented by both Turkey and the Powers. Nothing vi I lie omit ted to tiring about the prompt settle ment of the claims for destruction of missionary projierty at Harriot and Masash. Hojie is expressed that no obstacle will in future be iuterjKwd to prevent the cMjie from Turkey of all those who seek lo avoid the perils which threaten them there, and that the present sombre prosjiect in Turkey will not long be erniitted to olfend the sight of Christendom. Considerable space is given to Cuba. The President finds it diilicuit to per ceive that any prigreas has thus far been made toward the pacification of the Inland, notwithstanding Spain's strengthened detcrminatlm to put down the insurrection. "There is much reason to be ieve that the Insurgents have gained iu point of numliers, char acter, and resources, and are none the less inflexible in their resolve not to succumb without practically securing the great objects for which they took up arms. If Spain has not yet re-established her authority, neither have the Insurgents yet made good their title to le regarded as an independent State." The only civil government maintained is that by Spain, more or less imperfectly, in the large towns ami their immediate suburbs. "It is rcKrted, indeed," the President pro ceeds, "on reliable authority, that, at the demand of the Commander-in-Chief of the Insurgent army, the putative Cuban government has now given up all attempt to exercise it.s functions, leaving that government confessedly (what there is the best reason for sup posing it always to have been in fact) a government merely on papi-r." Arguing from the inability of the Spanish troops to bring aliout a pitch e l battle, the President paints out that there is hardly a limit to the time hos tilities may be prolonged, and the Spanish authorities pceiu to have Im itated the Insurgents in a policy of "w!y!ti!? V1" 1 ion p5;;ErJv',f U; it may not b used by their opponents. At least from foit.OtfJ.t) to $"t),fK)0,Kr of American capital are invested in the Island, and there is an immense tra le between the United States and the Is land, liesidc, Cuban residents in this c untry, many of them uuturaliz 1, promote the Insurrection by means which the laws and the spirit of our institutions can not reach, ami Ameri can citizens express their oyuipathy in many substantial ways, thus necessi tating coustaut claims by this country for protection of its citizens and for damages now estimated at many mil lions. The demands made for the ac cording of belligerent rights tolhelu surgents, the recognition of their inde pendence; the purchase by the Unittd States of the Island, or the interven tion of the United States to end the strife, even at the cost of war with Sjiain, are all dismissed by the Presi dent Tl:c restraint and patient endurance of the United States of conditions in Cuia are pointed out, as well as the respect aud regard for Spain thus man ifested by the American jieople. Final ly the President suggests : "It would seen that if Spain should o.Ter to Cuba genuine autonomy a measure of home rule which, which, while preserving lh ivcnignty of Spain, wxuld satisfy a'l rational requirements of Iter Span ish subjects there should lie in just reason why the pacific.it ion of the Is land might not be elleetcd on that basis. Sjc'ii a result would appear to lie in the true interest of all concerned. It would at once stop the con diet which is now consuming the resources of the Island and making it worthies for whichever party may ultimately prevail. It would ke p intact the pos sessions of Spain w ithout touching her hunor, which will be vindicated rather than impugned by the adequate redress of admitted grievances. It would put the prosperity of the Island aud the fortune of its inhabitants within their own control without severing the nat ural and ancient tics which bind them to the mother country, ami would yet enable them to test their capacity for self-government under the most favor-, 0111 

SOMERSET, PA., able conditions. It has been objected on the one side that Spain should not promise autonomy until her Insurgent subjects lay down their arms; on the other side, that promised autonomy, however liberal, is insufficient, because without assurance of the promise b ing fulfilled. "Hut the reasonableness of a require ment by Kpain, of unconditional sur render on the part of the Insurgent Cubans before their autonomy is eou- oeded, is not altogether apparent It ig nores important features of the situa tion the stability two j-ears' duration litis given to the insurrection; the feas ibility of its indefinite prolongation, in the nature of thiDgs, aud as shown by past experience; the utter aud immi nent ruin of the Island, unless the. present strife is speedilj' composed; above all, the rank abuses which parties in Spain, all branches of her government, and all her leading public moil e.nteede to exist and profess a desire to remove. Facing such cir cumstances, to withold the proffer of needed reforms until the parties de manding them put themselves at mer cy by throwiug down their arms, ha the apca ranee of neglect! ng the gravesD of perils and inviting suspicion as t the sincerity of any professed willing ness to grant reforms. The objection on behalf of the Insurgents that prom ised reforms can not be relied upon must of course be considered, though we have no right to assume, and to reason for assuming, that anything Spain undertakes to do for the relief of Cuba will not be done according to both the spirit and the letter of the un dertaking." The 1 'resident deprecates an assump tion that Spain would evade any obli gation she undertook toward the In surgents, but realizing that suspicions and precautions on the part of the weaker party are natural, "it wsls iuti mated by this (iovcrnmeut to tlte Gov ernment of Spain some months bro that, if a satisfactory measure of honu rule were tendered the Cubau Insur g -nts, and would be accepted by them upon a guaranty of its execution, the United States would endeavor to fiud a way not objectionable to Spain of furnishing such guaranty. While no definite response to this intimation has yet been received from the Spanish Government, it is believed to be not altogether unwelcome, while, as al ready suggested, no reason is perceived w'ny it should not tie approved by the Insurgents." The friendly offices of the United States, he says, in this or any other way are at the disposal of either party, and we should object to the acquisition of the Island, or any interference with its control by any other nation. "It should be added that it ran not be rea sonably assumed that the hitherto ex pectant attitude of the United States will be indefinitely maintained. While we are anxious to ao-ord all due respect to the sovereignty of Spain, we can not view the pending eonllict iu all its features ami properly apprehend our in evitable close relations to it and its pos sible results without considering that by the eourse of events we may be drawn into such an unusual and un precedented condition as will fix a limit to our patient waiting for Spain to end the contest, either alone and in her own way, or w ith our friendly co-operation. "When the inability of Spain todeal successfully with the Insurgents has Income manifest, and it is demonstrat ed that her sovereignty is extinct iu Cuba for all purposes of its rightful ex istence, and when a hopeless struggle for its re-establishment has degenerat ed into a strife which means nothing nitre than the useless sacrifice of hu man life and tho utter destruction of t ue very subject matter of the conflict, a situation will be presented in which our obligations to the sovereignty of Spain will be superceded by higher ob ligations, which we can hardly hesitate to recognize aud discharge. Deferring theehoiceof ways and methods until the time for action arrives, we should make them depend up.ni the precise conditions then CTisf'nigj. and they should not ue ae&rniined upan with out giving careful imi to every OT. STion 'nvavini;ollr ij0lll)r auj in- tereot or the international duty we owe to Spain. Until we face the contin gencies suggested, or the situation is by other Incidents imperatively chang ed, we should cjntiuue in the line of conduct heretofore pursued, thus in all circunistan vs exhibitingour obedience to the requirements of public law aud our reg.wd for the dJty enjoined upon tu by the jiosition we occupy ill the family of nations." The closing of the Venezuelan ques tion aud the far advance with promise of an early siicjessful consummation of negotiations for a general arbitration treaty with Great Britain are briefly noted. Hope of co-operation with Great Itritaiu for the better preservation of seal life iu Behring Sea is expressed. The statistics from the Treasury De partment, including those of the reve nues, are submitted without comment or recommendation. The same is true of the statistics of immigration. The progress in coast defense is alluded to as the one form of military preparation essentially pacifie in its nature. Sum maries of the reports of the Attorney General and the Ptsttuaster-General are included. The postottlee deficit, due to "carrying at the nominal rate of one cent a pound the serial libraries, including trashy and even harmful literature, and other matter which, under the loose interpretation of a loose statute, has been gradually given -ec-ond-class rates," is poiuted out as an abuse that should be corrected. An adequate appropriation for the enter tainment of the International Postal Union Congress in Washington is rec ommended. On affairs of the Navy and Interior Departments there is noth ing in the message not contained in the reports of the Secretaries. Of the Pension Commissioner's report the President says: "In my opinion, based upon such statements as these and much other in formation and observation, the abuses which have been allowed to creep into our pension svsteni have done incalcu . . . . . ... lable harm iu ; demoralizing our pople o.i i.i,l. r-oioiti,- from! eitizonshin." The President urges the importance erset 

ESTABLISHED 1827. WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 1G. 181)0. of an adjustment of Pacific ltailroad obligations. Of the case of the Union Pacific, he points out that proceedings to forclose a first mortgage upon added parts of the main line to which the Government lien is subordinate and the default occurring on January 1, 1S'.7, must emphasize the mandate of the Act of 1SS7 to foreclose. "Therefore, unless Congress shall otherwise direct orshall have previously determined upon a dif ferent solution of the problem, there will hardly appear to exist any reason for delaying beyond the date of the de fault above mentioned such Executive action as wiii promise to suljserve the public iutcrests and save the Govern meiit from the loss threatened by furth er inaction." The work done by the Agricultural iH'partment is especially commended, but the discontinuai.ee of tbe gratuit ous distribution of seeds is urged. The progress of Civil Service Reform for the year is reviewed as a cause for the utmost congratulation. The amend ment of the 1 nter-State Commerce Act is recommended. Iiecurring again to the statistics of the Treasury Department, the President oilers some suggestions regarding the present Tariir law and its operation, lie says: "Whatever may be its short comings as a complete measure of Tar iir Iteform, it must be coiieieded that it lias otiened the way to a freer ami great er exchange of commodities between us and other countries, and thus furnish ed a wider market for our products and manufactures." Continuing, the President says: "I believe our present Tariir law, if allow ed a fair opirtuuity, will in the near future yield a revenue which, with reasonable economic expenditures, will overcome all deficiencies. In the mean time no deficit that has occurred or may occur need excite or disturb us. To meet any" such deficit we have in the Treasury, in addition to a goid re serve of one hundred millions, a sur plus of more than one hundred and twenty-eight millions of dollars, ap plicable to the payment of the expen ses of the Government, and which must unless expended for that purpose, re main a Us less hoard, or, if not ex travagantly waste!, must in any event be perverted from the purj.xise of its exaction from our people. The pay ment, therefore, of any deficiency iu the revenue from this fund is nothing more than its properand legitimate use. The Government thus applying a sur plus fortunately in its Treasury to the payment of cxjienses not met by its current revenues, is not at all to be likened to a man living Iieyond his in come ami thus incurring debt or en croaching on his principal." The President renews his former rec ommendation for tlu retirement of the greenbacks. "I am more convinced than ever that we can have no assured financial peace and safety until the Government currency obligations upon which gold may lie demanded from the Treasury are withdrawn from circula tion and cancelled. This might be done, as has licen hetetofore recom mended, by their exchange for long term bonds, bearing a low rate of in terest, or by their redemption with the prtweeds of such bonds. Kven if only the United States notes known as green backs were thus retired, it is probable that the Treasury notes issued in pay ment of silver piircha-es under the act of July 11, 1.;0, now paid iu gold when demanded, would not create much dis turbance, as they might, from lime to time, when received in the Treasury by redemption in gold or otherwise, hi gradually and prudently replaced by silver coin. "This plan of issuing Imnds for the purpose of redemption certainly ap pears to lie the most effective and di rect path to the needed reform. In de fault of Ibis, however, it would lie a step iu the right direction if currency obligations redeemable in gold, when ever so redeemed, should be cancelled instead of being reissued. This oper ation would be a slow remedy, but it would improve preseut conditions. .."National Hanks should redeem their issue circur.tf to the par value of bonds deposited as security for its re demption, ami the tax on their circula tion should be reduced to one-fourth of one per cent" The message concludes as follows: "Another topic iu which our jieople rightfully take a deep interest may be here briefly considered. I refer to the existence of trusts and other huge ag gregations of capital, the object of which is secure the monopoly of some particular branch of trade, industry, or commerce, and to stitl.i wholesome comjietitioii. When these are defend ed, it is usually on the ground that, though they increase profits they also reduce prices, and thus benefit the pub lic. It must be remembered, however, that a reduction of prices to the people is uot one of the real objects of these organizations', nor is their tendency j necessarily in that direction. If it oc curs in a particular case, it is only be cause it accords with the purposes or interests of those managing the scheme. "Such occasional results fall fur short of compensating the palpable evils charged to the account of trusts ami monopolies. Their tendency is to crush out individual independence and to hinder or prevent the free use of human faculties and the full devclepment of human character. Through them the farmer, the artisan, and the small trader is iu danger of dislodgenient from the proud position of being his own master, watchful of all that touch es his country's prosperity iu which he lias an individual lot aud interested in all that effects .he advantages of busi ness of which he Is a factor, to le rele gated to the level of a mere appurte nance to a great machine, with little free will, with no duty but that of pas sive obedience, aud with little hope or opportunity of rising in the scale of responsible and helpful citizenship. "To the instinctive belief that such ia the inevitable trend of trusts and mon opolies is due the widespread and deep seated popular aversion in which they are held aud the not unreasonable insis teuce that whatever may le their inci dental economical advantages their gen- eral eflect upon personal character, prospects, and usefulness cannot be otherwise than injurious. Though Congress has attempted to deal with this matter by legislation, the laws passed for that purpose thus far have proved ineffective, uot because of any lack of disposition or atU mpt lo en force them, but simply because the laws themselves, interpreted by tli courts, do not reach the difficulty. If the insufficiencies of existing laws can be remedied by further legislation it should be done. The fact must le recognized, however, that all Federal legislation on this subject may full short of its purjiose, liecause of inher ent obstacles, which, while making the Federal authority supreme within its sphere, has carefully limited that sphere by metes and bounds which cannot be transgressed. The decision of our highest court on this precise question renders it quite djubtful whether the evils of trusts ami monop olies can Inadequately treated through Federal action uulcss they seek direct ly and purposely to include in their ob jects trausiiortatiou or intercourse be tween States or between the United States and foreign countries. "It does not follow, however, that this is the limit of the remedy that may be applied. Kven though it may be found that Federal authority is not broad enough to fully reach the case, there can be no doubt of the xwtr of the several States to act effectually in Che premises, and there should be no reason to doubt their willingness to ju diciously exercise such power. "In concluding this communication its last words shall lie an appeal to the Congress for the most rigid economy in the expenditure of the motley it holds in trust for the people. The way to perplexing extravagant e is easy, but a return to frugality is diilicuit. When, however, it is considered that those who bear the burdens of taxation have no guaranty of honest care save in the fidelity of their public servants the du ty of all jxissible retrenchments is plainly manifest. "When our differences are forgotten and our contests of political opinion are no longer rememlcred, nothing in the retrospect of our public serxitsj will lie as fortunate am! omforting as the recollection of ofiicial duty well jier formed and the memory of a constant devotion to the interests of our confid ing fellow countrymen. G itov::i: Ci.kvki.an i. Thought the Kaiser Stupid. An amusing little story about the present emperor of Germany, Will iam 1 1, aud a Vienna coachman was narrated at a banquet lately given at Vienna by some diplomatists, the nar rator lieiug himself a well known anil prominent member of the corps di plomatic. In the year 1SS7 the present p.niper- or William 11. ol tiermany, men Prince William of Prussia, came to Vienna, visiting his particular friend ami chum, the late Crown Prince Iiu dolf of Austria. Joined by the Prince of Wales, who was at that time also a frequent visitor to the Vienna court, thctluee princes took a fancy to ming le with the commons of the Vienna population. Dressed in ordinary clothes they visited jilavs which are not in the least regarded as suitable for princely guests. One day they catered a hotel, but in stead of going into the dining mom thev walked into the "schweiiim"," a place which answers in some tb-gree to the bar room of an American hotel ; in this room coachmen and the servants of the hotel guests take their meals. The three princes took seats at an empty table, and listened, htgiiiy amused, to a fierce debate a'iut poli tics between several stout members of that class of fashionable Vienna coach men who are known all over Kurope as "fescue Wiener fiakcr." The dis tinction of those charioteers is a kind of gnod naiutvd -imldiicss and drcll familiarity toward their customers as well as to perfect strangers. After listening awhile Prince Will iam put in a word, and s.oti was drawn into the excited discussion. Suddenly a stout, red faced coach man 1 riv waih.eu up to me iao;o w oerj uie iii . princes were seated, an I, tapping. Prince illiain gently on the shoulder, said, "Now, if you s'io jld ever have anything to say hi politics, you wouldn't set a riv.-ron fire, I'm sure !" As every public coachman in Vienna wears a number, this coachman was upon a special request of Prince Will iam easily identified. The prince sent him a tantlsome scarfpin with his initials as thanks for the amuse ment he had famished, and thus the man learned in amazmi -nt w'.io; po litical abilities they were that he had so belittled. Vienna Letter in New York Press. Famous Farmer Boys. There are some jieople foolish enough to laugh at the homely virtues of a farm life. They are fortunately few, and they are fortunately growing few er. But it is well sometimes to look at the list of great men who came up from the farm not all of them, for that would fill a thousand volumes, but some of the most able ones that flash into mind in a moment Nearly three-fourths of the men who have lieeu chosen by the jx"ople for the great ollices of the nation are men who were early familiar with wooded bills and cultivated fields, says the Kansas City Times; for example, Lincoln, Grant, Garfield, Hamlin, Greeley, Tilden, liar rison, Hayes, Blaine, ami many others almost equally conspicuous iu current events or living memory. Among journalists, Henry Watterson spent his early life iu rural Kentucky, ami JIu rat Halstead was born and liven! on a farm in Ohio. W. H. Vanderbilt was born in a small New Jersey town, and early engaged in the business of ship chandlery, it issel $ wxi hon, ja a New York village. Jay Gould spent his early years on his father's farm in New York State.
