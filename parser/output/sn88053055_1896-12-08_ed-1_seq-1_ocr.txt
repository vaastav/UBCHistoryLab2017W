THE WILMINGTON DAILY REPUBLICAN 1 r=rr ONE CENT WILMINGTON, DELAWARE, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1896. ONE CENT. Senator Call Moves at Once for the Recognition of Cuba. A REPUBLICAN CAUCUS CALLED. The Silver Senators Who United the St. Louis Convention Served with Notices ol the Caucus—The President's Election Ex pressions Cause Amusement, Washington,D ee.. 8 — Tho United States •enate began the second session of the Fifty-fourth congress with crowded gal leries aud with that accompaniment of ac tivity aud of greeting that usually attend* the reassembling of congress. But the Upper branch of congress never puts aside itlng developed dramatic incidents. its dignity, and tho demonstrations The reading of tho president's message was the feature of tho proceedings, and beyond this no attempt was made to enter upon the business uf tho session. To many of tho foreign representatives occupying the diplomatic gallery tho message had ■pedal interest and significance, owing rc the part they hud taken in tho conspic uous foreign events to which tho president raferred. Sir Julian Pnuncofoto, tho British Turkish minister, bussudor, aud the Moustapha Boy, were present. i* Depuy de Lome, the Spanish minister, was not in attendance duriugtho day, but two •f the secretaries of the Spanish legation carefully noted tho references to the Cuban conflict. Minister Hatch of Hawaii, and Mr. Coopor, tho Hawaiian minister ol foreign affairs,were listeners, although the message contained no reference to the Hawaiian Islands. On tho floor of tho senate printed copies of the message wore distributed, and those gave the senators opportunity to read the salient features instead of listening to them. As u result there was scant at tendance after tho reading had proceeded beyond tho first half hour. The reading of tho message covered an hour aud filly minutes, nml at its conclusion tho senate adjourned. Just as tho senate was about to adjourn Senator Call, of Florida, roso to offer a resolution, but which he withdrew until today. It Is a joint resolution, as follows: ''Resolved, That tho United .Slates ol America reoogulzo tho republic of Cuba os a free and independent government, and accord to that people all tho rights of o sovereign and independent government In tho ports and within the jurisdiction of the United States." When the determination was reached to call a Republican caucus today •sting situation at once presented Itself. Tho silver Republican senators who bolted the St. Louis platform and ticket wore an unknown quantity in their political uifil* lotions, and whether or not to invite them to attend t he Republican cauc undecided matter. There were many ferencos, and it was finally concluded that notices should be sent them as before. This result placed the burden of acti the silver Republicans, thateithor Senators Pettigrew, Mantle or Cannon will attend tho caucus, although they would not be required to indicate their views. Tho purpose of the caucus is to outline a program for the session. While tho scenes attending the opening uf the house worn both brilliant and In teresting In the crowds that throngod tho galleries and tho conspicuous personages present, the proceedings themselves were dull and spiritless, being distinctively routine. The house met, the chaplain In voked tho divine blessing on the work of the session, the roll was called, a commit tee consisting of Mr. Cannon of Illinois, of New Hampshire and Mr. Turner of Georgia was appointed to wail the president, and the latter's annual communication was read. The opening words of the message, graduating the country on the result of tho election, created a broad smile, the Doinocrata as well as the Republicans seemingly enjoying the anomalous politi cal condition which allowed a Democratic president to felicitate himself upon a vic tory gained under tho banner of tho Re publican party. Tho president's expres sions on Cuba and Venezuela were listened it believed It is Mr. Hav ta attentively, but there stratlons, either when ho announced that the administration somo months ago had ■uggented home rule for Cuba to Sp when ho announced tho termination of tho controversy between Great Britain and tho United States boundary line. Mr. Grow, of Pennsylvania, showed a disposition to debate tlio mossage, but yielded until a later time. Mr. Turner, of Georgia, informally an- nounced the <leath of his late colleague, -Speaker Crisp, and willed by him reciting that tho house hurt heard with profound regret tho announce- ment of Mr. Crisp's death was adopted, after which, as a further mark of respect, the liouso immediately adjourned. demon- tho Venezuelan resolu11 Millionaire's Will.
