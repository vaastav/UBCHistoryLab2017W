NKW YORK, Dec. s.—Frank Waller, j t: Uuston, has broken the only record j up to the present time in the six days' j bike race at Madison square garden. \ He now holds the world's record for | continuous riding. He left his wheel j ut 4:10 o'clock this afternoon, having j ridden miles and eight laps in six- j teen hours and ten minutes, without anting, beating iast year's record i of 272 miles, made by Stepnane. \\ aller took a short rest, losing two j places in the contest, Pierce, followed i by Miller, passing him. At the end j of the seventeenth hour Pierce was ; about live miles behind Waller's record | of last year. The record made by | hours t. day fell short of three or four i miles of those made last year. Falls I ire frequent this year than last, j spills occurred today, but none ; is were seriously hurt. j The garden was Oiled with spectators I ys and until a late hour tonight. of the early surprises and a disappointment to his admirers j the retirement of Joe Rice, of | Wilkesbarre, Pa., who quit work this having found himself in no state to continue the race. Miller aroused the greatest enthu siasm this afternoon by setting a won derful pace for many laps. Fredericks, Nawn and Pierce were entirely out class, d for awhile, and only the vet eran Waller was able to stick to the champion and maintain his relative position. In and again amidst wild cries light from thousands of throats Miller spurted and tried to shake off the tenacious Waller, but the bigger man knew full well that with two miles to the good to keep up with Miller was his end of the game, and he held his own. .Many cheers greeted the reappear ance of the French champion this af ternoon. He had been off the track about four hours, and it was generally ■ 1 that he had quit for good. On his return, however, he publicly an nounced that he would not leave the track again for forty-eight hours, and immediately began to make the hottest pace of the day. -Miller, Waller, Pierce and Nawn, however, refused t<> be Bhaken off, and stuck close to his heels. A.bout the same time Lawson, the Swede from Minneapolis, took a short and afterward appeared with n Btomach rest, the first that has been us d in the present race. Hall pays little or no attention to pacemakers, preferring to go his own gait, which appears to suit the require- j ments of Menachon, as the stolid | Frenchman keeps in the wake of Hale. "'or hours this pair pursue the even tenor of their way. Harry Bikes, the world's one houi champion, with a record lirty-four miles 1,220 yards, spin a little after 4 o'clock this afternoon, and put life into the pack of racers. They tried to keep up with him. but could not do so. Their speed was considerably increased for half a dozen laps, however. "Eddie" McDuffie, of Boston, came out on the track and made a dozen laps at a sprint. Miller and Waller tried to keep up with him. and there was an exciting spurt for a few minutes. They gave it u,p, however, and Me.Duffle left the track after warming up a bit. 

M'DUPFIE INJURED. A feature of the evening was to have been a five-mile exhibition by Eddie McDuffie, of Boston. An unfortunate accident, however, cut the exhibition short. When McDuffie started to fol low his pacemakers, the regular six day riders kept to the inside of the track. After McDuflle had gone about a mile a tandem, which was to have pick< .1 him up, Bllpped down the mi ck, and the riders were ii in a heap. One of the pact- ■■ s, W. M. Hicks, fell against v.

Bob Fitzsimuions, present champion of the world, was oue of the first to make the state ment that the battle between Corbett and Sharkey would be a fake, and for that reason was unmercifully scored by critics all over the country. The claim was made at the time that Fitztimmons had no right to make such Statements when, according to his own ac knowledgment, he laid down to Jim* Hall in Australia in a fight for the championship. So much has been said of this that Khz thinks it no more than right that he be heard in his own defense. This is the state ment he makes to a New York 6a»Hr: Some people say that I have no right to express my opinion of the battle b&tweon Corbett and Sharkey; that I ought not "to j throw stones at glass houses because of the ] faec that I admitted I laid down to Jim Ha.i in Australia for a paltry sum. Well and K<.od. j 1 don't deny it. It is a fact. At that time I ! was an ignorant, green blacksmith, making barely a living. I wanted to forge my way j forward in the boxing line. A chap came to I me one day and said: '•Bob, do you want to make some money?" 1 said: "Of cou.se • I da." "Weil," he replied, "ycu can make some by traveling around Australia with Jim j Hail." Hall was a coming middleweight at that time, and I quickly grasped the o.*por- , tunity. There was many times a void in my stomach, and the chance of getting three square meals every day, with a soit, downy j bed to rest my head, made my eyes beam : and niy lieart jump with joy. I was requested ! to drop one night before Hall, and on the ' following night I was to beat him. Thus we t went, on from town to town. 1 was simply ; pmplojed, and, like a dutiful hireling to j his master, I obeyed orders. That is all there ; is to It, and no one will say, who is not j prejudiced, that I did wrong. My reputation I in America is beyond reproach, for I have ' always fought to win. As to my future plans, I want it under stood that I am still In the game and ready ; to box any heavyweight in the world. The j fact Uiat McCoy won't meet me leaves quite j a gap in the; ranks. I am preparing a state- i ment, in which I will tell just whom au4 when I will flght.

PAUL GLOBS TUESDAY- HEWS OF RAILROADS BOYCOTT OF THE GREAT WEST. KHN CAUSES SOMETHING OF A SENSATION PRESIDENT STICKNEY TALKS Says the Action of the Santa Fe Came an a Surprise He Does Not Know Wlmt Prompted It, Nor Docs He Care Conjecture otf Other Roads as to What It All Means. The current sensation in railway cir cles Is the boycott aguinst the Chicago Great Western, which has been declar ed by the Santa Fe and the threatened boycott by the Rock Island. The lat ter is as yet newspaper rumor, but it is reported from Cbksago that the Rock Island will sever relations with the Chicago Great Western Dec. 20. Weth er other lines will jom the movement is uncertain, but there is an impression abroad that the troubles of the Chi cago Great Western have only begun. The Santa Fe has foldcnved its declara tion as to passenger business with an other cancelling ail freight agreements wi'ih the Chicago Great Western, so that after Deo. 15 the two systems will have no traffic relations Whatever. The Chicago Great Western officials all ex press surprise and contempt at the ac tion of the Santa Fe. "It does not trouble us at all," said President A. B. Stiokney yesterday to a reporter for The Globe. "All we got last year from passenger business with the Santa Fe was $5,000, while the San ta Fe was benefited by its connection with the Chicago Great Western to the amount of $19,000. If the Santa Fe wants to cut nearly $20,000 from its revenues to deprive us t>f $5,000, it may do so, and nobody will care particu'ar ly. I do not know what amount of freight business was interchanged last year. WAS A 

SURPRISE. "This action of the Santa Fe came as a complete surprise. I do not know what prompted it and do not care. Our trouble has been to find enough busi ness for our various California con nections, so we shall not miss one. I have no information of the proposed action of the Rock Island except such as 1 have read in the papers. I know of no reason winy the Rock Island or any other line should antagonize the Chicago Great Western. I am not wor rying about the matter anyway." An official notification of tlhe Santa Fe's intention to out loose from the Chicago Great Western was received by the freight officials yesterday morn ing. General Freight Agent P. C. Stohr said he had been in correspon dence with the traffic officials of the Santa Fe and did not know but that the latter road might rescind its ac tion. He said he was still in the d?rk as to the motives of the Santa P'e. Another official of the Chicago Great V estera said tc the reporter that the Chicago Great Western would try to worry along without the assistance of the Santa Fe. The Union Pacific, alone, could handle all the company's freight ■ .tiifomia. Besides that road tho Chicago Great Western has the Mis souri, Kansas & Texas, the Pittsburgh & Gulf, the Soo, the Northern Pacific and the Great Northern. City Ticket Agent Elmer went to Chicago yesterday to consult with offi cials about the boycott. OFFICIALS INTERESTED. Local'railway officials are interested to know whether a concerted boycott against the Chicago Great Western has been inaugurated. It is recalled that a few weeks ago threats were m&de to boycott the road because of its withdrawal from the Western Weighing association. The Chicago Great Western claimed that the asso ciation was an expensive farce and that its work could be done more cheaply by the roads acting individ ually. The road placed its own inspec tors along its line, but this was not satisfactory to the other roads which claimed that the Chicago Great West ern was hoodwinking its competitors by passing freight wrongly classified which enabled it to cut standard rates! The threatened boycott did not ma terialize, and it was thought it had bepp. abandoned. •Xext was heard complaints against the Chicago Great Western tariff books which were alleged to be so compiled and arranged that it was impossible to learn what its rates were. Certain commodities were found to be wrong ly classified, and it was recently neces sary for the company to recal a tariff book in order to correct its typograph ical errors. All this while there were mutterings of discontent among the other roads, ana finally the Chicago Great Western issued its December tar iff book, which it claims to be the only legal and honest tariff book published by any road in the country, though it violates the interstate commerce law in its style of type. This tariff book, it is alleged by the road's competitors, shows that the Chi cago Great Western does not regard the standard rates, but cuts them The Chicago Great Western officials reply that the rates as published are the rates charged to shippers and which are made secretly by those roads that complain against it. They say they have simply published openly the rates vshich other roads make privately to shippers, and that in so doing they have compelled them to show their hands. Just what force there is to this argument only shippers can tell. BLAME THE TARIFF BOOK. It is thought in some quarters that the new tariff book of the Chicago Great Western may be the cause of the present disturbance. Others think it is a pretext for the Santa Fe, and possibly the Rock Island, to square accounts with the Chicago Great West ern for the long standing grievance they have had against it on account of the Missouri grain rate case. Two years ago the Santa Fe and the Rock It-land proceeded against the Chicago Great Western for failing to maintain grain rates in Missouri. It was claim- ! c-d that, while other roads were keep- j ing up rates according to the rule of the interstate commerce commission, the Chicago Great Western was cut ting them. The matter was taken to court, and the Chicago Great Western won the case, and it is said that the complainant roads have ever since been waiting for an opportunity to re taliate upon the Chicago Great West ern. A statement was made yesterday by a transcontinental railway official that the Northern Pacific would not enter ' any combination agair#. the Chicago; Great Western, nor was it likely that the Great Northern would join hands ' in an effort to down that road. "If the book tariff is the cause of I the present disturbance," said he, "the I transcontinental roads in this section ! will syrrpathize with the Chicago Great Western, for it is an open tariff I and publishes rates that other roads make while pretending to maintain tariffs." The Chicago Great Western, it is un derstood, will not take any retaliatory action against the Santa Fe, as The notice issued by the latter road re quires none. The progress of the fight will be watched with interest all over tho country. 

TRUNK Linn COSfMiTTBB. Will Meet In. St. I.oni* Next Week ami Consider Itx Btetva. The Western trunk '.hie commlttei? will nii>?t in St. Louis Dec. 15, and th»re is much curiosity to know whether it will prove t« be the last meeting of that commute*. Tv« contracts cf the present commissioners will expire Dec. 31. and it is not known whether they will be renewed or whether-the commit tee will be dissolved. Since the decision of th supreme court against the Joint Traffic association there has been much uncertainty aa to the future of the Western trunk line committee. It has been said that the com mittee never had been able to maintain a rata on any commodity and that it was simply an expensive appendage to the railroad busi ness. It will not create surprise if It Is dis continued. It is also possible that the committee may be changed inco a bureati of information and that the reads will adopt the plan of the other roads to make gentlemen's agree ments. If this is done there may be & reduc tion of salaries. 

LAND GRANT CASE. En&ineer Langr $ayn the Route Sag grested by State Is Impracticable. The case of the state against the Dulutb. & Iron Ranee for revocation of the latter's land grant was resumed before Special Com missioner Farrington in the Merchants' Bank building yesterday morning, and continued all day. Engineer Lang, who was on the stand when the case was adjourned some time ago, was again under examination. His testimony, which was for the railway company, went to show that the land route, which the state wanted the road to take, was impracticable because of the insecure character of the land mtst of which was swamp. He gave testi mony yesterday as to soundings which he had made while following up the party of state snrveyc-rs and he declared it was not fit lor railroad construction. When his direct examination was concluded Attorney General Childs took him in hand and questioned him closely without shaaking his expressed conviction that the quality of the land which the state wanted the road to take for its route was wholly unfitted for such a purpose. He declared it was worth less. He was asked whether it was not pos sible to build such a road with corduroy, and he said he did not believe in corduroy work for railroads. The ease will be continued today. Boston's New Station. BOSTON, Dec. s.—At the rate the work on the Southern station is progressing it is ex pected that trains will be running into it by Jan. 1, 1899. For a long time the building has been outwardly in an almost completed condition, but an immense number of details inside arc ypt to be finished. There are nine platforms which are to be used exclusively for baggage. There is an ice plant with a capacity for 20 tons a day, to be used in icing the cars. Every window in the train shed is set on edge, and it 13 possible to get at every one and wash it by hand, something true of no other station. The total area of the plan is thirty-five acres, and the buildings cover thirteen acres. It is 135 feet from the sidewalk to the eagle on top of the building, and a flags aff is to be set so that Old Glory will wave 200 feet above the street. The total length of the track in the station when all laid will be fifteen miles. There are 2C2 .switches in the yard. It will be possible to run 2,000 trains a day into the station. There are 2f>s arc lights lv the station and 6,000 incandescent lights. The whole structure, when complete, will cost $14,000,000. Doing; a Land Office Bnalneas. HELENA, Mont., Dec. 5. — The Northern Pacific Railway company Is, in flact, doing a land-office business in Montana. Accord- Ing to Karl Simmon, local sales agent for Montana, with headquarters in this city, the company will sell almost double the amount of laud in Montana this year that it did last, when it disposed of between 750,000 and 1.00 D ,-000 acres. There has beon a grand rush for both government, state and railroad land in Montana during the last six months, and it is hard to say whether the government and state land offices or the railroad com pany has done the larger business in that pericd. Most of the lauds sold by the rail road company are grazing lands located In Custer, Yellowstone and Sweet Grass coun ties, where most of the large cattle outfTs of Eastern Montana are located.

OF VITAL INTEREST THE SEI/fcCTION OP PERRY BEL MONT AS PRESIDENT OF NEW YORK DEMOCRATIC CLUB ITS SCOPE TO BE ENLARGED Leader* of All Democrats From Maine to California to Be Made Welcome Some of the Non-Res ident Democrat* Who Already Belong to It Interetited in Na tional Affairs as Early as IS7O. NEW 

YORK, Dec. 5.-(Special.)—The election of Hon. Perry Belmont to the presidency of th-e Democratic club means more than the choice of a non- Tammany man to preside over an or ganization to which Tammany hall has recently given renewed national prom inence. Mr. Belmont resigned from the Democratic state committee on which he represented Richmond and Suffolk counties, as soon as the New York del egation returned from the Chicago con vention. He did not vote for W. J. Bryan for pre^dent, but helped at Indianapolis to n««*ninate Palmer and Buckner, and supported them on the stump in New York and AYest Virginia, as well as at the ballot box. He is a pronounced ad vocate of the gold standard, yet he goes to the head of what has been call- I ed "Croker's club," with the hearty i support of Mr. Croker and the hun- i dreds of Tammany men who have join ed the Democratic club since the leader of the New York Democracy made it his political headquarters. "This," said an ex-governor of the club, "is one of the series of events likely to have vital interest for the Democratic party throughout the Unit ed States. The Democratic club is to be made not only the political head quarters for the leaders of the party in the city of New York, but its scope is to be so enlarged that it may be the home and council chamber of rep- ! resentative Democrats In the Empire state and throughout the Union. The Democratic club has become the only distinctively political club of its party in the metropolis. It is now recognized as such, not only by those Democrats who 'belong to the Tammany organiza tion, but by others as well. In fact, the history of the club shows that, un til of late, Tammany hall men have not preponderated in its membership. In its rooms in Twenty-fourth street the leaders of the county Democracy were in the habit of meeting. Tihe leaders of all the Democracies, from California to Maine, are henceforward to be made welcome. "While his father, the late August Belinont, was a "sachem of Tammany hall all the time he served as chair man of the Democratic national com mittee, Perry Belmont, who has four times represented fais district in con gress, has been active as a tariff re former, and has represented his coun try at the court of Madrid, has never been enrolled in the Tammany organ ization. That organization is now giv ing to him a cordial support, which is interesting in view of his peculiar in dependence of those associations which • are apt to control business and profes sional men in politics—for he is not even indirectly in' any business. "The Democratic club, with a mem bership of more than 1,900, is already one of the largest clubs in the United States. Among its non-resident mem bers are such representative Demo crats as Senator Faulkner, of West Virginia; Senator James Smith, of New Jersey; Hon. Marcus Daly, of Monta na; Hon.
