The t popular colors) or INTERWOVEN PRESIDENT TAfTS MESSAGE TO CONGRESS Washington. Dec. 7. The first an nual message of President Taft was read before both houses of Congress today. The reading was followed with great interest by both the Republi cans and Democrats. The message was generally favora bly commented upon. The phrase which attracted most attention was ti.at referring to the Zelaya Incident of which he spoke "as it had tales of unspeakable barbarities." When the reading was concluded the house adjourned until Friday. The President's Message. The successful party in the last election in its national platform de clared in favor of the admission as separate States of New Mexico and Arizona, and I recommend that leg islation appropriate to this end be adopted. .1 urge, however, that care be exercised in the preparation of the legislation affecting each Territory to secure deliberation in the selec tion of persons as members of the convention to draft a constitution for the incoming State, and I earnestly advise that such constitution after adoption by the convention shall be submitted to the people of the Terri tory for their approval at an elec tion in which the sole issue shall be the merits of the proposed constitu tion, rnd if the constitution is defeat ed by popular vote means shall be provided in the enabling act for a new convention and the drafting of a new constitution. .1 think it vital that the Issue as to the merits of the constitution should not be mixed up with the selection of State offi cers and that no election of State of ficers should be had until after the constitution has been fully approved and fnally settled upon.

The tariff, the Nicara-Biian- question. sugar frauds and "whit's slavery" are among the ques tions discussed. Perhaps the most Important ques tion presented to this administration is that of economy in expenditure and sufficiency of revenue." says the pres ident, who discusses the methods tak en 10 meet the deficit. The president declares it unwise to attempt further revision of the tariff until the facts are at hand upon which such revision can pioperly be undertaken. Speaking generally, he says the country is in a high state of prosper ity. He notes the increase tn tae cost of living but says the tariff is not the cause. In those products of the factory and farm there has been no increase in the tariff and in msny instances a very considerable reduc tion, the president declares. In beginning the president says: "The relations of the United States with all foreign governments contin ued the normal basis of amity and good understanding and are very gen eral! tatisfactory." President Taft says the Zelayan gov ernment of Nicaragua h kept Cen tral America in constant turmoil. It is unnecessary be says, "to rehearse here the sad tale of unspeakable bar barity and oppression alleged to have been committed by tne Zelayan gov ernment. Recently two Americans were put to death by order of Presi dent Zelaya himself. They were re ported to have been regularly com missioned officers in the organized forces of a revolution, and as such, according to the modern enlightened practice of civilized nations, they would be entitled to be dealt with as prisoners of war. He continues: "This government proceeded with deliberate circumspection, to deter mine the exact troth in relation to these reports and upon the coarse In the premises most consistent with its dignity, its daty to American Inter prise and its' moral obligation o Central America and to civiMration." Concerning the Far East, fie presi dent says this government preserves unchanged its policy of supporting the "open door" and adds;. "Oar traditional relations with the Japanese empire continue' cordial as usual. Tim arrangement of 1908 for a co-ope rati va control of the coming -of laborers to the United States has i nrnvfl to work eaflRfiiptnrtIv " Reorganization of the department of state upon modern times in fur therance of our foreign trade and of American interests abroad is recom mended. "Perhaps," continues the message, "the most important question present ed to this administration is that of economy in expenditures and suffic iency of revenue. "The report of the secretary shows that the ordinary expenditures for the current fiscal year ending June 30, 1910. will exceed the receipts by $34, 070.620 :i to this deficit is added the sum to be disbursed for the Pana ma Canal amounting to $38,000,000 and S1.000.00u to be paid on the pub lic dbt, the deficit of ordinary re ceipts and expenditures will be In crease! to a total deficit of $73,075, C20. This deficit the secretary pro poses to meet by the proceeds of ttonds issued to pay the cost of con structing the Panama Canal. I ap prove this proposal." The president says the cost of en gineering and cons uct ion of the ca nal which will be completed January 1. 1915. will be $297,66fi.00O instead of $139,705,200 as originally estimated. Other expenses increase the cost by $7o.i:?3,000, to a total of $375,201,000. The president Is advised by the sec retary of the treasury that the esti mates of the expenses of the govern ment for the fiscal year ending June, 30, 1011 that is, for the next fiscal year are less by $55,863,000 than the total of appropriations for the current fiscal year and adds: "So far as Jhe secretary of the trea sury is able to form a judgement as to the future income and compare it with the expenditures for the next fis cal year ending June 30, 1911, IncluJ-. ing the payments on account of the 1'aniTiia Caaal and the public debt. there will be no deficit in the year end ing June 30, 1911, but a small surplas of $718,000. "In t.ie present estimates the needs of the departments and of the govern ment have been cut to the quick so to speak and my assumption by con gress, so often made in times past that estimates have been prepared with the expectation that, they may be redr.ced. will result fn seriously hampering proper administration." Mr. Taft refers with regret to the sugar frauds recently. iliuuJfFl Rfc say ing that the settlement niaJr wStifihe so called Trust will not interfere with or prevent, the criminal prosecu tion of every one who was found to be subject to the same. He believes that an investigation of the frauds by congress at present would be inad visable .saying it might give immuni ty and otherwise prove an embar rassment In securing conviction of the guilty parties. President Taft then discusses the tariff and the operation of the maxi mum and minimum clause in the act. He says that in the working of this, fear ha been expressed that be pow er conferred and duty imposed on tne executive is likely to lead to a tariff war. "I beg to express the hope and belief that no such result need be an ticipated." Mr. Taft says. "No one is seeking a tariff war or a condition in whK-h die spirit of retaliation shall be aroused. The new tariff board Is discussed the president saying that their work will perhaps take two or three years A continuing annual appropriation is asked.

RATE ON INSURANCE Roawell Is to have a new rating for Insurance purposes at the hands of the Rocky Mountain Fire Luaerwm- cr-i" Association, L. P. Terhune. in spector for that organization, having arrived -last night for the purpose of giving Roswell a thorough inspection nd making report on the conditions c-f th-? city as regards the risk the companies must take in issuing the people of Roswell Are insurance. Mr. Terhune's headquarters are now at Denver, the home of the Rocky Mountain Vnder writers, nut lie ar rived last night from - Albuquerque, where he has lately opened up a New Mexico office. He will spend about ten days in Inspecting Roswell and making up his reports. When seen by a Record reporter tuls afternoon, he said: "Of course I can say nothing yet as to what kind of a new rate Ros well will get. The town has not had a rating in three or four years. We give a town a new rating at intervals of several years, and oftener in cases where big improvements are put in that cut down the risk of damage by fire. In Roswell's case, I understand a big Improvement has been made in he shape of a new water-works sys tem and increase in the efficiency of the fire department. But these things are no alone what are considered in giving a town a rating. Every build ing must be inspected and reported on. Everything adds or detracts. I ex pect there will be fifteen hundred re ports on the town of Roswell, alone. "You people meaning the Record should encourage the people to do those things that will help In cutting down the rate. By abolishing tVasn heap3 at the rear of buildings,! re movinz fim trans, little oiit-builtltnes and such the rate will be greatly ben efitted."
