Asserting that the Monroe doctrine, which President Wilson reasserts is the most probable cause of the next war, the Westmins ter Gazette says of the president's message to Congress: "We hope from President Wilson's message that the American people are beginning to understand that this is not merely a war between Great Brit ain and Germany or France and Ger many, but a conflict between two kinds of civilization. If this war end ed in the triumph of Germany or the downfall of British sea power, the American people would discover at once that what President Wilson" now describes as the aberration of a small minority had become a dangerous can cer in the heart of their state and would find also that the Monroe doc trine which the president reasserts with such vigor, has become the big storm center of world politics and the most probable cause of the next war." The Westminster Gazette appeals to the American people to realize from their own experience what is going on in Europe, and, "if unable to help us by positive asistance, not to hin der us by asserting the neutral rights of commercial interests to the proju dice of our naval power." The Pall Mall Gazette, expresses the view that President Wilson's denun ciation in his message of the activi ties of war plotters was too mild in general and not sufficiently discrimi natory between unneutral conduct and criminal conduct. It adds: "He even goes so far as to suggest that the acts of an assassin or a dynamiter are chiefly heinous as ex hibitions of unneutral conduct and that equal censure must fall upon every American who fails to 'keep the scales of judgment even and prove himself a partisan of no nation but his own.' "We can not say that this theory of morals, whatever its convenience, ma be in domestic politics, will .increase the respect of the outside world for the official attitude of the White House. Literal reading- of Dr. Wil son's message would almost suggest that he regards ex-President Roose velt's denunciation of Miss Cavell's execution as equally heinous with the crime of last week which blew some twenty munition workers into frag ments." The newspaper adds that the. presi dent's theory of the duty of the Ameri can nation does not "become clearer when we compare his boast of mak ing 'common cause with all partisans of liberty on this side of the sea' with his resolute indifference to the fight between liberty and.tryanny upon the older continent."
