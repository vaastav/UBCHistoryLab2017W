MONDAY. DECEMBER 11, 1922. The Recent Railroad Record. The Interstate Commerce Commission's report shows more than the inadequate earnings of the railroads not only from the point of view of making a reasonable return 011 investment but from the prAnt of view of commanding the means to maintain the properties. It shows as well that in spite of low earnings private management is more careful than Government operation about keeping up essential equipment. All this has a direct and important bearing upon the railroad recommendations in President Harding's strong message. The carriers' earnings are and. \ since the present railroad act went into operation, have been "clearly an inadequate income." Nevertheless there have been downward rate adjustments with the purp?se of >emoving rate interference with the free flow of commerce. AVhether for this reason or for other reasons the 1922 tonnage movement of the roads up to now lias steadily increased. Nothing has yet developed, however, to put the roads as a whole on anything like the earning basis contemplated by the law under which the commission functions. Nevertheless some of the greatest of the transportation systems, like the Pennsylvania in the Kast and the In ion Pacific in the West, are making voluntary wage increases. With r shortage of day labor owing to the suicidal restrictions of the immigration act such roads must go into the labor market under the law of supply and demand and bid for wa?e earners to keep their roadbeds in condition and do the other maintenance work upon which depend the rery foundations of the carriers. Their labor costs will be going up. therefore, while their traffic receipts fall off with the seasonal decline now due in freight movements. On the other hand, the roads, crippled though they were by their financial condition, have shown their ability to handle a rising volume of traffic. The car loadings, which in January of this year were 3,060,167 and in May 3,446,946. were up to 3,765,764 in June and 3,930.161 in August, notwithstanding coal strikes and shopmen's strikes. In October they were 4,301.487. At the same time the locomotive inspections by the commission for the fiscal year ended June 30 last revealed better conditions under irlvate management, handicapped though it was by low earnings and other circumstances, than when the roads were under Government control or Just emerging from the effects of Government control. The locomotive defects found by the inspectors, for example, were *135.300 in 1919 (fiscal year), while in 1921 they were 104.848. In 1922 they were 101,734. The percentage of locomotives found defective in 1918 (fiscal year) was 53. It was 58 in 1919; 52 in 1920: 50 in 1921, while in 1922 it was 48. Everything about the railroad sec rd, in fact, goes to prove that the American iransporumon system a'irs not thrive under Government operation. The West Side Subway. The figures gathered by the Tran?lt Commission relative to ticket aalea on the subways in the year that nded .Tune 30 tell a story of greater congestion. It Is only necessary to take the Increases on one line, the West Side Intarborougb, to see what has been happening. The sales at Fourteenth street increased 2,400 a day; at Pennsylvania ' station. 3.600 a day: nt Times Square. g,500 a day. All this pressure was added to a line already so choked with traffli' that it could bear no wore trains. The Increases mean fltat three stations, whose total traffic bad been 172.000 passengers a day. had to taka on nearly 15,000 more paaaangers daily. It was avident years ago that the l?'eat Side subway had reached its ^ilt; that a great new trunk line ?lt be built. But to-day. at least Vytara after the new line should k ! have been started, nothing has been ' done. The Transit Commission's great plan for a doable deck, eight ; track trunk line In Eighth avenue ; was held up in City Hall. Truly the new administration at Albany will have a grave problem to face; particularly grave from a political standpoint because a disappointed public is losing patience. Wheat for the .World. The I'nited States to-day is the ; incomparable wheat growing country of the world. Its great good fortune in respect of its vast wheat crop, however, is not the unsurpassed quantity we have to sell to the rest of the world. It is that we can supplv all our own bread and then have | wheat left over to help feed nations that cannot supply their own bread. As a matter of fact, out of our crop of 810,000,000 bushels of wheat this year we require for our own consumption, for bread and for seeding, about 600,000,000 bushels, That leaves about 200,000,000 bushels for sale abroad. But Canada, with a crop of about 300,000,000 bushels, can sell about 350,000,000 bushels because the I other 40,000,000 bushels is more than enough to provide the bread for Canada's population. ; There is much the same story to tell of Argentina with a crop of j 1S0.000.000 bushels and Australia with 132.000,000. There are rela\ tively few mouths to feed in both j those wheat growing countries put together. While only 25 per cent, of iour wheat crop is in excess of our home requirements, about 75 per ; cent of their wheat output is in excess of their home requirements. Canada's population of 9,000,000, I good for 390,000,000 bushels of wheat; ' Argentina's 8,500.000 population, good tor 180,000,000 bushelsT'and Australia's 5,500,00V population, good for 132,000.000 bushels?this means only 23,000,000 people to feed at home with more than 700,000,000 bushels of wheat at their own doors, as against over 110,000,000 population with 800,000,000 bushels of wheat. That is why this country is not the j source of the world's wheat export I supply, because we don't sell ours for the most part; we eat it. And this is why Canada with her I imports again held down and with some 350,000,000 bushels of wheat to sell abroad at better than a dollar a bushel no longer has any problem of a heavily depressed foreign exchange to distract her industry and business. Canada's currency, in ; iruin, even as measureu in uuhcu ! States gold, has been quoted in New ; York recently more often at a pre; mium than at a discount. When you sell the goods the other fellow pays you?that's the exchange I problem in a nutshell. Cheap Heat From Electricity. ! Professor Rhoi.na.ld A. Fesbkndex, whose achievements in electrical engineering entitle him to be heard with respect, offers to demonstrate that houses in Boston can be heated by electricity for what it would cost to produce the same temperatures | were coal selling at from $2.50 to $2 !a ton. Without going into the elaborately worked out technical details it may i be said that there is predicated an electric power station in the anthra| cite regions from which the heating effect of one ton of coal could he delivered in Boston over a wire 252 miles long from, say, Scrantou for $1. The freight rate for a ton of coal is about $2.50. With this as a starter other economics are indicated which would reduce heating costs to the low figure mentioned. And this is saying nothing of the benefit of getting rid of i the smudge and dirt incident to handling even the cleanest coal, and I saying nothing also of the eliminated eost of furnace care and ash dispot'. ion. Professor Frssekdex proposes to use Boston, and ultimately all of Massachusetts, to demonstrate the practicability of his plan. To the Bay State the inventor offers the free use of his devices accompanied by his personal supervision of their Installation. Here surely is a matter carrying a I strong appeal to the traditional New England thrift. Discount the inventor's forecast by, say, 50 per cent, and there still remains a vast margin of public benefit. But how is the project going to affect the coal mining industry? Professor FrsarxDEx's answer | is simple: there isn't going to be any coal mining industry. He believes that long before the end of the pres ent century coal mining will have come to an end. except possibly for some chemical manufactures. "With the sun radiating over 4.000,000 horse-power on every square mile of earth surface, of which more than 10 per cent, can be obtained by known methods of power storage by which a horse-power hour can be stored for a week at a. cost of onefifteenth of a cent, and the fact that generating stations where it is not ! cloudy can supply stations with cloudy areas, what." asks Profeasor KEK&Exnr.s. "are the probabilities that we shall continue to hother about mining coal or that 99 per I cent, of the coal areas will ever : bring their owners a single cent an acre?" " As for the talk about the necessity j of our conserving fuel. that, says Professor FEssrjtnr.r*. Is based on a I mistake. "The fundamental reason ! why coal is so high." says Professor i FESSEXttr.tr. "is that there is so much ! more of It than can ever he used." United S|ates Geological Survey reports are quoted to show that the I United States has enough high grade icoal actually located to last. 10.000 years at tbg present rate uf consuaip THE tion. And this is taking no accou of the medium and low grade coal excellent for steam making, of whi< we have a 40,000 years supply ahea And then there are the oil shale d posits. The Government experts ai j independent mining interests a | quoted as 6aying these sources ! supply are sufficient to furnish ! with all the gasoline and oil we slu ' need for the next 20,000 years. ! With coal at staggering prices, ai hard to-get at that, these certain i are interesting assurances. Will n ; Boston and the professor kindly g down to business as speedily as p< ! sible and produce a few satlsfyii ' samples of that low priced heat? I ~ I Canada's Immigrant Campaig Canada has again launched a cai paign to attract American farmers the Dominion. By newspaper advc tising and by the direct appeal traveling agent the agricultui advantages found there are be! described and inducements to imn ! grate are being offered. Excellent grain growing land I low prices and long time payments I the basic attraction. Climatic d I advantages are minimized.

Latterly the subji has been enraging the verv serio attention of Dominion authorlti and business Interests. In Octofc last there was an important confe ence on the subject. In response i c. Government summons represenl j tives of transportation companii j leading immigrant officials afid hea I of the newly organized Canadian C< I onization Association assembled j Ottawa. The facts they laid before the Mi j ister of Immigration were disturbir j The Canadian Pacific and the Can jdlan National railroads, the Canadii j Pacific steamships and three gre transatlantic steamship lines were j ! represented by a single spokesma I At the outset he made the broi statement tJiat in the decade 191 1921 Canada lost to the United Stat every immigrant that came to h i shores and nearly 300,000 perso I, j besides. He estimated tne population ! Canada in 1911 at 7,206,643. By nj j ural Increase this population in 19 should have been 9,043,050. To th i figure should be added the 1,975,3 immigrants who arrived in the df ade. With these additions Cana in 1921 ought to have had a popul tion of 11,018,443. But the actual population Canada in 1921 was 8,769,494, or 31: 572 less than the 1911 populath plus the ten years total of immigra arrivals, and 273,556 less than mlg 1 have been expected from natural i i crease with immigration left entire out of the calculation. In oth words. Canada lost all of her near 2.000,000 immigrants and more thi a quarter of a million populath besides. These llgures moved t Montreal .Star to remark that Cana< was only Sam's sieve. But it should be borne in mil I that the particular decade in qu< i tion was exceptional. It included t 1 war period, and during the oponi: years of that period, when this cou j try was not involved, the demai ! here for ail kinds of labor caused Canadian migration to the Unit ! States such as was never knov before. Canadian immigration effort labo I under three distinct handicaps. En i lish speaking people fear an lnund tion of non-British stock.

The very object of a written constitution is g to prevent violent changes; to insure dejt liberation and the exercise not of the j. passions but the reason of the nation.
