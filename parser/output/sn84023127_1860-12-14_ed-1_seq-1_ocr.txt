FRIDAY MOUSING, DEC. 14. lsf.0. TIIK I'UKSS ONTIIK MUSSACK. In lieu of remarks of our own upon Mr. Buchanan's last, wa copy below a number of extracts from the leading articles of prominent journals. With the exception of those pap :rs which were determined to be suited, and whose eulogiurns might as well have been, (as perhaps they were) written before they saw the document, the general tone of tho press is condemnatory. And in this the press is, wo doubt not, but an echo of public opinion generally. Wo do not think there was a general dis position in advance to find fault. On tho other hand there was a general expression of hope that Mr. Huehanan would seize the op portunity, so providentially afforded him, of retrieving some of his former blunders, and of regaining some of tho good will of tho millions ol his countrymen, which he had sacrificed to the favor of the slavcbolding oligarchy. Ho has not done this, and ho will have to take tho consequences. Hi course throughout tlie short remainder of his torm.so far as his niessago gives indication of it, is hkoly to ha ono of vacillation and cow ardly condonation of treason and rebellion, which, if it be possible, will but add to the contempt felt for him by good and honest men ol nil parties, and perhaps do irretriev able injury to the country which honored him with the hi ghost gift in its power. The X. Y. Tribune reviews the Messago after the following merciless fashion: " Let us devoutly thank God that, for tho ensu ing four years at least, the People of tho United State aro relieved from the annual visitation of a long Presidential lecture wherein Keason is in sulted, Uumanityoutraged, History travestied and Common Scnso defied, in the interest of Human Slavery and for tho gratification of its upholders. Tho man who in this day talks of the opponents of Slavery as blind, besotted fanatics, and repre sents tho current agitation as utterly unprovoked and gratuitous, is simply dishonest. Mr. Buchan an knows better. Ho knows that the means whero by Texas was thrust into our Union were eminent ly calculated to arouse any latent Anti-Slavery conviction that slumbered in tho breast of our non-slavholding citizens, llo knows that, when thcWar on Mexico was ma Jo to result in tho transfer of vast and thinly peopled regions from that republic to our Union, it was inevitable eith er that Slavery should bo excluded from thoso Territories or that the Poople of tho United States as a whole, and not thoco of the South exclusive ly, should tako upon their soula tho responsibili ty of extending "tho peculiar institution" over a region half so large as Europe far larger than tbe United States east of tho Mississippi. Mr. Duohanan himself expressly affirms, and quotos the Supreme Court as his authority, that ovciy foot of Federal territory is necessarily slavehold ing territory that is, territory subject to tho law of Slavery from tho moment that it passes under tho sway of our Union. Ho knows that tho Kan-las-Nebraska bill was expressly and avowedly in troduced to remove legal obstacles to the diffusion of Slavery, and that the bill owed all its impor tance and geneial interest to that fact. How is it possible, then, for a publicist, with tho eyes of the world full upon him, to say that "Tho long " continued and intemperate interferenco of tha "Northern people with thequestion of Slavery in 'the Southern Stales has at length produced its " natural effects ? ' Is the PrcUdcnt's brow brass that it should not crimson with the consciousness that the whole world will know this to bo a lie? Decs ho not know right well that the childron in our public schools will point the finger of shame at the author of such assertions, who lingers on the brink of the grave to libel and traduco tho most intelligent and conscientious portion of tho pcoplo about to bo relieved from tho incubus of his rulo? Mr. Uuchanan asserts that it would be "easy " for the American peoplo to settle tho Slavery " question for ever," and this simply by letting the Slave States alone, and permitting them to "manago their domcstio institutions in their own "way." Yet in this very Message he proposes to force Slavery down tho throats of the Northern peoplo, and compel them to tako upon their con sciences the responsibility of justifying, protect ing, and extending it, by five or six distinct and important acts." The Tnbunt further agrees with Mr. Bu chanan on secession and coercion says amen to the President's remarks on the Tariff and thanks him for his word for the fam ishing in Kansas and for the four columns, which on revision be omitted from tho mes sage. The Times is scarcely less severe than the Tribune. Its article closes as follows : TV Afesntn in nnr ludrment. ia an incen diary document, and will tend still further to cz- asperate the eeetionai aiucrences oi mo uay. n backs up the most extravagant of the demands lumn inniln w ihn Snnth indoreps WIllCXl Uttto J ' their menace of Disunion if those demands aro not conceded, and promises tne seceamg ouues wai tho power of the Federal Government shall not bo used for their coercion. Tho entire North will be made doubly indignant ty inn nagrani i ,t-i: .M.ifn tl.n nart nf the executive of aereiicuu" ""'j . the Nation, while tho Disuaionists of the bouth will be stimulated to fresh exertions in tho work of i-: -i. iii.v Tinr-A Amhurlred. The ooun- niin upcb ituu.1 - . . try has to strugglo through three months more of this disgracclul lmoecuuy auu v" Constitution." The New York Iltrald, which loses no op nnrtnnitv to plaster Mr. Buchanan with flattery, till ho is fairly blind, is i it- im TfrfnMff consistent and8convincing Ticws. thereon, of this admirable annual Message. - it is his best, good as lis predecessors havo been, 11 13 ilia ue.k, b . .-nnireraant. of tho each in its auapi;""" - tho time. The Now York World is also well suited. It says : Despite the logie.il inconsistency between ome of its most important positions, President Buchat an's Mcssago is a judicious, patriotic, and concilia tory document. But when he proceeds to address Congress on iri duties, his recommendations seem to us a great deal better than his reasoning. Tht World detects divers contradictions, and discrepancies in the President's rcasoning6 but then it considers theso " more curious than important." Consistency is a virtue of small value in the World's esteem. The staid and truly conservative Commer cial takes a somewhat different view of tho Message. It says : It is totally unworthy of thoExcoutivo of this great Republic. Its stereotyped abuso of " tho North," its falso allegations respecting " the long continued and intemperato interferenco of the Northern peoplo with tho question of slavery in tho Southern States," its cntiro silenco about Southern agitation ot tho Slavery question, cou plet with iterations of the charge that tho North has kept up such agitation, wo pass by as the haokneyed phrases of a disappointed political par tisan, deserving tho strongest condemnation in an official document, emanating from tho President of tho whole country. The Evening Post says : It was written, evidently, under a painful sense of the difficulty of reconciling his past conduct with his present duty, and a selfish fear of disturb ing his relations with a faction from whoso trea sonable toils ho sees no escape except through the valley of humiliation. Of course, it is as impossible for Mr. Buchanan to state the issues between tho North and South correctly, as it is for him to hold his head up straight. His ono-sidednoss in both respects has bocomo ehronic. The New York Sun, (neutral) pronounces the Message to bo " double-faced and unde cided," and in a pointed article shows ,as fol lows, the absurdity of the President's po sition : Tho States are bound by the federal compact, but there is no power to enforce it, if they repudiate tho obligation. Tho President is bound to execute tho laws, but ho i? without the moan3 to do so, if his agents resign and tho pone comitaius and mili tia aro disaffected. He has, indeed, the army and navy to aid in executing process, but Judy o Ma grath has rcsigntd, antHhcro neither is, nor can be any process to execute, so that this provision of the Constitution is also a dead letter. If a collect or resigns another can bo appointed, but not so with a judge, a district attorney or a marshal; Whcnco this difference? Tho inconsistency is nonstnsical.lt is obvious that tho whole, is a labor ed but whiineioal etTort to prove that tho Presi dent is sound on tho Constitution and unperjured as to his oath of office, but powerless to uphold the former or to fulfill tho latter. It is a palpablo cover of retreat from tho sacrod responsibilities of his position; an elaborately contrived excuso for pusillanimity. Tho Courier . Enquirer thinks the mcs sago unworthy of the Chief Executive, and unequal to the crisis. We clip the fol lowing from a long and severe criticism : "As for tho recommendations of the Mcs-.igo in regard to a Convention to change tho Constitution to suit South Carotin -. and for the purpos-: of carrying slavory into tho Territories, it is all 6eiA. Xho Pcoplo of the United States lovo tho Union; but they havo just proclaimed trumpct- tongucil tnrouga the Hallot iioxef, tnat tliey do not love the Institution of Slavery. They havo said, "Let it alone" and confine it to tho limits of tho States which lovo it. Yo will havo nothinj to do with it. It is local, not national: and the General Government shall not meddlo with it We will protect every State in the enjoyment of tho Institution, hut wo will not recognize its pres. encc m our Territories. And in the faco ot all this, Mr. Buchanan asks a chango in tho Consti tution by these very people, for tho express pur poso of makingjthem stultify themselves and rcpu diato their recent vote against clavcry excite ment." The jV. I". iNVtcj (Douglas) is disappoint ed. It says : " Either from lack of natural capacity to .i-isp so great a question, or through the obstructing dissensions of a heterogeneous Cabinet, .Mr. Uu chanan has failed to come up to our expectations.' The Albany Journal U perplexed: as thus : " There is cvidence.in tho structure of this Mcs sage, and upon its face, that it was conceived and written in a patriotic spirit, and with a Iolty pur pose. To arguments so strong and clear, to con ception so elevated, conclusions so illogical and lame, have no fitness or athnity. As a whole, therefore, hastily read, wo know not how to estimate tho Message, uf good, taken scp aratcly, there is enough to brighten the darkened skies enough to build sanguino hopes npon enough even to avert tho threatened danger. Hut qualified, toned down, and emasculated, as it 5s,we aro unable to form an opinion as to its effect upon Congress and the people. Tho Boston Journal forcibly says : He argues that no right exists on tho part of - l . r . I l"1 . ) TT . 1 ! uuy cliu io 2Kceuo irom uiuxeuciai union, mougu bo arrives at tbe impotent conclusion that no State ought to be coercod if she should sco lit to scccdo ' In other words, secession should not bo regarded as rebellion, but tolerated because, of tho real weakness of tho central power. If this is to he established as an axiom in tho administra tion of tho federative powers, then tho U. States. instead of being a first-class nation, is a mero ag gregation of petty republics with not half tho co hesion of tho Herman btatcs. buch an admission from our Chief Magistrate must lead J to distrust of the stability of our government, and of tho security of our bonds. Wo shall expect, as the natural result, that our foreign creditors will be clamorous for tho payment of an indebtedness which each .state in turn mar repudiate by seces sion, and the "United" States havo dissolved liko snow beforo tho advancing spring. Tho Boston Traveller says : As to tho Presidential recommendation that amendments of the Constitution shonld be made, conceding to tho slavcholding interest all that it has ever asked, it isab-urd to suppose that peace can como therefrom. There would bo hot and heavy debates, a moro violent "agitation" than wo havo ever yet known, and probably a general breakdown of tho country. The Springfield Republican says : For its false assumptions and its sectional spirit tbero is no palliation, except in the possibility that by taking the extreme southern side on some points it may have more effect there in delaying any sudden and violent action. Wc concludo our extracts,with tho follow ing indication of Mr. Lincoln's opinion of the Message : SpuiSGriELC, 111.. Dec. 5, 18C0. A synopsis of tho President's Message reached Mr. Lincoln this morning. Ho comments very severely on its accusatory tone towards the North, and says his own views are misrepresented. Tin: N. Y. Historical Society. A taper bv Gov. Hall, or Yt. At tho last regular meeting of the Historical Society of N. I'.City tho paper of tho evening was read by Gov ernor Hall of Vermont, and was enditlet 'The Now Hampshire Grants." Tho main topic was upon tho separation of Ver mont from New York. In 1761 tho present State of Vermont was settled by emigrants from most of the New England colonies. Tho lands of theso settlers were held by virtue of grants from Now Hampshire Subsequently, by a proclamation of the king, Vermont was added to New York, and tho New Hampshire settlers were looked upon as trespassers. Bitter feuds thereupon ensnod, and the settlers were outlawed in many instances without trial by the arbitrary Governors of New York. Articles showing the rights of New York to tho territory were extensively published. The New York Government claimed that tho settlers had purchased their grants from New Hampshire, knowing that the titlo was doubtful, and that hcreforo they were in the ligtof voluntary tres passers. This, however,wa:n not eo; tho settlers took their title from that territory, which claimed title by reason of the boundary line which had been tlaid down botweenthe colonial provinces of New Hampshire and New York. The New York land patents were Issued to but few persons, though in large quantities; the New York Governor, like a prudent man. takin? irood care of himself and family. These grants were all made in violation of the King's order, which was, that not more than one thousand acres should be granted to one settler. Under these circumstan ces, it was noi at, ail surprising that the original settlers revolted from the rule of New York, and insisted upon the protection of their rights. A vote of thanks was passed to the speake r for the interesting paper read by him. How is this ? Tho Post Offico Depart ment at Washington sent out, Thursday, blanks'sufacient to Supply thcCharleston (S.C.) Postmaster until J uly next. They were sent in response to hia order. THE 

PERIL. OF THE SOUTH. A striking portion of Mr. Buchanan's Message, is that in which he states that the immediate peril at fio South is the danger of servile insurrection. He absurdly attributes this to the utterly impossible causo of northern agitation of the Slavery question ; but as to the reality of the danger, he is doubtless correct. It exists, and the slaveholders have, by their own ungrounded denunciations of the .Republican party, as an abolition party jn the hearing of their slaves, given fresh and strong stimulus to the ever-present tendency of the enslaved to riso upon their masters. Tho peril and its cause are both forcibly portrayed in tho following most interesting extract from a private letter from a South Carolina matron to a relative in New York City. It is dated Dec. 1, and published in the New York Times of Fri day. It must stir the hearty sympathy of every one, for thoso unhappy housoholds ' sleeping on their arms," as well as of ab horrence of a system, of which such dangers and precautions aro necessary concomitants. You may imagine, dear uncle, our situation, but you never can rcalizo it in its fulness. Already wo trcmblo in our own homes in anticipation and expectancy of what i3 liable to burst forth at any moment, a negro insurrection. Could you seo the care and precaution displayed hero by tho propri etors cf tho negroes, not only planters, but others, you would not for a moment envy us our posscs- sions. Not a night passes that wo do not securely lock our field servants in their quarters, but our most loved and valued houso servants who in ordinary times wo would trust in any extent, aro watched and guarded against with all the scutiny and caro that wo possess. Our planters and own ers of slavo property do not allow their servants to havo any intercourse with each other, and tho negroc3 are confined strictly to tho premises where they belong. We are all obliged to increaso our forco of overseers to prevent tuo free intercourso even among our own servants. Tho negroes feel and notice these new rcatraints, and naturally ask "Why is this? But it is unnecessary for them to ask tbe qutstion, for they all comprehend tho cause as well as wc who own them. They have already learned enough to ijwe them an idea of what is ijoing on in the State and nation, and this knowl edge tiey hate n'.t gained from Abolitionists, as somr suppose, but from the conversation of their owners indirectly held in their presence. Thoy havo already heard of Lincoln's election, and have heard alto that he it for giving them their liberty, and you may imagine tho result. You have heard that our servants all lovo their masters, and their masters' families, and would lay down their lives for them that the colored race in the South prefer Slavery to freedom that they would not be frco if thoy could, ic, Ac. That is but the poetry of tho ease, tho reality con sists in sleeping upon our arms at night in doubio bolting and barring our doors in establishing and maintaining an efficient patrol force in bay ing watch dogs, and in taking turns in watching our sleeping childrcn.to guard them and ourselves from tho vengeaneo of theso same "loving ser vants' a vengeance which, though now smould ering, is liabld to burst ont at any moment, tu overwhelm the State in spite of tho Palmetto flags or state precautions. You at tho North aro not the only ones who are suffering financially by this now panic. Tho planters among us are really suffering from the depreciation in their property. Already negroes are not worth half price. No one dares to buy a servant, learing lest he, in doing so, should bo in troducing upon his plantation ono tinctured with tho idea of freedom. My husband has but a few servants, I believe but thirty-ono all told, still I (eel (and so dues he) that they are thirty-one too many in such times as theso. He would sell them immediately, it it were possible, but tho truth is ho could real ize nothing for them at present, or at most not ovrr half their real value. Slaves are a drug in tho market, my husband says, and you l:now him well enough to juilgo of bis judgment In ueh matters. Now, ono word as to tho military forco of the State, to protect us against an insurrection. I presume, with the exceptions of Charleston, and perhaps a few largo towns, that tho remainder of tho State is situated very much as wo are here; and I will givo you an idea of how well prepared we aro to resist a mob. Upon our place of about 1,200 acres we have; ofwhitos, males husband, two oversccrsand my son of 18 years; total, bur; females self and cousin, little Licy and wife of one of the'ovcrscer's,four;of whom only four at tho most aro capable of bearing arms, to offset which we have at least seventeen field hands sturdy young negroes, besides the female servants.

WALKER, James Babrett, j W. A. ECENETT, j L0B2XZ0 SnELDO.v. i Executive Com. C. A. TnoHAi, Jons Howx, Jr., For the Frco Press . CHIlIsTIANIT,Y, AND WORLD." " TI Messrs. Editors of tht Free Press: I am glad to find that you cstimato at its true value The "World. That pretontious papor assumes and presumes to speak for Chris tianity a self constituted judjjc of what is prope for Christianity in all possible relations. -And from that lofty height, as it justly may, for tho greater includes tho less it dispenses advice, re buke and direction, to christian men, and States Governments and Nations, with the authority of another successor of St. Peter. It was said of Christianity by its Author that it should bo liko Icavcn a power ever aggressive, invading and pervading, assimilating to its own nature, and subjecting to its own law, wholly or partially, in all directions. Tho announcement of its character was a piophccy of its results. Pre cisely such has been its effect in tho world. In its moro central and efficient working, subduing men to a willing and grateful obedience; moro outwardly acting upon tho intellect and in tho consciences of millions who do not know.or often times are unwilling to aeknowlodgo (he origin of tho influence that controls them. Sometimes it moves silently and slowly, often against ficrco and noisy resistance, in tho midst of large masses of moro or loss assimilable mate rial, gradually and for the most part indircstly, putting an end to unhallowed rites, barbarous customs, unrighteous laws, anil falso opinions; stimulating tho intellect, arousing the conscience, and purifying all domestic rotations so trans forming :i polished but corrupt heathendom into christian States; or quietly adding barbarous nations to a civilized Christendom. Always, whether extending noiselessly and quietly, or in tho face of whatever opposition, it moves with a mighty, I may say almighty power. It not only subdues to itself, and for itself, what ever can bo made subservient i its end; but its touch is tho doom of whatever is found incapable of such conformity. Forthwith, the incompatible thing leji to wither away, like the barren fig trec.an.l its destruction is only a question of time. This great and most hopeful fact is demonstrable from history. Customs, institutions, occupations which fail, beforo tho ever laoro and more cn lightened and sensitivo conscience of Christendom , to prove their right to be however great the clamor or the loss of shrine-makers and ethers for whose profit it is to reserve them are blighted, crumble away, and perish forovor; or if their re suscitation is attempted they have bat a spasmod ic and momentary life. Herein is found tho ful filment of the prophecy that this kingdom should briak in pieces and coo sums all ether knig doms. ThU, however, though the more quiet asd or dinary, is not the only method by which Christian ity advances. For bow often has it happened, moreover, and how often, alas ! is it yet to hap pen, when ancient injustice, obstinate despotism, hoary falsehood, or incurable corruption has per sistently rofnsed obedience to this over aggressive kingdom, that that other prophecy, of Him whoso this kingdom is, has been, or will bo, ful filled: "Thou shall dash them in pieces as a pot- i vessel. But daring its wholo history as was also prophesied cf it whenever Christianity has been felt to encroach upon favorite opinions, npon authorised delusions or vices that divide handsome profits, or upon time-out-of-mind injustices, it wboicnboutt mizbt, and may bo linflnp, Uy Ita characteristic attendants. These are the naked wolves of infidelity howling in front; en either flank tho not less angry irolves in shaep's clothing, all shouting vociferously "thus far aad no far ther;' and hanging to tho shirts bchind.a motley train of pious conservatives, whispering, in terror at tho consequences of further progress, "rir be far flrom the, Lord !" Among all tho historical enormities which have ever had legal existence, for the amount and qual ity of injustice and unrighteousness which aro not merely inseparable from it, but constitutive of it, by far the direst is Slavery. For obvious reasons, too, it is among the most ineradicable forms of injustice. Yet tho subversive power of Christian ity over thi3 evil has steadily increased both in extent and intensity, driving it from nation after nation,thc feeling of its essential injustice pervad ing more and more widely and deeply the minds of men, until it is at length wholly cast out from the consciences, not only of all christians, but of all Christendom. This tho pious brake-men admit. Truo, there aro cortain Scribes and Doctors(DD.s) who daro to assort, as of old, that through Beelze bub, tho princo of the devils, has this devil been cast out. Certainly, then, never in any other in stance, wa3 Satan so thoroughly and so foolishly divided against himself. It is just at this stago of the contest that " 7 he World," The Observer," and the like of them. modestly demand of Christianity,nct merely to halt "pass not tholbcrus" but to retreat a thousand years. Trudent advice, too, and might szveprestut trouble; to which cars unstopped might, perhaps, hear the reply to Peter for a similar presumption. Docs Christianity, that most aggrcssivo of all powers, halt? Pile up your compromises of sand bags and cotton-bags ! Do you not perceive that tho tide rises ever higher and higher, and that your momentary obstructions only increase tho destructivenrss of tho consequent flood ? The result will be all the came for Christianity. Tho choico of the means it shall cso lies with lho3e who resist it Shall it persuade, or shall it " dash in pieces"? xnis language is not intended a3 a threat; but simply to present tho most solemn question of history in regard to all infatuated injustices. Ac sure as tho laws of Nature are con stant, and God is unchangeable, thcro is left to Slavery but thi3 choice. Has the North, then, been guilty cf unpardocablo arroganco, self-righteousness, as we aro accused, becauso wo havo entreated tho South to do in regard to Slavory what we had ourselves dono? in words of kind ness at first, often in carefully chosen words of christian and brotherly kindno;s; and insisting on kindness for was cot an abolitionist then in al most a3 much danger hire, as ho is now in tho slavo States ? What was tho answer to this most unselfish and well-meant request that ever one pcoplo made to another ? The reply that Slavery shall not bo diminished, but increased and made universal; that Slavery is holy, just and good; and that wc shall treat it as such ; if not, at our peril. Men are congratulating themselves just now men of Prime piety, and others, that lAfy hare not resisted theso pretensions, they have cried peace, peace, their consciences are clean, thoy havo pulled hard at tho skirts and cried forbear! Have they thus encouraged the Soutu to heap up ponder in its bosom icith the intention to produce tho -inevitable explosion ? No, good souls ! (though tho guilt is thereby hardly dimin ished for a man who can read history) they are of the wise men who think that French revolutions and others and worse, happen by accident ! or that tfiey arc a conspiracy of tho devil against "law and order," their chemistry know3 nothing of spontaneous combustion. There comes to christian men of enlightened and aroused consciences, who honestly believo in God, an imperative command, straitly charging them, and all of them not merely tho hangman under penalty, to chase, catch, and deliver, all fugitives from slavery to say to Christianity, "excuse us ! unless wo hearken to nun rather than God in this, we shall suffer for it ; besides,our fathers promised that we should." A very proper commani, says the TVorM,and ought lo be obeyed! It ought to bo obeyed says and . Oh! happy scnls ' whoso "eonscieno cs are in tho keep ing cf tho law!" sco Coleridge, wrap thy cloak about thee, Oh, man of Worldly and Prime piety ! and take an easy scat in tho car of State: tho shall never suffer "striving against sin." It ought to lo obeyed ! insist upon it, gentlemen, to your heart's content,'and bring us4norc of tho ramo sort if you please, and worse, if that wcro possible. Tho effects have been, and will bo, such cs men not infatuated could and can easily foresee. Effect not greatly to bo deplored, except by tho blind Power that usucs tho command. This is what you call statesmanship, against "unreasoning philan thropy !" to dragoon a whole people into obedience to an edict wholly obsolete in morals, and against which their deepest religious convictions revolt with shame and horror. An in sanity by tho sido of which tho fatuity of King Charles tho bruto obstinacy of French and Italian Bturbonism, are transparent wisdom. Will "Tht World" deny that this ia wholly a question of morals rather of religion ? For, are not all the earthly interests of 'he North on tbe side of obedience, so much so as to seduce men of whom Got and man ospeetcd better things f The issue ii now distinctly made, and we thail see whether the Christianity cf tho North is ripe enough to resist strong temptation and ttmble threats. Let mousing statesmen meditate upon that question. It can wait. The Vt'orld is the meekest of alt impersonali ties. It is iocapable -f dUpleasure. except at honest mdhnation. Witnets its abase of Sumner and others, in whoit. slavery excites other than loTiag emotions. Tha World is also eery neutral in polities it care is rt!ijri"3. Liko Bvug'as is dan't care who wbi;., so staviry n not affmdtd. The Wr.'J U s:.arp-sighted to see Republican faults but it can see no difference between slaves Tif r niversal, freedom nowhere ; and freedom general, slavery local. Or it is a mere war of words, be cause slavery is excluded from the Territorits by the laws of Nature. It never can, never d-d, cx iit anywhere North of So3 it can't Itvo in the cold, poor thing '. Bat then it claims its sights though it does not intend to ate them, u may de fend a principle, it will sceede for an abetraeUon. High-minded slavery ! What then is to be done ? nothing, exeept to have faith enough in God to obey Him. In re gard to the Territories three great principles aro involved let us violate neither of them. Slavery is politically a curse, morally a crime, religiously a sin. The States in regard to slavery, since it is purely leija'. and local, nre f.rtujn to oath other. It teaches not ur conscience there let them do with it as they can, siuce thty spam advice. For the fugitive slave law oar iathera were drawn into it under falso pretences. It was un derstood and protnUei on all side.-', that slavery should bo temporary. T'wy performed the prom ise on their pirt by abolishing it; and now we are called npon t Puffer tits eonieqoenco uf faiinre to perform on tho part of othois. We utterly re pudiate the moral obligation of the contract, not so much f jr the deception, as bccuse it is a contract ti violate our consciences. Nevertheless, our fathers having "sworn fur ns tu oar hart," let as "change not," in regard to the legal obligation, bat for every person within onr power, anet proved to be a slave, whom we refuse to deliver np, let ns pay sneh proportion of the market prleoae im partial umpires shall direct. Would this satisfy the Soath Not at all. Would all it demands satisfy the leaders of the eottoH fatates ? Not in the least.

REIGN Oi' TERROR. Every day gives additional proof that the reign of terror is thoroughly established over a great part of the Slaves States. It is only necessary to call any one, male or female, an abolitionist or "Black. Republican," to ex pose the suspected to gross assault, and even loss of life. Everything like free speech and fair discussion seems U bo at an end. News papers from the Free States, except those which pcrsevcringly misrepresent tho Re publicans and accuse than of being bent upon attacking the internal slave policy of the Slave States, are not allowed to be de livered from the postoffiees in extensive por tions of the slavcholding States. The fol lowing from the Boston Journal illustrates this state of things : A lew days since a very intelligent young gentleman returned to his homo here from , in Georgia, where he had spent the last two years in his business pursuits. A day or two after his return, being at the post office, a friend inquired the news from Georgia. He replied that they were prctly hot down there, but r.ot materially different from their condition when he tirst went there, some two years ao. The question was then asked what was the particulir cause of the excitement and heat. The answer was that the election of Linoln mi'it have put a little edge to the matter, but he thought that as much as to any one thing it was at tributable to such papers as the Boston Courier and the New York Herald ; he never saw any other papers there ; no Republican paper could pass through South Carolina without being burned, (or words to that ef fect.) As a natural consequence, the onlv ideas they had of Northern people, and the purposes ot northern majorities, were lroni those papers, and believing what they road in thoso papers, it was not unreasonable for them to do as they did. Tho general belief existed that the Repub lican party was formed and maintained for the purpose of invading their --onslitutional rights and the overthrow of slavery in the States. He was then asked if the Boston Journal did not publish some things which excited that region. The reply was that no paper that advocated Lincoln's election could ever reach that part of the country, and that the Journal was never seen there by him. The two papers first mentioned wero tho on ly ones he had seen there during the past six months." As a case m point, we givo an extract of a letter just received by us from a lady sub scriber in Texas, directing usto discontinue scndiDgc-ur paper to her there, hut to send it to a friend in this Stnte, Shesavs : "It ij almost dangerous for me to receive your paper longer. I find also, tho Postmas ter makes lnmsclt liable for delivcrms it." Postmaster 'iahle for doing the very duty which the laws of the United States impose upon him, 11: : to deliver to tho people the letters and papers sent to their address !

DfATU or Ex. Gov. Paljier. Hon. Win. A. Palmer died at his residence in Danville Dec. 3d, in the 80th year of his age. Mr. Palmer was a native of Connecticut. Ho removed to Vermont in tho year 1800, and for many years was a prominent man in the politics of the State. Ho represented the Town of Danville repeatedly ia tho Legisla ture, held the office of Judge in tha Supremo Court, was L". S. Senator from thi3 State from 1818 to 1825, and Governor of the State from 1831 to 1834 inclusive. During tho later portioniof his life ho withdrew entirely from politics or public business. For the last eleven years he was in poor health. Til HILLING NARRATIVE. The Cleaveland Herald gives a thrilling account of the hardships and sufferings ex perienced by the passengers and crew of tha propeller Jersey City, wrecked on Lako Erie during tho late galo, Sve only of whom sur vived the disaster. The steamer was bound from Toledo for Buffalo, and when overtaken by the gale Capt. Monroe, her commander, -headed her for Long Point, Canada, intend ing to take shelter behind it. Tho storm, however, drovo tho vessel so far from her course that it was evident she could not be got round the Point without great difficulty. The account of tho Herald continues ; The ordinary fires were found unequal to getting up the great pressure of steam necessary, and kegs f lard and bnttcr were rapidly thrown in to feed tbe flames. But every effort was vain. A sudden shock, a dull grating sound that was felt above tho howling of the tempest, and the Jersey City was a hopeless wreck. Sho bad grounded on the steal about two miles distant from tho Point. Capt. Monroe immediately ordered every eao to tho hurricane dcak, as the only chaneo of safety. A number, hecdleH of bis warnings, jumped into tbe life-beat and made for shore. They wero all lost among the breakers. Soon after grounding the propeller heeled over, broadside to tbe seas, and with her deck exposed to the action of the waves. Her deck-load was at oaee washed off, and the repeated blows of the huge waves stove in her decks and daubed her sides inti pieces. Tho hurricane deck with its load of half-froien sufferers, floated towards the shore. About 3 o'clock in the afternoon tho hurricane deck grounded within a short distance from the shore, in shallow water. At this moment a boy who was on the wreck was washed off by tho waves but was rescued by Capt. Monroe. After this tho boy became frightened foj tho first time, and clung eagrrly to his preserver. Capt. Monroe fastened a plank life-preserver to his body, and, taking the boy in hh arms, leaped into tho water and waded ashore. As tho boy was landed his suspenders broke am! his pantaloons fell about his ancles, where thoy froze in a solid mass, chaining him to the pct where he stood. In a few moments the half-naked boy was dead. Capt. Monroe walked back to the piece of wrcok aad directed his comrades where to leap so as to strike in the shallowest water. Ono by ono tho leap was made in safety, until but one was left en board, and that one was Mr. A. Derby, the clerk of tho propeller. Ho was seen sitting upen the wreck w.th his head bent down, as if in despair. Capt. Monroe called him by name, but he did not answer, although his mouth opened. To a seeend hail, he again opened bis mouth, without giving any articulate sound. Capt. Monroe and Engineers Manchester and Cummin gi went to the wreck, and after considerable difficulty got off the helpless man. Capt. Monroo took Derby on his back, while tha two engineers steadied his Irgssoas to prevent tho wave' washing him off. In this way tho party waded throtteh tbe water, ice making on them at eitry step, the surf dashing around them, tho bitter wmi freezing their bands and facoe,and tbe blind ing -now obscuring their view. 'i reaching tha horo, Captain Montoo attempt ed to lower Derby to hia feet, but tound it im possible to let hiin down. The (living bearer had fruita fast U hi? dead burden. Tho captain's arms were froien stiff, and clasped around tho arms of tho dead man. Tbe two engineers were Uo v fr .zen about the hand that they coukl render no as Ktancc. Finding it impossible to rid himelf of bis terrible harden in any other way. Captain M-.tiroe flung himself on the ground, heai most, and thns 'spilled' the dead man from his shoulders. But he ha-1 eseuped from one horriblo dilemma only to find himself in another. His triiwsers were fiozeu so stiff up to bis hips that he was as much unaMc to rise as if his leei had been ei leased in lengths of stove pipe, and his cmipan iobs could render him no assistance At a short disttnee was the body of a man, frozen iu a sitting position. Captain Monroe managed to roll him- tr!f to the body, and by it climbed to his feet. This little party of snrvivorsnowsetonton their painful mareh towards the lighthouse, which was at no great dittanee. They had got Rifely along until within about three hundred yards of tba house, when a small creek impeded thoir progresi. First engineer Manchester attempted to cross tho creek, but abandoned it and returned to the shore, where be sat down, exhausted and despairing Second engineer Cummincs came up, and endear ored to encourage him to farther efforts, but ia vain. Cjptl Monroe Legged Manchester to rise and make an attempt to get around the creek, tell ing bira the light houso was close by. "Its ef no use. Captain," said tho unfortsnato man, "X can't go any further." Calamines placed his arms around tho bod v of his comrade in order to lift him to his feet, but at that moment the icy hand cf death was laid 03 both, and, clasped in each other's arms, face al most touching face, with words of friendly cheer frozen in the utterance, theso two brave men Manches'or ami Cumming3 perished within a few minutes walk of safety. In this position they wore afterwards found by the party in search. Capt. Monroe succeeded in reaching tho light house in safety, although badly frozen. Out of the twenty-two who hai formed ths crew and passeng ers of the ill-fated Jersey City, but five survived, being Capt. Monroe, two firemen, tho wheelsman, and one pasrenger. The others cither perished in the waves or were froien to death in that awful death-march. Six of tho bodies havo been recov ered, some being returned to 'heir former homes, and others buried on the Point. We are glad to learn that the brave Capt.Menroe will not suffer so severely by his exposure as it was a: first teared. Sucn heroes cannot bo spared. His deeds of daring and tender care during tho fatal wreck and march of death on Long Point adds a brighter halo to the famo won by the gall ant rescue of tbe frozen crew of the Omar Pasha,at the risk of bis own life, at the mouth of Cleveland harbor, some years since.
