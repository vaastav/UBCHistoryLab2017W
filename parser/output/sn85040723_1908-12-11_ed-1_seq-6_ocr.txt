President’s Message. To the Senate and House of Represen tatives Finances. The financial standing of the nation at the present time is excellent, and the financial management of the nation's in terests by the government during the last seven years has shown the most satisfac tory results, lint our currency system is imperfect, and it is earnestly to be hoped that the currency commission will be able to propose a thoroughly good system which will do away with the existing defects. louring the period from .July 1, 1901, to September 30, 1908, there was an increase In the amount of money in circulation of $902,991,899. This Increase in the per capita during this period was s7.(*i. Within this time there were several occasions when it was necessary for the treasury department to come to the relief of the money marker by purchases or redemptions of United States bonds; by increasing deposits in national banks; bv stimulating additional issues <>f national bank notes, and by facilitating im portations from abroad of gold. Our im perfect currency system lias made these proceedings necessary, and they were cf fective until the monetary disturbance in the fall of 1907 Immensely increased the difliculty of ordinary methods of relief By the middle of November tlie available work ing balance in the treasury had been re duced to approximately $5,000,000. clearing house associations throughout tlie country had been obliged to resort to the expedient of issuing clearing house certificates, to In used as money. In this emergency It was determined to Invite subscriptions for s.<>,- 000,000 Panama canal bonds, and $100,W), 000 three per cent, certificates of indebted ness authorized by the act of June 13. 1898. It was proposed to re-deposlt in the national banks the proceeds of these issues, and to permit their use as a basis tor additional circulating notes of national banks. 'I he moral effect of this procedure was so great that It was necessary to issue only &£4,0.‘U,- 980 of the Panama canal bonds and $b,43C,- 500 of the certificates of indebtedness. During the period from July 1. 1901, to September 30, 1908, the balance between the net ordinary receipts and the net ordi nary expenses of the government showed a surplus in tin* four years 1902, 1993, 1909 and 1907, and a deficit in the years 1994, 1805, 1908, and a fractional part of the fiscal year 15)09. The net result was a sur plus of $99,283,413.54. The financial opera tions of the government during tills period, based upon those differences between re ceipts and expenditures, resulted in a net reduction of the interest-bearing debt of lie United States from $987,141,040 to $897,253.- 090, .notwithstanding that there had been two sales of Panama canal bonds amount ing in the aggregate to $54.(531,980, and an issue of three per cent, certificates of in dehtedness under the act of June 13, 18!!S, amounting to $15,436,500. Refunding op r; tlous of the treasury department under tin act of March 14, 1900, resulted in the eon version into two per cent, consols of 1930 of *200,309,400 bonds bearing higher rates Of interest. A decrease of 88,687.950 in the annual Interest charge resulted from these operations. in short, during the seven years and Hire ■ months there has been a net surplus of nearly one hundred millions of receipts ov< r expenditures, a reduction of the interest bearing debt by ninety millions, in spite of the extraordinary expense of the Panama canal, and a saving of nearly nine mil.ions on the annual interest charge. This Is an exceedingly satisfactory showing, especially In view of the fact that during tlds period the nation has never hesitated to undertake any expenditure that it regarded as neces sary. There have been no new taxes and no Increases of taxes; on the contrary some taxis have been taken off; there has been a fiduetion of taxation. Corporations. As regards the great corporations engaged In interstate business, and especially the railroads, I can only repeat what 1 have already again and again said In my ines sagt s to the Congress. 1 believe that under the Interstate clause of the Constitution the TAilted Statis lias complete and paramount right to control all agencies of interstate commerce, and I believe that the national government alone cun exercise this right with wisdom and effectiveness so ns both to secure justice from, and to do justice to, the great corporations widen are the most Important factors in modern business. 1 believe that it is worse than folly to at tempt to prohibit all combinations as is done by the Sherman anti trust law, be cause such a law can be enforced only imper fectly and unequally, and its enforcement works almost as much hardship as good. 1 strongly advocate that instead of an unwise effort to prohibit all cotnfMnations, there shall be substituted a law which shall ex pressly permit combinations which are In the interest of the public, but shall at the same time give to some agency of the na tloual government full power of control and supervision over them. One of the chief features of this control should be securing entire publicity in all matters which tlie public has a right to know, and further more, the power, not by judicial but by executive action, to prevent or put a stop to every form of improper favoritism or other wrongdoing. The railways of the country should be put completely under the interstate com merce commission and removed from the domain of the anti-trust law. The power of the commission should he made thor oughgoing, so lh.;L it could exercise com plete supervision and control over the issue of securities as well as over the raising and lowering of rates. As regards rates, at least, this power should he summary. The fiower to investigate the financial op erations and accounts of the railways has been one of the most valuable features in recent legislation. Power to make combi nations and traffic agreements should be explicitly conferred upon the railroads, the permission of the commission being first gained and the combination or agreement being published In all its details. In the interest of the public I lie representatives of the public should have complete power to see that the railroads do their duly by the public, and ns a matter of course this power should also he exercised so as to see that no Injustice is done to the rail roads. The shareholders, the employes and the shippers all have Interests that must be guarded, it is to the interest of all of them that no swindling stock speculation should be allowed, and that there should be no Improper issuance of securities. The guid ing intelligences necessary for the success ful building and successful management ot railroads should receive ample remunera tion; but no man should be allowed to make money in connection with railroads out of fraudulent over-capitalization and kindred stock-gambling performances: there must be no defrauding of investors, oppres sion of the farmers and business men who ship freight, or callous disregard of the rights and needs of the employes, in ad dition to tills the interests of the share holders, of the employes, and of the ship pers should all be guarded as against one another. To give any one of them undue and improper consideration is to do in justice to the others. Rates must be made ns low as is compatible with giving proper returns to all the employes of the railroad, from the highest to the lowest, and proper returns to the shareholders; but they must not, for instance, be reduced lu su< ii fash ion as to necessitate a cut in the wages of the employes or the abolitiou of the prop er and legitimate profits of honest share holders. Telegraph and telephone companies en gaged in interstate business should be put under the jurisdiction of the Interstate commerce commission. It is very earnestly to I>e wished that our people, through their representatives, should act in this matter. It is hard to say whether most damage to the country at large would come from entire failure on the part of ’he public to supervise and control the actions of the great corpora tions, or from tlie exercise of the necessary governmental power in a way which would do injustice and wrong to the corporations. Both the preachers of an unrestricted in dividualism. and the preachers of an op pression which would deny to able men of business the just reward of their initiative and business sagacity, are advocating pol icies that would be fraught with the grav est harm to the whole country. To per mit every lawless capitalist, every law defying corporation, to take auv action, m> matter how iniquitous, in the effort tp se cure an improper profit and to build up privilege, would be ruinous to the republic and would mark the abandonment of the effort to secure in the industrial world the spirit of democratic fair-dealing. On the other hand, to attack these wrongs in that spirit of demagogy which can see wrong only when committed by the man o: wealth, and Is dumb and blind in the pres ence cf wrong committed against men ot property or by men of no property, is ex actly as evil as corruptly to defend the wrongdoing of men of wealth. The war we wage must be waged against miscon duct. against wrongdoing wherever it is found; and we must stand heartily for the Tights of everj- decent man, whether he be a man of great wealth or a man who earns his livelihood as a wageworker or a tiller of the soil. It is to the interest of all of us that there should be a premium put upon individual initiative and individual capacity, and an ample reward for the great directing intel ligences alone competent to manage the great business operations of today. It Is well to keep in mind that exactly as the anarchist is the worst enemy of liberty and the reactionary the worst enemy of or der. so the men who defend the rights ot property have most to fear from the wrong doers of great w< alth, nr.'l the men who are ch: npiouing popular rights have most to fear from the demagogues who in the name of popular rights would do wrong to *nd oppr ss honest business men. honest men of wealth: for the success of either tvpe r wrongdoer necessarily invites a violent reaction against the cause the wrongdoer nominally upholds. In point of danger to the nation there is nothing to choose be tween on the one hand the corruptionist, the bribegiver, the bribe-taker, the man who employs his great talent to swindle his fellow-citizens on a large scale, and, on the other band, the preacher of class hatred, the man who. whether from ig norance or from willingness to sacrifice his country to his ambition, persuades well meaning but wrong-headed men to try to destroy the instruments upon which our prosperity mainly rests. Let each group of men beware of and guard against the shortcomings to which that group is Itself most liable. Too often we see the business community in a spirit of unhealthy class consciousness deplore tile effort to hold to account under the law the wealthy men who in their management of great corpor ations. whether railroads, street railways, or other Industrial enterprises, have be haved in a way that revolts the conscience of the plain, decent people. Such an atti tude cannot be condemned too severely, for men of property should recognize that they Jeopardize the rights of property when they fail heartily to join in the ef fort to do away with the abuses of wealth. On the other hand, those who advocate proper control on behalf of the public, through the state, of these great corpora tions and of the wealth engaged on a giant scale in business operations, must ever keep in mind that unless they do scrupulous justice to the corporation, un less they permit ample profit, and cordial ly encourage capable men of business so long as they act with honesty, they are striking at the root of our national well being; for in the long run. under the mere pressure of material distress, the people as a whole would probably go back to the reign of an unrestricted individualism rather than submit to a control by the state so drastic and so foolish, conceived in a spirit of such unreasonable and nar row hostility to wealth, as to prevent busi ness operations from being profitable, and therefore to bring ruin upon the entire business community, and ultimately upon the entire body of citizens. The opposition to government control of these great corporations makes its most effective effort in the shape of an appeal to the old doctrine of states’ rights. Of course there are many sincere men who now believe in unrestricted individualism in business, just as there were formerly many sincere men who believed in slavery -that Is, in the umestricted right of an In dividual to own another individual. These men do not by themselves have great weight, however. The effective tight against adequate government control and supervision of individual, and espe cially of corporate. wealth engaged in interstate business Is chiefly done under cover; and especially under cover of an ap peal to states’ rights. It is not at all in frequent to read in the same speech a de nunciation of predatory wealth fostered by special privilege and defiant of both the public welfare and law of the land, and a denunciation of centralization in the cen tra! government of the power to deal with this centralized and organized wealth. Of course the policy set forth in such twin denunciations amounts to absolutely noth ing. for the first half is nullified bv the second half. The chief reason, among the many sound and compelling reasons, that led to the formation of the national gov ernment, was the absolute need that the Vision, and not the several states, .should deal with Interstate and foreign commerce; and the power to deal with interstate com merce was granted absolutely and plcnarily to the central government and was exer cised completely as regards the q#>lv instru ments of interstate commerce known in those days—the waterways, the highroads, as well as the partnerships of individuals who thou conducted all of what business there was. Interstate commerce is now chieily conducted by railroads; and the great corporation has supplanted the mass or small partnerships or individuals. The proposal to make the national government supreme over, and therefore to give it complete eontro' over, the railroads and other instruments of interstate commerce is merely n proposal to carry out to the letter one of the prime purposes, if not the prime purpose, for which the constitution was founded. It does not represent cen tralization. It represents merely the ac knowledgment if the patent fact that centralization has already come In business. If this irresponsible outside business pow er is to be controlled in the interest of the general public it ran only he controlled in one way; by giving adequate power of con trol of the one so ereignty capable of ex ercising such power—the national govern ment. forty or tiftv separate state govern ments can not exercise that power over corporations doing business in most or all of them; first, because they absolutely lack the authority to deal with interstate busi ness in any form; and second, because of tlie inevitable conflict of authority sure to arise in the effort to mforee different kinds of state regulation, often inconsistent with one another and sometimes oppressive In themselves. Such divided authority can not regulate commerce with wisdom and effect. The central government Is the only power which, without oppression, can nev ertheless thoroughly and adequately con trol and supervise the large corporations. To abandon the effort for national control means to abandon the effort for all ade quate control and yet to render likely con tinual bursts of action by state Legisla ture's. which can not achieve the purpose sought for. but which can do a great deal of damage to the corporation without con ferring any real benefit on the public. 1 believe that the more farsighted cor porations arc themselves coining to recog nize the unwisdom of the violent hostility they have displayed during the last few years to regulation and control by the na tional government of combinations en gaged in Interstate business. The truth is that we who believe in tills movement of asserting and exorcising a genuine control, in the public Interest, over these great cor porations iave to contend against two sets of enemies, who, though nominally opposed to one another, are really allies in prevent ing a proper solution of the problem. There are. first, the big corporation men, and the extreme Individualists among business men, who genuinely believe in utterly un regulated business—that is, in the reign of plutocracy; and, second, the men who. be ing blind to the economic movements of tin' day believe in a movement of repres sion rather than of regulation of corpora tions, and who denounce both the power of the railroads and the exercise of the federal power which alone can rcaliv con trol the railroads. Those who believe In efficient national control, on the other hand, do not in the least object to combi nations; do not In tlie least object to concentration in business administration. On the contrary, they favor both, with the all Imuportant proviso that there shall be such publicity about their workings, and such thoroughgoing control over them, as to insure their being in the interest, and not against the interest, of the general public. We do not object to the concentra tion of wealth and administration; but wo do believe in the distribution of the wealth in profits to' the real owners, and in se curing to the public the full benefit of the concentrated administration. We believe that with concentration in administration there can come both the advantage of a larger ownership and of a more equitable distribution of profits, and at the same time a better service to the common wealth We believe that the administra tion should lie for the benefit of the many; and that greed and rascality, practiced on a large scale, should bo punished as re lentlessly as if practiced on a small scale. We do not for a moment believe that iae problem will be solved by any short and easy method. The solution will come only by pressing various concurrent remedies. Some of these remedies must lie outside the domain of all government. Some must lie outside the domain of the federal government. But there Is legislation which the federal government alone can enact and which is absolutely vital in order to secure the attainment of our purpose. Many laws are needed. There should be regulation by the national government of the great interstate corporations, including a simple method of account keeping, pub licity. supervision of the issue of securities, abolition of rebates and of special privi leges. There should be short time fran chises for all corporations engaged in pub -11 business; including the corporations which get power from water rights. There should be national ns well as state guardian ship of mines and forests. The labor legis lation hereinafter referred to should coa cvrrently be enacted into law. To accomplish this, means of course a cer tain increase in the use of—not the creation of —power, by the gentral government. The I-ower already exists; it does not have to oe < rested; the only question is whether it shall be used or left idle—and meanwhile t: ’ corporations over which the power ught to be exercised will not remain idle. I ■ r those who object to this Increase In the ■ ■of the only power available, the national power, be frank, and admit openly that they propose to abandon any effort to control the _i at business corporations and to exercise supervision over the accuintilntion and dis tribution, of wealth; for such supervision and control can only come through this particular kind of increase of power. We no more believe in that empiricism which remands absolutely unrestrained individual ism than we do in that empiricism which clamors for a deadening socialism which would destroy all individual initiative and would ruin the country with a complete ness that not oven an unrestrained individ ualism itself could achieve. The danger to American democracy lies not in the least in the concentration of administrative power in responsible .nd accountable hands. It lies in having the power insufficiently con c nti-ated. so that no one can be held re sponsible to.the people for its use. Concen trated power is palpable, visible, responsi ble, easily reached, quickly held to account. Power scattered through many admiuistra tors, many legislators, many men who work behind and through legislators and admin- istrators. is impalpable, is unseen, is irre sponsible, can not bn reached, can not be held to account. Den - icracy is in peril wherever the administration of political power Is scattered among a variety of men who work in aren't, whose very names are unknown to the common people. It is not in porit from any man who derives author ity from the people, who exercises it ill sight of the people, and who is from time to time compelled to give an account of its ex- rcise to the people. Labor. There are many matters affecting labor and the status of the wageworker to whlcn I should like to draw your attention, but an exhaustive discussion of tlie problem in all its aspects is not now necessary. This administration is nearing its end; and, moreover, under our form of government the solution of the problem depends upon the action of the states as much as upon the action of the nation. Nevertheless, there are certain considerations which 1 wish to set before you, because I hope that our people will more and more keep them in mind. A blind and ignorant resistance to every effort for the reform of abuses and for the readjustment of society to mod ern industrial conditions represents not true conservatism but an incitement to the wildest radicalism: for wise radicalism and wise conservatism go hand in hand, one bent on progress, the other bent on seeing that no change is made unless in the right direction. I believe in a steady effort, or perhaps it would be more accurate to say in steady efforts in many different direc tions. to bring about a condition of affairs under which the men who \j>>rk with hand or with brain, the laborers, the superin tendents, the men who produce for the market and the men who find a market for the articles produced, shall own a far greater share than at present of the wealth they produce, and be enabled to invest it in the tools and instruments by which all work Is carried on. As far as possible 1 hope to see a frank recognition of the ad vantages conferred by machinery, organiza tion, and division of labor, accompanied by an effort to tiring about a larger share lii the ownership of wageworker of railway, mill, and factory. In farming, this simply means that we wish to see the farmer own his own land; we do not wish to see the farms so large that they become the prop erty of absentee landlords who farm them by tenants, nor yet so small that the farm er becomes like a European peasant. Again, the depositors in our savings banks now number over one-tenth of our entire popu lation. These are all capitalists, who through the savings banks loan their mon ey to the workers—that is, in many cases to themselves—to carry on their various in dustries. The more we increase their num ber, the more we introduce the principles of co-operation into our industry. Every in crease in Hie number of small stockholders In corporations is a good thing, for the same reasons; and where the employes are the stockholders the result is particularly good. Very much of this movement must be outside of anything that <'an be accom plished by legislation; but legislation can do a good deal. Postal savings banks will make it easy for the poorest to keep their savings In absolute safety. The regulation of the national highways must be such that they shall serve all people with equal justice. Corporate finances must be super vised so as to make it far safer than at present for the man of small means to in vest his money in stocks. There must be prohibition of child labor, diminution ox woman labor, shortening of hours of all mechanical labor; stock watering should be prohibited, and stock gambling so far as is possible discouraged. There should be a progressive inheritance tax op large for tunes. Industrial education, should be en couraged. As far as possible we should lighten the burden of taxation on the small man. We should put a premium upon thrift, hard work, and business energy; but these qualities cease to lie the main factors in accumulating a fortune long be fore that fortune readies a point where it would be seriously affected by any inherit ance tax such as I propose. It is emi nently right that the nation should fix the terms upon which the great fortunes arc inherited. They rarely do good and they often do harm to those who inherit them in their entirety. Protection for Wageworkers. The above is the merest sketch, hardly even a sketch in outline, of the reforms for which we should work. But there Is one matter with which the Congress should deal at this session. There should no long er be any paltering with the question of taking care of the wageworkers who, un der our present industrial system, become killed, crippled, or worn out as part of the regular incidents of a given business. The majority of wageworkers must have their rights secured for them by state action; but the national government should legis late In thoroughgoing and far-reaching fash ion not only for all employes of the na tional government, but for all persons en gaged in interstate commerce. The object sought for could be achieved to a measur able degree, as far as those killed or crip pled are concerned, by proper employers' liability laws. As far as concerns those who have been worn out. I call your at tention to the fact that definite steps to ward providing old-age pensions have beeii taken in many of our private industries. Those may be indefinitely extended through voluntary association and contributory schemes, or through the agency of savings banks, as under the recent Massachusetts plan. To strengthen these practical meas ures should be our immediate duty; it is not at present necessary to consider the larger and more general governmental schemes that most European governments have found themselves obliged to adopt. Our present system, or rather no sys tem, works dreadful wrong, and is of bene fit to only one class of people—the lawyers. When a workman is injured what he needs is not an expensive and doubtful lawsuit, but the certainty of relief through imme diate administrative action. The number of accidents which result in the death or crippling of wageworkers, in the Union at large, is simply appalling; in a very few years it runs up a total far In excess of the aggregate of the dead and wounded in any modern war. No academic theory about “freedom of contract” or ‘‘constitu tional liberty to contract” should bo per mitted to interfere with this and similar movements. Progress in civilization has everywhere meant a limitation and regula tion of contract. I call your especial atten tion to the bulletin of the bureau of labor which gives a statement of the methods of treating the unemployed in European coun tries, as this is a subject which in Ger many, for instance, is treated In connec tion with making provision for worn out and crippled workmen. Pending a thoroughgoing investigation and action there is certain legislation which should be enacted at once. The law, passed at the last session of the Congress, granting compensation to certain classes of employes of the government, should be ex tended to include all employes of the gov ernment and should lie made more liberal in its terms. There Is no good ground for the distinction nnuje in the law between those engaged in hazardous occupations and those not so engaged. If a man Is injured or killed in any line of work, it was hazardous in his case. Whether 1 per cent, or 10 per cent, of those following a given occupation actually suffer injury or death ought not to have any bearing on the question of their receiving compensa tion. It is a grim logic which says to an injured employe or to the dependents of one killed that he or they are entitled to no compensation because very few people other than he have been injured or killed In that occupation. Perhaps one of the most striking omissions in the law Is that it does not embrace peace officers and others whose lives may be sacrificed in enforcing the laws of the United States. The terms of the act providing compensation should be made more liberal than in the present act. A year’s compensation is not adequate for a wage-earner’s family in the event of his death by accident in the course of his employment. And in the event of death occurring, say, ten or eleven months after the accident, the family would only re ceive as compensation the equivalent of one or two mouths’ earnings. In this re spect the generosity of the United States toward its employes compares unfavorably with that of every country in Europe—even the poorest. The terms of the act are also a hard ship in prohibiting payment In cases where the accident is in any way due to the negligence of the employe. It is in evitable that dally familiarity with dan ger will lead men to take chances that can be construed into negligence. So well is this recognized that in practically all countries in the civilized world, except the United States, only a great degree of neg ligence acts as a bar to securing compen sation. Probably in no other respect is our legislation, both state and national, so far behind practically the entire civilized world as In the matter of liability and com pensation for accidents in Industry. It is humiliating that at European international congresses on accidents the United States should i>e singled out as the most belated among the nations in respect to employers’ liability legislation. This government is Itself a large employer of labor, and in its dealings with its employes it should sot a standard in this country which would place it on a par with the most progressive countries in Europe. The laws of the United States in this respect and the laws of European countries have been sum marized in a recent bulletin of the bureau of labor, and no American who reads this summary can fail to be struck by tne great contrast between onr practices and theirs —a contrast not in any sense to our credit. The Congress should without further de lay pass a model employers’ liability law for the District of Columbia. The employ ers' liability act recently declared uncon stitutional. on acco’-..t of apparently In cluding in its provisions employes engaged in intrastate commerce as well as those engaged la interstate commerce, has been held by the local courts to bo still in ef | feet so far as its provisions apply to the I District of Columbia. There should be no i ambiguity on this point. If there is any doubt on the subject, the law should he | re-enacted with special reference to the District of Columbia. This act, however. 1 applies only to employes of common car i riers. In all other occupations the liability law of the is the old common law. The severity and injustice of the common law in this matter has been in some de gree or another modified in the majority of our states, and the only jurisdiction under the exclusive control of the Congress should be ahead and nor behind th“ states of the union in tuis respect. A compre hensive employers’ llahilitv law should be passed for the District of Columbia. 1 renew my recommendation made in a previous message that half holidays be granted during summer to all wagework ers in government employ. I also renew my recommendation that the principle of (he eighbhonr dav should as rapidly and as far as practicable be extend ed to the entire work being carried on by tile governmint; the present law should he amended to embrace contracts on those pub i lie works which the present wording of the j act seems to exclude. The Courts. 1 most earnestly urge upon the Congress tin* duty of increasing the totally inade quate salaries now given to onr judges. On the whole there is no body of public serv ants who do as vain a tile work, nor whose moneyed reward is so inadequate compared to their work. Beginning with the supreme I court the judges should have their salaries I doubled. It Is not befitting the dignity of I the nation that its most honored public servants should he paid sums so small com pared to what they would earn in private life that the performance of public service by them implies an exceedingly heavy pe cuniary sacrifice. It is earnestly to he desired that some method should be devised for doing away with the long delays which now obtain in tin l administration of justice, and which operate with peculiar severity against per sons of small means, and favor only the verv criminals whom it is most desirable to punish. These long delays in the finai decisions of cases make in the aggregate a crying evil; and a remedy should iio de vised. Mm'h of this intolerable delay Is due to improper regard paid ro technicalities which are a mere hindrance to justice. In sonic noted recent cases this over-regard for technicalities has resulted in a striking de nial of justice, and llagraut wrong to the body politic. At the last election certain leaders of organized labor made a violent and sweep ing attack upon the entire judiciary of the country, an attack couched in such terms as to include the most upright, honest aud broad-minded judges, no less than those of j narrower mind and more restricted outlook. ! It was the kind of attack admirably fitted to prevent any successful attempt to*reform | abuses of the judiciary, because it gave the ; champions of the unjust judge their eagerly i desired opportunity to shift their ground j into a championship of just judges who wore unjustly assailed. Last year, before the House committee on tiie judiciary, these same 1; bor leaders formulated their de mands, specifying the bill that contained them, refusing all compromise, stating they wished the principle of that hill or nothing. They insisted on a provision that in a labor dispute no Injunction should Jssu:- except to protect a property fight, ‘alia spe cifically provided that the right to carry on business should not tie construed as a property right: and in a second provision their bill made legal in a labor dispute any act or agreement by or between two or more persons that would not have been unlawful if done by a single person. In other words, this bill legalized blacklisting and boycotting in every form, legalizing, j for instance, those forms of the secondary boycott which the anthracite coal strike I commission so unreservedly condemned: ! while the fight to carry on a business was j explicitly taken out from under that pro ! tection which the law thrives over proper i ty. The demand was made that there ; should be trial by jury in contempt cases, | thereby most seriously impairing the au j thority of tjie courts, ’ All this represented a course of policy which, if carried out, would mean the - enthronement of class privilege in its crudest and most brutal form, and the destruction of one of the most essential functions of the judiciary in all civilized lands. The violence of the crusade for this legis lation, and its complete failure, illustrate two truths which it is essential our people 1 should learn. ’ In the first place, they ought ! to teach the workingman, the laborer, the I wageworker, that by demanding what is improper and impossible he plays into the hands of his foes. Such a crude and vi cious attack upon the courts, even if it were temporarily successful, would inevitably in the end cause a violent reaction and would band the great mass of citizens together, forcing them to stand by all the judges, competent and incompetent alike, rather than to see the wheels of justice stopped. A movement of this kind can ultimately rt suit in nothing but damage to those in whose behalf it is nominally undertaken. This is a most healthy trutn, which it Is wise for all our people to learn. Any movement based on that class hatred which at times assumes the name of “class con sciousness” is certain ultimately to fail, and if it temporarily succeeds, to do far-reach ing damage. “Class consciousness,” where It "is nTSgely another name for the odious vice of class selfishness, is equally noxious whether in an employer's association or in a workingman’s association. The move ment In question was one in which the ap peal was made to all workingmen to vote primarily, not as American citizens, hut as individuals of a certain class ii society. Such an appeal in the first place revolts the more high-minded aud fi.r-slghtecl among the persons to whom it is ad dressed, and in the second place tends to arouse a strong antagonism among ai! oth er classes of citizens, whom it therefore tends to unite against the very organization on whose behalf it is issued. The resul. is therefore unfortunate from every stand point. This healthy truth, by the way, will be learned by the Socialists if they ever succeed in establishing in this country an important national party based on such class consciousness and selfish class inter est. The wageworkers, the workingmen, the laboring men of the country by the way in which they repudiated the effort to get them to cast their votes in response to an appeal to class hatred, have emphasized their sound patriotism and Americanism. The whole country has cause to feel prido in this attitude of sturdy independence, in this uncompromising insistence upon acting simply as good citizens, as good Americans, without regard to fancied—and improper class interests. Such an attitude is an ob ject lesson in good citizenship to the en tire nation. But the extreme reactionaries, the per sons who blind themselves to the wrongs now and then committed by the courts or, laboring men, should also think seriously as to what such a movement as this por tends. The judges who have shown them selves able and willing effectively to check the dishonest activity of the very rich man who works Iniquity by the mismanagement of corporations, who have shown them selves alert to do justice to the wagework er, and sympathetic with the need/, of the mass of our people, so that the dweller In the tenement houses, the man who prac tices a dangerous trade, the man who is crushed by excessive hours of labor, feel that their needs are understood by the courts —these judges are the real bulwark of the courts; these judges, the judges of the stamp of the President-elect, who have been fearless in opposing labor when it has gone wrong, but fearless also In hold ing to strict account corporations that work iniquity, and far-sighted In seeing that the workingman gets his rights, are the men of all others to whom we owe it that the appeal for such violent and mistaken legislation has fallen on deaf ears, that the agitation for its passage proved to be with out substantial basis. The courts are Jeoparded primarily by the action of these federal and state judges who show In ability or unwillingness to put a stop t the wrongdoing of very rich men under modern industrial conditions, and Inability or unwillingness to give relief to men of small means or wageworkers who are crushed down by these modern industrial conditions: who, In other words, fail to understand and apply the needed remedies for the new wrongs produced by the new and highly complex social and industrial* civilization which has grown up in the last half century. The rapid changes In our social and in dustrial life which have attended this rap id growth have made it necessary that, in applying to concrete cases the great rule of right laid down in our constitu tion, there should be a full under standing and appreciation of the new conditions to which the yules are to he applied. What would have been an in fringement upon liberty half a century ago may be the necessary * safeguard of liberty today. What would have been an injury to property then may be necessary to the en joyment of property now. Every judicial decision involves two terms —one, an inter pretation. of the law; the other, the un derstanding of the facts to which it is to be applied. The great mass of our judicial officers are 1 believe alive to these changes of conditions which so materially affect the performance of their judicial duties. Our judicial system is sound aud effective at core, and it remains, and must ever be maintained, as the safeguard of those prin ciples of liberty and justice which staqd at the foundation of American institutions; for, as Burke finely said, when liberty and justice are separated, neither is saffe. There are, however, some members of the judicial body who have lagged behind In their understanding of these great and vi tal changes In the body politic, Vhose minds have never been opened to the new applications of the old principles made necessary by the new conditions. Judges of this stamp do lasting harm by their de- cislons. because they convince poor men in need of protection that the courts of the land arc profoundly ignorant of and out of sympathy with their needs, and profoundly indifferent or hostile to any proposed rem edy. To such men it seems a cruel mock ery to have any court decide against them on the ground that it desires to preserve “liberty" in a purely technical form, by withholding liberty in any real and con structive sense. It is desirable that the legislative body should possess, and wher ever necessary exercise, the power to de- I termine whether in a given case employ j ers and employes are not on an equal foot j ing. so that the necessities of the latter ; compel them to submit to such exactions j as to hours and conditions of labor as mi i duly to tax their strength: and only mis chief can resu't when such determination is upset on the ground that there must he no “interference with the liberty to con tract” often a merely academic “liberty,” the exercise of which is the negation of real liberty. There are certain decisions by various courts which have been exceedingly detri mental to the rights of wageworkers. This j Is true of all the decisions that decide that , men and women arc. by th<> constitution, j "guaranteed their liberty" to contract to enter a dangerous occupation, or to work an undesirable or improper number of i hours, or to work in unhealthy sumrnnd i ings; and therefore cannot recover dam- I ages when maimed in that occupation, and ! can not he forbidden to work what the j Legislature decides is an excessive | number of hours, or to carry on the work j tinder conditions which the Legislature de cides to he unhealthy. The most dangerous occupations arc often the poorest pad and those where the hours of work are longest; and in jnanv cases those who go into them are driven by necessity so great that they have practically no alternative. Decisions such as those alluded to above nullify the legislative effort to protect the wagework ers who most need protection from those employers who take advantage of their grinding need. They halt or hamper the movement for securing better and more equitable conditions of labor. The talk about preserving to the misery-hunted be ings who make contracts for such service their “liberty" to make them, is either to speak in a spirit of heartless irony or else to show an utter lack of knowledge of the conditions of life among the gU-at masses of our fellow-countrymen, a lack which un fits a judge to do good service just as it would unfit any executive or legislative i officer. | There is also. 1 think, ground for the be- I lief that substantial injustice is often suf fered by employes in consequence of the custom of courts issuing temporary injunc tions without notice to them, and punish ing them for contempt of court in Instances where, as a matter of fact, they have no knowledge of any proceedings. Outside of organized labor there is a widespread feel ing that this system often works great in justice to wageworkers when their efforts to better their working condition result in : industrial disputes. A temporary Injunction I procured cx parte may as a matter of fact i cave all the effect of a permanent injunc | tion in causing disaster to the wagework ers' side in such a dispute. Organized labor is chafing under the unjust restraint which comes from repeated resort to this plan of procedure. Its discontent has boon unwise ly expressed, and often improperly ex pressed, but there is a sound basis for it. ju'd the,orderly and law-abiding people of a corammiTfy would be in a far stronger posi tion for upholding the courts if the un doubtedly existing abuses could he provided against. Such proposals as those mentioned above as advocated by the extreme labor leaders, contain the vital error of being class legis lation of the most offensive kind, and even if enacted into law I believe that the law would rightly he held unconstitutional. Moreover, the labor people are themselves now beginning to invoke the use of the power of Injunction. During the last ten years, and within my own ,ai iwlcdgo. at least fifty injunctions have ’ en obtained by labor unions in New York city alone, most of them being to pro tect the union label (a “property right"), but some being obtained fc- other reasons against employers. The power of injunction is a great equitable remedy, which should on no account be de stroyed. But safeguards should bo erected against its abuse. I believe that some such provisions as those I advocated a year ago for checking the abuse of the issuance of temporary injunctions should be adopt ed. In substance, provision should be I made that no injunction or temporary re straining order issue otherwise than on notice, except where irreparable injury would otherwise result; and in such case k hearing on the merits of the order should be had within a short fixed period, and. if not then continued after hearing, it should forthwith lapse. Decisions should be ren dered immediately, find the chance of de lay minimized in every way. Moreover, I believe that the procedure should be sharp ly defined, and the judge required minute ly to state the particulars both of his ac tion and of his reasons therefor, so that the Congress can if it desires examine and investigate the same. The chief lawmakers in onr country may be, and often are, the judges, because they are the final seat of authority. Every time they interpret contract, property, vested rights, due process of law, liberty, they necessarily enact into law parts of a sys tem of social philosophy; and as such in terpretation Is fundamental, they give di rection to all law-making. The decisions of the courts on economic and social ques tions depend upon their economic and so cial philosophy; and for the peaceful prog ress of our people during the Twentieth Century we shall owe most to those judges who hold to a Twentieth Century economic j and social philosophy and not to a long I outgrown philosophy, which was itself L_.e product of primitive economic conditions. Of course a judge’s views on progressive social philosophy are entirely second in importance to his possession of a high and tine character; which means the pos session of such elementary virtues as hon esty, courage, and falrmindedness. The judge who owes his election to pandering to demagogic sentiments or class hatreds and prejudices, and the Judge who owes either his election or his appointment to the money or the favor of a great corpora tion, are alike unworthy to sit on the bench, are alike traitors to the people; and no profundity of legal learning, or cor rectness of abstract conviction on ques tions of public policy, can serve as an off set to such shortcomings. Bqt it is also true that judges, like executives and legis lators, should hold sound views on the questions of public policy which are of vital interest to the people. The legislators and executives are chosen to represent the people in enacting and administering the laws. The judges are not chosen to rep resent the people in this sense. Their function is to interpret the laws. The leg islators are responsible for the laws; the judges for the spirit in which they interpret and enforce the laws. We stand aloof from the reckless agitators who would make the judges mere pliant tools of popular prej udice and passion; and we stand aloof from those equally unwise partisans of re action and privilege who deny the proposi tion that, inasmuch as judges are chosen to serve the interests of the whole people, they should strive to find out what those inter ests are, and, so far as they conscientiously can, should strive to give effect to popular conviction when deliberately and duly ex pressed by the lawmaking body. The courts are to be highly commended and staunchly upheld when they set their faces against wrongdoing or tyranny by a majority; but they are to be blamed when they fail to recognize under a government like ours the deliberate judgment of the majority as to a matter of legitimate policy, when duly ex pressed by the Legislature. Such lawfully expressed and deliberate judgment should be given effect by the courts, save in the extreme and exceptional cases where there has been a clear violation of a constitutional provision. Anything like frivolity or wan tonness in upsetting such clearly taken gov ernmental action is a grave offense against the republic. To protest against tyranny, to protect minorities from oppression, to nullify an act committed in a spasm of popular fury, is to render a service to the republic. But for the courts to arrogate to themselves functions which properly belong to the legislative bodies Is all wrong, and ia the end works mischief. The people should not be permitted to pardon evil and slipshod legislation on the theory that the court will set it right; they should be taught that the right way to get rid of a bad law is to have the Legislature repeal it, aud not to have the courts by Ingenious hair-splitting nullify it. ai law may be unwise and Im proper; but it should not for these reasons be declared unconstitutional by a strained interpretation, for the result of such ac tion is to take away from the people at large their sense of responsibility and ul timately to destroy their capacity for order ly self restraint and self-government. Un der such a popular government as ours, founded on the theory that in the long run the will of the people is supreme, the ulti mate safety of the nation can only rest ia training and guiding the people so that what tney will shall be right, and not devising means to defeat their will by the technicalities of strained construction. For many of the shortcomings of Justice in our country our people as a whole are them selves to blame, and the judges and juries merely bear their share together with the public as a whole. It Is discreditable to us as a people that there should be difficulty In convicting murderers, or in bringing to justice men who as public servants have bOen guilty of corruption, hr who have profited by the corruption of public ser vants. The result is equally unfortunate, whether due to hairsplitting technicalities In the interpretation of laws by judges, to sentimentality and class consciousness on the part of juries, or to hysteria and sen sationalism in the daily press. For much of this failure of justice no responsibility whatever lies on rich men as such. We who make up the mass of the people can not shift the responsibility from our own I shoulders. But there is an important part 1 of the failure which has specially to do with inability to hold to proper "account ! men of wealth who behave badly. i The chief breakdown is in dealing witn i the new relations that arise from the mu tualism, the Interdependence of our time, i Every new social relation begets anew j type of wrongdoing—of sin. t,> use an old fashioned word—and many years always elapse before society is aide to turn this I si;: into crime which can l>c effectively pun i ished at law. During the lifetime of ill? i older men now alive the social relations j have changed far more rapidly than in the : preceding two centuries. The immense ! growth of corporations, of business done by associations, and the extreme strain and pressure of modern life, have produced | conditions which render the public eon | fused as to who its really dangerous foes are: and among the public servants who ■ have not only shared this confusion, but : by some of their acts have increased it. 1 are certain judges. Marked inefficiency has been shown in dealing with corpora tions and in re-settling the proper atti tude to be taken by the public not only towards corporations, but towards labor, and towards the social questions arising out of the factory system, and the enor mens growth of our great cities. The huge wealth that has been accumu lated by a few individuals of recent years, in what has amounted to a social and in dustrial revolution, has been as regards some of these individuals made possible only by the improper use of the modern corporation. A certain type of modern corporation, with 1 s officers and agents, Its many issues of securities, and its con stant consolidation with allied undertak ings. finally becomes an instrument so complex as to contain a greater number of elements that, under various Judicial de cisions. lend themselves to fraud and op pression than any device yet evolved in the human brain Corporations are neces sary instruments of modern busi ness. They have been permitted to become a menace largely because the gov ernmental representatives of the people have worked slowly in providing for ade quate control over them. The chief offender in any given case may be an executive, a legislature, or a judge. Every executive head who advises violent, Instead of gradual, action, or who advocates ill-considered and sweeping measures of re form (especially if they are tainted with vindictiveness, and disregard for the rights of the minority) is particularly blame worthy. The several legislatures are re sponsible for the fact that our laws are often prepared with slovenly haste and lack of consideration. Moreover, they are often prepared, and still more frequently amended during passage, at the suggestion of the very parties against whom they are afterwards enforced. Our great clusters of corporations, huge trusts and fabulously wealthy multimillionaires, employ the very best lawyers they can obtain to pick flaws in these statutes after their passage; but they also employ a class of secret agents who seek, under the advice of experts, to render hostile legislation innocuous by mak ing it unconstitutional, often through the insertion of what appear on their face to be drastic and sweeping provisions against the interests of the parties inspiring them: while the demagogues, the corrupt creatures who introduce blackmailing schemes to “strike” corporations, and all who demand extreme, and undesirably radical, measures, show themselves to be the worst enemies of the very public whose loud-monthed cham pions they profess to he. Avery striking illustration of the consequences of careless ness in the preparation of a statute was the employers’ liability law of 190(5. In tin cases "arising under that law, four out of six courts of first instance held it uncon stitutional; six out of nine Justices of the supreme court held that its subject-matter was within the province of congressiona’ action; and four of the nine justices held it valid. It was, however, adjudged micon stitutional by a bare majority of the court — five to four." It was surely a very slovenly piece of work to frame the legislation in such shape as to leave the question open at all. Real damage has been done by the inanl fo'd and conflicting interpretations of the interstate commerce law. Control over tin great corporations doing interstate business can bo effective only if it is vested with full power in an administrative department, a branch of the federal executive, carrying out a federal law: it can never be effective if a divided responsibility is left in both the states and the nation; it can never be effective if left *n the hands of the courts to 1)0 decided by lawsuits. The courts hold a place of peculiar and deserved sanctity under our form of gov ernment. Respect for the law is essential to the permanence of onr institutions; and respect for the law is largely conditioned upon respect for the courts. It is an of fense agtiinst the republic to say anytb’ng which can weaken this respect, save for the gravest reason and in the most care fully guarded manner. Our judges should be held in peculiar honor; and the duty of respectful and truthful comment and criti cism, which should be binding when we speak of anybody, should be especially binding when we speak of them. On an average they stand above any other serv ants of the community, and the greatest judges have reached the highest level held by those few greatest patriots whom the whole country delights to honor. But we must face the fact that there are wise and unwise* judges, just as there arc wise and unwise executives and legislators. When a President or a governor behaves improper ly or unwisely, the remedy is easy, for his term is short; the same is true with the legislator, although not to the same de gree, for he is one of many who belong to some given legislative body, and it Is therefore less easy to fix his personal re sponsibility and hold him accountable therefor. With a judge, who, being hu man, is also likely to err, hut whose tenure is for life, there is no similar way of hold ing him to responsibility. Under ordinary conditions the only forms of pressure to whch he is in any way amenable are pub lic opinion, and the action of his fellow judges. It Is the last which is most im mediately effective, and to which wo should look for the reform of abuses. Any rem edy applied from without Is fraught with risk. It is far better, from every stand point. that the remedy should come from within. In no other nation in the world do the courts wield such vast and far reaching power as in the United States. All that Is necessary is that the courts as a whole should exercise this power with the farsighted wisdom already shown by those judges who scan the future while they act In the present. Lot them exercise this groat power not only honestly and bravely, but with wise Insight into the needs and fixed purposes of the people so that they may protect all persons in their rights, and yet break down the barriers of privilege, which is the foe of right. Postal Savings Banks. I again renew my recommendation for postal savings banks, for depositing sav ings with the security of the Government behind them. The object is to encourage thrift and economy in the wage-earner and person of moderate means. In fourteen states the deposits in savings banks as re ported to the comptroller of the currency amount to .$3,590,245,402, or 98.4 per cent of the entire deposits, while in the remain ing 32 states there are only $70,308,543, or 1.6 per cent, showing conclusively that there are many localities in the United States where sufficient oportunity is not given to the people to deposit their savings. Th result Is that money is kept in hiding and unemployed. It Is believed that in the aggregate vast sums of money would be brought Into circulation through the instru mentality of the postal savings bank. While there are only 1,453 savings banks report ing to the comptroller there are more than 61,000 postofflees, 40,000 of which are money order offices. Postal savings banks are now in operation in pract’cally all the great civilized countries with the exception of the United States. Parcel Post. In my last annual message I commended the postmaster general’s recommendation for an extension of the parcel post on the rural routes. The establishment of a local parcel post on rural routes would be to the mutual benefit of the farmer and the coun try storekeeper, and it is desirable that the routes, serving more than 15,080.000 people, should be utilized to the fullest practicable extent. An amendment was proposed in the Senate at the last session, at the sug gestion of the postmaster general, provid ing that, for the purpose of ascertaining the practiCdbtltty of establishing a special local parcel post system on the rural routes throughout the United States, the postmas ter general be authorized and directed to experiment and report to the Congress the result of such experiment by establishing a special local parcel post system on rural delivery routes in not to exceed fonr coun ties in the United States for packages of fourth-class matter originating on a rural route or at the distributing pojtofflce for delivery by rural carriers, it would seem only proper that such an experiment should be tried In order to demonstrate the prac ticability of the proposition, especially as the postmaster general estimates that the revenue derived from the operation of such a system on all the rural routes '"ould amount to many million dollars. Hawaii. I call particular atention to the Territory of Hawaii. The importance of those Islands Is apparent, and the need of improving their condition and developing their re sources is urgent. In recent years indus trial conditions upon the islands have radi cally changed. The importation of coolie ms practically ceased, and there is now developing such a diversity in agricul tural products as to make possible a change in the land conditions of the .erritory, ; o that an opportunity may be given to the small land owner similar to that on the mainland. To aid those changes, the na tional government must provide the neces sary huroor Improvements on each Isi-.nd so (hat the agricultural products can “be carried to the markets of the world The coastwise shipping needs of the islands and the alien contracts la.K>r law should’ he so modified In its application to Haws' as to enable American and European to be brought thither. ‘“ oor : We have begun to Improve Pearl Harbor for a naval base and to provia* the nec s l sary military fortifications for the protec i tlon of the islands, but I can not too strongly emphasize the need of appropria- Uons for these purposes of such an amount as will within the shortest possible time make those Islands practically Impregnable. It is useless to develop the industrial con ditions of the Islands and establish there bases of supply for our naval and mer chant fleets unless wo Insure, as far as human ingenuity can, their safety from foreign seizure. One thing to he remembered with all our fortifications Is that it Is almost useless to make them impregnable from the sea if they are left open to lan.l attack. This | Is true even of our own coast, but it is doubly true of our Insular possessions. In Hawaii, for instance, it is worse than use less to establish a naval station unless we establish u behind fortifications so strong that no landing force can take them save bv regular and long-continued siege opera tions. The Philippines. Real progress toward self-government Is being made In the Philippine islands The gathering of a Philippine legislative body and I hlllpplne assembly marks a process absolutely new In Asia, not only as regards Asiatic colonies of European powers but as regards Asiatic possessions of other Asiatic powers -and, Indeed, always excepting the striking and wonderful example afforded bv the great Empire of Japan, it opens an entirely new departure when compared with anything which has happened among Asiatic powers which are their own mas" tors. Hitherto this Philippine legislature has acted with moderation and seif restraint, and has seemed in practical fashion to realize the eternal truth that there must always he government, and that the only way in which any body of indi viduals can escape the necessity of being governed by outsiders Is to show that they are able to restrain themselves, to keep down wrongdoing and disorder. The Fili pino people, turough their officials, are therefore making real steps In the direct ion of self-government. I hope and believe that these steps mark the beginning of a course which will continue till the Filipinos be come tit to decide for themselves whether they desire to be an Independent nation. Hut it is well for them (and well also for those Americans who during the past decade have done so much damage to the Filipinos by agitation for an immediate independence for which they were totally unlit) to re member that self-government depends, and must depend, upon the Filipinos themselves. All we can do is to give them the oppor tunity to develop the capacity for self government. If we had followed the ad vice of the foolisli doctrinaires who wished us at any time during the last ten years to turn the Filipino people adrift", we should have shirked the plainest possible duty and have Inflicted a lasting wrong upon the Fllpino people. We have acted in exactly the opposite spirit. We have given the Filipinos constitutional govern ment; a government based upon Justice; and we have shown that we have governed them for their good and not for our ag grandizement. At the present time, as dur ing the past ten years, the inexorable logic of facts shows that this government must he supplied by us and not by them. We must be wise and generous; we must help the Filipinos to master the difficult art of self-control, which Is simply another name for self-government. But we can not give them self-government save in the sense of governing them so that gradually they may, if they are able, learn to govern themselves. Under the present system of just laws and sympathetic administration, we have every reason to believe that they are gradually acquiring tin* character which lies at Hie basis of self-government, and for which* If it be lacking, no system of laws, no paper constitution, will in any wise serve as a substitute. Our people In the Philippines have achieved what may legitimately be called a marvelous success in giving to them a government which marks on the pa r t of those in authority both the neces sary understanding of the people and the necessary purpose to serve them disinter estedly and In good faith. I trust that within a generation the time will arrive when the Philippines can decide for them selves whether It is well for them to be come independent, or to continue under the protection of a strong and disinterested power, able to guarantee to the Islands order at home and protection from foreign Invasion. But, not one can prophesy the exact date when it will be wise to consider independence as a fixed and definite policy. It would l)e worse than folly to try to set down such a date in advance, for it must depend upon the way in which the Philip pine people themselves develop the power of self-mastery. Porto Rico. I again recommend that American citi zenship he conferred upon the people of Porto Ulco. Cuba. In Cuba our occupancy will cense in about, two months’ time; the Cubans have in orderly manner elected their own govern mental authorities, and the island will Ho turned over to them. Our occupation on this occasion has lasted a little over two years, and Cuba has thriven and prospered under it. Our earnest hope and one desire is that the people of the island shall now govern themselves with Justice, so that peace and order may lie secure. We will gladly help them to this end ; but 1 would solemnly warn them to remember the great truth that the only way a people can per manently avoid being governed from with out is to show that they both can and will govern themselves from within. National Guard. Now that the organized militia, the Na tional Guard, has been incorporated with the army as a part of the national forces, it behooves the government to do every rea sonable thing in its power to perfect its efficiency. It should he assisted in its in struction and otherwise aided more liberally than heretofore. The continuous services of many well-trained regular officers will be essential in this connection. Such officers must be specially trained at service schools best to qualify them as instructors of the National Guard. But the detailing of offi cers for training at the service schools and for duty with the National Guard entails detaching them from their regiments which are already greatly depicted by detachment of officers for assignment to duties pre scribed by acts of the Congress. A bill is now pending before the Congress creating a number of extra officers in the army, which if passed, as it ought to be, will enable more officers to be trained as instructors of National Guard and assigned to that duty. In case of war it will be of the utmost importance to have a large num ber of trained officers to use for turning raw levies into good troops. There should be legislation to provide a complete plan for organizing the great body of volunteers behind the regular army and national guard when war has come. Con gressional assistance should be given those who are endeavoring to promote rifle prac tice so that our men, in the services or out of them, may know how to use the rifle. While teams representing the United States won the rifle and revolver championships of the world against all comers in England this year, It is unfortunately true that the great body of our citizens shoot less and less as time goes on. To meet this we should encourage rifle practice among schoolboys, and indeed among all classes, as well as in the military services, by every means in our power. Thus, and not other wise, may we he able to assist in preserving the peace of the world. Fit to hold our own against the strong nations of the earth, our voice for peace will carry to the ends of the earth. Unprepared, and there fore unfit, we must sit dumb and helpless to defend ourselves, protect others, or preserve peace. The first step—-in the direction of preparation to avert war if possible, and to be fit for war if It should come—is to teach our men to shoot. Census. I strongly urge that the request of the director of the census in connection with the decennial work so soon to be begun, be complied with and that the appoint ments to the census force be placed under the civil service law, waiving the geo graphical requirements as requested by the director of the census. The supervisors and enumerators should not be appointed under the civil service law, for the reasons given by the director. I commend to the Congress the careful consideration of the admirable report of the director of the census, and I trust that his recommenda tions will be adopted and Immediate action thereon taken. Panama Canal. The work on the Panama Canal is being done with a speed, efficiency and entire de votion to duty, which make it a model for all work of the kind. No task of such magnitude has ever before been undertaken by any nation; and no task of the kind has ever been better performed. The men on the Isthmus, from Colonel Goethals and his fellow commissioners through the entire list of employees who are faithfully doing their duty, have won their right to the un gruding respect and gratitude of the Ameri can people.
