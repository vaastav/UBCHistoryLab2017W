TELEPHONES 47 and 90 Railroad Avenue Colfax, La. Opposite Court House The President's Message. President Wilson read his mes sage to Congress which assem bled last Monday. Every avail able seat and space on the floor of the House was occupied, a, Mr. Wdson appeared in persdc before a joint session of -bothl houses of Congress, while the galleries were packed with visi tors. We give a synopsis of the 'President's message, as follows: The session upon which you are now entering will be the closing session of the Sixty-third Congress, a Congress, I venture to say, which will long be remem bered for the great body of thoughtful and constructive work which it has done, in loyal re sponse to the thought and needs of the country. I should like in this address to review the nota ble record and try to make ade quate assessment of it; but no doubt we stand too near the wvrk that has been done and are ourselves too much a part of it to play the part of historians to ward it. "Markets of Central and South America can be turned to the United States and what interests us now is our duty and oppor tunity. "We have grossly erred in the way in which we have stunted and hindered the development of our merchant marine. The time and circumstances are ex traordinary and so must our ef forts be also. "Safeguard the resources of the national domain and encour age the? use of the navigable waters outside that domain for the generation of power. "A larger measure of self-gov ernment to the people of the Philippines. TIhe passage of this bill will nobly crown the record of these two years of memorable labor. ,"Open the gates of trade to *k he anited States by passage of S hi ll pending in both louses. It is not a question of :he government monopolizingI ,he field, but providing means of raining trade. "Show good faith in adopting the rural credits bill, already rati tied by Great Britain and Ger many. "Provide means for charting and surveying the coasts of the United States and Alaska, there by conserving lives and shipping. "Provide for economy in public expenditures. - The duty is mani fest and imperative. "As to national defense, the policy of the United States is set tled against a large standing ar my. A nation of peace has no need to be alarmed by sensation alists. We shall not turn Ameri ca into a military camp. Con gress should encourage military training in schools. The nation al guard should be developed and strengthened. The country has been misinformed as to the mat ter of the nation's defenses. The United States has not been neg ligent. A powerful navy we have al ways regarded as our proper and natural means of defense; and it has always been of defense that we have thought, never of ag gressiveness or of conquest. But who shall tell us now what sort of navy to build? We shall take leave to be strong upon the seas, in the future as in the past; and there will be no thought of of fense or provocation in that. Our ships are our natural bulwarks. When will the experts tell us just i,iht kind we shall construct and whien will they be right for ten years together, if the rela tive efficiency of craft of differ ent kinds and uses continues to shange as we have seen it change irder our very eyes in these last few months? "Great tasks of and duties of ieace challenge our best powers md invite us to build what will a!st with all the finest gifts of constructive wisdom we pos "The Ideal Catalogue." A librarian's idea of the most useful form of catalogue for a library is gives as follows: "The ideal catalogue for a public It brary is one published with one line entries, each being about twice as long as the average newspaper Column is wide. This catalogue is published in the for m of a newspaper, on cheap paper, cheaply printed. It is sold by the library at about two cents a copy. The copies sold are soon worn out or thrown away and do not conde back in after years to vex the librar1 ian. The library keeps the whole thing in type, takes out some titles ev ery month, adds hew ones, and prints a new edition. This catalogue con tains author entries only. If a man wishes to know anything about the books in the public library that this catalogue does not tell he goes to the library and finds out by asking; if he wishes information concerning books on a certain subject he goes to a bibli ography of that subject; if he wishes to know certain specific things about certain books he asks to see the books themselves." Old Sayings About the Weather. If it thunders on Sunday, the death of a great man will follow; on Mon day, the death of a woman is portend ed; on Tuesday in early summer, an abundance of grain; on Wednesday, warfare is threatened; on Thursday, an abundance of both sheep and of corn; on Friday, a man of note will be murdered, and on Saturday, there will be a pestilence or some other great disaster. Truly, thunder is sa ill-omened visi tor at the best! If the full moon should rise red, ex pect wind. The sharper the blast, the sooner 'tis past. A light, yellow sky at sunset fore tells a windstorm. Three foggy mornings in succession mean rain. A sky full of stars predicts .rain. Look Ahead. There are some people who ride all througn the journey of life with their backs to the horses' heads. They are always looking into the past. They are forever talking snout the good old times, and how different things were when they were young. There is no romance in the worlt now, and no heroism. The very winters and sum mers are nothing to whit they used to be; in fact, life is altogether on a ;mall, commonplace scale. Now, that s a miserable sort of thing. It brings a kind of paralyzing chill over life, and petrifies the natural spring of joy that should be forever leaping up to meet the fresh new aneled ia the OF k-eep ssag _ HAT AND THE 

HABITATION Architect Shows How the One Has Always Borne Strong Relation to the Other. A well-known architects has pointed out that the form of the hat bears a certain relation to buildings of a prim itive nature-huts. He has invited at, tention to the curious resemblance that has existed, and that is still to be found in many countries between headgear and habitations or other buildings. It may be that the same taste, or the lack of it, has given rise to the similarity of style, or in the be ginning the designer of the hat may have taken the hut as a model In the Hawaiian islands, long before the inhabitants took the trouble to clothe themselves, they built grass houses, and at the present time the characteristic Hawaiian hat is remark. ably like the hut. The turbans of the dignitaries of the Eastern church are still of the shape of jbose worn by the high priests among the Jews of olden times, and they are extraordinarily like the charl acteristic domes that surmount mosques. Again, it is pointed out, the high-pointed spires of Gothic churches were contemporaneous with the high horn-like headdress known os the hen niLn. It is believed, too, that like remults may be found after a comparison of other styles of architecture with the headgear of the period wherein they flourished.
