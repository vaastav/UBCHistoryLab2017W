Neck ret- an extended vi'L'ig rison m iirnn UULUU EFFECTIVE JANUARY 2ND Ratei on Fruits to Points Beyond Jacksonville Are Lowered and Carload Is Fixed. Washington, I). C After an ex haustive review of the efforts of the Florida railroad commission to reg ulate the reasonableness of interstate rates applying to the movement of traffic into and out of the state, the Interstate Commerce Commission ren dered an opinion favorable to the Florida Fruit and Vegetable Shippers' association against the Atlantic Coast Line and the railroad commis sion of Florida against the Seaboard Air Line. The whole case 1b substantially set out in the finding and order of the commission as follows; "From the facts disclosed by the record held that the rates upon pine apples, citrus fruits and vegetables which would result from the applica tion of the distance tariff given in the report herein upon the lines of the Florida East Coast Railway com pany, the Atlantic Coast Line railroad company and the Seaboard Air Line railway from points in Florida up to Jacksonville, when deBtined to any points beyond in other states, would be just and reasonable, that they ought not to be exceeded for the fu ture and that the present rates of those carriers are unjust and unrea sonable to the extent that they ex ceed such rates. "These cases being at issue upon complaints and answers on file and having been duly heard and submit ted by the partitfB and full investiga tion of the matters and things involv ed having been had and the commis sion being of the opinion that the present rates on pineapples, citrus fruit and vegetables from points on the Florida East Coast railway, the Seaboard Air Line railway and the Atlantic Coast Line railroad to Jack sonville when destined for points be yond in other states are unjust and unreasonable insofar as the rates named in paragraphs 3 hereof would for the future be just and reasonable. "It is ordered that the defendant Florida East Coast Railway company, Seaboard Air Line railway and Atlan tic Coast Line railroad company be and they are hereby notified and re quired to cease and desist on or be fore the 2nd day of January, 1912, and for period of not less than two years thereafter, abstain from exact ing for the transportation on pineap pies, citrus fruits and vegetables in carloads and less than carloads from points of production upon their vari ous lines of railway to Jacksonville when destined for points beyond in other states and rates in excess of those mentioned in paragraph 3 hereof. It is further ordered that said de fendants mentioned in paragraph 2 hereof be and they are hereby noti fied and required to establish on or before the 2nd of January, 1912, and maintain in force thereafter during a period of not less than two years and apply to the transportation of pineap pies, citrus fruits and vegetables in carload and less than carload quanti ties, the carload minimum being 24, 000 pounds for vegetables under veil tilations and 17,500 pounds for vege tables under refrigeration from points of production upon defendants' vari ous lines or railway to Jacksonville, when destined for points beyond in other states, rates which shall not exceed the following in cents per standard box of eighty pounds in case of pineapples and citrus fruits and in cents per standard crate of fifty pounds in caBe of vegetables." (Here follows the tariff which hereaf ter is to be used in making these shipments). Louis C. Massey represented the railroad commission at the hearing, and A. A.

CONVENED CHAMP CLARK THINKSf ADJOURN MENT WONT COME UNTIL AF TER THE CONVENTIONS. PRESIDENT TAFT'S MESSAGE Chief Executive's Message to Con ores Dealt With Only One Subject Trusts. LEVY COUNTY VOTED AGAINST BOND ISSUE. Proposition to Bond County for the Building of Good Roads Defeated by a Large Majority. Bronson. In the election held in this, Levy county, to decide whether or not the county should be bonded for the purpose of building hard roads, the proposition was defeated by a large majority, several precincts giving a unanimous vote against bonds. There was only a light vote polled, but the interest was general throughout the county. Gainesville is turning attention to different things nowadays. Not that the pursuit of happiness and the ex tension of trade and exploitation of Florida have been laid aside, but it now appears that in order to get a special metropolitan air some of the aldermen have decided to import a few dozen squirrels, so that these "sassy" little fellows may skip about the big oaks in the square and re mind one of Central park. The squir rels will be purchased by the city and liberated in the square and protected from sharpshooters." Sinclair to Get a Divorce. New York. Upton Sinclair, author and Socialist, will get his divorce from his wife, Meta F. Sinclair, if the court approves the recommenda tion mad by Referee W. S. Keiley. With the recommendation for an In terlocutory decree went tha reform'. report of the testimony, containing Interesting details of life at Arden, the summer camp of the Sinclair col ony, while Harry Kemp, the Kansas poet and co-respondent In the case, was dweller there with other liter ary people. Washington. The first regular ses sion of the Sixty-second congress convened. Legislative machinery is ready for a long session. Speaker Clark and other leaders having pre dicted that adjournment may not come until after the national conven tlons of the two big" political parties have been held. This has not MP' pened since 1888. The opening was not only the Btart of a congress in which party leaders will struggle for party vantage at tne polls next November In dealing with tariff, trust and other big problems, but it will initiate the brilliant win ter social season at the nation's cap- tal. "When you contemplate all the im portant legislation to be considered; said Speaker Clark, "you are forced to the conclusion that congress will be in session until well into the sum mer, if not until fall." "While no definite program as to tariff bills in the house has yet been framed," said Democratic Leader Un- derwiod, "it is certain that the Dem ocratic caucus will unanimously ap prove immediate action by the ways and means committee.. The commit tee will welcome the report of the tariff board on the textile schedules, but It will not delay action for any great length of time if the board's report is held back. Upon the attitude of the Insurgent Republicans will depend the legisla tive accomplishments of the senate. They hold the balance of power as between the regular Republicans and the Democrats, and without their ac quiescence nothing can be done by either of the regular partieB. President Taft's third annual mes sage was devoted to the "trust ques tion." The message contains from 5,000 to 6,000 words, and, with the exception of a few references in a general way to other related subjects, deal with the question of industrial combinations alone. Federal incorporation as outlined by Mr. Taft two years ago was sug gested again as a method for solution of the problem. The president indi cated his aversion to amendment of the Sherman anti-trust act, and there is no suggestion of such amendment in the message. "I've put all my eggs in one bas ket,' the president said to callers. The president has done something that has not been done since 18S7, when President Cleveland devoted his mes sage entirely to the tariff. It is usual for the chief executive to point out the need of all sorts of legislation, and to give in brief form the history of the past year so far as the gov ernment is concerned. This will be done away with in the present mes sage and later on Mr. Taft will send special messages to congress dealing with important subjects. Conservation, including the develop ment of Alaska, will be dealt with either in a separate message or in one that takes in many subjects ex clusive of the trusts and the tariff. In addition to these suggestions to congress, Mr. Taft hopes to Bend in reports of the postal commission, the railway cimmission and possibly oth ers, before the holiday adjournment. Seeking Accomplices of McNamaras, Los Angeles, Cal. "The United States government and California au thorities are co-operating to uncover one of the most gigantic conspiracies ever conceived in the hstory of ths country." Ths was the declaration of Assistant District Attorney W. Jo seph Fird, Becond in command to Dis trict Attorney John D. Fredericks. "It is only a question now of whether the Federal government or the state au thorities can reach certain persons and bring them to justice more effec tually," continued Mr. Ford. Carnegie Talks of War. !evr York. ihese warlike pro ceedings in Europe at present are a flash from the past, a passing recur rence of the practices of savage times," said Andrew Carnegie, in a statement in which he urged the ne cessity of ratifying the proposed ar bitration treaties with Great Britan and France. Mr. Carnegie advocated "a four-hands-around" treaty between the United States, Germany, Great Britain and France who would stand four square to all the winds that blow." Pellagra Puzzles Scientists. Washington. After many months of Investigation of pellagra in the Southern states, the scientists of the public health and marine hospital ser vice are in as much doubt as ever as to the cause of the scourge. Mean while, the disease seems to be gain ing, and it has been reported that nearly every physician in South Car olina has from five to fifteen cases in his private practice. Assistant Sur geon Gen. John D. Long says it has been demonstrated that cure can be effected even up to the fifth attack. Oscar Underwood Talks. Washington. "This session of con gress will be largely given over to tariff bills," said Representative Un derwood, majority leader of the house. "If we can continue as we began last session, I think there will be no doubt as to the verdict of the people at tha polls. AH the Demo cratic members are prepared to make concessions in the interest of har mony. They expect to have passed through the house tariff revision, which the Democratic party believe tt country want. , Sparks ShowTomorrow Sat, Dec, 9th. Mammoth Amusement Enter prise Billed for Two Performances. A few more days and Spark,' world's famous shows will hold forth In this- city for a matinee and night exhibition, and the rare, unique and wonderful things that have - been promised on paper will become a re ality. The airy riders who, In diaphanous skirts, have been pirouetting on ths expansive backs of beautiful and Bpeedy circus horses (on the bill boards) will be seen In all the gor geousness of tulle - and seductive smile; the elephants will copy their pictured acts of comedy and go them one better; the contortionist will proceed to disentangle himself from the knots he tied In his responsive body last year; the acrobatic families will turn dizzy somersaults and the clowns will work off their latest com edy stunts to the great delight of the crowds present we all like the clowns. ' There is nothing on earth like the circus. It Is the people's show par excellence. It Is the one great Amer ican amusement that appeals to all, the people. The expert knows what Is coming every minute of the show, but he wouldn't have It changed for worlds. The very conventionalism of most of the performance is what makes it so delightful. The merit In a big circus like the Sparks shows is in the fact that everything in the show is the very best of its kind. There must in evitably be riding acts, but the riders are the leaders of their profession. There must be acrobats, but the acro batic artists and aerlalists are gath ered from the wide world, and are the best that money can procure. It is this superiority in the qual ity of the performers that makes the Sparks shows such a welcome visi tor. Within a few weeks tho Pinellat Lumber and Development company will probably begin to rebuild their sawmills recently burned. The ma chinery and buildings were destroy ed and there was no insurance, but, realizing that nothing is to be gain ed by delay and also that the de mand for lumber in that section is heavy and increasing, the mill people are going to have a new plant ' on the spot as soon as it can be erected. The date for the celebration of the completion of the great Oversea rail way to Key West has finally been set. It will begin on January 20 and con tinue through February 3. President Taft is to visit Key West during that period, and many representativee or foreign powers are expected to attend and contemplate the magnificent engi neering triumph. Plans for the cele bration are going forward and it is thought that there will be thousands of visitors to Key West during the period mentioned.
