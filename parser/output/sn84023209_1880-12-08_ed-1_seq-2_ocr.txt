The r-erwioo comiuittee will report io a day or two slid it is probable its work will be approved and the revised laws pusat-d without taUing much time. The grand list committee lias reported by bill and propose to have each tax-payer return a sworn inventory of his property which shall be nppraised by the lisurs. It has always seemed to us that legisla tion us to our tax laws would take this complexion, that is be founded on the present svsiein which is bad in practice rather than in theory. The need is to (jet property into the list ami there is no batu i way than lo oblige men to make disclos ure of what they own and deal with them -with the utmost severity if they fail lu if" it. Resides icvisiuu and tax matters there are many bills of importance before lue two bouses for acliun. And while then has been n.ueh criticNtn of the present body of Irgislalois it is entirely safe lo say their justification is in their own hand.-. If tbey act wisoly, and by experience they are now much heller qualified to act than when tlicy came here, for the rcmainilei of lue session tbey will leave no room lor just complaint and in met tne present session does not promise to be so much longer than sessions usually have been, n would appear al first thought. Congress. The forty-sixth congress began its las' session Monday. This congress came ih one March like a lion and will go out in such sort of way as it best can. In March 1875 the democrats nflei years of service in the minority obtained complete control of ibe national House ol Representative and for six years hnv worked therein their own sweet will. Up to March 1H79 the republicans retained control of the Senate but at that time the latter body became democratic and for nearly two years the democracy ba controlled both houses of congress. The only check upon thorn wa-t the vote of the president. This will continue until next March. Then there will be a change, but not exactly the change which was so loudly demanded and advertised by the opposi lion before and during the last campaign. The next bouse of represettative's will be republican and the senate will be so close that tho democrats cannot rely on con trolling it all times. I5ul this winter things will go on as in the past, except that there will not be probably quite so much talk of the boast ing sort as there was about the time the present House begun its labors. It will be as well for the oounty but altogether the republicans have to thank the present House of representatives lor m my blessings, Ihough they were rather distin guished at the time. Ai.mon JIkakku Skntknced. In ac eordancc with the terms of the statute which provides that when any person has pleaded guilty of murder, the court shall hear testimony to determine the degree, the county court, last Saturday afternoon, listened to the testimony of SherilF Ather tun about Almon's confession to him on the night when they went together and recovered the body of little Alice, and the testimony of Dr. Henry I tne- of Water burv in regard to the post m irteni exam ination of her corpse, and the certainty from that examination, that death did nut result from natural caii9es. The iesond ent's counsel put in no testimony. Aliuon sat in his chair in ihe bar behind his coun sel as unconcerned as ever. He had bei n exhorted by his own counsel, by the coun sel of the stato and by the officers to tell the whole truth, He hud been told that if he told the truth and it became evident that his share in the murder was what they believed it to be, everything should be done to secure a commutation of his sen teneo to imprisonment for life. Hut he refused to open his lips. Judge Redlield in an address of great humanity, in which he regretted the duly which was imposed upon him by the law, and intimated that if the statute had not made it iinperativi upon the court to find the crime murder by poison to be murder in the first de gree, they might have found otherwise in order that the sentence should be milder. He directed the clerk to ask the respondent if he hud anything to say why sentence should not be passed upon him. Almon stood up. looked almost defiantly a. the court, and said "No." Judge Redlield then pronounced sentence as follows : The sentence of tho court is that you, the said Louis Almon Meaker, on the sec ond Friday of February in the yeur I HSU, between the hours of 1 and 2 o'clock in the afternoon of said day, within the walls, or inclosed yard, of tiie state prison in Windsor, in the county of Windsor, be hanged by the neck till dead. And it is ordered that a warrant be issued by the clerk of the court, under the seal of said court, lo llie sheriff of said Windsor coun ty, commanding said sheriff to cause said senlence to be carried into effect. And it is also the sentence of this court that in the meantime you, the said Iouis Almon Meaker, be confined in said statu prison al hard labor therein till within three months of said time fixed for said execution; and for and during said three months next prior to said time fixed for the execution and up to said execution, you, the said Louis Almon Meaker, lie confined in soli tary confinement iu said stale prison. The respondent was then taken back to jail. He and his mother will be taken to the state prison in a few days. It has been decided to hold the annual meeting of the Atnericnn Ayrshire breed ers' association in Rutland. The 20th of January is tbe date fixed upon for the opening of the session. And now it is said that the real fight between the Western Union and Ameri can Union telegraph companies will begin shortly after the first of next January, accompanied by some sharp cutting of rates. The holiday trade has opened in New iork. Ihe Trxbunt says: "Inere are evidences iu shop that the Christmas buying has begun already and in earnest. The ladies have discovered that they can get through the process at this stage with comfort, and not only make the r selec . tions at leisure, but even find the prices a ! little easier In some cases. The advan tages of this method over the regulation way of pushing one's way into the stores three days before Christmas, enduring agonies of crowding and wiuting, and emerging with dragglod skirts and hats all awry, are obvious. Tie Seventh Judge. Last Friday the joint assembly, after several balloting to which there were numerous candidate elected Hon. Russell S. TafU the representative from Burling ton, sixth associate judge of the supreme court. The election Was by acclamation and was unanimous. Judge Taft was horn in Williston in U35, was admitted to the Chittendon oounty bar in 1856 and in If 57 began practice with T. E. Wales. In 1872 he was lieutenant-governor and In 1874 was strongly supported for governor being pitted in the convention against that most eminent man Ashel Peck. Judge Tad's service In the present legif lature has shown him to be a man of cool and judicial bead and one whose judge ment his fellow legislators highly regard eil. It has been for some time supposed that on the retirement of Judge I'ierpoini Mr. Taft would go upon the bench and the peculiar complication which arose on the retirement of Judge Barrett merely hastened this event. The defeat of Judge Barrett took from the supreme court of this state a jurist ol eminent native ability and learning. Judge Barrett has opened a law office in Woodstock and is now in attendance on Bennington county court practicing his profession. It is safe to say he will not suffer from want of employment in his business and we take it will be pretty independent. From Our Regular Correspondent.! Washing-Ian Letter. Washington, D. C, Deo. 4, 1880. The appropriation committee of the House has not, till within the last two days, had a quorum of its members pres ent, and it has made little or no progress with the regular bills. It will be remem bered that, at this time last year, the ap propriation bills were pretty much all prepared, so far as the work of the com mittee was concerned, and that congress on assembling was ready at once to take in hand its most important business. It now looks as though congress will have no appropriation bills ready for immediate consideration, and it is to be feared that there will be a repetition of the wasteful haste so common when this business is postponed until the hurried days of ad journmeni. and is then dispatched en bloc, without the deliberation that bills involving tho expenditure of millions of money ought to receive. From the present outlook this session of congress will be dull and confined mostly to such Indispensable legislation as the passage of the regular appropriation bills and possibly a financial hill to enable the secretary of the treasury to refund the bonded debt which will be duo iu May and June of 1881. There is a disposition among democrats to give politics a rest, and in this, it is thought, republicans will not oppose them. An effort will again bo made to put salt ind pulp on Ihe free list, but if any radical tariff legislation shall be attempted, it will meet with no success, for republicans will oppose important changes, preferring ti postpone them until the 47lh congress, when Fernando Wood will no longer be chairman of the most important committee of the House. A small number of republican members have expressed themselves in favor of an extra session, so that they can secure con trol of the organization of ihe House im mediately after the 4th of March, and step right into the patronage amounting to one hundred and fifty appointments, which, otherwise, will continue to be enjoyed by the democrats until after the convening and organization of the 47th congress in December, 18H1. liul the more infiiicnliul republicans seem disposed to leave the democrats undisturbed io the offices until December of next year. A extra session of the Senate will be indispensable to confirm Gen. Garfield's appointments, and if the now Chinese treaty shall not have been ratified before the adjournment of the present congress, the Senate may remain here until tho be ginning of summer. The latest on dil is that Senator -elect Fair of Nevada will act with the republi cans and give them the organization of the Senate beyond a peradventure. This rumor lacks confirmation ; but the Senate will be so evenly balanced that each parly will have to keep its ranks closed up. and the illness or absence, from any cause, of a single senator may turn the scale in very important legislation. Wokcesteu. Dr. Hunt has been sick with diphtheria. Willie Forde is quite sick with erysipe. las. Etta J. Hunt has returned from the White Mountains. A harvest of ice has been gathered the past week. Eight inches of snow fell the first dav of December. Morris Humblet has been to market with a lot of poultry. C. C. Abhott, the postmaster, has been quite sick for a few days past. The M. E. SocieLy are about getting a new organ for their church. The Good Templars are to have an oyster supper on Tuesday evening, Decem ber 14th, the hills only sufficient to cover the expense. The public are cordially invited. PuTNAMSvn.LB. Mrs. Jacob Putnam is just recovering from lung fever. Will Neal, in tho employ of C. C. Put nam & Son, fell from thd lumber track the other day, striking on his bead and should ers. Fortunately no serious damage was done. A pure black marble has been discover ed near Brandon and a quarry will be opened in the spring. The marble is of the finest hitherto disoovered in Vermont, and as pure as tbe far famed statuary layer of the Rutland marble. A company has been formed of six gentlemen, among them being Lawyer Aldis Walker, of Rut land, and S. L. Goodell, of Hiandon, to quarry the marble The quarry is on a bill side and those interested claim lhaL it can be quarried cheaper than any marble in Vermont. Juikjb Taft. Tbe election of Hon. R. S. Taft as judge of the supreme court, was a surprise to our community, ami probably to himself. Though often men tioned, as one who would some day make a promising candidate for a judgeship, he was not, so far as we are aware a camli date for any such office at this lime. His name was not formally presented, in the joint assembly; but on the tirnt ballot yes terday, tor the seventu fudge, 28 votes were thrown for him, rising to 94 on the thin) ballot, when his unanimous election by acclamation took place. Mr. Taft is a native of Williston in this county, and is iu the prime of lite, being in his 46th year, lie is a man of marked ahihty. well versed in tne law and in public affairs, and of high standing as a citizen; and he will make an upright, courteous and capable judgu, ree Press. Silver Wedding at Fyston. There wan a very happy gathering at f. O. Bovce's on the 22d nit., the occasion being the twenty-fifth anniversary of their marriage. There were over two hundred cards sent out. and, dpspite the extremely cold weather, one hundred and eighty responded. The two oMest daughters were present from Boston, also the third daughter, who resides at Franklin Falls, Mass. The family being all together beueath the home roof made it especially pleasant for Mr. and Mrs. Boyce. The literary entertainment commenced with a song. Drifting with the tide," by Mrs. Bert Waterman of M mtpelier, and her sister, Bessie Marsh. A letter from Rev. V". J. Kidder of Northtiold. who lied the matrimonial knot twentv five years ago, was read ; aUo letters from Otis Clapp and Nathaniel Peabody of Boston, read by Miss S. M. Thompson. Then came a poem by D. S. Stoddard a spicy article, wherein he went through the marriage ceremony very handsomely in rhyme, making the groom promise To lake nor lor worse or for belter; If she wanted lo scold, why, he must let her.' So be knows now what to expect, and as Mr. Stoddard is a " justice of the peace," there seems no way for him to get a re prievo unless he applies for a divorce from the lusl matrimonial decree. Dr. N. W. Gilbert road a poem, and Mrs. Bert Watennon read one fnom Dr. G. N. Brigham. Grand Rapids, Mich , and also one from Mrs. S. B. Mansfield. Captain Wilder made the presentation and some verv cnlertaininsr remarks, to which Mr. Boyce responded with much emotion. Rev. H. Webster, Barre, also made interesting remarks, and prayer was offered by Rev. G. L. Wells. A collation of cake, coffee, tea and fruit was served, next in order, and seemed quite as agreeablo to all parties as any part of the entertainment. There were many beautiful and useful presents, gifts from friends and loved oties, to be prized because they are such. Among them were a silver cake basket, two silver butter dishes, dinner castor, four silver napkin rings, dinner and tea set with individual dishes, a dozen silver knives, a butter knife, set of tea spoons, fern basket, very handsome toilet set, Turkish towel, etc. All seemed to enjoy themselves to the utmost, and it was near the small hours before the guests departed.

In my former annual inessiejcs I have asked the attcntiiin of emigres to the urgent necessity of a reformation of Lite civil service system of the gov ernment. My views concerning the dani-'ers ol p ttronage, or appointments tor personal or parti san considerations, have been slivuglltene l by my ohservalion and experience in ttie executive ollice, and I believe these dangers threaten the sUioilily ol the government. Abuses so serious In their nature cannot he perm tnently tolerated. They lend to be- come more nlarinin- with the: enlargi-meiil ol ad- minitrative service, as the growin 01 un; country in population increases the number of oltleers and placemen einploved. The reasons are imperative fni- the adoption 'of Axed rules lor the regulat s of appointments, promotions and removals, estab lishing a uiiiliiriii method, havum exclusively m view, in every instance, the atlainuienl. ol Llie Oct qualillcations for Ihe position in qilc-lioii. such a method alone is consisUml W illi III. equal rights 01 all citizens,. and theinosi economical auo i iiieieni adtninislration of the public, business. Ijoaipetllive exaiiiinalions, in aid ot impartial appointment and promotions, have been eonoucted lor some 'ura pasl in several 01 tne cai-uii, iit-p ii .1111:111.0, Id OV niv Ulieeuoil tins sysie in uccii .1'iwpt.cii in the custom nouses ami pont uim v m uiv iuia-i i cities ol the country, in tuecity oi ew 1 oik over iwotuousano potiuoiiB m mib uvii k-iyii na v ueen sunjeci. in im-n ri.-. ,,. nb0 v i place to the operation of pntdisbe rules lor this purpose during the past two years. The results ol these iHMctieal trials have been ver suU-.lacury, and have conilnii' d my opinion in favor ol this system of selection. AH are subjecteii to tne same tests, and the result is free from prejudice by per sonal favor or partisan mtlueiue.

These invaluaule results nave been attaineo in n nigu degree in tne omres where the rules for appointment by competitive examination have been applied. method which has so approveii used by experimental tests at points where such tests may be fairly considered conclusive, should lie extended to all sub irdiuate positions under the government. I believe thata strong and growing public sentiment demands im mediate measures for securing and enf orcing the highest possible efficiency in the civil service, and its protection from rucognixed abuses, und that the experience referred to has demonsirated the feasi bility of such measures. The examinations in the custom-houses and post-offices have been held un der many embarrassments and without provision for compensation for the extra labor performed by the officers who conducted thein, and whose com mendable interest in the improvements of the pub lie service has induced this devotion of time ami labor without pecuniary reward. A continuance of these labors gratuitously ought not to be ex pected, and without an appropriation from con gress for eompei.B.ition it is not practicable to ex tend ihe system of examinations generally through out the civil service. It is also highly important that all such examinations should be conducted upon a uniform system and under general super vision. Section 1 7 A3 of the revised statutes author izes the president to prescribe the regulations tor admission lo ihe civil service of the Uuited htates, and for this purpose to employ suitable persons to conduct the requisite inquiries with relerence to " the tltuesB of eiich candidate, in respect to age, health, character, knowledge anil ability, forthe branch of service into which he seeks to enter: hut the law is practically inoperative lor want of the requisite appropriation. 

RBCOMMKNUATTON. I therefore recommend an appropriation of $25,. OOh per annum to meet the expenses of a com mi a. sum to be appointed by the president in accord ance with the terms of this section, whoso dutv ii Bhall be to devise a Just, uniform and efficient av. tern of competitive examinations, and to supervise the application of the same throughout the entire civil service of tbe government. 1 am persuaded that the facilities which such a commission will af ford for testing the fitness of those who apply for office will not only be as welcome a rollef to mem- oers oi congress as ii win ne to trie president and heads of departments, bill that it will also tend to remove me causes oi emiiarrassmeiil Which no v inevitably and constantly attend the conllietiug claims of patronage between the legislative and ex ecutive departments. The most effectual check upon the pernicious competition of inlluence and of- nciai tavoritisin in tho bestowal of ollice, will be the substitution of an open competition of merit oeiweeii me applicants in wnicii every one can make his own record with the assurance that hi success will denend illion this atom I nlun mend such legialation as, while leavingevery officer as free as any other citizen lo express his political opinions and to use his means for their advance ment, shall also enable him to feel un sntv .- private citizen in refusing all demands upon his salary for political purposes. A law which should thus guarantee true liberty and justice to all who are engaged in the Public service, and likewise con tain stringent provisions against tbe use of official amhorlty to c-ncrce tho political action of private citizens or of official subordinates, is greatl. to be desired. The most serious obstacle, however, to an improvement of )the civil service, and especially to rwiurin in me iiH-tm.u ui npponumciii ami removal has been lound ! be the practice, under what is known as the spoils svsiein, bv which Disappoint ing power has been so largelv encroached upon bv members ot congress.

FOREIGN RELATIONS UHEAT 11KITAIN. Our relations with all foreign countries have been those of undisturbed peace, and have presented no occasion tor concern as to their continued mainte nance. My anticipation of an early reply from tne Uritirth government to thodemand of indemnity to our tlshernieu for the injuries received by that in dustry at fortune Hay, in January, S7S, which I expressed in my Inat annual message, was disap pointed. This answer was received only in the latter part of April in the present year, and, when received, exhibited a failure of accord between the two governments, as to the measure of the inshore lulling privilege secured to our llsheriiien by the treaty of Washington, of so serious a clmnicter that I made it the suiilcctofa communication to congress, in which I recommended the adoption of me measures wiiicn aecmei. lo me proper to be taken by this government in maintenance of the rights ncconled to our Unhernien under the treaty, anil towards securing an indemity for the injury tliece interests h id suffered. A bill to can v out these recommendations was under consideration by the house ol representatives at the time of the ad journment of congress in June last. Within a lew weeks 1 have received a communication from her mnjeHty'H government, renewing tho subject, both of the indemnity for the injuries nt Fortune Hay, and ol the interpretation of the treaty in which the previoiih correspondence had shown the to irov erniiieiiu t he at variance. Upon both these topics the disposition towards a f iendly agreement is manifested by a recognition of our right to an in demnity lor the trans iction at Fortune It y, leaving the measure of such indemnity to further conler- , ence, and by an assent to tbe view ol tins govern I ment, presented in the previous correspondence, urni uie regulation ol conmcting interests ol the shore llsbery of the I'rovinc.ial sea coasts, and the vertnel llsbery of our fisherman, should be made the subject of conference and concurrent arrange ments between trie two governments. 1 sincerely hope, that the basis may be found for a speedy ad justment ot the very serious divergence of views in the interpretation of the fishery clauses of the ireaiy oi amnngion, which, aettie correspond ent between the tw governments, stood at the elo.-coi the last session of conirrcHs. seemed to be irreconcilable. In the important exhibition of arts arm ministries, wtucii was beta 1 ist year nl.M dnev New South Wales, as well as in that now in nroifresh it .Melbourne, the United Mates have been eilirient- Iv and honorably represente t.

In the exhibition at Melbourne, the share taken by our country is no less notable, und an equal degree ot success is expected.

The wrong was brought to the attention ol the Spanish government in a serious protest and remonstrance, nun me matter is undergoing inves tigation by the royal authorities, with a view to such explanation or reparation as mav be ca lied lor by the facts. The commission sitting in thi city for the adjudication of claims of our citizens against the government of Spain, is, hope, a- pronr.ouiK uie ttfruiniiibioii oi us moors.

The relations between this govern ment and that ot the United states ot Columbia have engage I public attention during the pa-t year, inailllv bv reason of the project ol an interoceanic canal across the Isthmus of Panama, to be built by private capital under a concession irom tbet .oium bian government for that nurpose. The treatv oh ligations subsisting between the United States and Columbia, by which we guarantee the neutrality of tne transit ana me sovereignty mm property 01 Columbia in the Isthmus, make it necessary that the conditions under which so stupendous a change in the region embraced in tins guarantee simuM tie effected translormmtr. as it would, thin Isthmu from a barrier between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans into a gateway and thoroughfare between them, tor tne navies ami trie merciiant snips ot the rtorl i should receive the approval ot tins govern ment, as being compatible with the discharge of these obligations on our part, and consistent with our interests as the principal commercial power of the western hemisphere. I tie views which 1 ex pressed in a special message to congress in .March last, in relation to hub project, i ieetn n mv iiuiy again to impress upon your attention. .Subsequent consideration lias butconflrmed the opinion " that it is the right and dutvol the United states to as sert and maintain such supervision and authorltv over any interoceanic canal across the isthmus that connects North and south America as will protect our national interest. THE PEKUVO CHILIAN WAR. The war between the republic of Chill on the one hand and the allied republics ol Peru and Ho livia on the other, still eontinm-b. This govern inent has not felt caiteo upon to interfere in a i test that is within the belligerent rights of ttie. par lies as lU'iepenneni states, ne nave, However, always held ourselves in readiness to aid in iieconi modating their difference, and have at different times reminded both belligerents of our willing ness to render sucti service, our good nfilccs in this direction were recently accepted bv all the belligerents, and it was honed thev would nrove efficacious; but 1 regret to announce that the aieas ures which the ministers of the United Mates at Santiago and Lima were authorized to take with the view to bring about a peace, were not success ful. In the course of the war some questions have arisen affecting neutral rights; in all of these the ministers of the United States have, under ttieir in structions, acted with promptness and energy in protection of American interests. HKAZH, AND AltUENTINK PUBLIC. The rclatio'is of the United states with the Em pire of Hni7.il continue to be most cordial, and their commercial intercourse steadily increases, to their mutual advantage. The internal disorders with which the Argentine Kcuuhlic has for some time past been alllicted, and which have more or less influenced its external trade, are understood to have been brought lo a close. This happv result may bo expected Up redound to the bencill of the foreign commerce of that republic as well as to the leveiopinetu ot us vast interior resources. 8 A MOAN I H LAN OS.

CONSIXAIt KKPOKTS. The efforts of the department of stare to enlarge the trade and commerce of the United elates, through the active agency of consular oflUers and through the dissemination of information ohtaiii.-d from them, have been unrelaxed. lhe interest in tnene euorts, as ueveiope-i in our commercial com munities, ami tne value ot the information secured by this means, to the trade and manufacture of the country, were recognized by congref-s at its la-t session and provision was made for lhe more fre quent publication of consular and other reports bv the department of state. Tbe first issue of ihi'p. publication has now been prepared, and subse quent issues may regularly be expected. The importance and intere.-t attached to the reports ol consular officers are wiiness-d by the jeneral demand for them by all classe-i of merchants and mnnutucturers engaged in our loreign trade. It is oeneveo mat tne s-.su-u oi such ouhi timu . deserving of the approval of eoiigrets, and that the necessary appropriations for its continuance and enlargement will commend itself to j ourconsidera- 8TEAMSI1IP St MSI Id K8. The ir)snerous energies of ourdomewtie i,i,ina tries, and their immense prodnctions of the subjects i"iriK wiiiiiikji, in -tne, aim even require, an active ileveloprnent of the wishes and interests of our people in that direction. Especially important o i- mo. .mi Miiniiicirmi rri;tii-mi Willi tne rtlllUIllC and Pacific co ists of South America, with the wt Indies and the eiulf of Mexico should be direct, and not through the circuit of Kuropean systems, and siiouid e carried on in our own bottoms. I lie ful appreciation of the opportunities which our front on the Paciilc ocean gives to commerce with Japan, '.'liina and the Fast Indies, with Australia and the island groups which lie along these routes of nnvi. gation, should inspire equal efforts to appropriate to our own shipping, and to administer by our own capital a due proportion of this trade. Whatever modltlcations of our regulations of trade and navi gation may be necessary or useful to meet and direct tnese impulses to ttie enlargement of our exchanges and of our carrying trade, I am sure the wisdom oi e.mgr ss will be ready to supply. One initial measure, nowever, seems to me so clearly iiBoini un-1 emcient mat i venture to nress it unon your earnest attention. It seems to me very evident ui-" mw pi"viiou in regular steam-postal couiinu- mention, uy aid -rom g vernmeot, has been the forerunner ol the commercial predominance of vi reai nritain on an tuose coasts and se i, a greater snare in wiiose trmle is now tho desire an t the intent of our people, it is also manifest that the effortB ol other European nations to contend with lireat Britain tor a share of this commerce have been successful in proportion with their adoption of regular steom postal .'iommunieation with the markets whose trade they sought. Mexico and the states of South Am rica are anxious to receive such postal communications with this country, and to aid in their development. Similarco.opcration mav be looked tor in due lime Irom the Kast-rn nation's and Ir an Australia. It is difficult to see how the lead in this movement can be expected from private interests. In respect of foreign commerce, unite as much as in interna I trade, postal coniinuide dion seems necessarily a matter of common ami public administration and thus pertaining to government 1 respectiully recommend to your prompt attention such just and efficient measures as mav conduce to lhe development of our foreign commercial ex changes and the building up of our carrying trade. PAOIPIC CAULK. In this connect! n I desire also to suggest the very great service which might be expected mi enlarging and tacilitating our commerce on the Pacific ocean wore a transmarine cable laid from San Francisco to the Sandwich Islands, and thence to Japan at the north and Aus ralia at tho south. The great influ ence of such means of communication on these routes of navigation, in developing ami securing the lue sliar-i of our Pacitlc coast in the commerce s and the -otj w"' e, "cvi no illustration or enforcement it may ne uiai sucn an onterprise, useful and in the end prniltahle as it would prove to private invest ment, may need to be accelerated by prudent legis lation by congress in its aid, and f submit the imie( hi jrvur oaruiut consideration. KNLAKOKMKNT OF THK NAVT. An additional, and not unimportant, although secondary, reason for fostering and enlarging the navy may be found in tho unquestionable servi-se to tne expansion of our commerce, which would be rendered by the frequent circulation of naval ships m lhe seas and pons of all quarters of the globe Mupsof the proper construction and equipment, lo b- ol the greatest efficiency in case of maritime war might be mailu constant and active agents in time of peace in the advancement and protection of our loreign trade, and in the nurture and discipline of young seamen, who would naturally, in some num bers, mix with and improve the crows of our merchant-shins. Our inerchHiu.-. t !.,. abroad recognize tiie value to loreign commerce of an active movement of our naval vessels, and the intelligence and palriotio seal of our naval officers in promoting every interest of their countrymen is a just subject of national prido.

This presents a verv favorable opp Ttunity not only to further reduce the principal of the debt, but also to reduce the rate of interest on that which will remain unpaid.

THK SlI.VKlt IiOI.I.AIt. At the time of the passage of the act now in force requiring the coinage ol Mlver dollars, tliug their value and giving Ihem legal-te id-r character, it was believed bv many ot the niipporters of the i ilea.-u re that the sliver dollar. Which it authorized, would speedily become, under the operations of the law, ol equivalent value to the gold dollar. There were otiier supporters of the bill who, while they d mill ed a lo the probability of this result, nevertheless were willing lo gi e the proposed experiment a fair trial, with a view to slop Hi.' coinage, if experience -boul I prove that the silver doll r authorized by the lull continued io le of less commercial value than Die standard gold dollar. The coinage of sil ver dollars, under the act ret erred to, began in March, i.-;, and has been continued as required by the act. The average r it per mouth to the present liuie ha.- been $2,27-1, 1!i2. The total aiiioiiut coined prior to the llml of November lar-t was 72,-47,7.')U. of this amount $i7,b-l,4.t) remain in the trcaMirv, and only j."),;ii.l,-2'.d are in the hands of the people. A constant olfort h is been made to keep this cur rency in circulation, and considerable expense has been necessarily i.icurrcd for this purpose, but its r. -tin u to the treasury is prompt and sure. Uonlran to the coniident anticipation of ttie friends of trie men-dire at the tune oi n adoption, the va ueof the silver dollar, containing 412 grains of silver has not increased- lJurmg the year prior to the passage ot t ie oill authoniiig il coinage, the market value of the iiver which u contained was from ninety 1 1 ninety-two cents as compared with the standard gold dolhi-. During the last year lhe average mar ket a lue of the silver dollar "has been eighty -eight a.id a halfeeius. it is obvious, thai the legislation of the last congress iu regard to silver, so tar as it was based on an anticipated rise in the value of sil ver as a result of that legislation, has failed to pro. duce the effect then predic:ed. The longer the law remains in force, requiring as it does the coinage of a nominal doll r, which, in reality, is not a dollar, the greater In comes the danger that this country will be forced lo accept a single metal as the Bole legal standard of value, in circulation, and thia is a standard of less value than ii purports to be worth in the recognized money of the world. The consti tution of the United .-tales, sound liuanc.ial princi ples, and our best i nterests, all require that the country should have as its legal ten ler money, both gold and silver coin, oi an intrinsic value, as bul lion, equivalent lo that which, upon itn luce, it purpo is lo possess. The constitution, in express terms, recognised both gold and silver as the only true legal tender money. To banish either of these metals from oir currency is to narrow and limit the circulating medium of exchange to the disparage ment of important interests. The Unite 1 Males produces more -ilver than any other country, and is directly interested in maintaining it as one" of tne two precious metals .vluch iiiruisii the coinage of the world. It will, in my judgment, contribute to this result il congress will re neal so much of evist. I in' legislation as requires the coinage of silver dot- ! ,HTB ntaining only 41 2 . grains of silver, and in its stead iii authorize uie secret iry ot lhe treasury to coin silver dollars of equivalent value as bullion, with gold 'lobars. Plus svill defraud no man, anil will bo in accordance with utmiliar precedents. Congress, on several occasions hasaltery i the ratio i value between gold and silver, in order to estab lish it more nearly in accordance with the actual ratio of value between the two metals.

It is believed the full legal strength is Uie least pos silde force at which the present organization can be maintained, having in view etli--ieiiey, discipline and economy, v hile lhe enlistment of this force would add somewhat to the appropriation tor piv of lite army, the saving made iu other respects would be more than equivalent for this additional outlay, and the efficiency of the army would be largely increased.
