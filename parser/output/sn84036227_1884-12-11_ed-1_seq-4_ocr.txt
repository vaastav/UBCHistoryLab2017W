PrCas, entitled, 'Justice for the ''errltones." A great isy hayc b"Cg ,oring undei the impressiop, no doubt, that there are a piultiplicity of requirements of a ter ritory before it can be admitted as a state; that a certain number of inhab itans are necessary, that intelligence or wealth was a basis for claims to Statehood. This article plainly shows h t our tfrritorial condition is an nnnatural one. The writer says: "Not only was it not intended that this sys tem should be permanent, but it was not intended by any just man that it should be continued a moment beyond $jpp wheat there was reasonable videance that the people of a territory were equal in pomnt of numbers, of intelligence and of devotion to free institutions to take upon themselves ~he cares and duties of statehood." It is evident that the only barrier to the admission of Dakota and Mon Jaia as st#tes, is the opposition of political denagog es in both parties, men who cagnrt rise above party in terests long enough to do justice to over half a million of people. How long we shall have to await their pleas ure, no one knows, but it is liable to be several years. :rhoggh the official vote of the ter ritory, as approved by the board of canvasqers, his not as yet, been pub lished, it is known that the consti tution has been adopted ly a large .majority of all votes cast on the ques tion. The plea is now being made by a few journals-notably the Husband I man-.-that,inasmuchas a majority of all vote; cast are not represented on the i question of adoption or rejection of the constitugop, it is defeated. By what mode of reasoning this conclusion I is reached, is peyond our conception. The sixth ordinance, accompanying the oqnstitution, as furnished the voters last fall, in pamp;-!et form, says as plainly as words can that "if, when 411 I the votes for or against tAe adoptio of a Ite constitution have been canvassed, j it shall appear that the constitution has been adopted by a majority of the I votes cast-meaning on the question- s it shall be declared." etc To count n l. . blh k ballot against is as erryneous _ as to co 4nt it for, in fact m re so. 4. Tihose that .voted on the question at all were tlte intelligent, reading citi zens as against the blank voters, who either did not know the import of the n question submitted for their decision or of the "don't care a darn" class, who would have expressed their ap d proval by their yote rather than see f the constitution defeated. Our con 8 temporaries can rest assured that blank ballots don't count either way, neither do they express the sentiment of the Lt voters pro or con, and that the consti i, tution is adopted and will be so de r clared and presented to Congress for r. approval. THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE. s In this issue of the ARGUS will be n be found the last annual message of ) his excellency, Chester A. Arthur. While it may not equal in brilliancy the productions of some of his pre 'f decessors it is considered an able e presentation of the condition of gov ' ernmental affairs, with some wholesome e advice as tq future legislation. He compliments the country for its pa tience and patriotism during the period of doubt and uncertainty connected with the recent presidential election. Considerable space is given to foreign affairs, with suggestions regarding the extension of our foreign trade. i-e I recommends the discontinuance of the v coinage of silver dollars; says that in compliance with the act of Feb. a8th, I 1878, more than twenty-seven million silver dollars have been coined an- ii nually, and the number outstand ing is reported by the secretary to be nearly one hundred and eighty-five million, whereof but little more than * forty million, or less than 22 per cent, are in actual circulation. He urges the restoration of the navy, has some thing to say of the Arctic expedition, and recommends the passage of the bill now pending in the house of rep resentatives, for the purchase of a A district of i8,ooo square miles from - the Sioux reservation. In regard to Utah the President is brief but desper ately in earnest. He closes his mes sage with a liberal dose of "taffy" for the friendly lelations that have existed between the lesgislative and executive F branches of the government.

A jury of your countrymen have found you guilty of designing and conspiring with divers Democrats to become president of the United States, to the great harHm and personal injury of over 100,000 loyal office-holders of the republic. And more: You have caused anger, hatred, ill will, curses and maledictions, to spring up and live among the hith srto united Republican family of this !ountry. Your advocates have defend led you with great zeal and ability. Indeed, such great zeal and ability has ever before been known in the history f presidential campaigns in these Jnited States.
