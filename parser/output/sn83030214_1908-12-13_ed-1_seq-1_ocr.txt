The total : rental for the term will be $4,4K'.000. This is ! the largest lease affecting a Manhattan parcel ! reported in many years. It is said that the com j pany will erect a twenty story store and office building on th«» site in the near future. The site comprises about 4.fi^o square feet. It fronts about 51.3 feet on Broadway. 56.1 feet on (2d street. 49.2 feet on Seventh avenue, and has a southerly line of 99.10 feet. It is one of the, ' most valuable corner parcels in the city. It has been occupied by the Hotel Metropole. a four ! story structure, for many years. : According to a report yesterdays', Henry E. Coe, ■ who represents the estate, was recently offered 52.000.000 for the property, or at the rate of $430 a square foot Many other overtures to purchase or lease the property have been made ' in the lav two years, and those negotiations ! have usuailv been followed by rumors that the premises had been sold or leased The number of investors and speculators who have tried to get control of the parcel is probably larger than : the numerical strength of the prospective buyers i-.r lessees for property of its value in the city v -,..,. has changed hands or been taken over under a long lease in the last twenty years. This lease makes a certainty the Improvement of the entire block bounded by 41st. and 42d streets. Seventh avenue and Broadway. About four months ago Henry Phipps purchased from the New Amsterdam National Bank the Hoi I garana, formerly the Rossmore. adjoining the Hotel Metropole. for $l.lU0.«00.

When Bishop William Ford Nichols left this city for the Pacific Coast yesterday he an nounced that J. Pierpont Morgan had contrib uted $100,000 for the rebuilding of the Episcopal churches of San Francisco, destroyed by the earthquake and fire three years ago Bishop Nichols, who has been in New York. Philadelphia. • Cincinnati. Boston and several New England cities, visiting Episcopal clergy men and laymen in the work of , appealing for funds with which to rebuild the ruined churches, has met with generous responses throughout his travels and has accumulated a fund, including Mr Morgan's contribution, of nearly $200,000. Before his departure for San Francisco Bishop Nichols said that one of the first church edi fices to be erected will be the new Episcopal cathedral the plans of which were drawn by the late George Frederick Bodley. the British architect The site, which was given by William H Crocker, the banker of New York and San Francisco is a block square on the top of Nob Hill two blocks from the big Fairmount Hotel. Bishop Nichols came to this city two years ago on invitation of the Board of Missions, and soon after his arrival he met Mr. Morgan and explained the needs of the Episcopal Church in San Francisco. Mr. Morgan became Interested In the Bishop's plans and agreed then to con tribute $100,000 on condition that the church would raise an equal ..mount from other source.-. ••The financial panic and the consequent bard times made this task Impossible." said Bishop Nichols before his departure yesterday. "On my present visit I explained the situation fully, quoting some figures which I obtained shortly before leaving San Francisco, several weeks ago. Careful estimates have shown that tiv total loss to San Francisco as a result of the disaster is

Only $210,000,000 came back to the city In the way of insurance, with the result that there Is now In Ban Fran cisco an average of only $1 for every $.", that was there before the lire. This money Is being ed to rehabilitate the city, build fine homes and office buildings, and little of it can be used for new churches. Thus we are rearing a Class A city, but still have Class Z churches where churches were destroyed I recently had a conference with Mr. Morgan on this subject, and at once he removed the restriction he had Imposed on our first meeting, two years ago, and s ave outiiEht the amount be lad originally promised" AND THEY JUMPED OFF.

TEN DEAD: FIFTY HURT DYNAMITE EXPLOSION AT BAS OBISPO. » Many More Laborers Reported Miss ing—Blast of Many Tons Pre maturely Goes Off. Colon, Dec. ,12.— a/ giant {blast of dynamite, prepared for firing, was prematurely exploded in the workings at Baa Obispj to-day. Ten men were killed and fifty injured. It may be that others have been killed, for the debris is piled up in ah direction? B^ OU»g< cut is about thirty miles from Color, and the shock of the explosion was distinctly felt here. Many reports are current as to the cause of the- accident, but the official version from Culebra. which gives the estimate of ten killed and fifty wounded, says that during the loading of the last hole of the blast, the dynamite in this cutting was discharged, and the remaining twenty-two tons were exploded by concussion. The holes had not been connected electrically, as the discharge of the blast was set for 5 o'clock in the afternoon. The last hole was being loaded under the supervision of one of the most efficient powder men 'in the employ of the com mission. A passenger train h*d Just passed when th? <-xi>lo<=iun occurred, but it wa? not damaged. Most of the victims art. Spaniard?. Relief trains were sent to the scene of the accident. •and one which returned here several hours latf-r brought back the report that forty-five of the injured had been sent to AACOn Hospital. The officials on the train said I • ■ en dead had been found, while many others in the gang of a hundr.d and twenty who were employed in the cut were missing It wns also reported by the trainmen that the explosion was due to a passing steam shovel. which h.>,,k< d the wire leading to the immense charge of dynamite. Whether or not this was the 'cause of the accident, a • us shovel and crew, which happened to be on th<- sc-ne. were practically buried under the mas? of rock and earth throw n up. i Jnngs were soon searching for the dead an 1 a^sistiris the wounded.

V PRESIDENT READY TO ANSWER CONGRESS AWAITING ACTION ON HIS MESSAGE. Censure WißDrmt Fire from White House Use of the Secret Sen Defended. {Tram The Tlßnui* Bureau. ] Washington. Dec. 12.— The President has ?ath« "re.! his ammunition, made his final inspection of his ordnance and men and is now resting on his arms awaiting the action of Congress with regard to that portion of his annual message which dealt v. Ith the Secret Service. The mer* appointment of committees to consider what ac tion should be taken regarding the messasre will not>*»« noticed by him. but any act which par takes of the nature of censure of the Executive will draw tlie fire of th» White H«»us». and them will be nothing uncertain about Mr. Roosevelt's aim. ' This doe's not mer.n. as some eppear to tiling that the President !s vindictive, nor that "* purposes to vent any spleen on members of Congress for criticising his message. The rumors that the President has employed th Secret Servic men to shadow members of Con gress and that he has a list of their personal peccadilloes, or that he purpose? to hold their private lives up to obloquy, are. of course, simply absurd. Neither Is the inference warrant that the President has evidence against members of Congress of crimes which it is hi 3 duty as Chi?f Executive to prosecute. The facts are simply |hese: Th» President stated hi his message that "it :s not too much to say 'hat this amendment (the one insisted upon "by the House* has been of benefit only. and could be of benefit only, to the criminal classes." and. further, that fthe chief argument in favor of the provision was that Congressman did not themselves wish to be investigated by Secret Service men." etc. MAY 

REPLY IN SPECIAL MESSAGE. Now. if either boose of Congress shall see fiS to take action which implies censure on th» President for these statements, he will deem it not only hia right but his duty to adviaa Congress in a special message of all the rea sons which prompted him to make the observa tions and to urge the removal of the restric tions which the House was responsible far placing on the usefulness of this branch of the government. The facts which the President will thus bring to the attention of Congress, and incidentally make public, in so far a? they deal with the conduct of members of Congress. will touch only their official lives, and. while his friends say that it is unlikely that he will show any absolute malfeasance in office on their part, he will be compelled to show relationships between certain members and certain large in terests which made necessary some tn-»estiga tion by the Secret Service. 11 may. be furtlier I stated that in the-onb hrstance -J^here it tas deemed necessary to employ Secret Service men to shadow a member of Congress, he -vis in dicted and subsequently convicted. The correspondence which William R. He*rs£ yaw fit to publish during the campaign is pointed to as an indication that some members Of Congress have questionable relations. That certain facts have come to the attention of the President which placed upon him the necessity of utilizing the Secret Service men to protect the interests of the government is equally true. Those in possession of the facts assert that there will be no doubt whatever in th« mind of the public, once ft has learned the course and the motives of the President, that thf conduct of the Secret Service has been right and proper and that the Chief Executive was wholly warranted in the remarks contained In hi"? message. la any event, the President is entirely ■willi-'.c to leave the verdict to the American people. It ts realized, of course, that Congress may expunge* the entire special message on the subject from lts records, but that will not make the slightest difference to the President. He holds himself responsible to the people, not to Congress, and if he is satisfied that the people understand that his course has been in all respects Ju»tiflab!» and proper it will be a matter of complete In difference to him what action Congress may take. For the present the Executive 's merely waiting to see what the course of Congress trill be. but if it undertakes to "impeach" the ac curacy 5 of his statements h- will, it is said, promptly proceed to "make good." USE OF 

SECRET SERVICE FORCE. Incidentally, if is of interest to note that lawyers hold that the "violations of law" in th» employment of the Secret Service men have ex isted only in th-» imaginations of the lawmakers. The law provided a certain sum for "the sup pression of counterfeiting and the protection of the President." It contained no provision, how aver, which forbade the employment of the sam» men who might one week be engaged in sup pressing counterfeiting from ferreting out land frauds or investigating the Beef Trust th» next. Congress also placed at the disposal of several departments funds with which to carry on the suppression of frauds and violations of the federal statutes. Most of the Secret Service men are per diem errployes. When. f«>r instance, the Department t«f Justice required men t» obtain evidence of the violations of federal stat utes, it called on th«» chief of the Secret ---rvice for men. and he detailed such operatives as h« could spare, their remuneration for the tim* they were working for th- Department of Jus tice being paid out of the fund appropriated for its purpose, which avoided any violation of th» law. This was the custom before the llous»? pro vision of last year was enacted. It was not only in violation of no law. but it operated for the utmost economy. For instance. In the fiscal year Of 1907 the COM Of the Secret Service, for Its combined work for the Treasury, suppressing counterfeiting, etc.. and for tht» Depart:- of Justice, amounted to $14^.000. while in the last year, the Department of Justice being unable. under the House rrovlsion. to obtain the use of Secret Service men and thus compelled to em ploy a force of Its own. the, cost of the two forces exceeded that of the year before by approxi mately $100,000. The rumor that the President employed -■.-•(■ Service men to watch the personal conduct o£ members of Consrren? appears to have srron-a out of the misjruMed enterprise of a member of tht local police force. This man sought to ob tain an increase el pay for District of Columbia policemen. Failing: to do so. he undertook to shadow a number of members of Congress. H» obtained evidence, as he believed, to Insure tha increase of j>ay. but hen he laid it before his superior he was dismissed from th» service. Nothing ev?r came of his efforts, but some members of Congress learned that they had been shadowed nnd they immediately assumed that It was by Secret Service men acting unJejl
