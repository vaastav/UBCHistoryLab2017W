It Handles State Question With Ability. rrigation Practically Discussed and Strongly Favored. NOTHING ABOUT 

TERRITORIES. President Roosevelt sent his first annual mescage to congress at noon today. Tho document Is an able state paper and consists of about 28.000 ords. It la Impossible for The Cltlsen to publish the message In full in one Issue, and the following ex- tiacta are given, a follows: To the Benito and House of Represen tative: The congress assemble this year under the shadow of a great calamity. On tho ilxth of September, President MrKlnley van shot by an anarchist while attending the Pan-American Ex position at Buffalo, and died In that city on the fourteenth of thnt month. Of the last seven elected presidents, he la tho third who tins been murdered, and the bare recital of thla fart Is sufficient to Justify grave alarm among all loyal American cltltens. Moreover, tho circumstances of this, the third assassination of an American presi dent have a peculiarly sinister signif icance. Roth President Lincoln and President Oarfleld were killed by as sanslna of type unfortunately not uncommon In history; President Lin coln falling a victim to the terrible passion aroused by four yeara of civil war, and President Oarfleld to tho re vengeful vanity of a disappointed office-seeker. President McKlnley was killed by an utterly depraved criminal belonging to that body of criminals who objact to all governmenta, good and bad alike, who are against any form of poiular liberty If It I guaran teed by even the most Just and liberal law, and who are aa hostile to the upright exponent of a free people's sober will a to the tyrannical and Irresponsible despot. It I not too much to say that at the time of President McKlnley'e death he was the most widely loved man In all the United Btatea; wlille wo have never had any public man of hi pos ition who ha been o wholly free from the hitter anlmnsltle Incident to publlo life. Ill political opponets were the first to bear tho heartiest and most generous tribute to the broad kindliness of nature, the sweet nes and gentleness of character which ao endeared him to hla close assoclatea. To a standard of lofty In tegiity In public life he united the tender iffectlona and homo virtues which are all-Important In tbe make up of national character. A gallant soldier In the great war for the union. he also shone aa an example to all our people because of his conduct In the most sacred and Intimate of home rela tlona. There could be no personal hatred of bim, for be never acted with aught but consideration for the wel fare of otbera. No one could fall to respett bim who knew him in public or private life. Tho defenders of those murderous criminals who seek to ex cuse their criminality by asserting that It la done for political ends, inveigh against wealth and political power. But for th's assassination even this base apology cannot be urged. President McKlnley waa a man of moderate means, a man whose stock sprang from the sturdy tiller of the soli, who had himself belonged among the wage workers, who had entered the army as a private soldier. Wealth was not struck at when the president was assassinated, but tho honest toll which Is content with moderate gains after a life time of unremitting labor. largely In the service of the public. Still less wnr power struck at In the senso that power Is Irresponsible or centered in the hands of any one Indi vidual. The blow waa not aimed at tyranny or woalth. It waa aimed at ono of the etrougost champions the wage worker ha ever had: at ono of tho most faithful representative of tho aystom of public right and rep resentative government who has ever risen to public ofnre. President Mc Klnley filled that political office for which tho entire peoplo vote, and no president not even Lincoln himself waa ever more earnestly anxious to represent the well thought-nut wishes of the people: his one anxiety In every crisis was to keep In closest touch with tho peoplo to And out what they thought and to endeavor to give ex pression to their thought .after having endeavored to guide that thought aright. He had Just been reelected to the presidency because the majority of our cltlxene, the majority of our far mers and wage workers, believed that he had faithfully upheld their Interests for four yeara. They felt themselves In closo and Intimate touch with him They felt that he represented ao well and ao honorably all their Ideals and aspirations that they wished him to continue for another four yeara to represent them. And this was the man at whom the assassin st'urk! That there might be nothing lacking to complete the Judas like infamy of his act, he took advan tage of an occasion when the presi dent was meeting the people goner- ally: and advancing as If to take the hand outstretched to him In kindly and brotherly fellowship, he turned the noble and generous confidence of the victim IntJ an opportunity to strike the fatal blow. There Is no baser deed In all the annals of crime. The shock, the grief of the country, are bitter In the minds of all who saw the dark days, while the president yet hovered between life and death At last the light was stilled in the kindly eyes and tho breath went from the Hps trat even in moital agony ut tered no word save of forglvenesa to his murderer, of love for his friends, and of .infaltertng trust In the will of the Most High. Such a death, crown ing the jrlory of such a life, leave us wltb Inflmto sorrow, but with such pride In what he had accomplished and In h's own personal character, that we feel the blow not aa struck at him. but as struck at tho nation. We mourn a good and great president who Is dead; but while we mourn we are lift ed up by the splendid achievements of his life and the grand he, oihni with which be met bia death. When we turn from the mnn to the nation, the harm done, Is so great as to excite our gravest apprehensions and to demand our wisest and most reso lute action. This criminal was a pro fessed anarchist, Inflamed by the teachings of professed anarrhlsta. and probably a 'no by the reckless utter ances of loose who, on the stump and in the public press, appeal to the dark and evil tpirlta of malice and greed, envy and sullen hatred. The wind ts sowed by the men who preach such doctrines, and they cannot escape their shire of responsibility for the whirlwind that la reaped. This sp piles alike to the deliberate dema gogue, to the exploiter of senratlonal lum, and to the crude and foollkh via lonary who, for whatever reason, apologises (or dim or excite aimless discontent. The bio was aimed not at thla pret- Usnt. hut at all presidents; at every rymbol of government. President Me. Klnley wis ns emphatically the embod- j Iment nf the popular will of the nation expressed tl rough the forms of luw as a New KtiKland town meeting Is In similar fanhioa tho embodiment of tbe law aid ling purpose and practice of the peoplo of the town. On no con ceivable trcuiy could the murder ofj i iiv i '-niut-iii in- urci'lHCfi ns flUC lo . protest ngsltmt "Inequalities In the social order,' save as the murder nf all tlio freemen engaged In tho town meet ing could be accepted a a protect against Innt social Inequality which put n mil'iactor in Jail. Anar by I no more an expression of "social dis content" thsn p'cklng pocket or wife hcntlng The anarchist, and especially the an archist In tho United Slates. Is merely ono typo of criminal, more dangerous than any other because he represents tho same depravity In a greater do gioo. Tho man who advocates anar chy dlref ly or Indirectly, In any shape or fnsh'on. or the man who apologizes for anarchists and their deeds, mRkes himself morally accessory to murder bef.iie tho fact. Tho anarchist is a fTlminal vhn perverted Instincts lead him to prefer confuflon and chaos to tho mont beneficent form of social orcb-r. HI protest of concern for the worklngm n Is outrageous in Its Im pudent falsity: for If the political In stitutions of this country do not afford opportunl'y to every honest and Intel ligent son of toll, then the door of hope Is forever closed against him. Tho anarchlHt Is everywhere not mere ly tho enemy of system and progress, but the demlly foe of liberty. If ever anarchy Is triumphant. Its triumph will last for but ono red moment, to bi succeeded for age by the gloomy nliiit of iltspotlsm. For the anarchist himself, whether hp proacVa or practices his doctrines, we need not have ono particle more concern than for any ordinary murder er. Ho la not tho victim of social or political lnjuatlco. There are no wrongs to remedy In hi case. Tho cause of hi criminality Is to be found in his own evil passions and In the evil conduct of thoo who urge him on not In tho failure by other or by tho stato to do Justice to him or his. flu is a malefactor and nothing else. Ho Is In no sense, In no shape or way, a "product of social conditions," save a a highwayman la "produced" by tho fact that an unarmed man happens to have a purse. It t a travesty upon the groat end holy names of liberty and freedom to permit them to bo In voked In auch a reuse. No man or body of men preaching anarrtilstlc doctrine should be allowed at large sny more than If preaching the murder nf snmo apeclfled private Individual. Anarchistic speechs. writings, and meetings nre essentially seditious and treasonable. I carneriily recommend to tho con cress that In the exercise of Its wise discretion It should take Into consider ation tho coming to thi country of snnrchlsts nr peieon professing prin ciples hoitllo to all government and InMlfylng tne murder of all those plac ed In authority. Such Individual ar. ttioao who not long ngo gathered In open meeting to glorify the murder of Kin Humbert of Italy perpetuate a crlmo, and the law should ensure their rigorous punishment. They and those like them should ho kept nut of this country; and If found here they should be promptly deported to tho country from whence they came; and far reaching p ovlslon should he made for the punishment of those who stay. No matter fails more urgently for the wlnest thought of congres. The federal court should be given iurlsdicti'in over any man who kills ir attempts to kill a president or any man who by the const'tutton or by law is In line of succession for the presidency, while the punishment for sn unsucccKsfiil attempt should he pro oortloned to the enormity of the of fense against our institutions. Anarchy is a crlmo against the whole human race; and all mankind should band against the anarchist. Ills crime should be made, an offense agalnit the law of nations, like piracy and that form of man stenllng known aa th .ilnvo trade; for it is of far blacker Infimy than either. It should bo so declared by treaties among all clvlllxed power. Burh treaties would give to the federal government tho power nf (If fling with tho crlmo A gtim commentary upon tho folly of tiio anarch I at position wag afforded by tho attitude nf the law toward this very criminal who had Just taken tho life of the president. Tho people would have torn him limb from limb If it had not been thM tho law ho defied waa at once Invoked In his belinlf. So far from his deed being committed on bo half of the peoplo against tho govern- eminent, the government wa obliged at once to exert It full police power to save hi in from Inatnnt death at the band of the people. Moreover, hi deed worked not the slightest disloca tion In our governmental system, and the danger of the recurrence of such deeds, no matter how great It might grow, would work only In tho direc tion of strengthening and giving harsh ness to tho force of order. No man will ever bo restrained from becoming president by any fear as to his per sonal safoty. If the rink to the presi dent's life became great.lt would mean that tho office would more nnd more come to l.e filled by men of a spirit which won' 1 make them resolute and merciless In dealing with every friend of disorder. This gieat country will not fall into anarchy, and if anar chists should ever become a serious menace to it Institutions, they would not merely be stamped out, but would Involve in their own ruin every active or passive sympathiser with their doc trlnes. Tho American people are slow to wrafh, but when their wrath Is once kindled It burns like a consum Ing flame The president thrn review the prosperous condition of the notion and the rapid Inoreaxe of wealth by all the people. He favor the conservative control of the laigo corporations of the roun'.rv. On thi subject he says: "There is a widespread conviction In the minds of the American people that the great corporations known as trusts are in certain of their features and tendencies hurtful to the general welfare. This springs froni no spirit of envy or iincharltablcnoss, nor lack of pride In the great Industrial achievements that have placed tills country at tho head of tho nations struggling for commercial mpreniacy. It does .lot rest upon a lack of Intelli gent appreciation of tho necessity of meeting changing and changed condi tions of tiude with new methods, nor upon Ignorance of the fact that com bination of capital In the effort to ac cotiipllHh g.eat things Is necessary when the world's progress demands that great things ho done. It la based upon sincere convi it ion thnt combtna tlcn and concentration should bo. not prohibited, hut supervised nnd within reaHonaiile limits controlled, and In my JudKtiient this conviction is rlcht." 

FOREST RRESERVE3. The president favors protection of the forest., and gays: "Public opinion throughout the Unit ed Stat, h has moved sti-uillly toward a Just uppn-clation of tho value of for ests, wliolier plunti'd or of natural growth The great part played by them in the creation ami maintenance of the national wealth Is now more fully real ized than ever before. "WIho forest protection doe not mean the withdrawal of forest re source, whether of wood, water or grot., fio'ii contributing their full share to 'be welfare of the people, but, on tin contrary, gives the assur ance of larger and more certain sup plies. Tbe fundamental Idea of for estry I the perpetuation nf forest by use. Forest protection I not an end of Itself; :t is a means to In Tease and sustain the resomces nf our country and the industries w nlch depend upon them. Th-' preset atlon of foret is an Imperative business necessity. We have rom to see (Parly that what ever destroys the forest, except to tnnko way for agriculture, threaten" our well being. "The practical usefulness of the na tional for"M reserves to the mining, grazing. In Igatlon, nnd other Inter ests nf the legions In which the re serves lie bas led to a widespread de mand by tne people nf tho west for their protection and extension. The forest '.-ofTVes will Inevitably be of atlll grea'r use In the future than In the past. Addition should be made to them whenever p:actlrahle. and their usefulness should b Increased by a thoroughly buslncsMIke management " 

FAVOR3 IRRIGATION. "The forests alone cannot, however. fully regulate and conserve the waters of tho arid region. Groat storage woik are necessary to equalize the flow of streams nnd to Kave the flood water. Their fn:intrurtlon ha been conclus ively shown by an undertaking too vast for private effmt. Nor can It bo best nccimpllKhcd by the Individual states acting alone. Far reaching In terstate problems are Involved; and the resource of single states would often be Inadequate. It la properly a national function, at least In some of Its features. It Is as right for the national government to make the streams and rivers of tho arid region useful by engineering works for water storage as to msko useful the rivers and harbor of the humid region by engineering works nf another kind. Tho storing of the floods In resorvolrs at the 'leadwators of our river Is but an enlargement of our prenent policy of river control, under which levee aro built on the lower reaches of tho same streams The government should construct and maintain these reservoir as it doea othor public works. Where their purpose i to regulate the flow of stream, the water should be turned freely Into the channel In the dry season to take tho same course under tho samn laws as the natural flow, 'The reclamation of the unsettled arid public land present a different problem. Here it I not enough to regulate the flow of streams. The ob lect of tho government Is to dispose nf the land to settlers who will build homo upon It. To accomplish this object water must he brought within their rea. h. "Whoever controls a stream prac tically controls tho land It rendeis productive, nnd the doctrine of pri vate ownership of wnter apart from land cannot prevail without causing enduring wiong. The recognition of such ownership, which has been per mitted to grow up In the arid regions, should gi.'e way to a more enlight ened and larger recognition of the right of the public in the control and disposal of tho public water upplles. Law founded upon condition obtain ing In humid regions, whore water Is too abundant to Justify boarding It, have no proper application In a dry lountry "In tho mid slates the only right to water which hould be recognized I thnt of iiHC. In irrigation this right should ottnrh to the land reclaimed and bo Inscpnrable therefrom. Grant ing perpetual water rlghta to others than user, without compensation to the public. Is open to all the objec tions which apply to giving awav per petual franch'ses to the public utilities of cities. A few of the western state have alrei.lv recognized this, and have Incorporated In their constitution the doctrine of perpetual state owner ship of water." Notice to Lawyer.
