wv THE NATIONAL TEIBUNE:' "WASHINGTON, DL ft," THURSDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1S93. TTJE " IfESSAGE President Cleveland's Views on Mat ters of National Importance. President Cleveland opened his annual Mes tgo to Congress, which assembled duly on Mondstv, Dec 4, by contmendiiip to that body a careful examination of the detailed statements and well-supported recommendations contained in iho reports of tho lioads of Departments. 

FOREIGN KELATIONS. Tho President declares that while during tho past year our foreign relations have not always been frco from complexity, uo embar-ras-inp situation at present remains that will not yield to the spirit of fairness and love of justirc. Ho declares that there is ample pro tection for American interests in Brazil. He fails to fco any reasonable grounds for recogni tion. as belligerents, of tho insurgents. The Convention between our Government and Chile, having for its object the settlement and adjiistnirnt of tho demands of tho two countries against each oilier, has been made cfl'cctivo by tho organization of tho Claims Commission provided for. Jt is believed that under tho recent amend ment of tho Chinese act, extending tho time for registration, tho Chinese laborers thereto entitled, who desire to reside in this country, will now avail themselves of tho rcuewed privi lege thus nfliiidcd of establishing by lawful pro cedure their light to remain, and that thereby tho necessity of enforced deportation may be to a great degree avoided. Ntgdtiations are now in progress botween Great Britain and the United States with a view to Mich concurrent action as will make theawaid and reflations agreed upon by tho Benin: Sea Tribunal of Arbitration practically effective; ind it is not doubted that Great Britain will co-operate freely with this country for tho accomplishment of that purpose. The dispute growing out of the discriminat ing tolls imposed in the Welland Canal upon cargoes of cereals bound to and from tho lake ports of the United States was adjusted by tho substitution of a more equitable schedule of charges. 

NICARAGUA AND THE CANAI Nicaragua has recently passed through two revolutions, the party at first successful having in turn been displaced by ano' her. Our newl appointed Minister, by his timely good olliees, aided in a peaceful adjustment of the contro versy iuvolved in the first conflict. Tho large American interests established in that couutry in connection with tho Nicaragua Canal were not molested. The canal company lias, unfor tunaloly. become financially seriously embar rassed, but a generous ticatmeut has been ex tended to it by the Government of Nicaragua. Information received of maltreatment suf fered by an inoffensive Amcrcan woman eu gaged in missionary work in Turkish Koorlis tan was followed bj-6Uch representations to the Porte as resulted in the issuance of orders for the punishment of her assailants, the removal of a delinquent official, and the adoption of measures for the protection of our citizens en gaged in mission and other lawful work. THE HAWAIIAN MUDDLE. Of the Hawaiian dillicully the President ays: It is hardly necessary for me to state that the quc-tions arising from our relations with Hawaii have caiieil "t-rioiis embarrassment. Jtiit prior to the installation of the promt Administration the exiMiii" Government oflluwnii hud been suddenly ot rthrnu ti, mid a tn-ntv of annexation had been J negotiated between the l'lovisionnl Government of tlt'i Iblands mid the UuiledSlHle-, nnd submitted to the Senate for ratificitirti. This tienty I withdre w for examination, and di-pateiied Hon. James II. Biount, of Gtorg-n. to Honolulu as n Special Com missioner to mke an impartial investigation of the circumMnures attending the change of Gov eminent, and of alt tlio conditions bearing upon the subject of the tfHiy. After it thorough and exhaustive cxnmiiiiilioli Sir. Hlhuut submitted to nie his report, -h-wiilg beyond nil question that the Constitutional Government of Hawaii bud been subverted with the nctivc aid of our representative to that Government and through the intimidation eaused by the pre-ence of an armed liavnl force of UietJiiited StHte which was lnhded for that purpose at (ho instance of our Minister. Upon the facti de Teloped it fct-enied to me the only honorable course for our Govern:ncnt to pursue was to undo the wrong that bnd leeii done by thoe representing us and to restore ns fur at practicable tbe ntntus. ex ist In i; at the lime of our forcible intervention. Willi a vicw-of itccomplislriig Ibis result within tho coiih.ilulion.il limits of Executive power, Knd recognizing: ail our obligations and respon-d--bl I it lea growing out rif any changed conditions brought ihout by our unjustifiable ititcrferciice.our prei'iit 31i!ii-ter i Honolulu has received Appro priate instructions to that end. Thus fur no Siifor--ftiation of tberccotiiidialiiueut of any definite re sults has been received from him. Additional ndviee are oon expected. When received ibt-y will be pmniptly tent to tho Con gress, together with nil other information at bund, accomp.inieil by n special lixecuiive message; fully detailing all the facts mccvulry to a complete un derstanding of the. ca-e. and presenting a hUtory of all the nia'erial events leading up to the present situation. In arcoidauce with the spirit of tho resolution adopted by Congress in the Spring of lb'JO, tho International 'American Conference of Wash ington by resolution expressed the wish that all controversies between the Republics of America and the Nations of Europe might be settled by arbitration, and that the Governments repre sented in the Conference might communicate this desire to all other friendly powers. Tho President takes signal pleasure in layine be fore Congress a Parliamentary resolution cor dially sympathizing with tho purpose in view. THE TIJEAfcUKY. Of the condition of the Treasury tbe Presi dent says: Tiie Secretary of tho Treasury reports that tho receipts of the Government from nil source-during the li-cnl year ended June 30, 1S1J3, amounted to StGl.TiG.OGlJl.and iisexpeuditurestoSJVJ.37t.674 29.

Of the financial situation tho President says: The recent repeal of tbe provision of law requir ing the purchase of silver bullion by the Govern ment us a feature of our monetary ccbeuiu iias siauean cnllre change in tbe complexion of our currency affairs. I do not doubt that tiie ultimate result of tins hctiou will be most nululary mid fur reaching. Of course, after the recent financial perturbation, time Is necessary for the re-cntnblisliment of busi Bcm conti Jence. When, however, through this restored confidence tbe money which has been frightened into hoarding-places Is returned to trade and enterprise, a survey of the situation will probably disclose a safe path leading to u perma nently sound currency, abundantly sufficient to Beet every requirement of our increasing popula tion and business. The Superintendent of Immigration, through the Secretary of tho Treasury, reports that daring the last fiscal year there arrived at our orts 440,793 immigrants. Of these 1.0G3 were .sot permitted to land under tho limitations of tbe law, and 577 were returned to the countries from whence they camo by reason of their having become public charges. The total ar rivals were 141,034 less than for tho previous year. In his references to tho Army and Navy tho President goes over the ground coveted by tho statements and recommendations of his Secre taries. Tho President condemns tho fco system as applicable to tho compensation of United States attorneys, marshals, clerks of Federal courts and United States commissioners. The President heartily joins tho Attorney Gcueral in recommending legislation fixing degrees of the crime of murder within Federal jurisdiction, as has been done in many of tho States; authorizing writs of error on behalf of tbe Government in cases where filial judgment 1 is rendered aiuiiust the sulliciency of an iudict socut or against tho Government upon any j atber question arising before actual trial; lim iting tho right of review in cases of felony punishable only by fine and imprisonment to the Circuit Court of Appeals, and making speedy provision for tho construction of such prisons and reformatories as may bo necessary for tho confinement of United States convicts. Tho business of tho United States mails indi cates with absolute certainty tho condition of tho business of the country, and depression in financial affairs inevitably and quickly reduces the postal revenues. Therefore a largor dis crepancy than usual betweon the Postofiice receipts and expenditures is-tho expected and unavoidable result. 

PENSIONS. Of pensions the President saya: The Secretary of the Interior has the supervision of so many important subjects that his report ia of especial value and interest. On tho 30ib day of June, 1893. there woro on tho pension-rolls 96C.012 names, an Increase of 89.914 over tho number on the rolls Juno 30, 1892. Of these there were 17 widows and daughters of Revo lutionary soldierx. 8G survivors of tho war of 1812, 5.425 widow s of soldiers of that war, 21,518 survivors nnd widows of the Mexican war, 3,882survivorsand wuloMsof Indians wins. 284 Army Nurses, nnd 475,- G15survivois. and widows and children of deceased soldieisaud tailors oftbe war of the rebellion. Tho latter number represent those pensioned on nc eount of disabilities or dentil resulting from army and iiiivv Huivict. The number of neraons remain ing on tho rolls June 30. IS93. who were pensioned under the act of June 27, 1890, which allows pen sions on account of death and disability not charge able to army ervice, was 439,155. Tho number added to the rolls during tho year was 123.G31, and the number dropped was 33.G90. Tbe first payment on pensions allowed during tho year amounted to S33.75C.519.9S. This includes ar rears, or tbe accumulation between tho titno from u.iich the allowance of pension dates and the time of actually granting the certificate. Although the law of 1S90 permits pensions for disibdities not related to military service, yet ns a reqiii-iile to its benefits a disability must exit in cap.icilnting applicants "from the performance of manual labor to such a degree as to rentier them unable to earn a support." The execution of this law in ite early stages doc? not seem to have been in accord with its true intention; but toward tbe close of the last Admnustialioii an authoritative construction was given to the statute, and since that tunc lids cou-triietion tins been followed. This bits bad the effect of limiting tbe operation of tho Inw to its intended purpose. The diieovery having been made that in my names had been put upon ihe pension-roll by means of wholesale nnd gigantic frauds, the Commi-sioner suspended pay ments upon a number of pensions which seemed to be fraudulent or unauthorized pending a com plete examination, giving notice to tho pensioners, in order that they might have an opportunity to establish, if possible, the justice of their claims notwithstanding apparent invalidity. Tiii", I uudei.-tand, is the practice which has for along time prevailed in the Pension Bureau; but after entering upon these iccciit investigations, tbe Commissioner modified this rule so as not to allow, until after u complete examination, interference. w ith the payment of a pension apparently not alto gether void, but which merely had been fixed at a rate higher than that authorized by law. I am unable to undeisland why frauds in the pension-rolls should not be exposed and corrected with thoroughness anil vigor. Uvcry name fraud ulently put upon thoe rolls is n wicked imposition upon the kindly sentiment in -which pensions bnve their origin; every fraudulent pensioner has be come a bad citizen; every false oath in support of a pension has made pcijury more common, and (alse and undeserving pensioners rob the pcop'o not only of their money, but of the patriotic senti ment which the survivors of n war, fought for the preservation of the Union, ought to inspire. Thou sands of neighborhoods have their well-known fraudulent pensioner", nnd recent developments by tho Unrcaii establish appalling conspiracies lo nccomplish pension frauds. By uo means the least wrong done is to brave and deserving pensioners, who certainly ought not to bo condemned lo such association. Those who attempt in the line of duty to rectify the- wrongs should not be accused of enmity or indifference to tho claims of honest veterans. The sum expended on account of pensions for the year ended June 30. 1893, was 8l3C.710.4ii7.14. The Commissioner estimates that S1C5.000.000 will be required to pay pensions during the yeur end ing June 30, 1894. THE 

INDIANS. The solution of tho Indian problem depends very largely upon good administration. The personal fitness of agents. and their adaptability to tho peculiar duty of caring for their wards is of tho utmost importance. Secular education and moral and religions teaching must bo important factors in any effort to save the Indian and lead him to civil ization. Tho relinquishment of tribal rela tions and the holding of land in severalty may, in favorable conditions, aid this consummation. The vast area of land which, but a shorty time ago, constituted tho public domain is' rapidly falling into privato hands. 15ut it is certain that in the transfer tho beneficent in tention of tho Government to supply from its domain homes to tho industrious and worthy home-Seekers is often frustrated. The Presi dent deplores this, and calls attention to the Secretary of Interior's recommendations. The time has conio when efficient measures should be taken for the preservation of our forests from indiscriminate and remediless de struction. AomcnLTunE. Tho President reviews the report of the Sec retary of Agricultuie. The exports of agri cultural products from the United Statos for the fiscal year ending' June 3. 1892, attained the enormous figure of $SOO,000.000 in round numbers, being 7ri.7 per cent, of our total ex ports. In the last fiscal year this aggregate was greatly reduced, hut nevertheless readied $015,000,000, being 75.1 per cent, of all American commodities exported. In each State and Territory an Agricultural ExperiiucutStation has been established. Theso stations, by their very character aud name, are the proper agencies to experiment with and test new varieties of seeds; aud yet there i.sau indiscriminate! aud wasteful distribution by legislation and legislators, answering no pur pose unless it ho to remind constituents that their representatives are willing to remember them with gratuities at public cost. So he ad vices tho stoppage of promiscuous free-seed dis tribution. 

CIVIL SERVICE. As to civil s'rvico the President says: The continued intelligent execution of the Civil Service law ami tbe increa-ing approval by the people of its operation are nio-t gratifying. The recent extension of its limiiatious and regulations lo tha employes at free-delivery po-toflices. which lias been honestly and promptly accomplished by tbe Commission, whi the hearty co-operation of the I'o-tmantcr-Gcnernl, is an immensely import nut advance in the usefulne-s of the system. I Hiu, if po-iihle, more than ever convinced of the incalculable benefits conferred by the Civil Service law. not only in its i fleet upon tbe public erviec, but uImi, what is even more important, in its eil'ect in elevating tho tone of political life generally. THE 

TARIFF. On the subject of tariff reform tho President says : After a hard struggle larllT reform is directly be fore us. Nothing ro important claims our attention mid nothing so clearly presents itself as both an oppoittiuity and a dutj an opportunity todeservo the gratitude of our fellow citizens and a duty im posed upon us by our oft-repealed professions ami by the emphatic mandate of the people. After full dlcu-hion our countrymen have Mpokeu in favor of this leform, and they have confided the work of its accomplishment lo the hands of those who arc HolfMiiuy pledged to it. If there is anything In the theory of a represen tation in public places of the jieople aud their de Mies, if public oilieurs arc really the servants of the peopif, and If political promiies and profes fious have any binding force, our failure to give the relief no long awaited will be sheer recreancy. Nothing should intervene to dinlract our attention or disturb our ff rt until this reform is accomplish ed by wise and careful legislation. While wo should .stancbly adhere lo the princl- file that only the necessity of revenue ju-tllles tho mpoBition of luritr duties and other Federal tax ation, and that they should be limited by strict economy, we cannot close our eyes lo the fact thhl conditions have grown up among ui which in justice and fairnes call for discriminating care In the distribution of such duties and taxation as tho emergencies of our Government actually demand. 'are ti Oil is the kind used in the production of Scott's Emul sion Hypophos phitesof Lime and Soda are added for their vital ef fect upon nerve and brain. No mystery surrounds this formula the only mystery is how quickly it builds up flesh and brings back strength to the weak of all ages. h will check Consumption and is indispensable in all wasting dis eases. Prepared by Scolt &. Bowne. If . Y. All drarclata. in mmn !!. i njji rB Norwegian (l tlr fiffc lis- Is Manifestly, if wo are to aid tho people directly through tariff reform, ono of its most obvious fea tures should be a reduction in present tariff charges upon the necessities of life. The benefits of such a reduction would be pilpable and substantial, seen aud felt by thousands who would be better fed and better clothed and better sheltered. Theso gifts should be the willing benefactions of n Govern ment whose highest function ia the promotion of the welfare of the people. Not less closely related to our pooplc's prosper- ity aud well-being is the removal of restrictions upon tho importation of tho raw materials neces sary to our manufactures. Tho world should bo open to our National ingenuity nnd enterprise. This cannot be while Federal legislation, through the iinpoMition of high tariff, forbids to American manufacturers ns cheap materials n thoio nued.by their competitors. It is quite obvious thnt, tho enhancement of the price of our manufactured products resulting from this policy not only coif fines tho market for these products within our own borders to the dircet disadvantage of our manu facturers, but also increases their cost to our citizens. The interests of labor are certainly, though in directly, involved in this feature of our tariff sys tem. Tho sharp competition nnd nctivo struggle among our manufacturers to supply tho limhed demand for their good", soon fill the narrow mar ket to which they nro confined. Then follows a suspension of work in mills nnd factories, a dis charge of employes, and distress in tho homes of our workingmeu. Even if the often disproved nsscrtion could bo made good that a lower rato of wnges would re sult from fiee raw materials nnd low tnriff dutie, tho intelligence of our workiugiMen leads them quickly to di.--covcr that their steady employment, permitted by free raw materials, is the mo-d im portant factor in their relation to tariff legislation. A mc'iMirc lias been prepared by the appropriate Congressional committee embodying tariff reform on the lines lieiein suggested, which will bo promptly submitted for legislative action. It is the result of much patriotic and unselfish woik, ami I bclicvo it deals with its subject consistently nml as thoroughly ns existing conditions permit. 1 am satisfied that the reduced tariff duties pro vided for in tho proposed legislation, added to ex isting internal revenue taxation, will, in tbo near future, though perhaps not immediately, produce sufficient revenue lo meet the needs of tho Govern ment. Tho committee, after full consideration, nnd to provide against n temporary deficiency which may exwt before the biisine-s of the country adjusts itself lo the new tariff schedules, have wisely em braced in their plan a few additional internal-revenue taxes, including a small tnx upon incomes derived from certain corporate investmenlH. These new assessments nro not only absolutely just and easily borne, but they bnve the further merit of being such as can be remitted without un favorable business disturbance whenever the neces sity of their imposition uo longer exists. In my great desire for tho success of this moastiro I cannot restrain the suggestion thnt its succcs can only be atlniued by means of unselfish counsel on the part of the friends of tariff reform aud as n result of their willingness to subordinate personal desires and ambitious to the general good. Tho local interests affected by the proposed reform nro so numerous and so varied that if all are Insisted upon the legislation embodying the reform must inevitably fail. In conclusion, my intense, feeling of responsi bility impells me to invoke for tho manifold inter ests of n generous and confiding people the most scrupulous care and to pledge my willing support lo every legislative effort forlliondvaiiccme.nl of tho greatness nnd prosperity of our beloved coun try. NEW 

TARIFF BILL. Characterized ly Sweeping: Reductions and Extensive Free Idst. The now tariff bill was mado public last week. As has been anticipated, it is a radical measure. Sweeping reductions aro mado in the duty on manufactured articles, aud upon the frco list arc articles that have always been protected from importation by moro or less prohibitive tariffs. The importance of the hill lies in the fact, also, that with House aud Sen ate and President Democratic, the changes which aro proposed stand an excellent chattco of being enacted into laws. The minority have had neitherlot nor parcel in tho framing of tho measure, but they have been allowed 10 days in which to prepare a minority report, and it can now bo predicted that this document will wave aloft, with un diminished enthusiasm, tho Hag of protection. The Democrat aro now wrestling with the internal revenue features of the bill, which arc important, because, in some way, tho deficit caused by tho enlargement of tho free list and tho reduction of duties will have to bo mado good. Thero is absolutely no protection per seo in tho bill. Asa matter of fact, the Committee seems to havo go no even beyond tho letter of its instruc tions in the National Democratic platform. If tho proposed measure wero to ho enacted into law as it at the present stands, without some in ternal revenue feature, such as an incomo tax, added, it would fail to meet the current expenses of the Treasury by at least $50,000,000, and, perhaps, $00,000,000. It is asserted by Some of tho members of the committee that, tho incomo tax will meet this eutiro defici ency. It is claimed by tho Republicans that every Secretary of tho Troasuary, from Aloxander Hamilton down to Mr. Manning, with thesingle exception of Secretary Walker, has advocated tho adoption of specific duties as the best method of protecting tho Government against fraud. Representative Uurrows pointed ont that when times nro hard and prices low, the ad valorem duty is also low, and thus tho im portation of foreign products is rendered easiest at tho very timo when the mills and foundries ought to bo giving labor to our own people. Chairman Wilson declares that specific duties lead to great frauds in administration, for count ing and weighing at the custom-house are done by the cheapest nnd most easily-corrupted labor, while ad valorem rates are assessed by the best paid and most responsible appraisers; that the ad valorem system has worked well in practice and is essentially the fair system, becauso it is a tax upon tho actual value of an article . Among tho heavy reductions wearing apparel is reduced from 82 per cent, to 40 per cent.; blankets, which also pay 82 per cent., are now brought down to 23, 30, and 35 per cent., and woolen cloths, which averaged 125 per cent, in the McKinley bill, aro placed at 40 per cent, in the now bill. Women's dress goodsaud carpets arc also relieved from tho heavy duty which has been imposed upon them; Brussels carpets being cut from SO to 30 per cent. Cotton goods show a reduction equally great, while iron and steel aro cut down to tho lowest possible margin. Steel rails aro now to come in at about $6 per tun instead of $13.41. Tin plate, which now pays a duty of 2 2 10 cents per pound, equivalent to an ad valorem duty of 73 per cent., is cut to 40 cents. Hay is reduced from $1 to $2 a ton. Po tatoes aro cut from 25 cents a bushel to 10 cents. Tho free list is very long. All the free articles in the McKinloy bill havo been lot alone. Wo give below tho most important of tho added list, with the duty under the existing law: Articles for the use of tho United States, coal, iron, and other ores, coke, ilax, hemp, clay, salt, binding twine, lumber, cotton ties, salt, mica, bacon, and hams (now five cents a pound), beef, mutton, and pork (each two cents a pound), bristles (10 cents a pound), cabbages (three cents each), cotton oil (30 cents a pound), cotton tics of iron or steel cut to lengths, punched or not punched, with or without buckles, for bailing cotton; cotton-seed oil (10 cents a gallon), egg (five cents perdozen), lard (two cents a pound), milk, fresh (live centH a gallon), plants, trees, shrubs, aud vines of all kinds commonly known as nursery stock, not specially provided for in this act (20 per cent, ud valorem) ; plows, tooth and disc harrows, harveatets, reapers, drills, mowers, horsemkos, cultivators, thrashing-machines, and cotton gins; soap, nil not otherwise specially pro vided for in this act (20 per cent, ad valorem); seeds of all kinds not specially provided for in this act (20 per cent, ad valorem); straw (30 per cent, ad valorem); tin ore, cassitcrito or black oxide of tin. and tin in bars, blocks, pigs, or grain or granulated (under the McKinloy law tin oro was on tho free list until tho 1st of last July); all wool of tho sheep, hair of tho camel, goat, alpaca, and other like animals, and all wool and hair on tho skin, noils, yarn waste, card waste, bur wasto. rags and Hocks, includ ing all wasto, or rags, composed wholly or in part of wool (11, 12, and 13 cents per pound, according to grado). Gen. Idlly Bead. Tho news of tho death of Gen. William Lilly, Pennsylvania's Ropresontativo-at-Largo, at his homo in Mauch Chunk, was received in Wash ington with much regret, for ho was well known and gouorally admired here. Gen. Lilly was born at Penn Yau, N, Y Juno 3, 1821. his father, Col. William Lilly, being a well-known citizen of western New York, who removed to Mauch Chunk in April,' 1838. t Ho became engaged in railroading and min ing, and took great intorest in military mat tors. Until tho Autumn of 18G2 Gen. Lilly was an l active Democrat. Sinco then ho had been a delegate to six National Republican Conven tions and to every Republican State Conven tion sinco 1803. Ho was a strong protective tariff man, and was chairman of tho New York Tariff Convention in 1881. Ho had been en gaged in tho mining of anthracite coal sinco 1859, was a life member of tho Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, the Ameri can Association for tho Advancement of Science, and of tho Society of American Mining En- ginoors.

OPENING ofogd:ngress. Scones Attending- tho 'OStavenlng- of Our National 3Bsta&B. Thcro were no nnusuihBranos attending tho jogulur opening of Cotcrrexn Since tho ad journment of the extrardifeBry session both Houses wore thoroughlysqpsired, now carpots putdown, the furnituroa'opnJishcd, and every thtntr madoto look frcsbjjVNBmcrous wero tho. , greet iugs exchanged in fcha.fionato before tho gavel of tho Vico-PrcsidsnttxiahQ uouy caitca tho members to order. Tho message reached, fjfchfe-?ISonate at 1:30 o'clock. The reading of Jthotiacssage was list ened to with tho closest vttea tion by tho Sena tors present, but scarcely a movement or a facial expression from ono of them indicated at any timo what impression it was making. Tho conclusion of tho reading, howovor, wa3 tho signal for a demonstration of hostility on tho part of the Republicans. Senator Gorman roscwhou the Reading Clork finished and moved tho printing of tho docu ment. Senator Cock roll followed with a formal motion, tho effect of which was merely to de fer for a brief time consideration of tho Presi dent's rccommcudntious The Republicans, howovor, at onco assumed that this was an attempt to shut them off from all opportunity to attack tho message. A heated discussion between Senator Cock rell and the Republican leaders was threatened, when Senator Gorman set matters straight by explaining that ho had uo intention of pre venting a discussion of the mossag'o, and would move to-morrow that an additional number of copies bo printed. This, he said, would give everyono an opportunity to mako speeches. There wero not nearly so many desks in tho Houso adorned with flowor3 as is usually tho case on tho opening of tho annual session of Congress. Messrs. Rusk and McKaig each re ceived a largo bunch of roses. Tho floor was less crowded nlso, but perhaps this was duo to the extra vigilance of tho doorkeepers in ex cluding unprivileged persons. Tho President's messago was listened to with much moro than ordinary attontion, caused doubtless by tho fact that so many topics of surpassing intorest wero discussed. A larger space than has heretofore been tho case in simi lar documents is devoted to foreign affairs. At the conclusion of this tho deaths of Rep resentatives Lilly and O'Neill wero announced, aud out of respect both Houses adjourned.
