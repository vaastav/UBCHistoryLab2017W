r., Hour-Treason --...We hare devote gpace of jate " development of thepolicjof tho Ad ministration rci'itire to slavery. i-That policy tras fairlj indicated In the Inaugural Address of President Lincoln, - the" election of his Cabinet, his message to Congress, the otit-ginngs of hia Secre- xaryot tar, antt the declarations of 'leading statesmen like Edttaed Evxeett and'JoHsCocKEixs, who were known to , possess his confidence and understood to reflect his opinions; but it is so atrocious, inhuman, and suicidal that many intel -ligent Eentuckians believed it impossible that even 'Abraham Likcolk, and the . Abolition agitators he had called around him, could contemplate it without horror. t T We cannot but hope that the accumu lated evidence of the purpose of the Ad v ministration at Washington to convert theirs into a free negro government, which vwe have from time to time placed before the public, had, prior to the appearance of the last message of Mr. Lincoln, con vinced the people of at least Southern Kentucky that the success of the North ern Armies in their State would. make them the subjects of a centralized des potism in which equality of the races is cardinal doctrine. .If. however, there, was one reader of the Courier who still doubted whether the North was given over to utter madness, and hoped for moderation, justice, and constitutional government in connection with the free State, the official enuncia tion of the policy of the Administration through President's message, which we hare published in full, and commented upon at length, must have dispelled his hopes and burned upon his brain the fear ful fact, that the people of the South, not now fighting for liberty, the right to eovcra themselves, 'their interests, their honor, ' and their independence alone, are engaged ?! a desperate struggle for existence, for should freedom bo given to four millions of slaves and arms put into their hands, then the question will not alone be which shall be the superior race, but which shall be exterminated! The President's message is fearfully - clear upon this subject, as we have shown. " It indicates only too e'early that not only is it intended to proclaim freedom to the slaves, but that social and political equal ity is to follow. And now comes the official report of Mr. Camzbon, Secretary of War, elabora ting discussing, setting forth with more pirticularity the policy of the adminis tration a policy so infernal that the En glish language contains no words to ex press the abhorrence it must excite in the breast of every human being over whose mind accursed fanaticism has not estab lished its. sway. Men cf Kentucky, in whose veins flows the blood of a gener ous andnoble ancestry, - whose fathers would have perished at the stake rather than submit to degradation, whose moth en would have torn you from their breasts and dashed you from the highest peak of your glorious mountains had they ever -dreamed that you would be such spiritless and craven things as to consent to live oa terms of equality with the emancipated slaves of your fellow citizens, read the recommendation of the Secretary of War of the Administra tion; and then prepare to meet the proc lamation for your degradation, the dis honor of your mothers, wives, and sweet hearts, and the indiscriminate massacre v of the old and the young, the innocent and the guilty, the unarmed, defenceless, and helpless, as those whose names you bear would meet it could they burst the cerements of the grave and stand in your placeBl v- - 1 Canada War novementi. The Mobile Advertiser states that the commander of the forces has proceded West to take the necessary eteps for placing that portion of the Province ia a state of defense It has been restored to call out the Provincial Militia for drill during the winter, and steps have been taken to erect some fortifications at weak points, for which purpose the Sappers and Miners at Halifax have been ordered to MontreaL The Gov ernment steamers will not winter at Que bec, but proceed to the Lakes, so that they can be employed, in case of an emergency, before the opening of the river navigation. Arms and ammunition are being forwarded from Quebec to the inland magazines. - The erection of new batteries has been eommeaced near the old fort at Toronto. Two "batteries will be erected, each to mount six heavy guns -rr- - ' : ' The Boston Post says: "a tun of powder, destined for the United States, was recently confiscated at Montreal" . : - The Toronto Leader,, a Government or gan, has the following: .

The defense of Toronto are now being rapidly strengthened in anticipation of the occurrence of any thing unpleasant in tha relwioBS of Great B.itaia with the neigh-Wl- R nubile At the old fort, eommand- ing Jha western.enti ance to the harbor and J the xauway -spproacaes to me ciiy, bb active preparations are being made. Tester day afternoon the work vras commenced of erecting a new battery of ten guns on the south eida of the barracks, overlooking the extensive warehouses of ihe Grand Trunk Railway, the Queen's warf and the channel. Two hundred men of the Thirtieth Regiment were detailed for the dutj, and nt three o'clock marched out to Trori:, rined with pick axes and shovels. They appeared quite jubilant at the prospect remote as we trust it is of actiTe operations in h field, and Bet about their' work, under the superintendence of an officer of the Rojal .engineer?, with a readiness and epmt char actenstic of the British poldier. The breastwork on which they are employed will extend alone nearly the whole south front -of the parade around, and will be a strong and formidable work. The guns to be mount d upon it or rather oenwa it are sixty pounders, wita one large Armstrong gun which will command nearly the whole harbor. The timber for the platforms, &c, is now on the ground. eawn and otherwise prepared for immediate use. mere is an old eathworK, with a three-gun battery, on this side of the fort, but it has for years been crumbling away, ana now uoes not rise more inaa tnreo leet - j 5 . .1 .1: . . above the surface of the parade ground. ' The battery has been dismantled and most of the wood earned off. The new earth work will be raised about ten feet inside of the old, and will have a base apparently of about twenty feet. There are now on the ground upward of twenty old smooth bore cannon, "honey combed" with rust, and long since condemn ed. The carraicres for the new metal ar rived by railway yeoterday.and were hauled to the barracks on Meters iiendris & ched- den's heavy wagons. The guns are expected to arriTe to-day or to-morrow, very little information with regard to the work is to be gained on the ground. The othcer in charge on being aeked by our reporter, said be knew little further than the facts that it was to be a ten eun battery, and that little he we8 not at liberty to communicate. The work is apparently to be puehed forward in great Basic, two Iiuuurcu ucu ucutg uoaireu every day for the purpose. They receive extra pay for the labor, and appear exceed ingly anxious to be employed. It ii reported at the garrison that it ia in tended to extend the fortifications along the I bank of the lake to the new fort, planting ba teries in .all for thirty-six heavy cannon; and that, m addition, a neavy oanery is io be erected on the northwest angle of the fort, overlooking the ravine and command ing the Great Western and Northern Rail ways. It is also reported tnat tents ior ten tnou- sand men are to be erected on the common, between the two forts; and that works are to be constructed at the eastern end of the city, somewhere in the neighborhood of the Dan river.. What truth there ism these ru mors we have no reason of judging, but they,rrobab!y arise from the fact of the eounL-il of militarv authorities lately held at Quebec, and the recent visit of His Ex- cellencv the Commander of the forces in this city. ' The Secretary of War and tne Pol icy of t be Lincoln Administration -The Slaves of "liebele" to bo Armed and Set Free. There are $1,000,000,000 worth of slave property in the "rebel" States; "the slave property in the South is justly sub jected to-all the consequences of this re bellious war ;" it would be madness to leave the Southern people in the posses- sion tneir slave property ; wnen tne slaves are taken from their masters, as the Government cannot hold them as property, and it would houseless and ex pensive to hold them as prisoners of war, M it is Oiz riglity aid may "became (he duty of the government to abjc and equip them, and employ (heir services against the rebels f and after the war, all such negroes will be justly entitled to freedom and the special protection of the Govern ment! These are some of the propositions of Mr. Camebos, the Secretary of War at Washington!. And Mr. Camxeon speaks f r the whole Administration. . If a majority of the Cabinet did not approve these recom mendations, Mr. Camebon would be promptly dismissed. If any one member of the Cabinet did not approve them, he would withdraw from the Administra tion. If the President himself did not agree with Mr. Camebojt, he would not lave 6ent this report to Congress at all. That Mr. Cajieeon speaks for the Prei dent and other members of the Cabinet, s admitted as a fact which cannot be de lied, by the friends of the Administra ion. The Louisville Journal of the 6th nst publishes the Beport, and says: . "As respects the question of slavery, the report confirms our worst apprehen sions. And the most grievous fact of all is that the report on this head can only be regarded as an expansion of what the President says in the same relation. . Hit report of the Secretary is of course sanctioned by the President. What is said by the one concerning slavery is but an illumination of what is said by the other. ; The Sec retary in this respect is no worse than the' President, and the President is no better than the Secretary.' : We demand of the people of Kentucky, that they read the message of the Presi dent and the Beport of hia Secretary both of which have been published in the Courier and we appeal to them by the memories of the past and the hopes of the future to meet the dreadful issue thrust upon thea with the spirit of men. ' The infernal purpose' of ( .the -tyrant Usurper and hii advisers is avowed.- Backed by the bayonets of his armies, the President feels strong enough to defy the latent patriotism of his section, and proclaims his lone-settled purpose to ! sweep away all the barriers of the Con stitution and all the defences of civil liberty. - And to the South, who foresaw his intentions and the effecls of Northern bnaticism, and barely in time to- k steps r the presvation of their liberties, he otnes with fiie and sword, proclaims .reedomto the slaves, and -u arms and equips " the emancipated negroes for the re-enactment of the dreadful scenes ot St Domingo. Men of Kentucky, you must take up arms for liberty, dearest boon of Heav en; but while hguting for the privileges of freemen, you must also strike with strong arms in defence of your wives and little ones, upon whom the Administra i ' tion proposes to turn loose an ignorant and licentious horde of slaves in whom lust and vengeance has been stimulated by abolition appeals, and into whose hands guns have been put by the agents of. a government which yet pretends to be civilized! Wherever this fiendish policy shall be carried out, which will bo on every foot of Southern soil where the armies of the administration shall get power, the inno cent and the guilty will suffer alike. The slaves of the loyal " and the " dis loyal" will alike be -emancipated and armed. And when the freed negroes shall be turned loose, - who believes they rill discriminate between the friends of he North and those of the South ? The issue is no longer disguised. The lour in trhich it must be met, has arrived fo delay, fellow-citizens of Kentucky, is yqually criminal and fatal. The answer to the defiance of the administion must be given now. Let it be from your rifles. Xbe Difference. The following extract from a letter from Washington to the Cincinnati Times, most significantly indicates the difference of feel ing, motiTe and action that animates the women of the two sections. The difference between the men ia equally as great, as erery battle field has attested : . And now that blankets are the subiect.let me digress to refer to the recent appeal of tne government ror donations of these in- dupenaible comforts. The meager response made by Northern women to this call is. bv 1 itself, evidence that the South is more in earnest than the North; at least, it feels mtre keenly ihe necessity of the crisis. It ia known that scarcely a Southern matron irou auu nau io mo uranae possesses a spare blanket. All surplus contents of the family chests and drawers have tone to comfort tho shirerinerebil army. But the women or the opulent and thrifty North the 5,000,000 housewives of the North find heart to distribute among their patriot brothers only thirty-fire hundred of the 20.- vw.vvu oiansieis in their- possession. The Abolition Congress Its Sesalon. The following from the Chicago Tribune ofjhe 4th, pretty clearly indicates the spirit of the present abolition Congress : The proceedings of Cooereea TesterdaV indicate pretty stern work. The seTerest ... - - measures for the conduct of the war will be adopted, and it is evident from the temper of the house, as illus rated yesterday, so far from constituting any ground of ob jection to a policy, will add to the chances of us adoption. ' We may look, therefore, for legisUtion of the most unmistakable and deoided character, not only on slavery but upon all other questions connected with the war. There will be no triflng, but action of the most earnest kind. The progress of the war during the nast six months demonstrates what few even of our most sagacious statesmen foresaw that the struggle is not an ephemeral distur bance, to be settled in six or twelve months but a tremendous war that may last three years, and call for the exertion of all the nation's strength, and all the neode's cow er of endurance... A contet-t tor life cannot, in the nature of things, be a trivial thing: and, in this ca9e, the struggle of the nation for existence against a conspiracy meditated and planned ror years, ana executed with the most ei- gantic and complete appliances, must nec essarily be desperate, and perhaps pro longed. Congress has arrived at a percep tion of this truth, - and will, at the present session, shape its measures and deelare its- policy therewith. e trust, however, that Consrress will be oareful not to do any thin? rash under a mistaken conviction of its severity The present hour calls for wisdom, as well as ior energy wisaom to -economise tne na tion's strength and direct it, with the least waste, to the end in view. -We have al ready been too reckless in the management of the wartoo wasteful of our resources, and too profligate of our strength.. . We have a prodigious army, in the field, and a prodigious fleet on the sea; but much of the rigor of both these arms has been expended in un concerted and inharmonious movements, which have led us but a league or two into the enemy's country, and have fallen far short of the work such powerful forces might accomplish if steadily, judici ously and unswervingly directed to a defin ite object. . Henceforth" there should be a stricter economy, not only of oar expenditures, but of our forces; and it will be the duty of Congress to insure this by divesting the war of all extraneous issues, and directing the forces of the. country to the naked ob ject of promptly, permanently, and effsQt sally suppressing tht rtbeilioa. w h b n n Tins If n ii 3 U I I V
