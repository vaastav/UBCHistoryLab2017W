Thursday, December 9, 1915. National Preparedness Main Theme of Head of Nation. Submits Definite Plan to In crease Present Standing Force of Regulars and For Four Hun dred Thousand Citizen Soldiers Raised In Increments of One Hundred and Thirty-three Thousand. FOLLOWING is the message of President Wilson delivered at a joint session of the senate and house at the beginning of the Sixty-fourth congress: Gentlemen of the Congress—Since I last had the privilege of addressing you on the state of the Union the war of nations on the other side of the sea, which had then only begun to disclose its portentous proportions, has extend ed its threatening and sinister scope until it has swept within its llaine some portion of every quarter of the globe, not excepting our own hemi sphere, has altered the whole face of international affairs, and now presents a prospect of reorganization and re construction such as statesmen and peoples have never been called upon to attempt before. The president tells how this country practiced neutrality and declares that he hopes that when the time comes for readjustment and recuperation this country will be of infinite service. Re ferring to Central and South American problems, the president dec-lares that we should retain unabated the spirit which has inspired us throughout the whole life of our government and which was so frankly put into words by President Monroe. We have been put to the test in the case of Mexico, and we have stood the test. Whether we have benefited Mex ico by the course we have pursued re mains to be seen. Her fortunes are in her own hands. But we have at least proved that we will not take advan tage of her in her distress and under take to impose upon her an order and government of our own choosing. Lib erty is often a fierce and intractable thing, to which no bounds can be set and to which no bounds of a few men's choosing ought ever to be set. Every American who has drunk at the true fountains of principle and tra dition must subscribe without reserva tion to the high doctrine of the Vir ginia bill of rights, which in the great days in which our government was set up was everywhere among us accept ed as the creed of free men. That doc trine is, "That government is or ought to be instituted for the common bene fit, protection and security of the peo ple, nation or community that "of all the various modes and forms of government, that Is the best which Is capable of producing the greatest de gree of happiness and safety and is most effectually secured against the danger of maladministration, and that when any government shall be found Inadequate or contrary to these pur poses a majority of the community hath an Indubitable, inalienable and Indefeasible right to reform, alter or abolish it in such manner as shall be judged most conducive to the public weal." We have unhesitatingly ap plied that heroic principle to the case of Mexico and now hopefully await the rebirth of the troubled republic, which had so much of which to purge itself, and so little sympathy from any outside quarter in the radical but nec essary process. We will aid and be friend Mexico, but we will not coerce her, and our course with regard to her ought to be sufficient proof to all Amer ica that we seek no political suzerainty or selfish coutrol. 

PAN-AMERICANISM HAS NONE OF EMPIRE'S SPIRIT. Economic Adjustments Inevitable With in the Next Generation. The moral is that the states of Amer ica are not hostile rivals, but co-op erating friends, and that their grow ing sense of community of interest, alike in matters political and in mat ters economic, is likely to give them a new significance as factors in interna tional affairs and in the political his tory of the world. It presents them as in a very deep and true sense a unit in world affairs, spiritual partners, standing together because thinking to gether, quick with common sympathies and common ideals. Separated, they are subject to all the cross currents of the confused politics of a world of hos tile rivalries united in spirit and pur pose. they cannot be disappointed of their peaceful destiny. This is pan-Americanism. It has none of the spirit of empire In it. It is the embodiment, the effectual embodiment, of the spirit of law and independence and liberty and mutual service. The president calls attention to the meeting In Washington recently of representatives of the pan-American republics and says that economic ad justment is inevitable in the next gen eration. No one who really comprehends the spirit of the great people for whom we are appointed to speak can fail to per ceive that their passion is for peace, their genius best displayed In the prac tice of the arts of peace. Great democ racies are not belligerent. They lo not peek nr desire war Their thought 1=

(From snapshot taken on Nov. 26.) of individual liberty and of the free labor that supports life and the un censored thought that quickens it. Conquest and dominion are not in our reckoning or agreeable to our princi ples. But just because we demand un molested development and the undis turbed government of our own lives upon our own principles of right and liberty, we resent, from whatever quarter it may come, the aggression we ourselves will not practice. We Insist upon security in prosecuting our self chosen lines of national development. We do more than that. We demand it also for others. We do not confine our enthusiasm for individual liberty and free national development to the Inci dents and movements of affairs which affect only ourselves. We feel it wher ever there Is a people that tries to walk In these difficult paths of independence and right. From the first we have made common cause with all partisans of liberty on this side the sea and have deemed it as important that our neigh bors should be free from all outside domination as that we ourselves should be have set America aside as a whole for the uses of independent nations and political freemen. Out of such thoughts grow all our policies. We regard war merely as a means of asserting the rights of a peo ple against aggression. And we are as fiercely Jealous of coercive or dicta torial power within our own nation as of aggression from without. We will not maintain a standing army ex cept for uses which are as necessary in times of peace as in times of war. 

SUGGESTS BROAD PLAN FOR NATIONAL DEFENSE. Increase Standing Regular Force—Four Hundred Thousand Citizen Soldiers. But war has never been a mere mat ter of men and guns. It is a thing of disciplined might. If our citizens are ever to fight effectively upon a sudden summons, they must know how modern fighting is done, and what to do when the summons comes to render themselves immediately avail able and immediately effective. And the government must be their servant in this matter, must supply them with the training they need to take care of themselves and of it The military arm of their government, which they will not allow to direct them, they may properly use to serve them and make their independence secure, and not their own independence merely, but the rights also of those with whom they have made common cause, should they also be put in jeopardy. They must be fitted to play the great role in the world, and particularly in this hemisphere, for which they are quali fied by principle and by chastened am bition to play. It is with these ideals in mind that the plans of the department of war for more adequate national defense were conceived which will be laid before you, and which I urge you to sanction and put into effect as soon as they can be properly scrutinized and discussed They seem to me the essential first steps, and they seem to me for the present sufficient They contemplate an Increase of the standing force of the regular army from its present strength of 5,023 offi cers and 102,985 enlisted men of all services to a strength of 7,136 officers and 134.707 enlisted men, or 141.843 all told, all services, rank and file, by the addition of fifty-two companies of coast artillery, fifteen companies of en gineers, ten regiments of infantry, four regiments of field artillery and four aero squadrons, besides 750 officers re quired for a great variety of extra service, especially the all important duty of training the citizen force of which I shall presently speak. 792 non commissioned officers for service In drill, recruiting and the like and the necessary quota of enlisted men for the quartermaster corps, the hospital corps, the ordnance department and other similar auxiliary services. These The program to be laid before you contemplates the construction within five years of ten battleships, six battle cruisers, ten scout cruisers, fifty de stroyers, fifteen fleet submarines, eighty-five coast submarines, four gun boats, one hospital ship, two ammuni tion ships, two fuel oil ships and one repair ship. It is proposed that of this number we shall the first year provide for the construction of two battleships, two battle cruisers, three scout cruisers, fifteen destroyers, five fleet submarines, twenty-five coast submarines, two gun boats and one hospital ship the second year two battleships, one scout cruiser, ten destroyers, four fleet submarines, fifteen coast submarines, one gunboat and one fuel oil ship the third year two battleships, one battle cruiser, two scout cruisers, five destroyers, two fleet submarines and fifteen coast subma rines the fourth year two battleships, two battle cruisers, two scout cruisers, ten destroyers, two fleet submarines, fifteen coast submarines, one ammuni tion ship and one fuel oil ship, and the fifth year two battleships, one bat tle cruiser, two scout cruisers, ten de stroyers. two fleet submarines, fifteen coast submarines, on* gunboat, one am munition ship and one repair ship. The secretary of the uavy Is asking also for the Immediate addition to the personnel of the navy of 7.500 sailors. 2,500 apprentice seamen and 1,500 ma rines. This increase would be suffi cient to care for the ahlps which are to be completed within the fiscal year 1917 and also for the nrmber of men which must be put ir training to man the ships which win be completed early in 1918. It is also n- essarv that the number of midshipmen at the Na val academy at Annapolis should be Increased by at least 300 in order that the force of officers should be more rapidly added to, and authority is ask ed to appoint, for engineering duties only, approved graduates of engineer ing colleges, and for service in the avi ation corps a certain number of men taken from civil life. If this full program should be carried out we should have built or building in 1921. according to the estimates of sur vival and standards of classification followed br the renern1 honrl of the (Continued on page 16)

By way of making the country ready to assert some part of its real power promptly and upon a larger scale should occasion arise the plan also contemplates supplementing the army by a force of 400,000 disciplined citi zens, raised in increments of 1153,000 a year throughout a period of three years. This it is proposed to do by a process of enlistment under which the serviceable men of the country would be asked to bind themselves to serve with the colors for purposes of train ing for short periods throughout three years and to come to the colors at call at any time throughout an additional "furlough" period of three years. This force of 400.000 men would be pro vided with personal accouterments as fast as enlisted and their equipment for the field made ready to be supplied at any time. Tliey would be astern a in in a a a Is at a in as so at on it suitable units of the regular army Their period of annual training would not necessarily exceed two months in the year. The president says it is up to the patriotic young men of the country to respond to this call.
