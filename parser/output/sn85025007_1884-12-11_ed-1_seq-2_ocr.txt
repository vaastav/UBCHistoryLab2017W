ALEXANDRIA, VA. THURSDAY EVENING, DECEMBER 11. THE INCREASE OF crime in this country, and from what we can learn in everyother, continues, it seems, to an alarming Of late years it has been impossible to glance over a newspaper without having one's sensibilities shocked or nerves un strung at some horrible rectal of Woodshed or heineous violation of innocence, and in many cases, too, narrated id a manneunfit for delicate ears. In one issue alone (last Tuesday's) of a leading paper of this coun try the accounts of murders, assaults, sui cides and other species of crime exceedec every other feature of the journal. Among tbe most flagrant might ba cited, first, a horrible case of infanticide which occurred in New York. A policeman while walking his beat on what is known as Pleasant avenue, kicked against what be supposed to be a bundle of rags. It appearing heavy, however, he picked it up and found the parcel to be wrapped in paper, but quic J dropped the same upon feeling a warm liquid course over his hands. At that in stant the moon burst from behind a cloud bank, and by her beams the conservator of the peace discovered the ghastliness of the bundle?an innocent babe, not then cold, with its head almost severed from the body. Horrible as is such a crime?murdering in cold blood an innocent offspring?it is one by no means uucommon in large cities, it being in no way surprising to drivers of garbage carts in New York to find bodies of dead infants in slop and ash barrels. The crime of infanticide is, of course, occasion ally committed in smaller places. Even oar own, as a general thing quiet, commu nity has had fiends in it at tirades who per formed the same terrible deed,'and old l'o tomachas more than once cast upon its shores the mutilated romains of what bad once been a living, guileless infant, who by the act of an unnatural parent had been forced to join the ranks of those whom we are assured compose in a great measure the kingdom of heaven. But, to pass on : The n ?xt revolting case mentioned in the issue of the paper alluded to was that of a four year-old girl-child lisping her evidence in a Chicago court against two young men at whose bands she had suffered nameless evil. Then follows an affray iu Chattanooga be tween two men rivals for the affections of a lady, in which both were killed ; then an attempt on the part of train robbers to wreck a heavily-laden passenger train, in no way concerned as to tbe number thut might be killed or crippled so a large booty was secured \ then the bloody endeavor ol a man in Buffalo to eviscerate a companion ; the firing of a residence iu Raleigh, N. C., by a disgruntled negro servant ; the murdei of an old man and his son by a man iu Port Jervis, N. Y., with whom the couple were bargaining for tbe sale of a horse ; the assassination of the principal wituess in a murder case at Galena, Kan., by a brothei of the culprit; together with several other murderous affrays in different parts of the country. Suicides and attempts at the same are so frequent in the larger cities that but small space is devoted to such items. There ? is hardly a day that the East river fails to force to its surface the blackened and bloat ed corpse of some individual who by his own rash act had launched himselt into the unseen world. To show the desperation of some of such characters when bent on self destruction the case of a despoudent New York tailor is cited. The man in question, growing weary of his monotonous calling, took seven boxes of matches and, scraping off the heads, made a mixed drink of sul phur and water and swallowed the same. Not dying quick enough, he saturated his clothing thoroughly with coal oil, applied a light to the same and sitting down awaited the final moment when, as be supposed, he would be transported from further sorrow and tribulation through the medium of fire. His plight, however, was discovered by the neighbors, the would-be suicide rolled in carpets, which smothered tbe tiames, and with the aid of a stomach pump he was forced to disgorge his deadly potion. It is a orime in New York to attempt self destruction; it has become a common thing for police justices in that city to have indi viduals before them for no other offence than that of attempted suicide. In the face of such a ghastly array of every day occur rences, the question, Is the world retro grading to antediluvian days ? is a pertinent one. Washington, in his Farewell Address to the people of the country, was careful to warn them against the dangers of foreign entanglements. Since that time, until the Arthur administration, his wise advice was followed, with the happiest result. But the republicans, under Mr. Arthur, could not let well enough alone, but set that advice at defiance, and sent representatives to the Congo conference, who took part in that con ference, thereby not only binding thiscountry to its decision, but establishing a precedent for other similar conferences, the result of which may be the overthrow of the Monroe doctrine, or wars to enforce that doctrine. The people of the country may well be gratulated upon the fact that the days during which the republican party can run them into further silly and unnecessary dangers are numbered. President Arthur recommended a pen sion for Gen. Grant and Senator Mitchell, with excessive previousness, embodied that recommendation in a bill. As the adoption of the recommendation, however, would have prevented the General's restoration to his rank and pa)' in the army, the latter being more than three times the amount of the pension, the General regrets their in terference in bis affairs, hoping for, and being likely to receive, more substantial benefits from the democrats. He has thus taught his superservicable friends a lesson in the art of thinking before speaking. No wondkr Attorney-General Brewster refuses to supply information concerning the business of his department, when he knows so little about that business that be declares, as he recently did, that his de partment never had the question of the title to the Aqueduct Bridge at Georgetown referred to it; though a report upon that question bad been made by his department, aod, what's more, was signed by himself. Poor old furbelow! The only things he does well are to pay George Bliss$100 aday and expenses to prevent the conviction oi the star routers, and to endorse Blaine's bloody shirt speeches. Thrre 19 a cood deal of talk about the necessity the democrats are under to repeal the statute providiog for the appointment of deputy mardhals, in order to preserve their reputation for consistency. But the exigency is such that in this matter the democrats will do well to follow the pre cedent set them by the republicans, and to act upou the formula of Mr. Raum, 'that modern politicians can't afford to be con sistent." Senator Vest is right when he eays the statute referred to should not be re pealed now. The republicans in many parts of the North are expelling men from their party for not votiug for Blaine. Nothing of the sort could be done iu Virginia ; for, with one or two honorable exceptions, every republi can in the whole State walked up to the polls and voted for Blaine, though to do so they had to stultify themselves by voting for General Mabone's electors, who, with two exceptions, were democratic scalawags who endorsed Mr. Wise's assertion that Southern republicans ore "apostates for the price of their apostacy." Some of the newspapers are applauding General Grant for declining a pension and thereby delayiog the establishment of a civ il pension list. They don't know the Gen eral. The only two things he ever declined were, a live alligator, which would have been a white elephant, and the pension re ferred to ;. but he declined the latter be cause while it was only tive thousand a year, he was assured that Congress intend ed to put him on the retired list at seven teen thousand. Senator Riddleberger is reported as sn \ ing that ''respect for his constituents urge-i him to oppose the confirmation of Secretary McCulloch." It Mr. Riddle berger means by his constituents the repu table white people of Virginia, his remark will lie the first iutimation they ever bad that be has any respcct for them. That they urge him to oppose the Secretary's confirmation is, of course, iucorrect. Low indeed must General Butler have fallen when his Virgiuia pal derides and reviles him. The latter, by the band of his amanueu^i'', compares the Butlerites of Massachusetts to the James brothers of Missouri. Sherman Wriggling. General Sherman, in reply to a question as to whether or not he intended to reply to the letter of Mr. Davis, recently published, said he might do so at some future time, but he should consult his own convenience; that Mr Davis had not addressed him, but the St. Louis Republican, and that if he roaJe any reply it could ouly be through the War Department. He further said he did not suppose that any reporter was at the meetiug of Frank Blair Post on the night ho spoke, as the Grand Army is an organization ouly for the social interchange of personal memories Still, he admitted that the reports published contained much of the truth, but not all. He has moat of his Louisiana papers, he said, to make good bis assertion that the civil war was forced upon the people of Louisiana by conspira tors in Washington; and that during the progress of the war Mr. Davis changed his views of the doctrine of secession, and threatened to use force in case any State of the Confederacy should attempt what was theu knowu as "separate State action." Sherman has already sent to Washington some letters and papers bearing on the case, but as to their publication, he stated that the authorities there must be con sulted. R. & D. R. R.?The annual meetiug of the stockholders of the Richmond and Dan ville Railroad Oompany was held in Rich mond yesterday. A resolution was adopted increasing the number of directors from eight to twelve. Col. A. S. Buford was elected president, and the following directors chosen : George F. Baker, C. S. Brice, Joseph Bryan, W. P. Clyde, H. C. Fahnestock, John H. Inman, John McAnerney, J. G. Moore, W. G. Oak man, H. B. Plant, George t. Seney, George S. Scott. The total earnings of the several lines of the system for the last year were $3,800, 381.48. and the expenses of maintenance,&c., $1,597,849.41, leaving a total net earning of ?1,617,357 70. The freight movement shows a decrease of 5,495,609 mile-tons compared with last year. The passenger mileage has increased 1,3S1,040, with an increase in revenue of $45,619.40. General Manager Rives says in his report; "In view of the fact that several of the largest railroad systems in the southern States are contemplating a change of guage from five feet to four feet nine inches, pre parations have been made and are making which will enable us to take similar action with the maxium economy at the proper time. I am satisfied that such change, when accomplished, will result in an in crease of business and reduction of expen ses." The report ol the auditor exhibits the in debtedness of the company as follows: Con sol bonds, $1,231,100; general mortgage bonds, $4,018,000; debenture bonds, with matured interest on the latter $357 310; $4, 326.310; bills payable, $791,263.

WASHINGTON. [Bpocixl Oorrospoudenoe of the Alexandria Uazeite. | Washington. D. C., Dec. 11, 1884. " Congressman Hewitt, of Alabama, who is in charge of tbe Mexican pensions bill, says the passage of that bill at the present ses sion of Congress will be impossible, for the reason that though the democrats are in fa vor of giving a pension to the survivors of the Mexican war, they can not support the Senate amendment to the bill, which prac tically pensions any man whose name was on the rolls of the federal army during tbe civil war. The republicans in the Senate knew this amendment would kill the bill, and for that reason adopted it. The republican caucus, as a cheap means by which to make party capital, re solved last night to attempt to secure tbe passage of the bill as amended. The democrats will try to have the objectiona ble amendment stricken out, or to compro mise upon a bill less objectionable, but both efforts will be resisted by the repub licans, because most of tho survivqr? of the Mexican war live in the South, aud, there fore, as Messrs. Hewitt aud Buckner say, the passage of the bill at this, or at any ear ly future session is by no means probable. The prevalent belief to-day respecting the new treaties is that none of them will be made effective at this session of Congress for the reason that the democrats will op pose them because tbey want to give the new administration a clear held, aud uot to interfere with its policy, and because the treaties are in favor of the manufacturers and not the farmers. Tbe resolution for debating the Spanish treaty in open session of the Senate, will, it is reported, be advo cated by the friends of the administration. It is learned that the new Nicaraguan trea ty, providing for an inter oceanic canal, gives great popular offense in France, for the reason that should the proposed canal be built it will depreciate the value of the stock of the Panama canal, which was a popular loan in that country, aud that prob ably France may on that account protest against the confirmation of the treaty. A democratic member of the Seuate when asked by tbe Gazette's correspondent this morning if Mr. Kiddleberger had any back ing in his opposition to the coufirmatiou oi the nomination of Mr. McCulloch for the position of Secretary of the Treasury, said he had not heard that matter discussed, but that he did not suppose he had ; that Kid dleberger didn't seem to have any inllueuce iu other matters, aud that he thought he was making a fool of himself, which any member, under the rules, had a right to do. He said he thought Riddlebergers vote would be the only one against tho coufirmatiou, but that it was noue of their, the democrats', fight, and be had really paid very little at tention to it. The Springer committee resumed its ses sions this moruing. They had before them as a witness Barker, the Treasury clerk, who testified under oath to tba same charge? be had previously made to the committee, which are that tho aocounts of officers in the Department of Justice were fraudulent, and that though Comptroler Lawrence ol the Treasury knew them to be so, because he, Barker, had told him, he yet ordered them to be paid. Senator Joe Brown, of Georgia, upou be ing shown the report of an interview with Mr. Bayard in a newspaper this morning, in which the Delaware Senator said the Southern policy of the Cleveland adminis tration would be in the lino of that ad vocated by such men as Hampton, of South Carolina, and Colquit and Gordon, of Geor gia, quietly remarked that there were other men in the l^outh whose views and opinions, he thought, were as deserving of as much of President Cleveland's consideration as thoso of the gentlemen named. At the national conference of health boards this morning delegates made reports of the sanitary condition of their respective cities. Mr. Brooks said New York and Brooklyn were prepared to prevent the introduction of cholera. Some of tbe delegates took strong ground Hgaiust the use of well and cistern waters in cities. Dr. Germer, of Erie, did not believe in disin fectants, saying "you might just as well have a prayer meeting againstgrasshoppers." Dr. J. G. Campbol), of Richmond, Va., said that the death rate among tbe colored popu lation was so large as to excite the pity and commiseration of a whole community. He attributed it,not to constiiution;il peculiarity but to poverty. The negroes, be said, con sidering the circumstances iu which they became freemen, bad doue remaiknbly weil and he was satisfied that in future the mor tality among them would be less. Dr. Reeves representing the West Virginia State board, advocated the appointment of women as house to house inspectors, as they were very appreciative aud would find a great many defects that men overlooked. Dr. Carson reported that be had gone to the scene of the late reported scourge iu Vir ginia and Kentucky, that that disease was epidemce dysentery caused by malaria; that the fatal cases occurred because those who were attacked did not believe iu doctors; that the death rate was low, and that the people there were agrieved at the exagger ated reports. The full text of the Spanish treaty togeth er with the President's message of transmit tal is published in the Congressional Jtccurd issued to-day. Among the strangers in the city to-day are Mr. Hurt, president pro tem. of the Virginia Senate, and Mr. J. Bell Bigger, who brought and delivered to Mr. Ed munds, president pro tem. of tbe U. S. Sen ate, the official returns of the electoral vote of Virginia. On the desk of every democratic mem ber of tho House from Michigan was placed this morning a life-size rooster. The one on tbe desk of Mr. Eidrige had a card at tached to it with this inscription .; ''This cock never picks a fight, but he's a terror when he goes in." The democratic members of the House from Virginia will hold a conference to night to determine what course they shall adopt with reference to the Massey-Wise contested electiou case. The pension bill, providing for an appro priation of sixty million, was reported iu tbe House to day, and will be called up speedi ly. Tbe House to-day resumed tbe consid eration of the inter-State commerce bill, Mr. Gla9seock, democrat of California, I 9oeaking in favor of the Reagan bill. The Senate resumed ti e consideration of the bill to forfeit railroad lands in Oregon, until two o'clock, when it will again take up the bill to admit tbe southern portion of the Tcrii tory of Dakota into the Uoion as a State. Tbe House Public Buildings' Committee determined to day to try to pass on Mou- ! day next a bill appropriating $200,000 for I an army medical museum in this city. The United States District Attorney at 1 Norfolk has been instructed to abandon the j case against the British bark Natalie, on i which a penalty tax was impo-ed on the ground that she bad a cargo of guano from Pedro Keys, which are included in the list ofguauo 1-tlauds appertaining to the United States. This action is taken because the British government says the islands of Pe dro Keys belong to Great Britain. At the Swaim court-martial to-day farther evi dence was aidnced to show the crookedness of tbe Judge Advocate General of the Army. Mr. Hugh 8. Thompson, a worthy citizen of Loudonn county, died at his home, near Hillsboro', on Tuesday morning last, of typhoid fever, in the 6oth year of his age. - 

NEWS OF THE DAY [ The woman suffrage party oppose the ! admission of Dakota, because women ate excluded from voting by the State constitu- , tion. In the course of a lecture in Chicago, Col. j Bob Ingersoll wanted to know what rain- i ister had ever doue as much for the world ! as Darwin, when a voice sang out, "Burch- ! ard." Eveu the Colonel had to join in the j laugh that followed this pat reply. The Kev. Dr. Newman, of the Madison | Avenue Congregational Church, New York, who wont to California pending a quarrei j between the trustees and his congregation, ! will tnke charge of u congregation in San i Francisco, and his former church will t>e closed. The Baltimore Day, which suspended publication a few weeks ago, made its re- j appeatance as a one-cent evening paper yesterday afternoon, with Mr. G. W. < ruik shank a3 editor. The Day was a must ex cellent paper and will doubtless maintain its well-earned reputation. Commissioner Bagwell, of Virginia, has joined Commissioner Aydelotte, of Mary land, who, with Eapt. Chas. Junken, of the United Slates coast and geodetic survey, has been engaged in locating buoys in Po comoke souud, which will complete the boundary line between the Suites of Mary land and Virginia. The opening session of the Methodist Centennial Conference was held at Mt. Ver non Place Church, Baltimore, yesterday. Bishop Cranberry presided, and Bishop Foster, of Boston, preached the sermon. In the afternoon papers were rend on the Christmas Conference, and at night missions were discussed at meetings at a dozen differ ent churches. In the Senate yesterday 31 r. Ve?<t, of Mo., plainly showed that the frequent demands of th? Territory of Dakota for admission to the Union are the demands of ambitious politicians desirous of .getting into the Senate of the United States or in the House. Mr. Vest opposed the project of dividing the Territory as unnecessary. The par; proposed to be formed into a State has not enough population to entitle it to a Repre sentative, though it sutlers from an excess of statesmen. The Senator had read a number of petitions from citizens of Dakota opposing the admission of the Territory as a State.
