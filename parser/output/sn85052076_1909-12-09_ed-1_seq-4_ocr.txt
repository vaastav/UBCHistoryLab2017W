deep into the mind of every teacher lie that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end to him will I give power over the nationsJust Just now there Is great need for you my friend In the rural schools to keep the great thought given In this verse constantly in mind One by one the boys and girls drop out until the empty seats which too often force you to begin to steal away your ambition and you begin to feel that the last few weeks are not worth much anyway You are Inclined to let things drift just count time un til the end comes Remember your verse He that overcometh Over coming is the great object of life It Is tho spirit which is behind every game It Is the strongest force be hind every great business enterprise A wish to overcome sent our forefath ers from the valleys of Virginia over the unknown mountains and across the broad stretches to the west It has been and will always be the great moving force of humanity The greatest joy one can know Is to overcome a temptation a weak

ADVICE TO ADVERTISERS One principle of ouccossfll advertis ing as practised by the metropolitan department otsro ad writers and other specialties on publicly is to give definite descriptions of the goods of fered When a merchant uses such phrases as Tho best is the cheapest and Biggest assortment end lowea prices he cchvirtcoa no one The reader argues that any ono can use these catch words and that tuoy prove nothing Try instead to help your reader get a mental picture of your goods For this purpose try definite and detailed though very brief description Get manufacturers of your lines to give you some definite facts about how the goods are put together BO that you can give some real reasons why goods are superior Pick out somo special bargains des cribe them 111 above Indicated and

and House of Repre sentativesThe I The relations of the United State with all foreign governments have continued upon the normal hauls of amity and good understanding and are very generally satisfactory Latin America One of the happiest events In recent PanAmerican diplomacy was the pacific Independent settlement by the govern ments of Bolivia and Peru of a boundary difference between them which for some weeks threatened to cause war and even to entrain cmbltterments affecting other republics less directly concerned From various quarters directly or Indirectly concerned the Intermediation of the Unl ted States was sought to assist In a so lution of the controversy Desiring at all times to abstain from any undue mingling In tho affairs of sister republics and hay ing faith In he ability of the govern ments of Peru and Bolivia themselves to settle their differences In a manner satis factory to themselves which viewed with magnanimity would assuage all emblt terment this government steadily ab stained from being drawn Iota the con troversy and was much gratified to find Its confidence Justified by events On the ninth of July next there will open at Buenos Aim the fourth Pan American conference This conference will have a special meaning to the hearts yof all Americans because around Its date are clustered the anniversaries of the In dependence of to many American repub lics It Is not necessary for me to remind the congress of the political social and ommerelal Importance of these gather Ings You are asked to make liberal ap propriation for cur participation If this be granted It Is my purpose to appoint a distinguished and representative dele gallon qualified fittingly to represent this country and to deal with the problems of Intercontinental Interest which will there be discussed Tho Argentine Republic will also lipid from May to November 1910 at Buenos Aires a great International agricultural exhibition In which the United States has been Invited to participate Considering the rapid growth of the trade of the Uni ted States with the Argentine Republic and the cordial relations existing between the two nations together with the fact that It provides an opportunity to show deference to a sister republic on the oc casion of the celebration of Its nation al Independence the proper departments of this government are taking steps to ap prise the Interests concerned of the Ope portunity afforded by this exhibition In which appropriate participation by this country Is so desirable The designation of an official representative Is also receiv ing consideration government ernment has long been fixed In Its prin prlnI ciples and remains unchanged With the j hanged circumstances of the United States and of the republics to the south of us most of which have great natural resources stable government and pro gressive Ideals the apprehension which gave rise to the Monroe doctrine may be said to have nearly disappeared and nei her doctrine as it exists nor any other doctrine of American policy should IK permitted to operate for the perpetua tion of Irresponsible government the es rApe of just obligations or the Insidious allegation of dominating ambitions on the part of the United States Beside the fundamental doctrines of our PanAmerican policy there have grown up a realization of political Interests community of Institutions and Ideals and a flourishing commerce All these bniids will be greatly strengthened an time goes on and Increased facilities such as the great bank soon to be established In Lat In Amerlra supply the means for build Ing up the colossal Intercontinental com merce of the future My meeting with President Dlax and the greeting exchanged on both Ameri can and Mexican soil served I hope to signalize the close and cordial relations which so well bifid together this republic and the great republic Immediately to the south between which there Is so vast a network of material Interests I am happy to say that all but one of the cases which for so long vexed our relations with Venezuela have been set tied within the past few months and that under the enlightened regime now direct ing the government of Venezuela provi sion has been made for arbitration of the remaining case before The Hague trl hunal Since the Washington conventions of 1907 were communicated to the govern ment of the United States as a consult ing and advisory party this government has been tlmost continuously called upon uponby the five Central American republics to exert Itself for the maintenance of the conventions Nearly every complaint has been against the Zelaya government of Nicaragua which has kept Central Amer ica In constanttension and turmoil The responds made to the representations of Central American republics as due from the United States on account of Its rela tion to the Washington conventions have been at all times conservative and have avoided so far as posalble any semblance of Interference although It Is very appar ent that the considerations of geograph ic proximity to the canal zone and of the very substantial American Interests in Central America give to the United States a special position In the zone of these republics and the Caribbean sea I need not rehearse here the patient efforts of this government to promote peace and welfare among these repub lice efforts which are fully appreciated apprecIatedby by the majority of them who are loyal to their true Interests It would be no less unnecessary to rehearse here the sad tale of unspeakable barbarities and oppression alleged to have been commit ted by the Zelaya government Recently two Americans were put to death by or der of President Zelaya himself They were officers in the organized forces of revolution which was In control of I about half of the republic and as such according to the modern enlightened t practice of civilized nations they were I entitled to be dealt with as prisoners of I war At the date when this message Is I printed this government has terminated i diplomatic relations with tho Zelaya gOV ernment for reasons made public In a communication to the forme Nicaragua charge daffaires and Is Intending to take such future steps as may be found most consistent with Its dignity Its duty to American Interests and Its moral obllga tlons to Central America and t civiliza tion Department of State II earnestly recommend to the favor able consideration of the congress the es timates submitted by the department of state and most especially the legisla I Lion suggested In the secrtary of states letter of this date whereby It will bo possible to develop and make permanent the reorganization of the department upon modern lines In a manner to make It a thoroughly efficient Instrument In the furtherance of our foreign trade and of American Interests abroad The plan to have divisions of LatinAmerican and FarEastern affairs ahd to Institute s certain specialization In business with Europe and the near east will at once commend itself These politicogeograph ical divisions and the detail from the diplomatic or consular service to the department of a number of men who bring to the study of complicated prob lems In different parts of the world practical knowledge recently gained on the spot clearly Is of the greatest ad vantage to the secretary of state In foreseeing conditions likely to arise and In conducting the great variety of corre spondence and negotiation It should be remembered that such facilities exist In the foreign offices of all the leading com mercial nations and that to deny them to the secretary of state would be to place this government at a great disad vantage In the rivalry of commercial competitionThe The consular service has been Im proved under the law of April 6 1906 and the executive order of June 27 1906 and I commend to your consideration the question of embodying in a statute the principles of the present executive order upon which the eftlclcncy of our consular service Is wholly dependent Expenditures and Revenues Perhaps the most Important question presented to this administration Is that of economy In expenditures and sum ciency of revenue The deficit of the last fiscal year and the certain deficit of the current year prompted congress to throw a greater responsibility on tho executive and tho secretary of the treasury than had heretofore been de I clared by statute This declaration Imposes upon the secretary of the treasury the duty of assembling all the I estimates of the executive departments bureaus and offices of the expenditures necessary In the ensuing fiscal year and of making an estimate of the reve nun of the government for the same period nnd If a probable deficit is thus shown It Is made tho duty of the presi dent to recommend the method by which such deficit can be met The report of the secretary shows that the ordinary expenditures for the current fiscal year ending June 30 1910 will exceed the estimated receipts by 134075620 If to this deficit Is added the sum to be disbursed for the Pan ama Canal amounting to tI9000000 and 11000000 to bo paid on the public debt the deficit of ordinary receipts and expenditures will be Increased to a total deficit of S7307G620 This def loll the secretary proposes to meet by the proceeds of bonds Issued to pay the cost of constructing the Panama Canal I approve this proposal In order to avoid a deficit for the ensuing fiscal year I directed the heads of departments In the prepara tlon of their estimates to make them as low as possible consistent with Im perative governmental necessity Civil Pensions I am aware that there Is a strong feeling In both houses of congress nnd possibly In the country against the establishment of civil pensions and that this has naturally grown out of the heavy burden of military pensions which It has always been the policy of our government to assume but I am strongly convinced that no other practical solution of the difficulties presented by the superannuation of civil servants can be found than that of a system of civil pensions Frauds In the Collection of Customs IIFrauds I regret to refer to the fact of the I discovery of extensive frauds In the collection of the customs revenue At New York city In which a number of the subordinate employes In the weigh ing and other departments were di rectly concerned and In which the beneficiaries were the American Sugar Refining Company and others The frauds consisted In the payment of duty on underweights of sugar Tho government has recovered from the American Sugar Refining Company all that It Is shown to have been defraud ed of The sum was received In full of the amount due which might have been recovered by civil suit against the beneficiary of the fraud but there was an express reservation In the con tract of settlement by which the settle ment should not Interfere with or pre vent the criminal prosecution of every one who was found to be subject to the same Criminal prosecutions are now pro ceeding against a number of the gov ernment officers The treasury de partment and the department of jus tice are exerting every effort to dis cover all the wrongdoers Including the officers and employes of the com panies who may have been privy to the fraud It would seem to me that an Investigation of the frauds by con gress at present pending the probing by the treasury department and the department of justice as proposed might by giving Immunity and other wise prove an embarrassment In scour ing conviction of the guilty parties The Tariff Act Two features of the new tariff act call for special reference By virtue I of the clause known as the maximum and minimum clause It Is the duty i of the executive to consider the laws and practices of other countries with reference to the Importation Into those countries of the products and mer chandise of the United States and If the executive finds such laws and prac tices not to be unduly discriminatory against the United States the mini mum duties provided In tho bill ore to go Into force Unless the president makes such a finding then the maxi mum duties provided in the bill that Is an Increase of 25 per cent ad valo rem over the minimum duties are to be in force Fear has been expressed that this power conferred and duty Imposed on the executive Is likely to lead to a tariff war I beg to express the hope and belief that no such result need be anticipated The discretion granted to the execu executIe discrimInatory maximum duty shall be charged against the Imports from a country It Is neces sary that ho shall find on the part orI that country not only discriminations In Its laws or the practice under them against the trade of the United States Btatesbut but that the discriminations found shall be undue that Is without good and fair reason I conceive that thisI power was reposed In the president with the hope that the maximum du ties might never be applied In any case but that the power to apply them would enable the president and the state de I partment through friendly negotiation to secure the elimination from the laws and the practice under them of any foreign country of that which Is un duly discriminatory No one Is seek Ing a tariff war or a condition In which the spirit of retaliation shall bs aroused NavyfThe The return of the battleship fleet from Its voyage around the world In morg > efficient condition than when it started was a noteworthy event of Interest alike to our citizens and the naval authorities of the world Besides the beneficial and farreaching street on our personal and diplomatic relations In the countries which the fleet visited the marked suc cess of the ships In steaming around the world In all weathers In schedule time has Increased respect for our navy and has added to our national prestige Injunctions Without Notice Tho platform of the successful party In the last election contained the following The Republican party will uphold at all times the authority and Integrity ot the courts state and federal and will ever Insist that their powers to enforce their process and protect life liberty and property shall be preserved Inviolate We believe however that the rules of procedure In the federal courts with re spect to the Issuance of the writ of In junction should be more accurately de fined by statute and that no Injunction or temporary restraining order should be Issued without notice except whore Ir reparable Injury would result from delay I In which case a speedy hearing there I after should be granted I recommend that In compliance with I the promise thus made appropriate legls I latlon be adopted The ends of justice will best be met and the chief cause of complaint against Illconsidered Injunc lone without notice will be removed by the enactment of a statute forbidding hereafter the Issuing of any Injunction I or restraining order whether temporary I or permanent by any federal court without previous notice and a reasonable i opportunity to be heard on behalf of the I parties to be enjoined unless It shall ap I pear to the satisfaction of the court that the delay necessary to give such notice and hearing would result In Irreparable Injury to the complainant and unless also the court shall from the evidence make a written finding which shall be spread upon the court minutes that Immediate and Irreparable Injury Is likely to ensue to the complainant and shall define the Injury state why It Is Irreparable and shall also Indorse on the order Issued the date and the hour of the Issuance of the o er Moreover every such Injunction or restraining order Issued without pre vious notice and opportunity by the de fendant to be heard should by force of the statute to expire and be of no effect after seven days from the Issuance therej therejof of or within any time less than that pe rlod which the court may fix unless within the Injunction or order Is ex tended or renewed after previous notice and opportunity to be heardi Second Claas Mall Matteri i The deficit every year In the post office department Is largely caused by the low rate of postage of one cent a pound charged on secondclass mall matter which Includes not only newspapers but magazines and miscellaneous periodical The actual loss growing out of the trans mission of this secondclass mall matter at one cent a pound amounts to about JflSOCOCOO n year The average cost of the transportation of this matter Is more than nine cents a pound It appears that the average distance ov er which newspapers are delivered to their customers Is 291 miles while the average haul of magazines Is lOll and of miscellaneous periodicals 110 miles Thus the average haul of the magazine Is three and onehalf times and that of the miscellaneous periodical nearly four times the haul of the dally newspaper yet all of them pay the same postage rate of one cent a pound The statistics of 1907 show that secondclass mall matter con stituted a91 per cent of the weight ot all the mall and yielded only B1J per centI of the revenueI The figures given are startling and show the payment by the government of an enormous subsidy to the newspapers magazines and periodicals and congress may well consider whether radical steps should not be taken to reduce the deficit In the postoffice department caused by this discrepancy between the actual cost of transportation and the compensation i exacted therefor compenaatlonI A great saving might be made amount i 101I by Imposing upon magazines and perlI odlcals a higher rate of postage They are much heavier than newspapers and contain a much higher proportion of ad vertising to reading matter and the aver age distance of their transportation Is three and a half times as great Postal Savings greatI The second subject worthy of mention I In the postofllce department Is the real necessity and entire practicability of es tablishing postal savings banks The suc 1 cessful party at the last election declared In favor of postal savings banks and al though the proposition finds opponents In many parts of the country I am con vinced that the people desire such banks and am sure that when the banks are fur nished they will be productive of the ute most good Favors Ship Subsidy I Following the course of my distin guished predecessor I earnestly recom I mend to congress the consideration and passage of u ship subsidy bill looking to I the establishment of lines between our Atlantic seaboard and the eastern coast I of South America as well as lines from the west coast of the United States to toSouth South America China Japan and the Philippines The profits on foreign malls are perhaps a sufficient measure of the expenditures which might first be tenta tively applied to this method of Inducing InducingAmerican American capital to undertake the estab lishment of American lines of steamships In those directions In which we now feel feelIt It most Important that we should have means of transportation controlled In the Interest of the expansion of our trade A bill of this character has once passed the house and more than once passed the senate and I hope that at this session a withthe withi Conserving National Resources In several departments there Is present ed the necessity for legislation looking to the further conservation of our national resources and the subject Is one of such Importance as to require a more detailed And extended discussion than can be en tered upon In this communication For that reason I shall take an early oppor tunity to send a special message to con gras on the subject of the Improvement of our waterways upon the reclamation and Irrigation of arid semiarid and swamp lands upon the preservation of our forests and the reforesting of suit able areas upon the reclassification of the public domain with a view of sep arating from agricultural settlement min eral coal and phosphate lands and sites belonging td tho government bordering on streams suitable for the utilization of water power powerPolitical Contribution I urgently recommend to congress that a law be passed requiring that candl candidates house of representatives and committees In charge of their candidacy and cam paign file In a proper office of the United States government a statement of the contributions received and of the expen ditures Incurred In the campaign for suchI elections and that similar legislation be I enacted In respect to all other elections 1 which are constitutionally within the con 1 trol of congress I THE
