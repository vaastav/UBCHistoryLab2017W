"There is a greater measure of ?a ger than probability of usefulness in fv. nintnl as a bedfellow, says the Louisville Courier -Journal. "The state­ ment is so obviously true that not be worth making, but for the fact that ther^ are so many persons who not seem to appreciate its truth. A Louisville woman awakens with a atnrtf stra'os the pistol from undei h«.r pillow because she is frighter.*1. Shoots herself in the shoulder and is •worse,, frightened, although, for tunately, not seriously injured. The accident is typical. "In the hands of the inexpert a pistol Is not especially effective in close Quar­ ters, and at long range it is not effect ive in any degree. Shooting at a tar get does not nepessarily develop a fac ulty for shooting straight when the target is a man. Buck ague, which sometimes causes a green hunter to miss a stag with a shotgun, is a mild form of nervousness compared with that which is experienced by the law-abiding individual who tries for the first time to shoot a human be ing. If the man on the-other side of the argument is a practical criminal he has a fair chance to get out of harm's way. He may get the pistol out of the hand of the person who is a novice in its use as a man killer and turn it upon the owner. Few burglars are killed or crippled by the family pistol, but it'claims many victims in the household. "A hickory club, a baseball bat or some similar weapon which has a more certain usefulness at close rang? abd which will not discharge hot lead into the anatomy of the owner as a re suit of mishandling is better promo tion, even to a woman than an auto matlc revolver which may shoot ihe wrong way when the burglar is dis covered, shoot the wrpng person when a fancied burglar is found movi about the room, or shoot its bedfellow who grips it accidentia while asleep "A rule that would he widelv bene ficial if followed is not to sleep with firearms, and not fo keep them in the chiffonier, where they may be put in action by someone hunting for a col lar button, or upon the whatnot, from which they may be knocked by some one dusting the ornaments. It i3 sater to risk the family jewelry by laying it out for the convenience of the burglar than to risk the "lives of persona in the house by keeping loaded pistols wLcro they are convenient when wanted, but Inconveniently deadly whon picked up In the dark by persons who know little about shooting burglars or handling pistols." iA: RESTRICTING IMMIGRATION. The restriction of unskilled labor Immigration is recommended in the re port of tio immigration commission appointed in 1907. which has just com pleted f, For Infants and Children. The Kind You Have Always Bought Bears the Signature of OF SLEEP. Facsimile Signatures In THE CCNTAUM COMPANY, NC«V VOK* OfTT. commission holds that sentimental considerations in restricting immigra tion should be waived because of the adverse 'effects on wages and living conditions which the large numbers of aliens have had in recent years by their entry into the basic industries. "The present immigration move ment," says the report, is in large measure due to economic causes, but emigration from Europe is not now an absolute economic necessity and as a rule those who immigrate -to the United States are impelled by a defsir© for better conditions rather than by the necessity of escaping from intol erable ones. This fact, should largely modify the natural incentive to treat the immigration movement from the standpoint of sentiment and permit its consideration primarily as an eco nomic problem." Several plans for restricting immi gration are proposed by the commis sion, among them a reading and writ ing test, the exclusion of unmarried* unskilled' laborers, limitations in the number arriving at any one port and from particular races, as well as in the amounts of money required to be in their possession on arrival. It is urged that the bureau of immigration co operate with the states and various so cieties in order to briAg about a more beneficial distribution of the immi grants among the agricultural sec tions, where they are especially need ed. Statistics show, the commission reports, that the immigrants have been more successful in agricultural pur suits, yet the great body of immigrants now coming in are being located in the. already overcrowded cities. 

AMERICANS PREFER LARGE CITIES. "That the average American prefers life in a large city to that on the farm or in a small town is strikingly shown by advance statistics from the censuo bureau "says the Chicago Inter Ocean." During the last ten years our forty eeven cities which have a population of over, 100,000 each have made again of 32 per cent, a slight fraction more than the rate of increase in the previ ous decade. The aggregate population of these cities today is 19,754,237. In 1900 it was 14,991,430, and in 1890 it was 11,361,220. "The aggregate population of 175 cities, ranging from 25,000 to 100P00 each, for which tho 1910 count has been completed, is 8,055,598. Since 1890 they have gained 2,277,157, or 39.4 per cent. The cities embraced in this group show the highest percent age of gain, surpassing the ratio of the still larger cities by nearly 8 per cent. "As the natural increase in popula tion in this country, exclusive of im migration, is about 15 per cent in a decade, the excess in the cities of over 25,000 inhabitants makes inevitable the conclusion that there has been an exodus from he smaller cities, towns and the rural districts. "Complete returns are still lacking, but an analysis of those available shows that there has been an increase of less than 3 per cent in the decade in the region bounded on the north by the Minnesota state line and on the east, south and west by the Mississippi and Misourl rivers. It is plainly ap parent that from this typical farming country of the middle west there have been wholesale removals of farmers and their families. The cities have drawn the young men, while the heads of the families who wished to continue to follow agricultural pursuits have been attracted by the cheaper lands in the southwest and northwest. What is true of the middle western states is even worre in the east. In New York, for example, there has been an increase since the last census of over 50 per cent in the population of cities with more than 25,000 inhabi tants, while the smaller cities show a loss in population ranging from 7 per cent in the 8,000 class to 15 per cent in the 4,000 class. In the strictly .rural sections of the empire state in 11900 V--C .rears' investigation. The there were 2,092,490, persons Today there are only 33,813 more, the increase in'ten years being only 1% ner cent. In seven counties in the /r IjlL I western lake region of New York the rural population Is less than it was In 1860, and these counties were once famed for their productiveness of agri cultural cornr^ iditles. "The average farmer is strongly tempted toward the cheap lands of the southwest and northwest, which sell for about $25 per acre and will yield practically as much as the land of Iowa. Illinois, Indiana and Missouri which commands $125 per acre.1 The land in the states named' is gradually being acquired by "gentlemen farm ers," who made their fortunes in the cities and turn for. ecreation and pleasure rather than for profit fancy stock raising and dairying. It costs some of them as much to produce a quart of cream as tb buy a quart of champagne, as they have frankly confessed. "Such farmers never will help re reduce the general cost of living by meeting the demand a larger sup ply of agricultural products. By in tensive farming, irrigation and other improved methods, those now engaged in agriculture may increase their yield per acre, and that would help some but the world-wide complaint of the high cost of living will not cease until the boys raised on farms stay to culti vate them and thousands quit, the cities to become farmers." To salesmen: Fulfill promises no matter what they cost. The buyer who can rely upon your pledge thinks more of your promise than he does of your price list, Secretary of the Navy Meyer has loojed $5,000,000 off the naval ap propriations for the coming year as compared to the appropriations for tne current year. President Taft is in sisting on economy and in this he is setting, the country a good example. The death of Mary Baker Eddy marks the passing of one of the no table women of the country. During the closing years of her life she had seen the church which she founded increase in membership and gain in influence, until its adherents are num bered by the hundreds of thousands.* President Taft may not \ave a big stick that breaks the record, the Oma ha World-Herald observes, but there is nothing the matter with his pruning knife. "One example is worth a thousand arguments." 

POLITICS AND POLITICIANS. Washington rumor has it that his physicians have ordered "Uncle Joe" Cannon to let up on the number of the famous black cigars which he smokes daily. Uncle, Joe is reported to have casually remarked that he has won out. in bigger battles than a fight against cigars, and he expects to consume his customary number of the fragrant weed. The most important recommenda tions in President Taft's annual mes sage relate to the tariff, the Panama canal, a federal incorporation law to make more effective the corporation tax law, a ship subsidy bill, reciprocity with Canada and some effective form of government for Alaska. Ex-United States Senator William E. Chandler of New Hampshire has a pet saying to the effect that the least im portant man in the world is the man who 'has voted on election day. Uncle Shelby S. Cullom, senior sena tor from Illinois, is one of the old guards of he upper house. He has just celebrated his eigbty-flrBt birthday and has been in^he senate without a break since 1883. His term expires in 1913. New York democrats declare th^t Colonel Roosevelt has a following which will have to be reckoned with in the republican national convention of 1912. Before that time rolls around the colonel, they say, will essay to overtures to the Taft administration or will endeavor to become hand in glove wi*.h the wing of the republican party led by LaFollette, Cummins, Bristow and Stubbs. In other words, according to the democratic theory. Col. Roosevelt" and his followers will go to the highest bidder. In Rhode Island the fight for Senator Aldrich's seat is going to be lively. Henry F. Lippitt, a prominent mill man and republican, has announced his candidacy, while the young men of the state are fcr Judge LeBaron C. Colt, who has a wide reputation as a jurist andvan orator. Henry A. Wise, United States dis trict attorney, who is trying to have the sugar trust dissolved. Is planning on a two-year fight before this famous case is ended. Mr. Wise is credited with having an ambition to rise higher in the government service, with a par ticular preference for an assistant at torney generalship. Governor-elect Woodrow Wilson of New Jersey has already donned the toga of a leader—he hates the terra •"boss."' Getting down to the heart' of the situation in the democratic party, he found that the "machine's" candi date was as much of a boss as the most rabid old-guard republican. Imme diately hi served notice that hew blood must be infused or there would be "nothin' doing.'0 THE 

EVENING STORY. FAIR EXCHANGE. By Martha McCulloch-Williams. (Copyright, 1910, by Associated Liter ary Press.) "With a woman in the case—seek the man," Eldridge paraphrased, nod ding vigorously as he spoke. Miss Mi-tonistarted. "Impossible!" s" said. "Clara Estes has not seen a man except through double crape, since poor, dear'Charley died." "Hm! That proves nothing," El dridge commented. "Were they hap py together? It struck me always he was never quite easy about her." "You never liked Clara," Miss Min ton answered slowly. "No more than you did,"' Eldridge broke in. "Be honest, Mary! You know we have this in common: We knew, all along, Charley had married the wrong girl." "Jessie was the, wife for him—-if he only could have seen it. Well, it's ray belief he might be living still. -0-''' But I have to say It for the girl he did marry—she has behaved admira bly—the deepest black after two whole years, no company at all, nor going out, except for charity. Then, even you must admit she's been lib eral "Too liberal—it shows to me she has something on her conscience," Eldridge growled. "A woman who had not, wouldn't have validated those unsigned codicils. Why, they gave away a third of. the money! And uhder the will she took every thing." "I don't see how you make that out," Miss Minton said, shaking her head. Eldridge laughed sourly. "If she had fought us we mirht have looked into her past," he said. "Depend upon it, she has a history. The man is in it—shells thinking of him, pin ing for him, the nights she walks up and down the halls.' "I don't know but what you are right. Still there's nothing we can do," Miss Minton began tentatively. Eldridge nodded again. "Except to wait—and watch," he said. "Let me know if the least thing happens—for Charley's sake and our own." "You mean your own," Miss Minton apostrophized as he went down the walk. She was a good woman, cljurchly, charitable given to mercies and clean minded but for ten years she had been under Eldrtdge's spell, »held tiy the hope of being,one day his wife. They were not betrothed—it was merely an understanding. Lately she had had an uneasy sense that he was restive under even that slight bond. As manager of the Estes es tate, he was brought much in contact with the widow, a woman much younger and more charming than her self, withal very rich in spite of her foolish generosity. Eldridge was intensely ambitions, also not a little grasping. He had held to his disapproving attitude to ward his client's wife, rather in spite of himself. Perhaps it was because of her reserve, the' veiled distrust in her eyes. "She's keeping back fimething— something I ought to know,' 'Eldridge had told himself over aaid over. If he could but find it out she would be in his power—he did not let him self measure what exercise he would make Of the pOwer. Something in her tempted him as much as even this other thing repelled him. Mary Min ton? Mary was a good creature—but a fool, therefore safely to be left out of the count. He had a sense that Clara had de frauded him—but for her, Charley Estes would have married pretty •Jessie Eldridge, thus bringing into the family the necessary money. Plus money, Eldridge felt he could half rule the state. He had the instinct of dominance which mat*e such ruling precious. Now that Jessie was sacrificed upon a struggling doctor, he felt more than ever bound to uplift the family for tunes. Miss Minton's revelations Ap peared to him to point the way Clara Estes had a secret—once let him coipe upon it^ a^d she-would be delivered1 into his hand. Therefore his hiart leaped when, three days after, Miss Minton called gaurdedly over the 'phone: "We have a strange visitor—rather mysterious. If you care to see him come quickly." Exactly an hour later he stepped through the door of the library at Est wold. Clara sat at the table, in front of the fire, her head in her hands, her eyes downcast. The visi tor stood beside the mantel, thuB air most directly beneath the portrait of the dead owner of Estwood. Eldridge started at sight of the stranger—who was not after all strange. A likeness, subtle, elusive, in a sense ghostly, to the pictured face made him feel that here was the beginning of possible tragedy. Clara looked up at. his entrance. "Is this telepathy she asked, smil ing faintly. "I was on the point .of sending for you—yet could not quite decide to do it." "Well, I am here," Eldridge said stiffly. The stranger glowered at. him. Neither man had made the least ac knowledgment of the other's pres ence. Clara rose. "You are in tipie." she said, her head high, "to'help me in —the righting of a wrong." •'I don't understand Eldridge began. She held up her hand, saying: "Wait! You will. Let nae present you to—Mr. Marshall Estes, owner of this house—of everything—as. soon as vou can legally transfer it to him." "Are yon mad—love marl Eldridsre sneered. Remember your husband's will—by remarriage you forfeit con trol of the estate. It vests instead in me—be sure I shall assert my rights." "You have none—because have none/' Clara snid, her head still hl»rh. "Let me explain. You know how the foutune came to cousin, cruelly my husband—from his father's half sister, Maria, who died unmarried-—" "Her mother was a great heireps." Eldridge interrunted. "Therefore, her son rightfully inherits the money whatever the law may be." Clara said: "Yes. Marshall Estes is her son. ten years my never older than his husband. His mother knew her that, he lived—they told that she had borne a dead child. Family pride, you see. Her father made some provisions for the lad "You surely take no stork in "such a threadbare invention?" Eldridge cried. "Why, it would disgrace a dime novel. Let this impostor out, neck and coop!" "He is no impostor—I have the clearest proofs," Qlara said with dig nity. Shame to me that, after seeing them, understanding,- believing them, I let myself hesitate. I "knew the right, but there was so much in the way of doing it. Charley had been so proud of his name. He would have died rather than stain It. Hours and' hours I walked and walked, praying to him all the time, praying, too, to God for light. It has worn me thin, but at last I see the light. I should be a thief and worse if I clung to this money, keeping it away from Maria BJstes' son.'1 "It Is a plot. I see through it," Eldridge begun passionately. "This is some old lover of yours—you have trumped up this tale to cheat me of my due-—" He stopped short there—a heavy hand w&b on his shoulder, a dark strong face bent menacingly above him. "Not an old lover, but a new one—if only she will let me be," said the man. "I have loved you,Clara, from the hour I saw you. You haunt me sleeping and walking. I have hated women—ever since I knew— you have brought me back to sanity. I will not take the money—not one penny' of It—unless along with It I may take you." "So that is your game!" Eldridge began to sneer. Marshall Estes led him strongly bnt not roughly to the door, thrust him through it, then turned to Clara, say ing: "I dare not ask you to forgive— but that cur forced me to speak." "There is nothing to forgive," Clara said, sighing softly, hut with a divine .blush. "It will be a fair exchange— you take the money, and give me back love." TWO 

RUNABOUTS. By Donald Allen. (Copyright, 1910, by the Associated Literary Press). Young Dr. Bennett had just opened his o'dce at Scottsville, and the peo ple of Scottsville, including the two doctors who had been there for years, were wondering how long it would take him to starve out. Dr. Scott had a few hundred dol lars left after receiving his diploma, and instead of setting up his office in the woodshed and preparing to visit patients on foot he had fitted up nice quarters and bought a run about machine, just as it had planned to sail right to the top within three months. He also wore gloves and a silk hat, and he didn't hang around the postofflce and talk politics. Scottsville had its way, and It didn't like young Dr. Scott's way. •. The only other runabout owned in the vicinity was the n^achlne belong ing to Miss Ida June, daughter of the broker in the city, who had an all-the-year house a mile from the village. The coming of a second ma chine was resented by the villagers and by Miss Ida. It wasn't overcrowd ing the field, but it was a handsomer vehicle and was said to be speedier, and then it had been Introduced with out warning. The doctor hadn't even hinted that he Intended to W9rk such an Innova tion In country practice, and a feel ing of pique was aroused. He had made a bad start. He had not taken the village into his confidence. Every da,y Miss Ida came into the village in her runabout. after the mail. Dr. Scott met her at the post offlce. He didn't stare, and her glances were furtive, but the impression of neither was favorable. "Proud, haughty and selfish," was the doctor's verdict. "Thlnk's he's quit® some, and needs to be taken down," was the verdict of the girl. It was inevitable that the two ma chines should meet.. They did meet. Miss Ida looked straight ahead, as if passing a load of straw, and the doc tor only cast a swift glance at her and wondered if she thought she owned the earth.. It was the same the second and the third time. Then some one told, the girl that the doc tor was boasting that his machine could travel three mile to her two. He hadn't said any such thing, but the re port acted on her the same as the truth, and she replied with great spirit: "If I ever catch that young man out on the road I will give him a lesson to do him good." And then some one told the doctor that Miss Ida was going to "lay for him' and make a holy show of his machine, and though he only smiled in reply he determined to humiliate that girl if opportunity offered. It was a month before it offered. He found her apparently waiting for him on the broad highway, and she started off with a defiant squeal of the horn. He didn't attempt to overtake her. It wouldn't be dignity to overtake and pass a young lady the very first time. Besides, there was a good deal of dust flying, and he also thought he could make out that she was a bit reckless In her driving. On the second occasion, while the doctor -was driving at a fair gait, the girl came uo and whizzed past him, and he would have laid odd that he heard a sneering laugh. On the third he was sure of the sneer and the laugh, and he said that he would not spare her again. A week later he found her on the road waiting for him. She had descended to cull wild flowers, but as soon as he appeared in sight she took her seat in the machine, deliberately looked back and went ahead. It was her defl, and it was accepted. She was going to take that young man down a peg or two, and he was going to bring about humiliation. Farmer Henderson had sold a load of straw to the livery stable the day before, and on this day was driving I it into town. He was driving in the middle of the road, of course. He was half asleep, of course. There! was no particular reason why he should "keep to the right," and have his eyes wide open. By and by he thought he-heard a noise behind him, and he looked back to brave up and exclaim: "Now, then, shoot my cats if that June girl and that nevw doctor ain't racm' to beat the band and If some thin' don't happen, then I don't knOW!"r "^f' s. As a matter of fact, the doctor did have the* better machine. It was geared for higher speed, and perhaps he was the better driver. It began to'creep up and up, and Miss Ida's actions showed that she was getting nervous. As the machines ran side by. side the load of straw loomed up"eighty rods away. It was right in. the middle of the road, and evidently intended to stay there. There were deep ditches, on either side of the highway, and the doctor called to the girl: "Let's slow down and call it a draw. It will be dangerous to try to pass." ,"X«t Ota stop," replied the girl as 0- she looked straight ahead and shat her teeth hard. "I shall keep on!" "And I shall win!" "Gee whizz, but the idiots are goin' to bang into me," shouted" the fanner. "Whoa, there—stop, stop!" In hiB hand rein and the horses and load swerved that way. That swerve re duced the speed and crowded the girl Into the ditch and the machine turned turtle. The docter stopped as soon as he heard the crash, and the fanner gathered up his reins and said: "Yes, she's in the ditch there and probably as dead as a door nail, and I can't make out what ails you folks! When you see a load of straw ahead of you why in Sam Hill don't you stop?" "But you'll stop and help me?" asked the doctor. "Oh, she ain't dead after all. Hear her yelling! Only got an arm or a leg broke, and I guess you can man age. I like to help folks, hut they want this straw right away." No, Miss Ida had not been killed. She had an arm broken and received several bruises, but when the doctor had heaved the wrecked machine over she coolly said: "You saw, didn't you, that I was crowded into the ditch—that It wasn't due to my poor driving?" "We will discuss that later," re plied the medico with a smile. "I must get you home at once." "We will discuss it noy, sir. Am I as good a driver as you are?" ''I—I think so." "Didn't the wagon crowd me into the ditch?" "It certainly did." "And if it hadn't wouldn't I have stood a good chance of beating you?" "Y-e-s, but you are hurt. Who is your family doctor?" "We haven't any. You will take me home and patch me up, but not until have admitted that it wasn't a fair race." "Well, it wasn't.'* r. A Summary of The Important Points Brought Out in President's Message 

•ASHINGTON, D. C., Deo. 6.—The outstanding feature# ot President Taft's message, sent to eonfen*est today, are these: He declares it is time to stop legislating with reference to regulation of corporations and to witness the effect of a vigorous execution of the laws already on tl statute books. The exact limita tion upon business methods impost by law will' doubtless be made clearer by pending decisions of the supreme court. Just at this time, the president says, he believes the activities of the government, in addition to enforcement of the laws, should be at rected toward economy of administration, the enlargement of op portunities for foreign trade, the building up of home industry and the strengthening of confidence of oapital in domestio investment Mr. Taft recommends strongly some form of ship subsidy to in crease American shipping especially to South America. The tariff board is not ready to BUbmit a report on any of the schedules of the Payne law, and Mr. Taft say he will not recoVnmend any tariff legislation until the new congress convenes in Dec., 1911. He urges that the tariff board be made permanent and that all future revisions be made schedule by schedule. He vigorously opposes another general revision. The Panama canal should by all means be -fortified. An appropria tion of 919,000,000 is recommended for this purpose. There must be no more "pork barrel" methods in river and tar* bor and public building bills. The latter should be hased, upon th« report of a commission of experts. In the past congress has appropri ated too much for buildings not needed and- not enough for bulldlngf badly needed. Recommendation for anti-injunction and federal incorporation law* are renewed. It is proposed that second class mall rates fehall be re-adjtrated sa as to charge magazines much higher rate on their advertising sections. Strong representations are made fdr the establishment of a new banking and currency system. Two new battleships and several auxiliary vessels are urged for the navy. The president recommends that coal, phosphate and oil lands and water power sites be disposed of in the future by leasing. Estimates for government expenditures during the next fiscal year have been cut to $630,494,013.12, which is $52,965,877.36 less than the actual appropriations for the current year. The estimated receipts for the next fiscal year are $680,000,000. The president urges the extension of the civil service principle to the diplomatic and consular corps arid the acquisition by the govern-^ ment of residences and offices for its diplomatic officers. Some criticisms of the Payne tariff act are just, says the president, but more are unfounded. There shoqld be more officers for the army. The engineer corps should be increased by sixty. The fortifications- at Corregidor Island, Manila Bay and at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, should be carried to early completion. Regarding the Panama canal the president says: "The progress of the work is most Satisfactory. It will be coni pleted well within the time set, Jan. 1, 1915, and within the estimated cost of $375,000,000 for delay." Failure to fortify the canal would leave the United States power less to enforce the universal and equal use of the waterway against a desperate and irresponsible enemy, and would defeat the object of the canal in increasing the military effectiveness of the American navy. The slides In Culebra Cut offer no great reason' The tolls should not exceed $1 per net ton. The president should be authorized to adjust the rates as necessity arises. The government should include In its management of the canal the furnishing not only to the navy but to the public as well, dry dock and repair facilities, and the sale of coal, oil and other ship supplies. Interstate railroads should be prevented from owning or control ling ships trading through the canal. Regarding the courts the president declares the crying need of the United States is cheapening1 the cost of litigation by simplifying judicijfl procedure and expediting final judgment. The supreme court should b^* relieved from unnecessary appeals. The Salaries of federal judges should b« Increased. Postal savings banks will be established in a number of cities on January 1. A parcels post on rural delivery routes is recommended. Postmaster Hitchcock Is given high praise for putting the postofflce department on a self-sustaining basis. The extension of the civil serv ice to include all classes of postmasters, and thus taking these officials entirely put of politics is urged. The president recommend? congress give some fitting recognition of the polar discoveries of Commander Robert E. Peary. The secre tary of the navy suggests thfct Peary be made a rear admiral and placed on the retired list. The stupendous value of the agricultural products amounting-to $8,926,000,000 this year, Indicates a good prospect for business through out the country. The present census promises to be the best ever taken, but is not perfect. The census paddors are to be vigorously prosecuted. A bureau of health should be established. *}j. The Southern Pacific railroad should be reimbursed for its ex penditures in fighting the flood in the Imperial Valley of California several years ago. Heavier fines should be Imposed against steamship companies for violating the immigration laws. The facilities at Ellis Island, New York, should not be so increased as to offer an Inducement to the steamship companies, to concentrate their Immigrant business at one port. Immigrants are needed in the rural districts. Some provision should be made for retiring superannuated ernment clerks. The only amendments suggested in the interstate commerce law are an appropriation to enable the Interstate commerce commission to ascertain the valuation of railroads and fixing tho responsibilities of public carriers in the issuance of bills of lading. alarm he pulled on the right 4*- 1 *f7' *-S '-kl •V 1 1 7 "And that if my runabout can be repaired we shall try it again." "Certainly, if you wish." 4 "And you are to tell dad that I had nerve—just as much as you had." jf* "I'll be happy to." The patient was taken home in the doctor's machine and attended to, and In due time her own runabout came back from the/ shop, but- some how or other- another race never came off. When she was able to ride out again the doctor made her believe that it must be in his charge, and when she came to drive again he was too busy to race. At the end of six months Farmer Henderson went home from town one day and said to ms wife: "Hanner, you remember that girl and the doctor?" "Yes they are goin' to sue you for .damages and take our farm away*" "Sue nothin'. They tell me In town they are goin' to get married. They ought to give me a new wagon for bringin' it about."
