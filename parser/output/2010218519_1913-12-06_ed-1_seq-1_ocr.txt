RESIDENT WILSON delivered his first an r nual message to congress on Tuesday last. It was ver brief, dealing with but few topics. It might bo called a curtain raiser. The real play will begin later. Ho mentioned the present pending legislation on the currency ques tion and the present status of affairs with Mex ico, and especially recommended that provision bo made for nominating Presidents through di rect primaries the Roosevelt-LaFollette idea which we are satisfied will prove a misfortune when tried. It will give politicians a magnificent J1 chance by tho use of a little money and a few mouthy orators to gather the rough scuff to j ' the primaries, while the good men who have a horror of Buch things will remain at homo, and we shall have some President nominated that wo will not bo very proud of. It Is on tho same score as tho recall of judges, which wo think Is deplorable, not only because it handicaps judges in their positions, but makes them dread the work of agitators, knowing as they must know that there is no trait in human nature so strong as the de sire to pull someone down who has reached a position, and to such people the harangue of a blatherskite is sufficient proof of tho Incompe tency of a Judge. The still more serious fea ture Is that they cannot help but break down I tho rospoct which is necessary to feel for the courts, and when that is done then we will have tho preliminary agitation which culminates some times In riot and all manner of excesses. When the people of Athens wero called upon to docldo whether their greatest man should be banished or not and they wrote their bal- lots on sholls, one mnft gave as a reason for voting for his banishment, that he was tired of hearing him referred to as "tho good." That spirit still rules in human nature. That men obey laws at all Is bocauso the wise mon In the past found that society was not safe for a mo ment unless there wore laws and those laws could bo enforced. But the old rebellious, preju diced feeling is still an active germ In the souls of thousands of men. President Wilson read his address to con gress. Many people think that it is an inno vation, hut Washington and Adams did tho same thing. Jefferson, when he became President, changed tho program and his motives were two fold. He wanted to show his scorn for tho aris tocratic methods of Washington, for down deep he hated Washington and deeper still he hated Alexander Hamilton, and one of his hates for Washington was because he knew that Wash ington respected Hamilton and loved him and that he did not have much respect or lovo for Jefferson. Then he had another object. Ho wanted to give the people an Idea that he was wonderfully Interested in them and desired s peclally to make the government the govern ment of the people, when in truth he was the most domineering President that there over was In the United States with the possible exception of Mr. Wilson. The delivery of the message direct from the President to congress Is not a bad idea. It has a double significance. While it makes clear that the President means business, It gives congress men the Idea that he Is still considerate of them. Of course, they are entirely different branches of the government. One Is the law-making power and the other Is tho executive, whoso business it is to see that the laws are on forced. But the executive in this case Intends that before he enforces laws he should have such laws passed as he is willing to enforce, which makes It a peculiar situation. With a smile tho President says, figuratively: "Wo are co-workers for tho good of the country, but keep in mind that I am boss," while congress men, with a smile, answer back, figuratively: "You can bully us, Mr. President, up to a cer tain point, but it is us that have the say," and so the play goes on. The message was beautifully written. There Is no doubt about tho scholarship or the style of -President Wilson. His state paper on Tues day was perfectly enough prepared to bo road before the graduating olass at Princeton. What of Fort Douglas
