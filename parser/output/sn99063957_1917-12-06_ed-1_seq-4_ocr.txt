CHAPTER LXXVI. After rpnchinrf Kuma T tinlr r,ff mtr ii ii j i '. : - - w- y "V Weil Lflat 1 things and then went into the library. Vimif in ' ati ad iixe inclination to cry, and JUST A FIT OF "TEMPER" Governor Withycombe has refused to pay the bonus promised ex-Superintendent Crawford of the prison flax plant, if he made a financial profit of the business. As governor of the state, and as such being in charge of the flax plant, he is quite within his rights and certainly is only doing his duty if he actually believes what he says, that Mr. Crawford has not made good. That he does not believe it is shown by his admission that, leaving the seed out of the calculation, that there is still a profit of $4,188, and by his offer to pay him $400. The governor goes out of his way to assert that Mr. Crawford's predecessor grew the crop and intimates that he should have credit for the value of the seed, and that Crawford should not. The governor knows better than this. Mr. Crawford's predecessor did not grow the crop of flax from which the seed was produced, lhat crop was crown under contract by farmers. The state had absolutely nothing to do with the growing of it other than to furnish the seed for planting. The state had nothing whatever to do with the crop untli its harvesting began. Mr. Crawford took charge in August and every bit of work done on the crop was under his direction. He harvested the crop, threshed, cleaned and sacked the seed, put the straw in the sheds and did whatever else was done to or about the crop by the state. " . However leaving out the flax seed Mr. Crawford's statement, which he says is checked up with the figures of the board of control, shows cash on hand $10,668.07, or $114.51 more than enough to repay the money loaned by the legislature. It shows the sum of $2,091.40 due from material sold. It shows improvements, paid for by Craw ford from sales, improvements, sacks on hand, lumber, twine, etc., amounting to $6,315.08. It shows fiber and tow baled and ready for market valued at $5,681.60. There is retted straw ready to manufacture valued at $15,250. There is unrettcd straw, threshed and bundled ready for rettiffg valued at $10,400. Besides these and other items there are 90 tons of straw in the sheds harvested and paid fflr by Crawford and which cost $1,980. Yet his excellency the 'governor, inppanuy remancs that he has figures which show "he, is lucky if he breaks even." , The governor admits there is a profit of $4,188, but inti mates this profit will vanish under the manipulations of his pencil. No doubt unassited and unchecked, the gov ernor might reach this solution, but we doubt anyone else doing so. He could reach it easily as he counts the labor and "time" that will be required to manufacture the "250 tons of straw" he says are on hand, but does not count the value of the finished product from it. The governor admits he does not like Crawford and did not want to make a contract with him. There is the whole reason for the gubernatorial dispaly of childish temper.

"The Turkish sultan belongs on tho bosom of the German knitter," Miller shouted. "The Turks must live or die with Germany. I hope they die with her." Miller charged that failuro of the I'nitod States to get supplies and funds and war materials to Italy for months resulted from the fact thnt this coun try was not at war with Austria. Much of the Italian disaster may bo charged against the I'nited States, ho said. "We cannot hope to separate Bulgar ia nmt Turkey from Germany and Aus tria except bv force of arms," said Mil ler. "We must throw away these intel lectual theories and go in wholehearted ly with our allies in common cause against the enemy."
