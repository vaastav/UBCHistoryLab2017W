The civilized world should make war upon England and compel her to act justly toward Ireland. The condition of tbe Irish is said to be worse than that of any other people in the world. Mi Delmae estimates that $3,700,000,000 of silver and gold has been sent to China and India since the middle of the sixteenth cen tury, and that not more than one-tenth of it has ever found its way back to Europe.

They represent th.t they are terri bly oppressed.and it is further urged that taxing banks reacts upon the business of, the country and is therefore a fcreat calamity. It' s still fur ther urged that the Government does not need the r venue secured br taxing banks, and can 'get along remarkably; well witbout it Indeed, it is asserted that without the $3,000,00 derived' from bank taxation the Government can pay all expenses and re duce the public' debt $100,000,000 a yeaf, Such statements are made ' br rnn of high characle'rj wiiv is j Vp faj4lViif f jtji the subject of revenues. Tntj fact thai Ihi Gevernment Is so well-to-do will likely'sug gest to the minds 'of a good many people that in reducing taxes the best place to begin is not the banks. The people are now enormously taxed to support National Banks, and if the banks are required to re fund some of the money, it is no inore than right. Let us have fair play in 'inatters of taxation. -7 . It is expected that France will be obliged to import nearly 70,000,000 bushel. Of wheat for consumption during the pending winter, and there is no doubt who will reap the ac cruing benefit. The French can not get what they want from Russia, as that Gov ernment lias been compelled to place pro hibitive restrictions upon the exportation of breadstuff. They must, therefore, come to us, and as nearly 500,000,000 bushels of wheat were garnered in he United States this year, we shall, no.doubt, be able to sup ply their wants. THE 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. We lay before the readers of the Sentinel this morning the. last annual message of Rutherford B. Hayes, whose .occupancy of the White House will cease March 4, 1WL The document has no remarkable features; it gives expression to no commanding thoughts; it is a somnolent state paper; it deals in platitudes; it is wanting in vigor, and in all regards is characteristic of Ruth erford B. Hayes. The message congratulates the members of the Senate -and House of Representatives "on the continued and in creasing prosperity ot our country," and credits "Divine Providence" with bestow ing the ''blessings of health, abundant har vests and profitable employment." The message refers to the fact that the Government of the United States is at peace with all the Nations of the earth. Mr. Hayes points with special pride to the fact that the late Presi dential eleciion passed off quietly. He be lieves there is no necessity for a Solid North or a Solid South, and that as soon as the Fifteenth Amendment is obeyed, everything ' like the solidity of sections will disappear. Mr. Hayes renews his recommendations uj)on the subject of Civil Service Reform, and urges legislation upon the subject with considerate emphasis. As matters now stand, Mr. Hayes is of the opinion that the "stability of the Government" is in danger. He wants Congress to enact a law establish ing "fixed rules for the regulation of ap jKIntment., promotions and removals, es tablishing uniform methods, having ex clusively in view in every instance, the attainment of the best qualifica tions for the position in question. It is to , be hoped that Congress will at tince proceed to give Mr. Hayes a law that will meet with his approval. Mr. Hayes takes stroiiKground against polygamy, and reconi mends aggressive legislation against the Mormons. He favors wiping out the pres ent Territorial Government of Utah and the establishment of a Government "analogous to the provisional Government established for the territory northwest of .the Ohio by the ordinance of 1787." If that will not do, then he recommends that the right to vote, hold office and sit on juries in the Territory of Utah be confined to those who neither practice nor uphold polygamy. Aside froiu these things, the message is devoid of special interest, and is chiefly made up of a rehash of Department reports. Mr. Hayes favors. like John Sherman, a bigger silver dollar ami the retirement of the greenbacks. He mildly refers to the Monroe doctrine with reference to the Darien Ship Canal. He favors granting subsidies as a means of extending the commerce of the country. Such a policy would draw largely upon the Federal Treasury, and whatever might be the result in a commercial point of view, it would largely benefit the private gentlemen who iocketed the money. The subject of education is touched upon, with a few flour ishes of the pen designed to impress Con gress with the importance of educating the ignorant who reside in States where school funds are not sufficient to meet the educa tional demand. In such cases, Mr. Hayes would draw on the Federal Treasury. The message will create no excitement and precious little interest anywhere, the only recommendation calculated to create a ripple on the smooth surface of political puddles being that relating to Civil Service Reform. In some regards the message is suggestive of reflections. It is the last that Mr. Hayes will issue. In lesa than three months Mr. Hayes will retire from an office to which he was elevated by means which will grow in colossal repulsiveness as the years roll on and in the future as often as his name shall be mentioned it will call up a record that no American citi zen can contemplate without experiencing a sense of deep humiliation. But Mr. Hayes has made money by the operation, and has managed, it is believed, to save at least $150,000 of his salary, and to hand somely reward out of the Federal Treasury the men who contributed directly to enter upon the the duties of an office which, by the fiat of the American people, belonged to another citizen.
