"DAVID R. FRANCIS." ! THE PRESIDE'NT'S INDORSEMENT OF THE WORLD'S FAIR. "I bespeak the mot cordial support from the Congress and the people for the St. Louis Exposition to commemorate the one hundredth annltersary of the Louisi ana Purchase. Thi purchase was the greatest instance of expansion in our his tory. It definitely decided that we were to become a great continental Republic, by far the foremost Power in the Wetrn Hm'phere. It is one of three or four great landmarks In our hitcrj th great turnlnc point In our development. It is eminently fitting that all of our pecple shoulo Join vith heartiest good will in com memorating it. and the citizens of St. Lout, of Missouri, of all the adjacent region, are entitled to etery aid in making the relebration a noteworthy etent in our an nals. We earnestly hope that foreign iation will appreciate thedeep interest our country takes in this Exposition, and our -(few- of its importance from etery stand point, and that thej- will participate in ectiring its success. The national Govern ment should be represented bj a full and complete set of exhibit" I A PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE TO THE FIFTY-SEVENTH CONGRESS IN CONDENSED FORM, President Theodore Roosevelt's first annual msage to Congres was rad In both houtes of Congress jesterday. For the first time in history the message was transmit ted in print. The two copies for the House and the Senate were printed on paper of the same size as that heretofore ued for the written copies: the color of the paper, however, is a heavy white instead of the blue tint which has been in use. Each copy was richly bound in brown morocco, with stiff covers, with simple gold border and let tering, the words on the front being: "Message of the President of the United States, 130L" The most striking points in the message follow: Anarchy is a crime against the "bole human race, and all mankind should band against the anarchist. His ciinie should be made an offense against the law of nations. Nothing could be more unwise than to disturb the business interests of the country by any general tariff change at this time. Subject to this proviso of the proper protection necessary to our well-being ar home, the principle of reciprocity must command our Hearty support. I most earnestly ask jour attention to the wisdom, indeed, to the vital need, of providing for a substantial reduction in the tariff duties on Cuban imports into the United States. I regard it as necessary to re-enact immediately the law excluding Chinese laborers, and to strengthen it wherever necessary to make its enforce ment entirely effective. The condition of the American merchant marine is such as to call for im mediate remedial action by the Congress. It should be made advantageous to carry American goods in American-built snips. j - The railway Ts a public servant, its rates should be jut to and open to all shippers alike. The Government should seeto, it, that, within its jurisdic tion, this is so, and should provide a speedy, inexpensive and effective remedy to that end. The mechanism of modern business Is so delicate that extreme care must be taken not to interfere with it in a spirit of rashness or ignorance. The first essential in determining how to deal with the gieat industrial combinations is knowledge of the facts publicity. In the interest of the pub lic, the Government should have the right to inspect and examine the tork-' ings of the great corporations engaged in interstate business. Xo single great material work which remains to be undertaken on this continent is of such consequence to the American people as the building of a canal across the isthmus connecting North and Sonth America. The work of upbuilding the navy must be steadily continued. In dealing with the Philippine people. ie must show both patience and strength, forbearance and steadfast resolution. There should be created a Cabinet officer to be known as Secretary of Com merce and Industries. Our present immigration laws are unsatisfactory. The President should nave by law the power of transferring lands for use as forest reserves to the Department of Agriculture. The policy of the National Government should be to aid irrigation in the several States and Territories in such manner as w ill enable the people in the local communities to help themselves. I call your attention most earnestly to the crying need of a cable to Hawaii and tie Philippines to be continued from the Philippines to points in Asia. The Monroe Doctrine should be the cardinal feature of the foreign policy of all the nations of the two Americas, as it is of the United Stares:. Pressure for the promotion of civil officials for political reasons is bad enoug, but it is tenfold worse where applied on behalf of officers of the army or navy. Xot an office should be filled in the Philippines or Porto Kfco with any re gard to the man's partisan affiliations or services, with any regard to the polit ical, social or personal influence he may.have. In my judgment, the time has arrived when we should definitely make up ocr minds to recognize the Indian as an individual, and not as a member of a tribe.
