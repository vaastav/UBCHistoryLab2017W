FARMING If! HIGHLANDS j Census of Mines Not as Satis-! Manager of Bartlett Estate Tells Is Captain Fred Foruo of the terri torial Mounted Police, has returned from Oklahoma City. He was no., er aetly impressed with the official treat ment given him. Armed with requisi tion papers for one William B. Quin lan, wanted in Socorro for contracting for a car of horses for which he was to. pay $700 cash and a stallion, but for which he has thus far failed to make good, Captain Fornoff located Quinlin at Sentinel, Oklahoma, and had him taken to Oklahoma City for a hearing before Governor Haskell. :But evidently the governor of Okla homa is averse to good citizens being taken out of his state and refused to honor the requisition because of the technicality that the averments in the complaint were., not sufficient. The complainant, George Cook, of Socorro, has no redress, and may have to pay in addition the expenses of Captain Fornoff and of the proceedings. Sher iff Talle of McKinley county, who had also gone to Oklahoma to bring back with him a man named Scott, located at Shawnee, and wanted at Gallup for leaving the Carbon City with a dia mond ring and shot gun claimed by some one else, became wise to the fact that Oklahoma is a favored refuge for people wanted elsewhere to answer for their deeds, and arranged for a satisfactory settlement, and returned with Captain Fornoff, but, without his prisoner.
