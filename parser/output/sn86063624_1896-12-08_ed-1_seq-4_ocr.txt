The dlFcussion of a new state constltu- Son over In Kansas has given a striking Irustratlon of the proclivity of the Amer can people to talk most about that of vhlch they know least. It may be safely (alii that not one in ten of the Populist Itatcsmen who are now spouting about the need of a new constitution has ever read the present orgtnlc law of the state. In demonstration of this it is only necessary to ask one of them what particular article, MftJon or clause h? believes is needing re vision, or what particular amendment the people might most advantageously attach, ind In the one case he will stammer and ivade and in the other. In a majority ot uihtanccs at least, will name pomething Much is already contained In the existing tonstilution. State Senator William K. Ptcrne, of Shaw iej. has ben making some experiments ilong this line, and has accomplished some esulis which are edlfvlngas well us aafflf. sir He declares that the people who are lolng th greater part of the talking about he no. csslty of a new constitution in Kan is lR-r never read ten lines of the docu mert wlit li was adopted with such Indnltn Mins in 1K, and that few. If any, of them save more than the remotest Idea, of Hire ral p-rrposes of the Instrument. He find-t that numbers of these would-lm constltu. uon makers have confused the function of thp lecishture wish those of the coistl t Hon, and. Instead of a. brand declaration tit governmental prlr.epl-s, or a guarante o' -rta'n Itnllenablo rights to the citlzpn, thev w .uld nakc out of tho prlmarv do-n-trx-ii' i rode of laws and include In it ail o' in na-hlnprj wh!--h properly belongs In t1-" e'etutor' enactments. In illustra t t c tl Ignorance of some of the lotiu rf t..!k. it Senator Sterne Fays he found o' pnmlt.ent Populist Tvho thought the J .m nt und- dlscnsion was tho De la n "-! ' Independence, and who sold that v i ' i is sood enough for Jefferson's " ' w a out at date now. In pausing, " ni.li propriety be Ud that this is - w . - than the remark of John IJreid- w o de-'lrd that the constitution ' 'hanged becinse it was adopted i . s when cowboys ruled." I t..l not b assumed. Iiowewr. that 1 j i he Populists are behind this con- i movnnt they are a unit ill i a i There i at least one noteworthy ex -i m tn the cae of the Pittsbura .x - nn of the leading Populist pa r Smthern Kansas, whlvh declares i . --epport a convention only upnn r tn, ii that the prevent constitution ' ilijSS'hcd and nothing put in Ii T- i..iiam-rs the somewhat startling , - trii on that a constitution Is not need. ii 1 declare that "the experience of iity phows that constitutions, in. 1 ' i-TvIm: ar a Imrrler against irre t i", ar themselves the bul- ' s-hield of whatever nbuse or 'ts in the state or nation." As an -.it the Kansan concedes reluct- a .vinstitution rcngbt not b v i' t uses, but declares that It should l j.ni'.r 1 lo two brief clauses, one of w I n tiovld. ior th holding of elections a ) t, othr f - 'lni l legislator.

It Is not fai to auii" that an thins like a large per cnt of the Populist party subscribe to such a doctrine, but It does show the tensr of thought which Is Insidiously permeating the organization, ami which, unrebukd by the more Intelligent leaders, may grow to proportions as dangerous as the doctrine i'i abhorrent. Trcre Is but one conclusion to be drawn, and that Is that the people of Kansas are not in temper at this time to cocstnir. a sat .star tory constitution. This idea, la ad mirably stated by Judge J. 15. Johnson, who sais: 'The state ought to be at ret when a new constitution Is adopted. The public mind Is not tranquil enoush at tni tlm to sive the Krave questions the delib erate f oniderat!on which they .houM have. Constitutions should only be made at the. calmest and most peaceful periods In the-his-tory of a state." the I'HEmr.NT'.s ME''n. 5Ir. Cleveland's last annual message to congress will h" read chiefly for its titter acf on the Cuban situation and its deal nsn with the flnanclal quetIon. It is writ ten in the president's usual ponderous stjle, now so familiar to the eountrv'. and -nlth his outcmury feeling of "solemn re sponlb'lKy." In d!-u.ss!ng the Cuban question, the pivsideirt reviews at some length the con dition or affairs in the hCand, which he ny-s is most ileplorable. Tho Spanish troops peem to be making little headway agnln-t tho Insurgents, and a state of an archy exists. Excep'es are committed by both sides and if the contest is protracted much longer it will result in the utter de struction of the Industrial value of terri tory in wrhch Americans have large Inter ests, amounting to at least from 

JSO.VO.OOO to $7,000.000. It is alo polntfd out that the United States ts involved In the contest in -wayn both vexatious and costly through filibustering operations1. The president suggests autonomy for Cu ba, and thinks if Spain would grant home rule to the island that the b.t interests of both would be conserved. The message re lates that our government Intimated to Spain some time ago that It home rule were offered the insurgents and accepted by them on a guaranty of its success the United States would endeavor to furnish such guaranty. No response has yet been received from Spain, but the president hopes for an early acceptance. If not, and things go onr from bad to worse In the Isl and, he plainly hints that this government will be called upon to interfere. But he counsels calmness and moderation in deal ing with, the question "until the time for action nrrivea." As might have? been expected, Mr. Cleve land upholds that wretched failure, the Wibon tariff law, which he rays has, not withstanding "its shortcomings as a com plete measure of tariff reform, opened the w-ny to a freer and greater exchange be tween us and other countries." In this he Is correct, but the benefit ha3 nil been on the side of the foreigner and to the detri ment of tho United States. Ho attributes the genwal business depression since the passage or the law not to that measure, but to other causes "perfectly well under stood and entirely disconnected with our tariff law," and believes the present act will yield ample revenue for all purpOFes. Tho "weakness and vices of our financial system" fill the president with alarm. It is "fraught -wlrh the greatest peril and per plexity," to his view, and must be correct ed. He explains what ought to be done, the first thing being to retire the green backs by exchanging them for Ions term bonds bearing a low rate of interest. He snrms up the situation by declaring thut "the day of sensible and sound financial methods will not dawn upon us until our government abandons tho banking busi ness and the accumulation of funds and confines Ita monetary operations to the re ceipt of money" for Its support. It would not seem like Mr. Cleveland's message dJd he not give tho offensive par tisans a rap, which he does In vigorous fashion. Ho also gives the trusts an over hauling, and closes with his usual plea for the "most rigid economy." There Is really nothing of particular interest about the message except Its disclosure of tho gov ernment's present attitude in the Cuban trouble. On this point it is more satis factory than the administration's long tar diness had led; the country to expect. 

COMING TO THUIIl SEiES. The recent action of the Chicago Fed eration of Labor In refusing to indorse a resolution declaring for the free and un limited coinage of silver at the ratio of 15 to 1 Is noteworthy. The same thing has happened in other labor organisations since the election and indicates that the work Ingmen are beginning to pee the trap they were drawn into by the sophistries of Bryan and the counsels of Sovereign and other leaders. At the last election a large proportion of the memlfprs of organized labor societies voted for Bryan, and the met realous ef forts of that gentleman in the campaign were directed to securing the support of the wage-earners. Since the election, however, the worklngmen have come to study the question with judgment unbiased by the heat of political exclteme nt. and the rrsult Is a marked change of feeling. They are com ing to realize that the rounder the money we havo the better it is for the tollers. They have not yet experienced the dread fid effects of the gold standard so vividly potraved by Mr. Brvan. and the imprrs--,on seems to be gradually dawmnir upon them that they were the victims of a game of political bunco of which the boy orator was the chief fakir. At this short ditanco from the eventful day which saw the downfall of the free oinac? craze. It is difficult to understand bow so manv good people could be de prived Into supporting a selfish scheme of (he silver trust. But the heresy spread like i ertoln nervous epidemics, such as "jrks" and the "Jumping sickness," which afllict el whole regions in the early days of the ountry. A man or nxman was seized with the "jerks" just because n neighbor had them, and many a shouting free silver man caught his disease In much the same man ner. Happily for the country, the delusion is rapidly on the wane and will soon be rumberrd with the many other crazes that havo been exploded and forgotten. oi it m:ic:iihoh-. thii mutin.. It Is related in the telegrams that Pro-fe-or Lowell, the Boston astronomer, has started for the dty of Mexico with the huge object glas of his twentv-K inch telescope, and that on next Thursday night t he expects to make some startling dis coveries through his observation of the planet Mars. On the date given the planet comes Into "opposition." which means that a line drawn to It from the sun would pis3 through the earth, this being the condition which furnlshCH the bc.n opportunities for telrscoric investigation. In 1S34. wh'n Mars was last In 'opposition ' Frofe.--or l.ow(ll made an elaborate series ,if obser vat.ns from Flas- aff A T and then startled the aueaufii. world by detlannc that he had fourd evidences, that the planpt wps peopled jut .if our eaith i. amtirg them being artifit allv constructed irrigation canals It was Sonlaparplli who first saw there rana. but Lowell added lo them innumer able new ones which he disfcovered while at Flagstaff, and in addition he believes that he demonstrated the existence of an atmosphere around the planet. He made nt that time a chart of the melting snow cap around the Martian south pole, which in itself Ls proof of the existence of at at mosphere, as .now and water cannot exist without air It is his theorj that thtre Is a great scarcity of water upon the habita ble portion of the planet, and that the canals so plainly marked are simply gigan tic irrigation ditches ued to convey the water from the melting snows about the south pole. In his observations this week Professor Lowell expects to learn much more about the-habltabll'ty of Mars, and even makes the enthusiastic prediction that proof will be gathered of the existence of a race of Intelligent beings upon its surface. ti,m;us ovuiiMriiiT. Dr. Talnrage, in his sermon last Sjnday, discoursed in his usual eloquent way of employments In heaven. The learned di vine takes the position that the occupations of our life in the flesh will be ransferred to the heavenly city, where the lawyer will prepare nU briefs, the military man study strateglcs in connection with the heaven) armies, tlhe sculptor aral painter evolve dreams cf lauty out of maTble or limn thtm on canvas, and the naturalist and the chemist pursue their favorite studies under the most favorable conditions, and bo on. But in the loner catalogue of professions enumerated by the pulpit orator there is no mention of the editor. How did the good parson com to make, this oversight? Surely In that great concourse of the re deemed from t?ie captivity of the flesh, where the activities of worldly life are car ried on under exceptionally favorable cir cumsCanePS, there must be innumerable newspaper men, who swajed. while on earth, the thoughts of the people for good and exercised a. general supervision of the moral vineyard. No doubt there are thou sands of them there with, aa eager noses fcr news ai they had when on tMs mun dane sphere. It was tho injunction of Jer emiah to "publish and conceal not," and how can this bo Jone without an editor to issue an occasional extia of the Celestial Messenger? All of the local affairs of the New Jerusalem need to be looked after, aii who so competent as the newspaper man Who had jears of practical training here below? ThfTe are great spectacles presented in the heavenly city every day that would fill a Journalist's soul with de light. Magnificent pageants and proces sions along the jasper streets; wonderful concerts, as the hundred and forty-four tlhousand sing their new song before the throne and ihe amethystine air pulsates with tho "voice of harpers harpins with their harps," besides many other splendid sights and happenings. If Mr. Talmago 'is right, then ifcivKl clearly hinted at newspapers in heaven when he said, "Prilse Him with organs," and the preacher did a manifest injustice to the profession by leaving editors out of celestial consideration. EDITORIAL OTE3. We don't mind telling Mr Cleveland frankly that the country would have re membered him with fully as much affec tion if he had cut that message down three-fourths. The country will be safe till the 4th of March, but after that date congressmen who failed of re-election would not be at all surprised to see it go to the bow-wows. Probably the most gratifsing thing about the president's ponderous message Is the assurance that It is the last of its kind. The Spanish navy may be stronger than ours, but all the same Spain will be wise to bring the Cuban trouble to) a termina tion without delay. Mr. Bayard, of course, humbly apolo gized for the constitutional obstacles whlcn prevent him from accepting that British Christmas box. As leader of the minority In the house :Mr. Bland is sure to have some unple?ant collisions with Mr. Reed's business rules. Mr. Leedv's face must have worn a very broad smile when he remarked that the ap pointment of Ed Little as his private sec retary would not take Ed out ot the sen. atorlal race. The president declares that "the progress made In civil service reform furnishes a cause for the utmost congratulation." And so it does to the thousands of Democrats who have been th'is riveted In office. The thousands of Republicans who were kicked out to make room for them don't see it in quite that light, however. 51r. Cleveland's defense of the Wilson bill will not deceive many as to the char acter of that measure. It Is a wretched failure, and everjbody knows it. So far as the suppression of trusts is concerned, the general government and the state governments might both work to gether for that end without any fear that the suppression would be too thorough. This seems to be a great year for John It. Tanner. He has not only been elected governor of Illinois, but has been elected lieutenant governor of his own household. It is no material difference to the country whether Major SIcKinley and Speaker Reed are warm personal friends or not. Major 5IKinley will make the best record he can as president and Mr. Reed will make the best record he can as speak er. It is not necessary for the success of either that the other should bp a failure, and it is not within the power of either to interfere with the other's success If he wished to. They are both big men and earnest patriots, and both will be too busy serving the country to bother their hea3s about personal likes and dislikes.

From the Boton Herald. Mr. William J. Brian talks like a man who has had, on tho whole, a prettv good time. He has achieved notoriety bevond his wildest expectations, and he emerges from the campaign a personage of national importance, instead of the second or third rate politician that he was bpfore the Chi cago convention Natural! v. he is in favor ot continuing the fight on the lines already laid down. "We are ready for another contest." he savs, the "we" in tlu cn--e meaning the cohorts or Populized Democ racy with himeir at their head "We en tered the contest w ith a disorganized arm : we emerge from it a united and disciplined force without the loss of a soldier." The bearing of this observation depends on Its application. The Idea of the managers of the campaign was to unite the forces which supported Cleveland in 1S92 with those who voted for Weaver But, with a. total vote of 1.7M.O00 more than it was in 1S92. the combination of ISM polled 230.000 votes less than its component parts did four jeans before. Assuming that It could claim only half of tho new vote, or 730. OiTO. there is between the votes that it dropped and the votes that it did not get an obvious loss of l.ftVKlOO DemoTatic "soldiers" as a result of the combination formed at the Chicago convention. It must, therefore, be regarded as an open question whether the Democratic party leaders view the prospect of con tinuing the contest with the same satis faction as Mr. Brvan He has nothing to lose. If not much to gain. h keeping before tho public the principle which the public has energetically repudiated. What Mr. Brvan persists in calling "bimetallism" is as dead as the principles of the silver gray Whlgs. and If the defeated candidate can not find an Issue having more vitalitv than that the chances of success In 1900 are surely nil The solemnity with which Mr. Bryan repeats tho charge that interna tional bimetallism was rot serlouslv con templated by those who wrote the Repub lican platform involves the assumption that he ever seriously believed In Its pos sibility himr-elf. The official organs of the European hlmetallists have made haste to rppudiate him and hl mthods. and have extracted much comfort from his defeat. If there were any such thing as logical cohesion about the processes of Mr Bry or.'s mind, he would see that there was an absolute incompatibilltv between what he calls "an American financial policy for the American people" and any talk of bimetal lism dependent on in'ernatlonal agreement In fact, Mr. Ilrjan Is as little capable after the election as he was before It of giving any intelligible statement of what ho wants, or of discussing, questions of flnanrp m anv other language than tint of voluble and reckless demigoglsm. Whether it be his tongue or pen that Is working, the same shallow sophistries that were his stock in trade during the campaign are made to do duty over again The rising value of gold, the diminished volume ot the world's standard money, and all tho old familiar fallacies which have been so con clusivflv refuted br facts appear to be st'll regarded bv Mr Brvan as forming a solid basis for bis lost cause It re quires a certain obtuspness. moral or Intel lectual, or both, to offer to the objections of the wage parner the formula that "a dollar which increases in purchasing power is an injurv to those who owe money, and must mirchasp it wih the proceeds of toil " The total Inversion of the relat'on borne to an honest dollar by the greatest "creditor class" of all. the working men and women of the country, is a character istic stroke of Bryanism. but It has lost ary power it ever had to convince, even if it still retains some of its power to de ceive. Abolish SIlciinII "Vott. Trom the Chicago Tribune. It is reported that a proposition lo abol ish football will come up for consideration bpfore the Asso-Iatlon of College Presi dents of the cuddle Werft at its meeting on December It This refer?, of course, to thp exhibitions of slugball which have become notorious features of rollege life In recent vpars Certainly It should be abolished It is out of place as an adjunct to an In stitution of learning. It should be relegated to the bruisers and thugs, like Fltzsim mans and Sharkey and others of that Ilk. The question does not even admit of dis cussion by a bodv of men with the ideals usually attributed to college presidents Where is there room for advere argu ment in a proposition to abolish slueball-' No one can pretend that the encourage ment of athletic training Is regarded anv iongpr even as a pretext fur theep exhibi tions. They arc brute battles, simply and unequivocally. They are openly recognized as full of dangpr to thp participants. No one would dream of starting a contest without the presence of a corps of sur geons and a full complement of substi tutes It is expected before every game that during the fortv minutes of "plav" one. or two. or a dozen, or even all the original contestants will be maimed. Ex pert phsic!an- and surgeons are as neces sary as the umpire. Ambulances or stretcher' are kept at hand to carry awav the injured.

This Is all there is to 'Higball apar' '-wn its gaud setting An., thit- in the i-it ;ue which the college presidents au to "consider" Thev j can have ro more Imperative business at I tris coming meeting than to take the most ! drastic action against this travest on a game. Let some college president take the trouble to compile a list of the oung men who have been killed or Injured at slugball during only the last season and then let him read this list at the meeting, or a hundred or so of the names if time does not warrant thp rending of the entire list. That ought to end or preclude unv further discussion. When slugball has been driven out. then, perhaps, the students will enjoy the res toration of that Interesting and wholesome game of football which some people will remember as an admirable part of the ath letic curriculum of the colleges of a few jeani aso. Tin- Vcn Counterfeiting:. From tho New York World. When the Bland dollars were first made It was pointed out as a danger that any thrifty and enterpris'ng coiner might make a very heavy profit bv setting up a dollar factory of hw own In oppo.tion to that of the government. The art of the engraver renders the counterfeiting of paper money practically impossible. The difference in specific grav ity and other ta-ily tested qualities? ren ders extended success in making gold coin.s from other metals practically out of the question. But with a qher dollar made out of onlv- y) cents' worth of silver nnv discreet counterfeiter, bv using precisely the same weight of silver of the same de gree of fineness, can make dollars that are indistinguishable from the genuine and pocket ICO per cent profit from his enter prise. The treasury department finds that this is now actually done; that persons who may be described as advanced and prac tical free siier men are in fact puttirg the free coinage programme into opera tion without waiting for laws or elections or other formalities of that sort, and with out subjecting the government to any mint charges. Some of these persons have been care less In their operations and a trifle waste ful of their raw materials, so that the government officials now imd in the trea ur vaults some of the privately made dollars that have more silver in them than the genuine. Their heedlessness in this way has awak ened the treasury officials to the danger, and the question of how to stop this dan geious but highly profitable form of full weight counterfeiting will be considered In the forthcoming official reports. south Hails the Dentil of .Sectionalism. From the Macon Telegraph (Dem ). Tho flag of sectionalism raised and flaunted in the Chicago convention by Till man, of South Carolina, went down in the November crash, and it should be made to stay down We still maintain that Mr. McKinley will show a broad statesman ship and will contribute to the pro"perit of the South if he shall, by recognizing generously its geographical claims to cab inet representation, go that far toward ex tinguishing forever the fiame of section alism. And tho American people desire that he should do this. This was made full evident during the campaign. For his fre quent and earnest appeals for the oblit eration ot sectional lines, Mr. McKinley was applnuded on all sides, and the recep tion accorded General Palmer and General Buckner wherever they went showed that tho people cordially responded to the senti ment. It is within Mr. McKinlev'.s power to fulfill the hope he has himself aroused by showing to the world that, so far as he is concerned, the lines have been wiped out, and that tho business interests ot the South are no longer to bo menaced by "mailed hand." It is true enough that the South can get on without this recogni tion, but it would, if accorded, help things mightily. Unreasonable Impatience. From the Boston Herald. The disappointment expressed at the non arrival of a business boom of sufficiently large dimensions has been aptly compared to the innocence of a little child, who. planting a seed in the morning, would dig it up at night to see why It had not sprout ed. The fact 'hat the election did not oc cur till the fall trade was practically over i one which seems to be too obvious to overlook. But the existing situation is viewed in some quarters as if such a. fact had no bearing on it, and results are ex pected from tho liberation ot the product ive energies of the country wlilch can only be a question of time. A country cannot be brought face to face with ruin, and rise, as if by magic, to a high level ot pros perity. Thnt the crisis has been success fully passed Is sufficient ground for hearty satisfaction. The Intungible thing known as confidence had received too rude a shock to recover with a bound, and all the currents of industrial and commercial activity had been too much contracted to render It probable that they should at once start into Hood. Meanwhile, there has bepn a resumption of work all over the countrv on a scale never witnessed after anv preceding period ot political suspense, and there has been a continuance of the process of agricultural recovery whose beginning did so much to demonstrate the falsitj of the arguments of the freo silver part. Directl and In directl . the result of the election has add ed enormously to the wealth of the coun try. It has kept productive machinery from sinking to the rank of old metal, and hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of real estate from Joining the class of use less brick and mortar. The future is reck oned secure, and it i3 on our estimate of the future tint the wealth of the present largelv- depends The cST'ct on the railroad propertv of the country alone of the avoid ance of a. peril so deadly as that of de preciated current can onlv be calculated by compounding the sacrifice of cars of income, and all but universal bankruptcy. Tho relief from the impending possibili ties of nrvanism ought to be regarded as improvement enough to satisf the most exactirg. even If the erterprise which these rosib!!ities checked and the a"tivltv they paralz-d have not full resumed their ac custoired swing Six months is surely not too long to allow for the newly created capital to gt Into the circulator veins of trade. People have been exercising enforced caution too long to realize all at once that the necesvity for It has passed Recovery wl'l be all the more certain ard permanent oi being something more than the product of mere sentiment. It is something to be able to feel the assurance that the long period of agricultural depression Is over, because the productive and consumptive energtes of the grain consuming world have been brought into something like equilibrium. Apparent ly, temporary Influences bear a largo share in this, but trpse Influences would have had no such effect had consumption not been rapidly gaining on production. On the so'id bais of national prospcrltv. the raising of the superstructure is merely a question of time, energy and prudence. In this, ai In other matters, the truth is an eternal one that raw haste is half-sister to delay. Our "linre of EnrthiinnUrs. From the New York Sun.

Tnke the Court by the Thront. From the New York Sun. Defeat has only stimulate! the intellect ual pro-csves of those deep revolvln-g stu dents cf the sfiencoof government without government who look with true Altgeldian terror upon federal interference with the pre-ious privilege of rioting, destroing property and blocking trains. Here, for Instance, is a Missouri journal, the Colum bia Herald, full of fear ar.l hatred of the federal courts. It declares that "tho fed eral judiciary Is a. danger cloud on the re public's horizon The federal judges, ap pointed for life, practicnilv irresponsible, more powerful than makers of law, great er than executors, may be the rock upon Which the republic founders " Which is just the kind of talk to cheer the heart of the somewhat forgotten but still hopeful Debs.

The Col umbia Herald proposes that the federal judges shall be elected. But this would be too mild a remedy. The Hon. Benjamin R.

TliliiUlnir About. From the Scientific American. It is suggested that on January 1, 1900, a new division of the ear into thirteen months be instituted. If such a division wcro made the first twelve months would have twent -eight days, or four weeks, each, and the new month twenty-nine days, to make 3K. and thirty In leap ears. After a few- daS there would be no need to refer to calendars, as the same day of the week would have the same date through the j ear. If January 1 were, say Monday, every Monday would bo the 1st, Sth, loth, and 22d; every Tuesday the 2d. 9th. 16th and 23d, and so on through the ear. Changes of the moon would be on about the same dates through tho ear, and many calculations like Interest, dates of maturing notes. Easter, and many other important dates would be simplified. Al though the present generation would have to figure new dates for birthdays and all legal holidays except New Year would bo on different dates, yet the gain would bo more than the loss, as that would be per manent and the objections trifling. A Sensible Hilling. , From the Chicago Chronicle. Tho district court of appeals at Washing tore has very properly held that a. telegraph company is liable for blunders of its em p'0es. A New York firm telegraphed to a customer that It would sell potatoes at 55 cents a bushel. As. deliverexi the tele gram read 4" cents. Two carloads were or dered and customers were found for hnl! of tlhe consignment. Then the mistake was discovered, and he refused to accept the consignment. Ho brought suit to recover the profit he would have made from the resales. This was denied by the court, but It held that lio was entitled to recover "the aictual pecuniary damage that he might have sustained through the failure to ob tain tho potatoes at the price at which ho had reason to suppose they had been oT fered to 'him." Telegraph companies have always disclaimed liability for errors In transmission, unless the message was re peated, tho sender to ray for the repeat ing, but it is nonsense to suppose that such corporations havo any right to compel double payment in order to secure perfect serv ice Mr. Ilnnnn's Flnenpple Pnleh. Trom the Washington Star. Mark Hanna Is growing pineapples. This statement will come as somewhat of a shock to those who think of Mark Hanna only as a political engineer. Although he Is a city man. he loves tho little pineapple patch that grows green and spiney out of the white sand if Dade county, Fla. Twice within the last eighteen months has he turned his footsteps from the North to the South Several times has Mark Hanna slept in the palmetto-thatched shark that stands shaded by whispering pine trees on the edge of Mark Hanna's pineapple patch. It was about two years ago that the plneappl; fever broke out in FloriJa and became so virulently epidemic that pine and fiatwood lands, which before had not been worth tl 23 an acre, were suddenly held at W an acre uncleared, and to clear an acre costs about $r Mr. Hanna was boarding at Palm Beach, where the hotels charge J-l a day during three months of the jcar and Jt a week during tho other nine. Wdl. Mr. Hanna. was boarding there during tho K-a-day season. The germ of tho pineapple contagion entered 1.1s blood, and he bought an acre of pino land from Representative Linton, of Michi gan, who owns a big tract along the Bfcane Bay canal.

The American people will not eat bananas this e.ar The fruit Importers have discov ered th's, to their surprise and disgus. an I were very much worried at first over the cause Why have the people given up ba nanas? they asked, anxiously.
