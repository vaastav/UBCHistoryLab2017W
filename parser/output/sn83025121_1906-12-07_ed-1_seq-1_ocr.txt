I THE SCHOOLS Measles and Sore Eyes Prevalent for Two Months- There has been a grent deal of sickness In the schools of all tho Islands, not excluding thoso of the city of Honolulu, the past two months. Some of the schools were almost depopulated In October. As many of these are now comparatively full again, the worst of the general siege may be considered as past. Measles and sore eyes have been the maladies that most prevailed and are to some extent still prevailing. A good many of the school reports noto absences for sickness without naming the trouble, while mentioning soro eyes, and the Education office deduces from tho general run ot them that all Is measles that Is not sore eyes. Among the city schools fairly through the siege after being heavily hit Is tho Normal. Many of the November reports are behindhand, so that the present situation cannot be fully sized up. Walanae In November had 24 cases of eye tiouble and 32 of measles. This school Is still demoralized. Superin tendent Babblttlfound a muster ot but 15 pupils there lut of a roll of 60 two dajs ago. Alea had 2G cases of measles In Oc tober, but the pupils have all returned to school. Walalua had 10 cases of soro eyes last month. Moanalua had eight chit dren down with measles. Maemae school, Honolulu, had 17 cases of sick ness, presumably measles, and 2S of eye disease. Kapna, Kauai, had 42 cases of sick ness all told. The recent news corres pondenco. and papers Irom Hawaii and Maul Indicate Juvenile epidemics right and left on thoso Islands, tho most alarming reports being of tho existence of diphtheria In some places. Where this dangerous malady has appeared the schools have been closed. N "The teachers are looking after the children very carefully," Superintendent Babbitt said yesterday. "Some of them have gone to tho Board of Health for remedies, and some buy remedies on their own account, for the children." m ami? era or Governor Carter's luncheon to Com' mlssloner Sargent of Washington, nt Alexander Young hotel jesterday, was perfectly satisfactory In every respect. The party encircled a round table, upon which a choice menu was served. The Governor had on his right Mr. Sargent and on his left It. C. llrown, acting chief Inspector ot Immigration here, vvhllo Secretary Atkinson sat opposite tho Governor. Thero wore fourteen nt table, the others than thoso aheady named' being C. M. Cooke, K. D.

As Commissioner ot Immigration ho said he was well pleased with things hero and tho prospects of a happy outcomo of matters connected with his department. It was not dollars and cents, Mr. Sargent said, by which he estimated tho results of what was being done here In Immigration, but tho possibilities to tho Territory fiom the productive services of so many human beings, of admirable mould and stamina, Introduced Into tho texture of tho permanent citizenship of the islands. BIG 

FIELD MAKES MINORITY GOVERN How easy It may bo for a man, In a big "Held" of runners, to win a seat In a governing body and yot represent but a small minority, Is shown by S. W. Logan's petition against Kealoha's election as supervisor for Koolau. Kcaloha, If ho stick, will hold tho seat by tho votes of nineteen less 'than one-third of tho voters of tho dlctrlct who voted for that olllco. Logan, should he win the contest, would, by the criterion of choice from among live men represent but eight more than one-fourth of tho number voting for d'strlct supervisor. How ho might faro among t'le four, with Ke-aloha eliminated, nobody could ever wy. The votes cast for the nfn weie S?l, j distributed thus: Koiloha, 109, Loiran 98; Taele, 75; Davis, 51; Watson, 48. - HAWAIIAN BUB Their Status Under the , Federal Rate Law. (Mall Spechl to the Advertiser.) WASHINGTON, D. C, Nrtfcmber 25. The status of railroads In the Hawaiian Islands has been Informally but of ficially deHned In several Interesting particulars during the pist week by tho IntL'rstiuVcommerce Commission. 'This follovycd a hearing before Commission ers Knapp, Clements nnd Harlan n few days ago at w hlch Mr. Sidney Ilallou, attorney for the Oahu Kallroad and Land Company, appeared. He was ac conipanled by Mr. L. A. Thurston and Mr. F. M. Hatch. The three commis sioners were all of the opinion that the railroads of Hawaii are subject to the railroad rate regulation law, as It Is an organized Territory of tho United States. Mr. Bnllou fully acquiesced In that view. It Is understood that the owners of the Oahu road have been of the same opinion. The Commission held also that tho Oa'ln road should file nil its tariffs. both general and special, with the In terstate Commerce Commission ana post the same nt the several stations along Its line, just as railroads on tho mainland nre doing. Tho tariffs nc cordlnclv have been filed with tha commission, Mr. Ballou having brought them with him from Honolulu. Chairman Knapp, during a talk with the Advertiser's Washington correspondent yesterday, Indicated ) fully what the altitude of tho commission will bo with roferenco to questions arising with tho Oahu road. It seems that the directors ot the road have had doubts about matters of tariffs. As Is pretty ivcll understood nmong Hawaiian shippers, the rond has contracts with numerous plantations by which sugar and merchandise are shipped at special rates, differing In somo cases from tho general public rates. These contracts In many Instances were made before annexation and for long terms of jears. Most of tho contracts have a considerable time jet to run. Some of them were on a sliding scale. A ccitnln rate was to be charged for tho lirst ten jears. a lower rato for the next ten years and so on. Mr Ballou explained these contracts to tho commission, and Chan man Knanii said yesterday that ho und others with him from Hawaii had! made an excellent Impression, convincing him and the other two commissioners piesent that the railroad was acting in a spirit ot fairness. While, some of theso contract rates, which cover about SS per cent, of tho tiallle of the railroad, aro somewhat lower than Is cluuged to other shlppeis, It was shown that the difference was very small; also that tho plantations load and unload the freight at their end of tho lino nnd thut the railroad received other ,., K llnt'nu f,m thptn uhlnh rnillil not ECUADOR HAS A REVOLUTION ON HER HANDS Philippine Constabulary Fight the Poland's University Deported-Education Bill in the House of Lords. bo given by general shlppeis It was the Japanese troops but the retention of Japanese advisers in all brought out that there Is 11 disposition public matters. on tlie part or mo ranroau to equanzo Us rates to all shippers as rapidly as It can do so without violating Its con tracts Recently tho contract with tho r.wa plnntntlnn, that neirest to Hono lulu, expired. The railroad forthwith made the same rate to that station for all shlppeis ns Is given tho En a plantation. The directors have had somo misgivings as to whether these contract rates might not make them liable under tho criminal provisions of tho Elklns law. This uncertainly was one of tho chief reasons why Attornej' Ballou was dispatched to Washington. The commission settles tlint satisfactorily to tho railroad, Its three members who heard Mr Ballou holding that can chargo moro than one rato for a given service. It must, however, fllo und post tlie various tariffs charged, which, ns aheady stated, has been done. The commission does not under take to saj Unit thcBO tariffs wilt eventually stand, it simply acquiesces In the principle of the double tarlnrs. If any shipper should complain that tho railroad's charge to It Is unjust and unreasonable, the comnilsslou will make an examination as Is provided by law and then dclde whether tho crlmlnitlon Is unjust and unreasonable, Until such charge are made and proven the commission will nssumo that the discriminations tare war ranted There Is no danger of prose- cut'ons under tho Elklns law for theso d errlmlnntlons, Vim (' nmIslonors likened the t ii'i 1 resrect to tho Onhu com- n'rirtr. to 'lie rates chtrged 1 rillrn,", on tho malnlnnd , ir o i nl Ha'lroid vng '' wod 11 of ' r r ' on coal that Is to " 1 ire "v,) (Associated Press Cablegrams.)
