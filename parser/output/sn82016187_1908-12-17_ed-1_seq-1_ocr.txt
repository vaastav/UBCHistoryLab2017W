greatly with what might be called the governing- class By that Is mean not alone the Senators and Representatives of both parties who confprisotCongrcss but with the great army of employes that keep the Government at Washing ton running All these people studjr a President elect more closely than do the average citizens thruout the country They know their activities will bring them into more or less close relations with him and that his policies and ways of think ing and of transacting public business cannot but hove an Important bearing upon their careers for tho next four years When McKInley hadjTbeen elected President he remained at Canton and Washington saw nothing of him until the special train snorted into the Washington Station and a dashing span of horses drew him and Mrs McKinley up Pennsylvania avenue and up 14th street to the Ebbltt House a day or two before inauguration Uut President elect Taft hasbeen so much In Washington since his election that his coming and going does not attract a crowd at the stations Of course Mr McKInley at Canton sent for many peo ple to come to see him for conference ax Mr Taft has done at Hot Springs and as he probably will do during the next two months in tho South But Mr Taft has been attending to a deal of business pertaining to his coming Administration the while he visited In Washington His most Important con ferences sinco early Noyembcr have been here - Unable to Realize It He has said a train andtacain durintr his recent visit that he is unable to realize fully that he is td be President of the United States lhavo to pinch myself occasionally he has asserted several times to make suro it is not all a dream t Except that he has becaa little busier and has been subjected to more pres sure from various directions his recent days in Washington fiavo outwardly been about the same as -when he was Secretary of War and Vas trying to do 20 hours of work in About 10 or 12 hours Ho has beenrrieeting every body who had legltlmateJdcmands up on his time with absolute frankness and absence of undueVformallty The great parlor of the Bojirdman resi dence oft Dupont Circle where he and Mrs Taft were guests

-secretary called out the names of those who were next as rapidly as a visitor had been disposed of In tho small room ad- Joining Senators generally demand precedence in Washington but in call ing upon Mr Taft they were simply accorded the hour that had been as signed for them to come Mrs Taft In the meantime kept in mind the social engagements her huaoand had made The political conferences were always conflicting with those social appoint ments but when it had become so late that thero could bo no further delay she would walk in upon the politicians and remind her husband that the time had como for him to depart senate and nouse were or tho opin ion that they could have their way more easily with Mr Taft than thev have had with Mr Roosevelt After the developments of the last two months they are beginning to wonder whether their earner conclusions wore correct He has shown decided firm ness especially In pressing for tariff revision which Is taken as a probable indication of his general attitude as President and as leader of his party His talks with callers of the Congres sional circle here the past week have convinced them that he Is rapidly shap ing his ideas about other ruministraive and legislative mattersand that he may bo equally firm in pressing for these other things that he wants Amiable and Connliteraie At the same time ho has dealt with tho men of his party yvlio occupy high positions hero on a most amiable and considerate basis Thero have been no efforts to dictate and coerce but rath er Mr Taft has sought to exchango views and to talk it oyer Whftn a given subject has been talked out ho has his own Ideas of what ought to be dono and says so Congressmen like that It has been ope of their chief grievances against President Roosevelt that ho called unrepresentative men Into consultation took their advice and went ahead without paying any atten tion to tho leader and captains of the party whom the people had selected to represent them and present their views in Washington Mr Taft appears to thrive physically under the strain of work to which he is subjected He has grown a little stouter and a little more fleshy In the lost two months but retains his good healthy color Ho enjoys the activity and enters upon his dajiy tasks with tho best of good nature just as he went thru the arduous labors of the campaign Whllehe seemB to be near tho 300 pound mark again he says he never felt more fit and the mountains of work ahead of him have no terrors forr hl3 soul T Four or five of tho latger States are figuring prominently in President-

the soutnern ena or the State Ho did not hesitate to have two men -at one time In his Cabinet from Tnwa Rccmtiiriptt Shaw and Wilson nor twofrom Ohio secretaries xai and Garfield In the same way Mr Roosevelt was entirely willing to nominate two Jus tices of tho Supremo iCourt of the United States from Massachusetts al tho he hesitated for awhile about thrt The President elect not only wants to distribute his Cablnfct -appointments so that all sections fhecountry will be represented but hot had decided to proceed slowly abdufc making hia se lections I am oner in sueirestlons he has said time

had L never gotten that far in his estima tion Slaking Vp the Cnblnet He wants first of all to find a capa ble Secretary of State and Is still can vassing the field for one Ho wants the best man obtainable and means to have him if that one will consent to serve He has had the name of Sena tor Philander Chase Knox of Pennsyl vania under serious consideration and some think Mr Knox may finally be the man Mr Taft has high respect for Mr Knoxs ability The latter it is true has had high Cabinet honors be cause of his distinguished incumbency as Attorney General during portions of tho McKInley and Roosevelt Adminis trations As a rule Senators do not care to resign their places to enter the Cabinet They reason that a Senator is quite as high in the official scale as a Cabinet officer Then the Senate has to confirm the nominations for Cabinet offices and Senators argue thatas they have a hand in creating Cabinet cers tney certainly must be quite as important aa tho officials they make But Senator Knox has always been a busy man All his mature life ho has had a prominent part in affairs In the Senate there- Is comparatively little to do that interests him The Senate as many a busy man has found becomes irksome and at times Senator Knox wishes he were out of It for good and engaged in practicing law or at some other active occupation And therefore some of Senator Knoxs closest friends would not be surprised If he accepted the premiership should it be offered him There are numerous leaders In the Senate who are senior to him In service which means he must wait quite awhile before he becomes one of the foremost men of action In that body It has long been a custom for a new President to take one of his rivals for tho nomination into the Cabinet and make him Secretary of State just as It has been the custom for the successful candidate for Speaker of tho House to give his leading ilval the most impor tant Chairmanship of a House com mittee That Is a i oniidpratlon to which Mr Taft is giving weight und Is one of the reasons for his considering Mr Knox- for Secretary of State Mr Knox was not his leading rival for the nomi nation but was very close to It t Ith the solid State of Pennsylvania behind him Vice Prealdent Fairbanks Vice President Fairbanks had more votes from more States for the nomi nation in which connection It rjiouic be noted that Mr Taft has thought of him for Secretary of State and has said that It might como about that Mr Fairbanks wpuld bo offered the place Tho Vice President isBiving lIttle If liny thought to such an outcome but Is making his plans to return to private life and tako up the practice of Iaw at Indianapolis However ho likes Wash ington official life and would be at tracted by a proffer of the highest Cab inet place under the new President From the political standpoint It might be a good move for Mr Taft to get Mr Fairbanks into the Cabinet Indiana Is torn with Republican fac tional fights and the Democrats will soon bo In complete control of the State They will have the Governor moatof tho State officers and one branch of the Legislature It is recog nized that there must be a big readjust ment in Indiana before tho Republi cans can hope to win there again The Governor Is elected for four years but two years from now members of Con gress and a Legislature will bc elected and tho Legislature will have the choice of a United States Senator to succeed Mr Beveridge Unless a peace can be arranged between the Fairbanks and Boverldge factions it is thought the State will go Democratic again Should Mr Fairbanks become Identified with tho Taft Administration as Secretary of State it might help speed Indiana back into line But tho new President has his Cab inet problem with reference to Ohio There are two factions in his home State altho only Senator Foraker of the defeated faction Is pressing for any ofllce and he is pressing simply for a re election to the Senate Two or three Cabinet aspirants In Ohio complicate the situation for Mr Taft to say noth ing of the rush for election to the Sen ate Mr Taft has said however that he will take no part in the Senatorial fray altho making no secret of the fact that he would like to see his brother ex Reprcsentallve Charles P Taft win the toga If his brother should be elect ed Senator It would be all the more difficult for him to name more than one member of the Cabinet from Ohio He has been thinking strongly about glyingRepresentative Theodore E Bur ton a place at his council table but if he should decide finally to do that he would be confronted with the problem whether to retain Secretary of the In terior Garfield For Secretary Garfield like Mr Burton not only comes from Ohio but from the city of Cleveland ClaliiiM of the West Then again the West particularly tho Far West has a traditional claim to the Interior portfolio because that Department has to do chiefly with mat ters that interest Far Western people and if ho should decide to keep Secre tary Garfield in the Cabinet It might become a question whether to retain him as Secretary of the Interior or move him over to the Department of Commerce and Labor where Mr Gar field has served as Commissioner of Corporations -so -that the Wost could have one of Its men at tho head of the Interior Mr Taft has already told the Pacific Coast Republicans that he rec ognizes their claims to a place in his Cabinet In recent times California has had the Pacific Coast member but Mr Taft has indicated that it may be some other Pacific Coast State this time Of course New York State Republi cans would have a fit If a President should organize his Cabinet without one of their number being in it Sec retary Elihu Root could havo remained at the head of the State Department If he had not consented to become the new Senator from New York No New Yorker of special promise has been brought forward for a Cabinet place yet unless one makes an exception for jWllllam Nelson Cromwell of Panama Canal fame who has been mentioned for Attorney General Of his ability as a lawyer there is little question but his legal career has been -Intimately associated with the big trusts and com binations and it is doubtful whether his appointment as Attorney General would bo at all popular He was Iden tified with Mr Tafts campuign and has had much to do with the War De partment in Panama Canal matters He was also one of the large contrib utors to the Republicn campaign fund Of course there is ienty of Cabinet J PSft NOT

BUCK CABINET A Fierce Dispute on Between tbe President and Congress Over the Secret Service Portion of the Message Both Houses Thoroly Angry What Will They Do Just as Mr Roosevelts Presidential sun Is setting the first real live pros pect of a war between the white House and Congress appears All during the seven years of his two Administrations there have been rumors of active hos tilities between the legislative and ex ecutive branches The President has been at outs with the Senate and House leaders He has fought thorn without gloves conducted crusades for legisla tion that he wanted and that they did not want but thero has never been open breach Compromise has followed scrapping and the President has al ways gotten at least half a loaf But now the die has been cast and If tho President chooses to press his light the 60th Congress and the second Administration of Theodore Roosavelt may close ranged on different sides of a chasm The cloak room mutterlngs and the fierce statements of Senators and Representatives which they would not stand for In public print may bloom at last Into formal and official declarations The quarrel is at present probably only In the Incubating stage btit the House of Representatives In most Im pressive manlier has adopted a reso lution that reflects upon the President It comes from legislation regarding what has been called the Black Cabi net The Black Cabinet When the annual message went to Congress on Tuesday Dec 8 It con tained a page and more devoted to the topic of Secret Service It was very much of a surprise that the President should discuss the Secret Service at such length or at all In an annual Isago He pointed out that Congress at lis last session restricted the operations of the Secret Service to the Treasury Department having by provlsion In ono of the appropriation laws forbidden tho transfer of Secret Service men to duty in other Departments Thltrucic hard at a practice tho Prefaent had countenanced of allow Ing Secret Servicf men -to be trans ferred for duty with the Department of Justice and the Department of the In ferior largely for investigating land ui iwitcuuuivt xawney or Minnesota the Chairman of the Houso Appropriations Committee is credited with having brought about the legisla tion to forbid such transfers Congress had quite a splutter about it at tha time It was claimed that Secret Ser vice men had been detailed to follow a Navy omcer and assist his wife to get a divorce but the abuses most com plained of was the use of Secret Service men to do work that the Special Agents of the Department of Justice aTCl of tho Interior Department could do and as was claimed could do better The President declared In his annual message however that this legislation was solely In the interest of the crim inal classes and that the chief argu ment for it was to keep Secret Servico men off the trail of offending Congress men It happens that a number of Re publican Congressmen have at times been implicated in Western land frauds The President recommended in his annual message with fine sar casm that the restrictions on the Secret Service transfers should be limited so that Congressmen could not be Investi gated by those sleuths Great indignation at the Capitol en sued of course as soon as the message was read Senators and Representa tives forgot for the time being all elso In that document They Interpreted It as a serious reflection upon a great co ordinate branch of the Government as of course there was no distinction be tween the good Congressmen and tho bad Congressmen when the President commented so severely upon legisla tion that Senate and House had sol emnly enacted A nesentful Rensfntlon The fires smouldered for two days The big leaders on both sides of tho Capitol had to taKe notice of the situa tion Democrats in the Senate and Democrats in the House threatened to bring ferward resolutions for an Inves tigation of the facts about the legisla tion if the Republicans did not Speak er Cannon and Senator Hale the new leader at the north end of the Capitol conferred again and again A program was ultimately agreed upon and on Friday after many many parleys a resolution was presented by Represen tative James Breck Perkins of Roches ter N Y a stanch Republican a man of unqueationed probity and one of tha most scholarly of members of tho House It cited tho language the President had used in his message and called for the appointment of a committee of five to make an early report In most Im pressle and carefully chosen words Mr7 Perkins briefly recited what had been done and the necessity for soma action He spoke but three minutes and thereupon without a dissenting ote the House authorized the appoint ment of the special committee Speaker Cannon named Mr Perkins Mr Denby or Michigan and -Mr Weeks of Massa chusetts Republicans and Mr Wil liams of Mississippi and Mr Lloyd of Missouri Democrats They have been studying the situation and formulating a report The Senate is ready to act and is expected to go quite as far as the House is willing to go in showing its displeasure at the Presidents course There has been talk that the Senate would vote to expunge that portion of the message from the permanent Con gressional Record for the message Is read in both Houses at the same time but is not printed in the records of tha House proceedings It is however in cluded In the Senate proceedings With all this ferment on the Hill tha President has been getting busy At first he told visiting Congressmen that he looked upon the Secret Service para graph or his message as a huge joke at tho expense of Congress for having undertaken to Interfere with his admin- lstration of the Secret Service But Sen ators replied that It was a very serious kind of a joke and they did not pro pose to Ignore it And so things went on and the Presi dent called Chief Wilkle of the Secret Service to his office What transpired has not befn given to the public but it Continued from pace three
