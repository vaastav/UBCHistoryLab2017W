The Secretary of the Hoard ol Agri culture announces that a large number of copies of its Ricuniul Report remain in his hands, anil these will be sent to any fanners requesting the same so long us the supply holds out. Address W. W. Cooke, l'.iirliuglon. Vt. The Christian F.udeuvor Societies of the state have just held their annual convention at MontH-lier. There whs it good attendance, and excellent ad dresses were made by both clergymen and hiyuien. The next meeting was appointed at Rutland. The Society is doing u good work among the young people of the state. Washington correspondents tell us that great preparations are being made for the inauguration of 'resident -elect Harrison. It is expected that Vermont will be well represented. Col. F.stey has engaged oil rooms at the Hotel Maltbv for the accommodation of Ver mont visitor. Gov. Dillingham ami stall are eXiccled to be there. It will be a "great day in the morning," as the boys sing. 

WHERE THE MONEY GOES. There are forty inmates in the Soldier-.' Home. The state appropriated ?i",immi lor their support, or almost ?(' per week each- This would pay the hoard of almost 1IMI old soldier tit ?-"" per week. Would it not have been better to have helped the old veterans who were needy so, they could have lived at or near their old homes? Hut then it would not have furnished a solt job for some one with m. lineal influence. Pags, Robes & Blankets, new invoice marked covn to lowest cash prices.

For the past two years he has been a legal resident of Ran dolph, his native town, and voted here.

Frederick Hillings, II011. J. G. MeCollough, CI. W. Hooker, and many men the state has been proud to honor. He is a per sonal friend of (Iovernor Dillingham and was doubtless appointed on that account as well as for his eminent fit ness for the position. We are glad, aside from local pride, to see the (iov. recognize these Vermont boys, who.

PICTURESQUE CHARACTER. Mr. A. A. Karle has sold '-The Landmark" at White Kiver Junction, though to whom we have not heard. He will probably rest awhile, get un easy and then start another paper somewhere and make a good thing in selling 011;, as he lias usually done. Karle is a strange mixture of rough ness and delicacy. His personalities would be intolerable but lor their wit, and occasionally he writes a tender o- bituary or a beautiful poem which re veals the other side of the man. He has combined more business sense and editorial nonsense than the average President Cleveland has sent his last annual message to Congress. He dis cusses, from a democratic stand-point. questions ol national import. lie re views in a rapid manner, the changes that have takeu place in our history, and sees gome dangers ahead. The in crease in wealth on the part of some, and the growth of the number id' those who are poor, the drift of the popula tion towards the cities he regards a ominous of evil. Classes are forming and the gulf between employers and employees is widening. While millions ..e .1 11 1..: .1 .1 1.. ! , the matter of iiiiiiN needs revision are taxed for the support ol the gov ernment under the operation tof tariff laws. If things keep on as they are tending he sees not far off the dev elop, ineiit of communism, and this of two kinds, one of wealth and the other of poverty. lie thinks he sees in a revis ion of the tariff a remedy for these ev il, lie believes in meeting existing evils fairly and squarely, making 110 compromise. He deplores the tenden cy to regard the government as pater nal ami to seek through it the fill Iter ance ol so many private interests, loo much loose legislation has encouraged the violation of contracts and thegrant- :ig of claims upon insufficient proof on the part of the applicant. This appears in the pushing for pensions where claims are not sustained by valid reasons. He considers the subject of neglected legis lation and refers to some of the evils flowing therefrom. One of these is the crowded condition ol the supreme court calendar and the consequent delay that is caused to suitors for justice. A suf ficient remedy has not yet been provid ed. Another ev il relates to the public lands. These are not protected with of dollars. He accepts the recoiiiiiiend- j atiou of the secretary of war that there 1 should be Home plan to test the fitness j of ollicers for promotion. He has 110 sympathy with those who would have the Apaches returned to their reserva tions. Treat them kindly but keep them in restraint far from the scenes of their former lives. lie thinks that I the navy ha been managed intelligent ly, and the postal service shows an in crease in business. In regard to pub lic buildings he thinks that the right of a community to the possession of one should be deterniini d by the amount of the gross receipt for the government. The pay of fourth class po-tninster. ought to be raised, clerks should be classilied, and the railroad service in He congratulate the government 011 the reclamation of eighty million of acres of public lands Irom usurpation uud think ti e gnod work should go on. He believes the reservations, under proper J restrictions should be divided to the Indians in several! v. and they be edu cated into the duties o! citizenship, lie call for a revision of the pension laws. The message is a brief resume of pub lic all'airs and while many may not a gree with it nil should read it. The law abolishing the stock ex change will probably be tested in the Courts, as .Mr. Knott, the manager of the liiirlington exchange, is advised that it is iincoustituliomd. It is claimed that the bill was instigated by Col. II. .1. Kimball, of Xew York city, one of the nvmbers on the start' of I Iov. Dil lingham. Argus. If Mr. Kimball was instrumental in securing the passage of lha law that has closed up every gambling den 01 bucket r-liiip iu the state, honest men vv ill thank him. These are not t-toek exchanges as no stock is really bought, sold or delivered at these place.-. The price of a particular stock on a given day is bet upon. If it is higher sufficient care to prevent their diversion one party wins and the other loses, to oilier uses th in us homes for honest ; It'it is lower the result is similar a citizen.
