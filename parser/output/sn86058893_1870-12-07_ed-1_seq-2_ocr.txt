Washington, December 5. tT-t :hr $--lle and JTotue of Representative! tub sotrrnERN states. A year of peace and general pros I'onty to this nation has passed, binee tie list assembling of Congress wo hav- through a kicdj'rovidence, been tlessid with abundant crops, snd hivo been spared from complica te d war with foreiga nations. la or midst comparative harmony has bsca restored. It is to bo rcgret cd, t.oever, that a frca exercise of the elective franchise, has, by vio lence aad intimidation, beeu denied to citizens in exceptional cases in sev eral of the States lately in rebellion, and the verdict of the people has thereby beau revered. The States of Virginia, Mississippi and Texas V a , : ' een restored to representation iu our national councils. Georgia is the oalSLate now without represen tative, but the may confidently be expected to take her place there at tfc j t?ginniDg of tho year, and then; lit us ho;-e that the work of recon struction will ba completed. With an ajqji -j; jec"o.the part of the whole pc lo ia tho national obligation to pa the public debt, created as the price ot' our Union, tho pensions to unr Ji.-ibled soldicra and sailors and their widows and orphans, and in the t i in the , constitution which I i- en made necessary by a great bo l, there is no reason why wo o ' not advance in material pros r nd happiness as no other na uo -I! I after so protracted and de i i ti.jg a war. . 

ARIS FRANCE THE ACTION OF THE UNITED STATES. ' ; ifooa alter the existing war broke out ia Europe, the protection of the States Minister in Paris was invek'lin favor of tho North Ger ;.a: .- iomiciled in French territory. In-v. . tiona were issued to grant the pr?u .ion. This has been followed by n i extension of American pro tective to citizens of Saxony, Hessa anl ivaxe-Cobnrg Gotha, . Colum b s, I ortugal, Uruguay,: the Domia-i.-s- llapublic, Eouador, Chili, v-ra 'nay and Venezuela in. Paris. TL: charge was onerous one re- .uirlrg constant and severe labor, n i-ell as the exercise of pa-tien-o, prudence and good judgment. 1 . i 'joca performed to the entire pa? -il l 'tion of the Government of rt:, Germany. As soon as I learned tbi: n Republic had been proclaimed at i'-ris, and that the people of r r.- had acquiesaed ia the chanee, the : 1 aister of the United States was orritrclbv telazrarih. to reeofrniza iti. ... I tender my congratlations andl those of the people of tho United t t .vt-. , . - . . : : v TL; re establishment in France of a altera of government disconnected w;' - "he dynastic traditions of Eu ro I appeared to be a proper subject for the felicitation of Americans. SuOttid the present struggle result in atuc' ing tho hearts of the French to our simpler forms of representative gov -ment, it will be a subject of still tirther satisfaction to our people. While we make no effort to impose our institutions upon the inhabitants of other countries, and while we ad here tj our traditional neutrality in civil ootests elsewhere, we can not be icdifferett to the epread of Ameri can political ideas in a great and hi.;t civilized country like France. We were asked by the new govern ment to use our good offices jointly with those of European powers in the intar its of peace. Answer was made that the established policy and the true interests of the United States ft r l.i ie them to interfere in Europe an : aestions jointly with European po-. rs. I ascertained informally and t jcially that the government of North Germany was not then disposed to listea to such representations from any power, and, though earnestly wi:hicg to ego the blessings of peace restored to the belligerents, with whe i the United States are on terms of friendship, I declined, on the part of this government, to taka a step which could "only result ia injury to our true interests, without advancing the object for which our intervention r. -.5 i roked. Should the time come n cen the action of the United States a hasten the return of peace by a oitig!? hour, that action will be heart " iiy f.ion. ' Earned it prudent, in view of the - ;-wr of persona of 'German and I re : oh birth living in the United Sta: -, to issue, soon after the official net of a state of war had been re t ' from both belligerents, a proc lamation defining the duties of the L litel States ass neutral, and the obligations of persons residing with i : tho territory to observe their laws aad l;a laws of nations. The proo !aiaai.ioa was followed by others as circumstances seemed to call for them. T - ple, thus acquainted in ad v.i.at of their duties and obligations, ha?e assisted in preventing violations ot tr i neutrality of the United States. :he cctban insurrection. ; t i i not understeod that tho condi tion uf the insurrection in Cuba ha3 materially changed 6ioce the close, tt the "..st ecssion of Congress. 'In an' early stasre of the contest, the author ities of Spain inaugurated a Bystem of arciuary arrests, or close " confine ni.t, of military trial and execution of persons, suspected of complicity with the . . surgents, and of summary em bargo of their properties and requisi tion of their revenues by execution warrant Such proceedings, so far as ' ffected the persons or property cf citizens of the United States, were ia violation of the provisions of the tii- .ot li'Jo between the United f' and Spain. Representations of ir j . 3 resulting to several persons c;ai-:ng to be citizens of the United fcUue .-, . ly reasons ot such violation '"ir . made to the bpanish eovein mtit. iism April, 18C9. to June iast tae tpamsh Minister at Washing f" L-,s been clothed with a limited prs'-'.r to aid in redressing such wi or -s. That power was found to be Tiuidrawn ia view, at it was said, of the , favorable situation in wh.c the island of Cuba was then, vroici;,- nowever, aia not icaa to the evtdatioa or suspension of the xirs ordinary and arbitrary ice- ons ..exercisea py tho cxecu tie lower in Cuba, and we were olhgt d to make our complaint at - d. In the negotiations thus r-pcu.i, and still pending then, the I j &itcd States only claimed that for the ir.ture the rights secured to their citiz ; a by treaty should ba respected in Caba, and that as to the past a ''' fibunal should be established in the United States with full juris diction over all such claims. Before euch a impartial tribunal each claim ant wuld bo required to prove his case : on the other hand Spain would beat ibertyto traverse every mate rial t it, and thus complete equity woa! i bo done. A case which at one Liue "ireatened seriously to effect the rclati ns between the United States aid hj aia has already been disposed of ir, his way. Thoclaimof Colonel Llojti of Aspiawall, for the illegal eeLu j and detention of that vessel ;aJ referred to arbitration by mutual consent.aad has resulted ia aa award to the United States for the ow t j of the sum of nineteen thous an io.ven hundred and two dollars aaJ Sity cents mgold. Another aad Ivt ; ending claim of- like nature that i the wha'e ship Canada, haa bca isposed of by friendly arbitra tion ..1 '.ring the present year; it is re ferred by the joint consent of Brazil sl j Uiiited States to the decision o! ;i idward Thornton, her ItHtAn.

These recent examples show that the mode which the Uwtcd States have proposed to Spain for adjusting the pending claims is just and feasible, and that it may be agreed to by either nation without dishonor. It is to be hoped that this moderate demand may be acceded to by Spain without fur ther delay. Should the pending ne gotiations unfortunately and unex pectedly be without result, it will then become my duty to communicate that fact to Congress, and invito its action on the subject. THE 

SOUTH AMERICAN PEACE CON GRESS. The long deferred peaoe confer ence between Spain and the a.lied South American republics has been inaugurated ia Washioaton under the auspices of the United States. Pur suant to the recommendations con tained in the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 17th of December, 1S66, tho Executive De partment of the Government offered its friendly offices for the promotion of peace and harmony between Spain and the allied republics. Hostilities and obstacles occurred to the accept ance of . the offer. Ultimately, how ever, a conference was arranged, and was opened ia this city on the 2tkh of October last, at whioh I authorized the Secretary of State to preside. It was attended by the Ministers of Spain, Peru, Chili and Ecuador. In consequence of the absence of a rep resentative from Bolkia, the confer ence was adjourned until the attend ance of a plenipotentiary from that republic could bo secured, or other measures could be adopted toward compassing its object. The allied and other Republics of Spanish origin on this continent, may seo in this fact a new proof of our sincere interest in their welfare; our desire to see them blessed with good governments capa ble of maintaining order and preserv ing their repective territorial integri ty, and of our sincere wish to extend our commercial and social relations with them. ' our manifest destiny. The time is not probably far dis tant when, in the natural course of events, tha European political con nection with this continent will cease. Our polioy should be shaped in view of this probability, so as to ally the commercial interests of the Spanish Government and the American States more closely together, and thus give the United States all the prominence and all the advantage which Mr. Mon roe, Mr. Adams and Mr. Clay con templated, when they proposed to join the Congress of Panama. v SAN 

DOMINGO. During the last session of Congress a treaty for tho annexation ot the liepublio of San Domingo to the Uni ted States failed .to receive the requi site two-thirds vote of the Senate. I was thoroughly convinced then that the best interests of the country, com mercially and materially, demanded its ratification. ' Time has only eon- firmed me in this view. I now firmly believe that the moment it is known that the United States have entirely abandoned the project of accepting as a part of its territory the Island of San Domingo, a free port will be ne gotiated for by the European nations. In the bay of Samana a large com mercial city will spring up, to which we will be tributary without receiving corresponding benefits if the fol.'y of our rejection is agreid to. The Gov ernment of San Domingo has volun tarily sought this annexation. It is a weak power, numbering probably less than one hundred and twenty thous and souls, and yet possessing one of the richest localities under the sun, capable of supporting a population ot ten millions of people in luxury. The people of San Domingo are not capa ble of maintaining themselves in their present condition, and must look for outside Bupport. They yearn for the protection of our free institu tions and laws, our progress and civil ization.- Shall we refuse them? The acquisition of San Domingo is desira ble, because of its geographical position it commands the en trance to the Carribbean Sea and the Isthmus transit of commerce. It possesses the richest soil, the best and most capacious harbors, the most salubrious climate, and the most val uable ? products of the lore6t, mine and soil of any of the West India islands. Its possession by the Uoited States will, in a tew years, build up a coastwise commerce of immense magnitude, which will go far toward restoring to us our merchant marine. It will give to us those articles which we consume greatly and do : not pro duce, thus equalizing our exports and imports. 1 - - - In case of foreign war it will give U3 the command of all the islands re ferred to, and thus prevent an enemy from again possessing him-elf of a rendezvous upon our coast. It pro tects our ' coa3t trade between the States bordering on the Atlantic and those bordering on the Gulf of Mexi co, by the Bahamas and the Antiles. Twice we must, as it were, pass through foreign countries to get by from Georgia to the castooastof Flor ida. San Domingo, with a stable gov ernment, under which her immense resources can bJ developed, will give remunerative wages to ten thousand of laborers not now upon the island. This labor will take advantage of ev ery available means of transportation to abandon the adjacent islands, and seek the blessings of free dom and its sequence: each inhabitant receiving the reward of his own labor. Porto ilico and Cuba will save to abolish slavery as a meas ure of self preservation, to retain their labor. San Domingo will be eome a large consumer ot the pro ducts of the northern farms and man ufactories. Tho cheaper rate at which her citizens can be furnished with food will make it necessary that con tiguous islands should have the same advantages in order to compete in the production of sugar, coffee, tobacco, tropical lruits, etc. Ibis will open to us a wider market for our products. The production of our own supply of tnese articles will cut oil more than one hundred millions of our annual im ports, besides increasing our exports. With such a picture it is easy to see how our large debt abroad is ulti mately to be extinguished. With a balance of trade against us, including r. i r i 1.1 1 1 i r - luiurcsiui uuiiun neia oy ioreigners, and of money shipment of our citi zens traveling in foreign lands, equal to the entire yield of precious metals in this country, it is not so easy to see how this result is to be otherwise ac complished. The acquisition of San DomiDgo is an adhesion to the Monroe doctrine; it is a measure of national protection; it is asserting our just claim to a con trolling influence over the great com mercial traffic soon to flow from West to East by way of the Isthmus of Da rien; it is to build our merchant mar ine; it is to lurniaa new markets lor the products of our farms, shops and manufactories; it is to make slavery unsupporcaoie in uuDa ana 1'orto Rico, and ultimately so in Brazil; it is to settle tho unhappy condition Cuba, and end aa exterminating conflict; it is to provide honest means of pay ing our honest debts without over taxing the people; it is to furnish our citizens with the necessaries of every day. life at cheaper rate3 than ever before r and it is. in tine, a ranid Stride towards that greatness which the .intelligence, industry and enter prise of the citizens of tho Uni ted States entitles the country to as sume among nations. In view of the importance of this Question. earnestly urgO Upon Gon?r(a early aotion expressive of its views as to tho best means of ae quiring San Domingo. My suggestion is that by a joint resolution of the two Houses ot Congress, the Execu tive be authorized to appoint a co'm- mittee to negotiate for a treaty lor tho acquisition of that island; that ap prcpna:cn3 be -lals tit defrw the expen-t,4 ci s:. h cotsrmssi. t he question my then be determined by itie action ot u.e twi Uoues ot Con gress t ;cya a resolution of annexation as in tho case cf t!.. a'-iuisition of Texas. So convinced am I ol all the advantages to flow from tho acquisi tion of San Domingo, and of tho great disadvantage I might almost say calamities to flow from non-acquisition, that I believe tho subject. has only to bo investigated to be approved. THE 

MEXICAN FREE ZONE. It is to be regretted that our repre sentations in regard to the injurious effects, especially upon the revenue of tho United States, of the policy of the Mexican goverumant ia exempt ing from important duties a large tract of its territory on our borders, have not only been fruitless, but that it is even proposed ia that country to extend the limit3 within which the Erivilege adverted to has hitherto een enjoyed. The exp3diency of tak ing into your serious consideration proper means for countervailing. The policy referred to will, it is pre sumed, engage your earnest attention. It is tho obvious interest, especially of neighboring nations, to provide against injury to those who may have committed high crimes within their borders, and who may have sought refuee abroad. For this purpose, ex tradition treaties have been ooncluded with several of tbfl Central American Republics, and others are in progress. THE VENEZUELA PRIZE MONET. The sense of Congress is desired as early as maybe conveoient.upon the proceedicgi of the commission on claims against Venezuela, which are oommunicated in the messages of March 4th, 18C9, Maroh 1st, 1370, and March Slsfc, 1870. It has not been deemed advisable to distribute any of the money which has been received from that government until Congress shall have acted upon the subject. THE TIEN TSIN MASSACRE. The massacres of French and Rus sian residents at Ttcn Tsin, under cir cumstances of so great barbarity, were supposed by some to have been pre meditated, and to indicate a purpose among the populaco to exterminate all the foreigners in the Chinese Em pire. The evidence fails to establish such a supposition, but shows a com plicity by the local authorities and the mob. The government at Pekin, nowever, seems to have been disposed to fulfill its treaty obligations so far as it was able to do so. Unfortunate ly, the news of the war between the German State3 and France reached China soon after the massacre. It would appear that the popular mind becomes possessed with the idea that this contest, extending to Chinese wa ters, would neutraliza the Christian influence and power, and that the time was coming when the supersti tious masses might expel ail foreign ers and restore Mandarin influence. Anticipating trouble from this cause, I invited Franco and North Germany to suspend hostilities in the East where they were temporarily suspend ed by the acts of the commanders to act together for the future protec tion in China of the lives and proper ty of Americans and Europeans. THE 

SLAVE COURTS. Since the adjournment of Congress the ratification of the treaty with Great Britain for abolishing tho mixed courts for the suppression of the slave trade has been recognized. It is believed that the slave trade is now confined to the eastern coast of Africa, whence the slaves are taken to the Arabian markets. The ratifi cations of the naturalization conven tion between Great Britain and the Uoited States have also been ex changed during the recess, and thus a long standing dispute between the governments has been settled in ac cordance with the principles always contended for by the United States. . . THE HUDSON BAY POSSESSION. In April last, while engaged in lo cating a military reservation near Pembina, a corps of engineers dis covered that the commonly received boundary line between the United States and British Possessions at that place is about fifty-seven hundred feet south of the true position of the zenith parallel, and that the line when run on what is now supposed to be the true position of the parallel, would leave the port of the Hudson Bay Company, at Pembina, within the ter ritory of the United States. This in formation being communicated to the British Government, I was requested to consent, and I did consent that British occupation of the port of the Hudson Bay Company, should con tinue for the present. I deemed im portant, hovever, that this part of the boundary line should be definitely fixed by a joint commission of the governments, and submit therewith estimates of tbe expense of such a commission on the part of the United States, and recommend that an ap propriation be made for that purpose. The land boundary is already fixed and marked from tho summit of the Rooky Mountains'to the Georgian bay. It should now be in like manner marked from the Lake of the Woods to the Eummit of the Rocky Moun tains. THE ALABAMA CLAIMS, f I regret to say that no conclusion bas been reached for the adjustment of the claims against Great Britain growicg out of the course adopted by that government during the rebellion. The Cabinet of London, so far as its views have been expressed, docs not appear to be willing to concede that Her Mjesty'a government was guilty of negligence, or did or permitted any act during the war by which the United States has just cause of com plaint. Our firm and unalterable convictions are directly the reverse, and I therefore recommend to Con gress to authorize the appointment of a commission to take proof of the amounts and the ownership of their olaims on notice to the repre sentative of Her Majesty at Washing ton, and that authority be given for the commencement of these claims by tbe United states, so that the govern ment shall have the ownership of the private claims as well as the responsi ble control of all tho claims against Great Britain. It can not be neces sary to add that whatever Her Majes ty's government shall entertain a de sire for a full and friendly adjustment of these claims, the United States will enter upon their consideration with an earnest desire for a conclusion con sistent with the honor and dignity of both nations. THE CANADIAN FISHERIES NAVIGA TION OF THE BT. LAWRENCE. The course pursued by the Cana dian authorities towards the fishermen of the United States during the past season has not been marked by a friendly feeling. By the first article of tho convention of 1818, between Great Britain and tho United States, it was rgreed that the inhabitants of the United States should have, forever in common with British subjects, the right of taking fish in certain water?, therein denned, in the waters not in cluded in the limits named in the con vention, within three miles of ports of the British coast. It has been the custom for many years to givo to in trading fishermen of the United States a reasonable warning of their viola tion of the rights of Great Britain. The Imperial Government is under stood to have delegated the whole, or a share, of its jurisdiction or oontrol of these inshore fuhcry grounds to the colonial authority known a3 tbe Do minion of Canada; and this semi-independent but irresposible agent has exercised its delegated powers in an un friendly way. Vessels have been siezed without notioe or warning, in viola tion of the custom previously prevail ing, and have been taken into the colonial ports, their voyages broken up aud their vessels condemned. There is reason to believe that this unfriendly and vexatious treatment was designed to . bear harshly upon the hardy fishermen of the United States, with a view to political effect upon this Government. Tbe statutes of tho Dominion of Canada ssiumo still broader and more untenable jurisdiction over the vessels of the united tatcs. Ihey "i. -horjrre ?"i ecis or pertona to brio" we'sUs t'i fl Til t "i r ir i t 1 . 1 .1 t Vv !. I VYinxirta n i 1 J J of any of the coasts, bays, creeks or ' harbor of Canada into port ; to search j the cargo, aad examine tL master on! oath touching the cargo nil vcyago, and to inflict upon him heavy pecu niary penalty it true answers were not given; and it such a vessel is touna preparing to ush within three marine miles ot any such coast, bars, creeps or harbors without a license, or after the expiration of the period named in the last license granted to it, they provide that the vessel, with her tacisie, etc., etc., shall be confiscated. It is not known that any condemnations have been made under this statute. Should the authorities of Canada attempt to enforce it, it will become my duty to take such steps as may be necessavy to protect the rights of the citizens of the United States. It has been claimed by Her Majesty's officers that the fishing vessels of the United States have no right to enter the open ports of the British possessions in North America, except for the purpose of shelter and repairing damages, or of purchasing wood and obtaining water; that they have no right to enter at the British custom house or to trade ex cept for the purchase of wood and water, and that they must depart within twenty-four hour9 after notioe to leave. It is not known that any seizure of a fishing vessel carrying the flag of the United states has been made under this claim. So far as the claim is founded on any alleged con struction of the convention of 1818 it cannot be acquiesced in by the United States. It is hoped that it will not be insisted upon by her Majesty's govern ment. During the conference which preceded the negotiation ot the con vention of 1S18. the British commis sioners proposed to expressly exclude the fishermen of the United States from the privilege of carrying on trade with any of her Britanio Majesty's subiects residing within the limits as signed for their use, and also that it should not be lawful for the vessels of the United States engaged in such fishery to have on board any goods, wares or merchandise whatever, ex cept such as may be necessary for the prosecution of their voyage to and from such fishery grounds; and any vessel of the United States which shall contravene this regula tion may be seized, condemned and confiscated, with their cargoes. This proposition which is identical with the construction now put upon the language of the convention, was em phatically rejected by the American Commissioners, and was thereupon abandoned by the British Plenipoten tiaries, and Article I, as it stands in the convention, was substituted. If, however, it be said that this . claim is founded on provincial or colonial statutes, and not upon the convention this government cannot but regard them as unfriendly, and in contraven tion of thcTaithful execution of which tho Imperial government is alono re sponsible. Anticipating that an at tempt may possibly be made by the Canadian authorities, in the coming season, to repeat these un neighborly acts towards our fishermen, I recom mend you to confer upon the Execu tive the power to suspend, by procla mation, the operations , of the laws authorizing the transit of goods, wares and merchandise in bond across the territory of the United States to Canada. And further, should such an extreme measure be come necessary, to suspend the operation of any Jaws where by the vessels of the Dominion of Canada are permitted to enter the waters of the United States. A like unfriendly disposition has been mani fested on the part of Canada in the maintenance of a claim of a right to exclude the citizens of the United States from the navigation of the St. Lawrence. The river constitutes a natural outlet of the lakes to the ocean, with an aggregate population of about 17.600.000 inhabitants, and with an aggregate tonnage of 601,867 tons upon the waters which disoharge into it. The foreign commerce of our ports on these . waters is open to British competition, and the major part of it is done in British bottoms. If the American seamen bo excluded from this natural avenue to the ocean, the monopoly of the direot commerce of the lake ports with the Atlantic would be in foreign hands, their vessels on transatlantic voyages hav ing an access to our lake ports which would be denied to American vessels ou similar voyages. To state such a proposition is to refute its justice. During the administration of Mr. John Quincy Adams, Mr. Clay un questionably demonstrated the natur al right of the citizens of the United States to the navigation of this river, claiming that the act of the Congress of Vienna, in opening the Rhine and other rivers to all nations, showed the judgment of European nations and jurists, that the inhabitants of a coun try through which a navigable river passes, have a, natural right to the navigation of that river from and in to the sea, even though passing through the territory of another pow er. This right docs not exolude the coequal right of the sovereign posses sing the territory through which the river debouches into the sea, to make such regulations relative to the poli cy of tho navigation as may be reason ably necessary. But those regulations shoatd be framed in a liberal spirit of comity, and should not imposo need less burdens upon the commerce which has tho right of transit. It has been found in praotice more ad vantageous to arrange these regula tions by mutual agreement. Tho Uni ted States is ready to make anv rea sonable arrangement as to the police of the St. Lawrence River which my be suggested by Great Britain. If the claim of Mr. Clay was just when the population of the States bordering on the shores of the lakes was only ,4uu,uuo, it now derives greater force and equity irom tho increased ponula tion, wealth, production and tonnage of the States on the Canadian fron tier. Since Mr. Clay advanced his argument in behalf of our right, the principle ior wnica ne contended has been frequently and bv various nn. tions recognized by law or by treaty, and has been extended to several other great rivers. By the treaty concluded at Mayooco in 1831, the Rhine was declared free from the point wnere is is urst nuvigaDlc into the sea. By the convention between Snain nd Portugal, concluded in 1835, the navi gation or tne uouro throughout its wnoie extern was made tree tor the subjects of both crowns. In 1853. the Argentine uonteueration by treaty threw open the free navigation of the i'arana and Uruguay to tho mer chant vessels ot all nations. In 185G the Crimean war was closed by a treaty which pro vided for the free navigation of the Danube. In 1858, Bolivia, by treaty, declared that it regarded the rivers Amazon and -Uai latte, in accordance with fixed principles of international law, as highways or channels onenod by nature for the commerce of all na tions. In lb59, the Paraguay was made free, by treaty, and in Decem ber, 18CC, the Emperor of Brazil, by Imperial decree, declared the Amazon to be open to all the frontier of Bra zil to the merchant ships of all na tions. Tbe greatest living British au thority on the subject, whilo asserting the abstract right of the British claim, says it seems difficult to deny that Great Britain may ground her refusal upon strict law; but it is as equally difficult to deny: First, Thatinsodo ing, she exercises harshly an extreme and hard law. Secondly, That her conduct with respect to the r,"ia tion of tho St. Lawrence is in glaring and discreditable contrariety with her conduct with respect to the navigation of the Mississippi, on the ground that she possessed a small domain in which the Mississippi took its rise. She in sisted on the right to navigate the en tire volume of its waters on the ground that Bhe possessed both banks of the St. Lawrence whero it discmbouges into the sea. She denies to the United States tho right of navigation throughout. About one-half of the waters of the Lakes Ontario, Erie, La'... ri,: -wi, UrtT ?c winch tho river flows, iuf the property of thd United S'tL-H. Tho whole nation is ta'strv ted iu securing cheap transpor tation froia the agricultural States of the West to tho Atlantio seaboard. And to the citizens of those Siates it secures a treater return for their la bor ; to the inhabitants of the seaboard it offers cheaper food ; and to tho na tion, an increase in the annual sur plus of wealth. It is hoped that the Government of Great Britain will see the justice of abandoning the narrow and inconsistent claims, to which her Canadian provinces have urged her adherence. AMERICAN COMMERCE. Our depressed commerce is a sub ject to which 1 called Epecial atten tion at the last session, and suggested that we will, in the future, have to look more to tho countries south of up, andto Chinajand Japan, for its re vival. Oar representatives to all these governments have exerted their influence to encourage trade between the Uoited States and the countries to which they are accredited; but the fact exists that the carrying is done almost entirely in foreign bottom.3, and while this state of affairs exists we cannot control our due share of the commerce of the world. That be tween the Pacific S'ates and China and Japan is about all the earning trade now conducted iu American vessels. I would recommend a liberal policy toward that line of American steam ers one that will insure its success, and even increase iti usefulness. The cost of building iron vessels, the only ones that compete with foreign ships in the carrying trade, is so much greater in the United States than in foreiga countries than without some assistance from tbe government they cannot be successfully . built here. There will be several proposition laid before Congress in the course of the present session, looking to a remedy for this evil. Even if it should be at some cost to the National treasury, I hope such encouragement will be giv en as will secure American shipping on the high seas, and American ship building at home.' : 

PUBLIC BUILDIN03. The condition of the archives of the Department of State calls for tbe early action of Congress. The build ing now rented by that Department is a frail struoture, at an inoonvenient distanco from the Executive Mansion, and from the other Departments. It is ill adapted to tbe purpose for which it is -dsed ; has not capacity to accom modate the archives, and is net fire nroof. Its remote situation, its slen- den construction, and the absence of a supply of water in the neighborhood leaves but little hope of safety for either the building or its contents in oase of fire. Its destruction would in volve the loss ot the rolls containing the original acts and resolutions of Congress, the historic records of the Revolution and of the Confederation, of the whole series of diplomatic and consular archives since the adoption of the Constitution, and of many other valuable records and papers left with that Department when it was the principal depository of gov ernment archives. I reoommend an appropriation for the construction of a building for the : Department of State. . I recommend to your reconsidera tion the propriety of transferring to the Department of the Interior, to which they seem more appropriately to belong, all powers and other duties in relation to the Territories with which the Department of State is now oharged, by law or usage; and from the Interior Department to the War Department, the Pension Bureau, so far as it regulates the payment of sol diers pensions. I would further re commend that the payment of naval pensions be transferred to one of tho bureaus of the Navy Department. ESTIMATE OF THE CURRENT EXPENSES. The estimates for the expenses of the Goverament for the fiscal year are IS.211,316 less than for the cur rent one, but exceed the appropria tions for the present year for the same items $8,972,127 5G.

APPROACH TO EPECIE, The average value of gold as com pared with the national currency for the whole of the year 1S09, was about one thirty-four, and for eleven months or lbtO, the same relative value has beca about one-fifteen. The approaeh to a specie basis is very gratifying, but the fact can not be denied that the instability of tbe .value of our currency is prejudicial t our pros perity, and tends to keep up prices to the detriment of trade, and the evils of a depreciated and fluctuating cur rency are so great that now, when the premium on gold has fallen so much. it would seem that tbe time has ar rived when by wise and prudent leg islation Congress should look to a poi loy which would placo our currenoy at par with gold at no distant day, REVENUE AND TARIFF. The tax oollected from the people bas been reduced more than fifty mil lion dollars per annum by progressing in our present oourse. There is no reason why, in a few short years, the national tax gatherer may not disap pear from tbe door of the citizens almost entirely: with the revenue stamps dispensed by the postmasters in every community, a tax upon Honors of all sorts, and tobacco in all its forms, and by a wise adjustment of the tariff which will put a duty onlv uoon those articles which one nould dispense with, known as luxu ries, and those which wc use more of than we produce, revenue enough may be raised, alter a tew years or peace and consequent reduction of indebt edness, to lumu an our obligations; i farther reduction of expense, in addi tion to a reduotion of interest and ner cent., may be relied on to make this practical. Revenue reform, it it mosna tl.iu him mv heartv support If it implies a collection of all the revenue for tbe support of the Gov ernment, lor the payment ot tbe prin cipal and interest of the public debt, peusions, &c, by directly taxing the people, then I am against it and reve nue reform, and I confidently believe the people are with me. If it means a failure to provide the necessary means to defray all expenses of the Government, and thereby repudiation of tbe public debt and pensions, then I am still more opposed to suoh kind of revenuo reform. It has not been defined by any of its advocates, to my knowledge, and seems to be accepted as something whioh is to supply every man's wants, without any eost or ef fort on his part. A true revenue re form cannot be made in a day, but must be the work of national legisla tion, and of time. As soon as the revenues ate dispensed with, all duty should be removed from coffee, tea, and other articles of universal use not produced by ourselves. The ne cessities of the country compel us to collect revenue from our imports. An army of assessors and collectors is not a pleasant sight to the citizen, but that or a tariff for revenue . is necessary. Such a tariff, so far as it acts in encouragement to home pro ducts, affords employment to labor at living wages, in contrast to the pauper labor of the old world, and also in the development of home resources. THE WAB 

DEPARTMENT. " The army has been gradually re duced, so that on the 1st of January, 1871, tho number of commissioned officers and men will not exceed the number contemplated by law. The War Department building is an old structure, not fire proof, and entirely inadequate id dimensions to our pres ent wants. Many thousands of dol lars are now paid annually for rent of private building to accommodate tbe various bureaus oi trie department. I recommend an appropriation for a new War Department building, suited to the present and growing wants of the nation. The report of the Seo- r,-tr? of ,-T-r c- n T-or?

NAVY. The expenses of the navy for the wholo of 'last year (from December, I860, the date of the last report) are less than nineteen million dollars, or about one million less than they were the previous year. Tho expenses of the Navy Department in this fiscal year, since July 1, shew, for the five months, a decrease of over two mil lion four hundred thousand dollars from those of tho corresponding months of last year. The estimates for tho current year were f 28,205 ,670; those for the next year are f2G,833, 170, with $35,100 addition for tempo rary and permanent improvements. These estimates are made closely, for the maintenance of the naval estab lishment as it is now, and without muoh in the nature of permanent im provement. The appropriations made for the last eight current years were evidently so intended by Congress, and are sufficient only to keep the navy on its present footing, and the repairing and refitting of our eld ships. This poli ;y must, cf course gradually but surely destroy the navy, and it is in itself far from econom ical; , for each year that it is pursued, the necessity for rtore re pairs in ships and navy yards became more imperative and more costly, and our current ex penses are actually increased for the mere repair of ships, many of which must soon be ucseaworthy and useless. I hope during "the present 9c-ssioa of Congress to Le able to sub mit to it a plan by which naval vessels can be built and repaits made with ereat saving upon the present cost. It can hardly bo wise statesmanship in a government which represents a oountry with over five thousand miles of coast line on both oceans, exclu sive of Alaska, and containing forty millions of progressive people with relations of every nature with almost every foreign country, to rest with such inadequate means of foroing any foreign policy, either of protection or redress, separated by tbe ocean from the nations of the Western Continent. Our navy is the only means of direct protection to our citizens abroad, or for the enforcement of any foreign policy. THE 

POSTOFFICE DEPARTMENT. The accompanying report of the Postmaster General shows a most sat isfactory working of that department. With the adoption of the recommend ation contained therein, particularly that looking to a reform ia the frank ing privilege, and the adoption of cor respondence cards, a self-sustaining postal system may be speedily looked for, and at no distant day a further reduction of postage will be attained. I reoommend an authorization by Congress to tho Postmaster General and Attorney General to issue all commissions . to officials appointed . through their respective departments. At present these commissions, where appointments are made, are issued by the State Department. The law in all departments of the Government, except those of tho postofiica and justice, authorize each to issue its own commissions. , THE 

CIVIL SERVICE. Always favoring practical reforms, ' I respectfully call your attention to ; one abuse of loiig standing, which I would like to see -remedied by this Congress. It is a reform in the civil service of the country. I would ad- , vise it to go beyond tbe mere fixing of the tenure of offico of clerks and employes who do not require the ad- ! vice and consent' of the Senate to make their appointments complete. 1 would havo it govern not the tenure, ' but the manner, of making all ap- j pointmcnts. There is no duty which ! so embarrasses the Executive and the beads of the Departments, as that of . appointments, nor is there any such 1 arduous and thankless labor imposed j upon Senators and Representatives as that of finding places tor constituents, j Th- present system does cot secure , the best men, and often not even fit , men for public place. The elevation and purification of the civil service of the government will be hailed with approval by the whole people of the ' United States. 

INDIAN AFFAIRS. Reform in the management of In dian affairs has received tho special attention of the Administration from its inauguration to the present day. The experiment of making it a mis sionary agency given to the denomin ation of Friends, has been found to work most advantageous. All agencies and superintendents not bo disposed of were given to officers of the army. The act of Congress reducing the ar my rendered army officers ineligible for civil positions. Indian agencies being civil offices, I determined to give all agencies to such denomina tions as had heretofore established missions among the Indians; perhaps to some other denomications who would undertakc the work, on the same terms as a missionary work. The societies selected are allowed to name their own agents, subject to the approval of the Executive, and are expected to watch over them and aid them as missionaries and chris tianize and civilize the Indian, aod to train him in the arts of peace. The government watches over the official acts of these agents, and requires of them as strict an accountabiiiiy if they were appointed in any other manner. I entertain the confident hope that the policy now pursued, will, in a few years, bring all Indians upon reservations where they will live in houses, have school houses and churches, will be pursuing peaceful and self-supporting avocations, and where they may bo visited by tho law abiding white man with the same im punity that he now visits civilizad white settlements. I call your special attention to the report of the Com missioner of Indian Affairs, for full information on this subject. THE

THE PATKXT OFFICE. During tbe year ending September 3). 1870, there were filed In the I'hiadi oilioe 1H.411 applications for patents, 8,:i71 caveats and 160 app IcatioDS for tbe exienitlon of patents. Thirteen thousand six hundred and twenty-t wo patents, tuciudiog the re Issues and designs, were Issued; lul ex tended; 1,(SJ u eie allowed, but not Issued, by reason of lha non-payment of final fees.

EDUCATION ABD AGRlCCLTOaB. In the Interests of one a bureau baa been established In tbe Interior iJepart nieut, the bureau of Kdncallon, and In the other a separate department, that of agriculture. I believe great general good is to follow from the operations of both these bureaus. If properly fostered. I can not commend to your careful consideration loo highly the reports of the Commission ers of education and of agrioaltare, nor urge too much liberal legislation to secure their emclency.
