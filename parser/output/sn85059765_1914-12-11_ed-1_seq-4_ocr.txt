We hem* a great deal -nowadays about the need and advisa bility of insiting on goods made in America when shopping. What a fine piece of "business" acume it is. It is noticeable that the campaign as instigated and engineered by Collier's and lesser lights reaches only to the consumer of articles of commerce made in America. Nothing is expected of the manufacturer. Although we respect a useful citizen whether he be white, black or brown, yet it must be observed that the American manufacturers who are whooping it up so strongly for the slogn, 'Made in America,' carefully refrain from carrying this principle into effect when purchasing' labor power. Why doesn't Collier's and the others nsist that the American manufacturers when employing labor i shall buy the finest thing in the American labor market ? the member of the American labor union? Right now, in the midst | of a crushing depression, immigration from Europe is encourag ! ;d and looked upon with satisfaction by these 'Made in America' I boosters. Colliers Weekly wouldn't dare do such a thing; it I m:'ght hurt the advertising section. We are for the working class ! every nationality and would not relish any discrimination , against any 'foreigners' as such, but this is a piece of hypocrit : ical patriotism which should be taken with a grain of salt by a | too gullible public. The skilled mechanic who insists on a union j scale is turned away in favor of the greenhorn unfortunate who is willing to work tor anything the boss will give, and the highly skilled, jobless members of the unions who are walking the streets are cooly invited to grow enthusiastic over the 'Made in U. S. A." proposition. What was it P. T. Barnum said? THE CLAN OF TOIL AWAKENS. The Clan form of organization is the one that seems to adapt I nself to the needs of the people of the South as Witness the Klu ? ;\lux oc reconstruction days, and the recent activities of the \ .ight Kiders. Legitimate form of organization labor have been | ruthlessly stamped out everywhere in the 'Sunny South', and it ! iow begins to look like the employing class will soon go up against :he secret, oath-bound and desperate Clan form of organization. I /rom different and widely seperated localities of the South comes i aories of the mysterious visitations of armed bands of 'Nisrht ciders', to mills, mines, and camps where conditions are no longer : .earable. The following item sent out by the American Press i?s<>. j>:tion during the week is a sampler Night Riders Busy Again in Kentucky. Princeton. Ky.. Dec. S- ? The authorities of Caldwell ? county were notified today that a band of fifty night riders 1 visited Cedar Biutf a remote settlement Monday night, blew ! mjj two small dwellings with dynamite and poured a fusillade : ?'{ bullets into a thi?*d house. The initial activities of the night riders were directed at employers of labor in non-union coal mines, in Butler. | Muhleni.nirg and Caldweli counties. With the Clan of Toil awakened to the real oppression of i me workers and, possessed of a determination to strike for their j class, the offspring of Klu klux sires may be expected to raise ? more } ? ell per square inch in Dixie than did all the invadin? ! -ankee armivs of the sixties. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Wood row Wilson is a whipped and beaten man. About two years ago his message fairly bristled with wrath occasioned by tii e wi.jked members of big; business who were rifling" the pock ets of v.he dear people. How many were to be hanged "higher than hair, an V" This weeks' message contains a miserable, sub missive apology for > all this and a promise to do better. In eliect the president declared that big business had nothing further to fear from the party he represents, that it was done with the at tempts at restrictive and corrective legislation and that hence forth the administration would content itself with such harmless activities as providing big business with a merchant marine with ! which to transport the products it has wrung from the toil of the | American proletariat to foreign shores; the depending of harbors ' in Alaska, and the opening of the usual porK barrels for favored congressmen. The one item of his fast fading poularity which : he still hangs to, is his advocacy of peace and restriction of ttic jmgnis-. program for ioading tile country witii a still heavier bur Wen of militarism. But his determination along this line will come ' to !)ut lutle if the actions of his cabinet, especially his ministers of war and the navy, in making reports urging an increase of militarism, are taken as a criterion. The school teacher has at i .as* turned into the politician, hoping against nope for the suc I cess of his party two years hence, and thus is explained his pres ' ent compromising attitude. AND 

STILL WE HAVE NO ARMY? in view of the fact that the .iingoists of the country are howl ing that the United States are absolutely defenseless and are loudly crying for increase in army and armanent. it is well for the American people to begin to ask what has become of the im mense sums spent in military preparation in past years? The United States has averaged an expenditure of three hundred mil liens of dollars a year on military preparations since the Spanish American war ? yet Congressman Gardner on the floor of Con gress, Thursday, declared that the war department hasn't en ough guns and ammunition to put up one hour's battle. What has become of the hundreds of millions of dollars that have been appropriated for the military and naval departments. This year, under democratic economy tactics, the war appropriation has been sealed down to two himdrede and fifty million dollars, and pub he works to eighty million dollars. While we economize by spend ing only two hundred and fifty millions for preparation, (or aliened preparation) for murder and destruction, we are spending THIRTY MILLION dollars in ihe Department of Agriculture. Thirty million dollars to learn how to produce food, and two hun dred and fifty millions to learn how to destroy life. And this is re for re 1 to as a civilized nation and an intelligent people! DEFEAT IN COLORADO. Another bloody chapter of the industrial war of the United States has just drawn to a close. The United Mine Workers made a splendid resistance against the Colorado Fuel and Iron Com pany and allied companies and their army of tin gs. militiamen, gunmen, and the rest of the social scum that a :ew dollars can buy. but their divided craft tactics proved no match for the nati onally organized coal operators- The miners, unaided and al ne, fought the coal barons, the power of their wealth, their courts, their gunmen, their militia, and the worst of all ? Hunger. Bur to beat them into submission the coal operators were driven to commit crimes that set the nation aflame and forced the people to seriously consider, for the first time, the ad visibility of cjlloot lvely operating the mines. The Colorado miners have suffered terribly, but they and the miners of West Virginia have shown the unions of America what to expect of the coal barons, ana if industrial organization is the fruit of their suffering and dving, then we again win, even in defea.. Holly Grove and Ludlow re vealed the spirit of trie apostles of greed: while the industrially defeated miners have achieved a distinct moral victory. MASSACRE FEARED. No one seems to be surprised that the Baldwin-Feltz defec tives of the C. a; 0. and N. ? W. have unearthed plans for a whole sale assassination of the delectable crew, since two of the band were shot during the past few weeks. The Baldwins can usually be depende upon to discover sufficient cause for their continued employment by corporations whose consciences pain them any way, and this discovery of a threatened invasion of the Tri-State section by an army of yeggs and murderers will probably make their graft safe for awhile longer. It would be a terrible blow to society as a whole were twelve of these brave tramp-chasers taken off, and we cannot help but weep when we behold in the list such familiar names as Geo. Lenz and Tom Feltz. George, however, says he is prepared to go. and outside of the putting on of an ad ditional steel breastplate, and withdrawing into his armored car. he is making no effort to escape. Although water transportation practically died with the tal lowdip candle, about the time that railroads came to the relief of , ! the people in the matter of transference of commodities, that business ( ?) aggregation known as the Congress of the United States still squanders enough of the people's taxes yearly to build I railroads on both sides of the Rivers and Harbors they open ''pork barrels" for. The amount estimated to be wasted in this ! manner at the present term of Congress is approximately one j hiindred million dollars The Huntington Chamber of Commerce with refreshing! naivete informs us that "seventy-five per cent of the wage earn- 1 ers of Huntington own their own homes." We know that they ! have built and own all of them, but to say that anything like 30 per cent have real possession of them is a shady untruth that is ! inexcusable even for the sake of boosting Huntington. YVlfat has become 01 that much hearlded currency bill that j was, by some mysterious process, to start the mills, mines and , factories again. Currency reform will not consume the surplus! of goods and weath that the profit system lias permitted the cap- j italist class to take from the producing -class, and which is now; piled high in the granaries and warehouses of the few. Have you heard of Edward Becker, the convicted New York j gunman going to the electric chair? No. And you will not. Beck er is the man higher up; the confident of the powers that be in New York City. The hired men have been executed. Society should be satisfied.. Perhaps the authorities of New York dare not kill a man who knows the inside of the game in New York. THE 

PROBLEM OF FEEDING. The Pittsburg; Gazette Times is | experting in the feeding: problem. In ! these days of many experts there is no reason why every man can't be his own expert. If tnere is anything easier than being an expert for the public it hasn't been tried up to De cember 7, 1914. The Gazette Times is interested in dissipating this delusion about the high cost of living. I lie old farmer who said after a long look at t k ;? gi raffe in the drills menagerie. "They can't fool me, there aint no sich ani mal." has nothing on the Times. I he Gazette Times knows there is no such condition as high living costs, but the public doesn't. The public, therefore, must be instructed. Hence this exporting by the Gazette Times To simplify the exporting, the Gn zctte Times explains that the ques lion in households toda\ is not, "Ho\\ well cun u family oi live he fc<' or, | a dollar a day?" but "For how much less than a dollar a day can you feed the family wholesomely and palata bly?" Those who can do this. an?. those sviio have done it. t w Gazette Times explains, may ho cmsidero i "domcst'c engineers.' '.tithough "goo<i managers" may be high-sounding en ough t'oi the more humble. The man I in the street would say that the wo j man who has done that, or can do ! it, is more than engineer <r manage'.-. She's a miracle. When a man has this 9$ cents a day for wage workers in his system it's mighty hard to get uwav lrom l?l a day as a muniiicent hasis i ?>r do mestic calculations. l! it were not for breaking up the Gazette Times' expert < xercis-:1 a fen thou.-aw: wo men in Pittsburg could ? p<r that nobody ? an i< ed a famiiy on a uollar a day. There are many who can starve a family of live on that, but none who can ieed the bunch fot either 9S cents, or a whole dollar. PRINTERS MEET.
