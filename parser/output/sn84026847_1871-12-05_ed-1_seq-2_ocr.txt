President's Message. Gentlemen, of the Senate and House of Representative* : Id addressing my third annual mee aage to the law making branch of the Government, it is gratifying to be able to atate that during the past year success has generally attended the effort to exe cute all the laws found upon the statute book. The policy has Deen not to in quire into the wisdom of the Jaws already enacted, but to learn their spirit and inteat and to enforce them accordingly. TH? 

PAST YEAR has, under ft wise Providence, been one of general prosperity to the ofttioa. It hfts, however, been attended with more ihfto asuftl chastisements in the loes of lift and property, by storm ftnd fire. These disasters have served to call forth the beet element of human natare in our country, and develop a friendship for us on the part of foreign nations which goes far towards alleviating the distrraa occasioned by these calamities. The benevolent who have so generously shared their means with the victims of these misfortunes will reap their reward in the consciousness of having per formed a noble act, and will receive the grateful thanks of the men, women and children who?e suffering* they have relieved. FOKlWiX KKLATIOM&. The relations of the United States j with foreign powers continue to be friendly. The year has been an cvent Ail one in witnessing two great nations spe iking one language and having one lineage settling, by peaceful arbitration, disputes of longstanding, and liable at any time to bring those nations into bloody and hostile conflict. An exam ple has thus been set which, if success ful in its final issue, may be followed by otiier oivilized nations and be the final means of returning tj productive in dustry millions of men now maintained Co settle the dispute; of nations by the bayonet and sword. THE TREATY OF WA9HIXGTOS. I transmit herewith a copy of the treat? alluded to, which has been con cluded since the adjournment of Con gress with Her British Majesty, and of the conferences of the commissioners by whom it was negotiated. This treaty provides methods for adjusting all the questions pending between the two nations The Alabama questions are to br adjusted bv arbitration, an J 1 recommend Congress at an early day to I make ihe necessary provision' for the meeting of this tribunal at Geneva, and for the several commissioners on the part of the -United States called for by the treaty. His Majesty the King o' Italy, the President of the S'vi-w Confederation, and His Majesty the Emperor of Brazil have each conferred, on the joint request of the t*-i pnvers. to name an arbitrat or for t lii* tribunal at Geneva. I have caused my thanks to be suitably ex pressed for the readine-n with which the joint request ha- been complied with by the appointment of gentlemen of eminence and learning to those im portant positions. His Maj esty the Em peror of Germany has also been pleased to comply with the joint request of the twoGovernments, and has consented to act as the arbitrator of the disputed water boundary between the United States and Great Britain. The con tending parties in the treaty have un dertaken to regar 1. as between them ?elves, certain principle* of public law for which the United States has con tended from the commencement of its history. They have aI.*o agreed to bring these principles to the knowledge of the other maritime postern and to invito them to accede to them. Nego tiations are going on as to the form in which the invitation is to be extended to theae powers. THE FISilECIKS. I recommend the legislation neces sary, on the part of the United States, to bring into operation the arrioles of the treaty relating to the fisheries and to the other matters touching the rela tions of the United States toward the British North American Possessions, to become operative as soon as the proper legislation shall be had on the part of Great Britain and its Possessions. It is much to be desired that this legislation may become operative before the fisher men ef the United States begin to make their arrangementa for the coming sea son. THB 

LAKES AND CANALS. I have ad lressed a communication, of which a copy is transmitted here with, to the Governors of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan. Illinois, and Wisconsin, urging upon the Governors of these States, respect ively, the neces&uy action on their part to carry into effect the object of the article of the treaty which contemplates the use of the canals on either side, connected with the navigation of the lakesand rivers forming the boundarv, on terms of equity by the inhabitants of both countries. It is hoped that the importance of the object, and the benefit ! to flow therefrom, will secure the speedy approval and legislative sanc tion of the States concerned. THE BOrNDARV QUESTION. I renew the recommendation for an appropriation for determining the true position of the forty-ninth parallel of latitude where it forms the boundary between the Unite.! States and the British Provinces, between the Lake of the Woods and the summit of the Rocky Mountains. The early action of Congress on the recommendation named would put it in thepower of the War Diparment to place a force in the field during the next summer. FRANCS AND GERMANY. The resumption of diplomatic rela tion between France and Germany has enabled me to live directions for the withdrawal of the protection extended to the Germans in France by the dis* plomatic and consular representatives of the United States in that country. It is just to add that the delicate dutv of this protection has been performed by the Minister and Consul General at Paris and the various consuls in France under the supervision of the former, with great kindness as well as with prudence and tact.- Their course has received the commenda tion of the German government, and bas wounded the susceptibility of ihe French. The Government of the Emperor of Germany continues to man ifest a friendly feeling toward the United States and a desire to harmonize with the moderate and jnst policy which this government maintains in its relations with the European Powers as well as with Uae South American Republics. I have given an assurance that the friend ly feelings of that government are fnllv shared by the United States. The rati fication of the Coasolar and Naturali sation Conventions with the Austro Jlnngariao Empire have been exchang ed. 1 have been officially informed of the annexation of the States of the Church to the Kingdom of Italy and the removal of the Capital of the Kingdom to the city of Rome. In conformity with the established policy of the United States, I have recognized this change. The ratification of the new treaty of commerce between the United States and Italy bM been exchanged. The two powers have agreed in their treaty that property at sea shall be exempt from capture in case of war between the two powers. The United States has spared no opportunity of incorporating this rule into the obligations of nations. SPANISH CLAIMS. The Forty-first Congress, at its URrd session, made an appropriation for the organization of a mixed commission for adjudicating upon the claims of citizens of the United States against Spain, growing out of the insurrection in Cuba. The commission has since been organized, and I transmit herewith the correspondence relating to its formation and jurisdiction. It is to be hoped that this convention will afford claimants a complete remedy for their injuries. It has been made the agreeable duty of the United States to preside over a conference at Washington between the plenipotentiaries of Spain and the allied South American Republics, wbich has resulted in an armistice, with the reasonable assurance of a per manent peace. THE 

MCSCOVY DICK. The intimate and friendly relations which have so long existed between the United States and Russia continue un disturbed. The visit of the son of the Emperor is a proof that there is no desire on the part of his government to dimin ish the cordiality of tho^e relations. The hospitable reception which has been given to the Grand Duke is proof that on our side we share the wishes of that government. The inexcusable course of the Russian Minister at Wash ington rendered it necessary to ask his recall, and to decline to longer receive that functionary in a diplomatic rela tion. It is impossible with self respect, or with a just regard for the dignity of the country to permit Mr. Catacazy to continue to bold intercourse with this government after abusing the govern ment officials, and during bis persistent interference, through various means, with the relations between the United States and other powers. In accordance with my wishes, this government has, been relieved of further intercourse with Mr. Catacazy, and the manage ment of the Imperial legation has pas 6ed into the hands of a gentlema nen tirely unobjectionable. With Japan we continue to maintain friendly relations. The CaWinet of the Mikado has, since the close of last ses sion of Congress, selected citizens of the United StatC3 to serve in offices of much importance in the several depart ments of that government. I have rea sons to think that this selection is due to an appreciation of the disinterested ness of the policy which the United States has pursued toward Japan. It is our desire to continue to maintain this disinterested and just policy with China as well as Japan. The corre spondence transmitted herewith shows there is no disposition on the part of this government to swerve from its es tablished course TUE COREA DIFFICULTY Prompted by a desire to put an end to the barbarous treatment ol our ship wrecked eailorn on the Corean coast, I instructed our minister at Pekin to endeavor to conclude a convent on with Corea for securing the safety from inhuman treatment of such mariners. Admiral Rogers was instructed to ac company him with a sufficient force to protect him in case of need. A small surveying party was sent out, and on reaching the coast was treacherously attacked at a disadvantage. Ample opportunity was given for explana tion and apology for the insults, but neither came. A force was then landed, and after a forced march over a rugged and difficult country, the forts from which the outrages had been committed were gallantly assaulted and were destroyed. Having thus punished the criminals and having vindicated the honor of the flag, the expedition re turned. Finding it impracticable under the circumstances to conclude the de sired Convention, I respectfully refer you to the correspondence relating thereto herewith submitted, and leave the subject for such action as Congress may see fit to take. THE VESICA* SMUGGLERS. The Republic of Mexico has not yet repealed the very objectionable law es tablishing what is known as the free zone on the frontier of the United States. It is hoped this may yet be done, and also that more stringent mea sures may betaken by that republic for restraining lawless persons on its fron tiers. I hope that Mexico, by its own action, will soon relieve this govern ment from the difficulties experienced from this cause. Our relations with the various re publics of CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA continues, with one exception, to be cordial and friendly. I recommend some action by Congress regarding the overdue instalments under the award of the Venezuela claims commission of 1866. The internal dissentions of this government present no justification for the absence of an effort to meet their solemn treaty obligations. The ratifi cation of our extradition treaty with Nicaragua has been exchanged. It is a subject for congratulation that the great Empire of Brazil has taken the initiatory steps toward the abolition of slavery. Our relations with the empire, always cordial, will natur ally be made more so by this ' act, and it is not too much to hop* that the government of Brazil may hereafter find it for its interest, as well as intrin sically right, to advance toward entire emancipation more rapidly than the present act contemplates. The true prosperity and greatness of a nation is to be found in the education and eleva tion of its laborers. It is a subject for regret that the reforms in this direction, which were voluntarily promised by the statesmen of Spain, have not been carried out in its West Indian colonies. The laws and regulations for the appa rent abolition of slavery in Cuba and Porto Rico leave most of the laborers in bondage with no hope of release, until their lives become a burden to their employers. I desire to direct your at tention to the fact that the citizens of the United States are large holders in foreign lands of this species of property forbidden by the fundamental law of their adopted country. I recommend to Congress to provide by stringent leg islation a suitable remedy against bold ins, owning, or dealing in slaves, or being inteiested in slave propertv in foreign lands, either as owners, hirers or mortgagees, by citizens of the United States. It is to be regretted that the disturbed condition of THE 

ISLAND OP CUBA continues to be a source of annoyance and anxiety. The existence of a pro longed struggle in such close proximity to our territory without apparent pros pect of early termination, cannot be other than an object of concern to a people who, while abstaining from in terference in the affairs of other powers, naturally desire to see every country in the undisturbed enjoyment of peace, liberty and the blessing of free institu tions. Otirnaval commanders in Cuban waters have been instructed, in case it should become necessary, to spare no effort to protect the lives and property of bona fide American citizens, and to maintain the dignity of the flag. It is to be hoped that all pending questions with Spain growing out of the affairs of Cuba may be adjusted in the spirit of peace and civilization which has hith erto guided the two powers in their treatment of such questions. SCHOOLING FOR FOREIGN SERVICE. To give importance and to add to the efficiency of our diplomatic affairs with Japan and China anl to further aid in retaining the good opinion of these people, and to secure to the United States its share of the commerce destined to flow between these nations and the balance of the commercial world, I earnestly recommend that an appropriation be made to support at least four American youths in each of the^e countries to serve asa part of the official family of our Ministers there. Our representatives would not, even then, be placed upon an equality with the representatives of Great Britain and some other powers. As now situated, our representatives in Japan and China have to depend for interpreters and translators upon natives of these countries who know our lan guage imperfectly, or procure for the occasion the services of the employes in foreign bueinefs houses, or the inter preters of other foreign ministers. SUBSIDIES TO STEAMERS. 1 would also recommend liberal mea sures for the purpose of assisting the American lines of steamers now plying between S;in Francisco, Japan and China, and the Australian line, almost our on'y remaining lines of ocean steamers and of increasing their service. THE NATIONAL DEBT has been reduced to the extent of $86,057,129.80 during the year and by the negotiation of National bonds, at a lower rate of interest. The interest on the public debt has been so far diminished that the sums to be raised for the interest account is nearly #187,000,000 less than on the first of March, 1869. It was highly desirable that this rapid diminution should take place both to strengthen the credit of the country and to convince its citizens of their entire ability to meet every dollar of liability without bankrupting them, but in view of the accomplish ments of these deeirable results, of the rapid development ol the re sources of the country, its increasing ability to meet large demands, and the amount" already paid.it is not desir able that the present resources of the country should continue to be so taxed, in order to continue this rapid payment. 

TAXES AND FI.VAXCK. I there ore recommend a modification of both tariff and internal tax law?. I re commend that all taxes from internal sources be abolished, except those on spiriiuous, vinous and male liquors, tobacco in its various forms, and for stamps. In readjusting the tariff I sug gest that a careful estimate be made of the amount of surplus revenue collected under the present laws, after providing for the current expenses of the govern ment, interest account and a sinking fund, and that this surplus be reduced in such a manner as to afford the greatest relief to the greatest num ber. There are many articles not produced at home, such as medicines and compounded essences, trom which very little revenue is derived, but which enter into general use. All such arti cles I recommend to be placed on the free list. Should a further reduction prove advisable, I then recommend that it be made on those articles which can be reduced without disturbing home production or reducing the wages of J American labor. I have not entered^ into figures, because to do so would be to repeat all that is laid before you in the report of the Secretary of the T reasury. The present laws for collect ing the revenue pay the collectors of customs small salaries but provide for shares of all seizures whicb, at the principal ports of entry particularly, raises the compensation of these offi cials to a large sum. It has always seemed to me as if this system nui9t at times work perniciously in holding out inducements to dishonest men. should such get into possession of the offices, to be lax in their scrutiny of goods entered in order to enable them finally to make large seizures. Your attention is respectfully invited to this subject. The continued fluctuation in the value of gold, as compared with the National currency, has a most damag j ing effect upon the increase and devel opment of the country, in keeping up the prices of all articles necessary in everv day life. It gives rise to a spirit of gambling prejudicial alike to the Na tional morals and the National finances. The question to be met is how to get a fixed value to our currency. That value is constantly and uniformly approach ing a specie basis, for with "specie every desirable object will be gained. FOR THE 

OPERATION'S OF TUB ARMY in the past year, the expense of main taining it. the estimates for the ensuing year, and for continuing the sea coast and other improvements conducted un der the supervision of the War Depart ment, I refer you to the accompanying report of the Secretary of War. I call your attention to the provisions of the ?f C<?n?reM aPPr<>ved March 3d, 1869, which discontinues promotions in the staff corrs of the army, until provided for by law. 1 recommend that the number of officers in each grade of the staff corps be fixed, and that when ever the number in any one grade falls below the number as fixed, that the vacancy may be filled by promotion from the grade below. I also recom mend that when the office of chief of a corps becomes vacant, the place may be filled by selection from the corps in which the vacancy exists. TDK xavt. The report of the Secretary of the Navy shows an improvement in the number and efficiency of the naval force without a material increase in the expense of supporting it. This is due i to the policy which has been adopted and is being extended as fast as our material will admit, of using small vessels as cruisers at tKe several sta tions. By these means we have been enabled to occupy at once a larger ex tent of cruising ground, to visit, more frequently the posts where the presence of our flag is desirable, and generally discharge efficiently the appropriate duties of the navy in time of peace, without eiceeding the somber of men or the expenditures authorised by lav. Daring the part year the nary has, in addition to its regular service, supplied the men and officer* for the vessels of the coast server, and has completed the surreys authorized by Congress of the Isthmus of Darien and Tebuaute pec, and under the same authority has sent out an expedition completely fur nished and equipped to explore the unknown oceans of the North. The suzgestions of the report as to the necessity for increasing and improring the materisl of the nary, and the plan recommended for reducing the pereon nel of the serrice to a peace standard, by the gradual abolition of certain grades of officers, the reduction ol others, and the employment of some in commercial marine, are well considered, and deserre the thoughtful attention of Congress. I also recommend that all promotions in the navy abore captain be by selection instead of by seniority. This course will secure in the higher greads greater efficiency, and hold out an incentire to young officers to im prore theraeelres in the knowledge of their profession. The present cost of maintaining the nary and its cost, com pared with that of the preceding year, and the estimates for the ensuing year, are contained in the accompanying re port of the Secretary of the Nary. TUB 

POSTOFFICB DEPARTMENT. The enlarged receipts of the Poet* office Department, as snown by the ac companying report of the Postmaster General, exhibits a gratifying increase in that branch of public service. It is an index of the growth of education and of the prosperity of the people in elements highly conducive to the vigor and stability of republic?. With a vast territory like ours, much of it sparsely populated, requiring the services of the mails, it is not at present to be expected that this department can be made self sustaining, but a gradual approximation to this end from year to year is con fidently relied upon, and the day is not far distant when the Postoffice depart ment of the Government will prove a much greater blessing fo the people than it is now. The suggestions of the Postmaster General for improvements in the department presided over by him, are earnestly recommended to your special attention, especially the documents favorable to the considera tion of the plan for uniting the telegraph system of the United States with the postal system. It is believed that by such a course the cost of tele graphing could be much reduced, and the service ax well, if not better, rendered. It would secure the further advantage by ex tending the telegraph through portions of the country where private enterprize will not construct it. Commerce, trade, and above all the efforts to bring a people widely separated into a com munity of interest, are always benefitted by a rapid intercommunica tion. Education, the ground work of Republican institution, is encouraged by increasing the facilities for bringing speedy news from all parts of the coun try, and the desire to reap the benefit of such improvements will stimulate learn ing. I refer you to the report of the Postmaster General for full details of the operation of last year, and for com parative statements of the result within four years. THE 

KU-KLCX LAW. There has been imposed upon the executive branch of the Government the execution of the act of Congress ap proved April 20, 1874, and commonly known as the Ku-Klux law. In a por tion of the State of South Carolina the necessity of the course pursued will be demonstrated by the report of the com mittee to investigate the Southern out rages. Under the provisions of the above act, I issued my proclamation calling the attention of the people of the United States to the same and de claring my reluctance to exercise any ol theexiraordinary powers thereby confer red upon me except in case of imperative necessity, but making known my pur pose to exercise such powers whenever it should become necessary to do so for the purpose of securing to all citizens of the United States the peaceful enjoy mentof their rights, guaranteed therein by the Constitution and the laws. Af ter the palace of this law informa tion was received from time to time that combinations of the character referred to in this law, existed and were power ful in many parts of the Southern States, particularly in certain coun ties in the State of South Carolina Careful investigation was made and it was ascertained that in counties of that State such combinations were active and powerful, embracing sufficient por tions of the citizens to control the local authority and having, among other things, the object of depriving the emancipated class of the substantial benefits of freeJom and of preventing the free political action of those citi-j zens who did not sympathize with their' own views. Among their operations were frequent scourging and occasional assassinations, generally perpetrated at night by disguised persons, the victims in almost all ca*es being citizens of different political sen timents from their own, or free per sons who had shown a disposition to claim equal rights.with other citizens. Thousands of inoffensive and well disposed citizens were the sufferers by this lawless violence. Thereupon, on the 13th of October, 1871, a proclama tion was issued in the terms of the law calling upon the members of these com binations to disperse within five days and to deliver to marshals or military officers of the United States all arms and amunit;on, uniforms, disguises and other means and implements used by them for carrying out their unlawful purposes. This warning not having been heeded, on the 17th of October another proclamation was issued, suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in nine countiss in that State, and direction was given that within the counties so designated, per sons supposed, upon creditable informa tion, to be members of such unlawful combinations, should be arrested by the military forces of the United States and delivered to the Mar shal to be dealt with according to law. j Id two of said connties, York and Spar tanburg, many arrests have been made. At last accounts the number of persons | thus arrested was 168. Several hun ! ared, whose criminality was ascertained to be of an inferior degree, were released for the present These have generally made confessions of their guilt. Great caution has been exercised in making these arrests and notwithstanding this large number, it is believed that do in nocent person is now io custody. The prisoners will be held for regular trial id the judicial tribunals of the United States. As soon ^ it appeared that the au thorities of the United Statss were about to take vigorous measures to en force the law, many persons abscon ded and there ia good ground for sup posing that all sacb persons bare vio lated the lair. ? lull report of what has been done under the law will be submitted to Congress by the Attorney General. THE XOKJfOK 

QCESTIOX. In Utah there still remains a rem nant of barbarism, repugnant to civili zation and decency and the laws of the United States. Territorial officers, how ever, have been found who are willing to perform their duty in a spirit of equity and with a due sense of sustain ing the majesty of the law. Neither polygamy uor "any other rio'ation of existing statutes will be permitted with in the territory of the United States. It is not with the religion of the self-styled Saints that we are now dealing, but with their practices. The? will be protected in the worship of God according to the dictates of their consciences, but they will not be permitted to violate the laws under the cloak of religion. It may be advisable for Congress to con sider what in the execution of the laws Xinst polygamy is to be the status of ral wives and their offspring. The propriety of Congress passing an ena bling act authorizing the Territorial Legislature of Utah to legitimatize all born prior to a time fixed in the act, might be justified by its humanity to the innocent children. This is a sug gestion only, and not a recommenda tion. THE INDIAX rOLICT. The policy pursued toward the In dians had resulted favorably so far as can be judged from the limited time during which it has been in operation. Through the exertion of the various societies of Christians to whom has been entrusted the execution of the policy, and the Board of Commissioners au thorized by the law of April, 1869, many tribes of Indians have been in duced to settle on reservations, to culti vate the soil, to perform productive labor of various kinds and to partially accept civilization. They are being cared for in such a way that it ? is hoped may induce tho?e still pursuing their old habits of life to embrace the only opportunity which is left them to avoid extermina tion. I recommend liberal appropria tions to carry out the Indian peace policy, not only because it is humane, Christian-like and economical, but be cause it is right. I recommend to your favorable consideration also the policy of granting a territorial Government to the Indians of the Indian territory west of Missouri and south of Kansas, and in doing so every right guaranteed to the Iudians by treaty should be ob served Such a course might be the means of collecting most of the Indians now between the Missouri and the Pacific, and south of the British pos sessions, into one territory, or one State. The Secretary of the Interior has treated this subject at length, and I recommend to you his suggestions. THE PUBLIC LANDS. I renew ray recommendation that the public lands be regarded as a heritage to our children, to be disposed of onlv as required for the occupation of actual settlers. Those already granted have been in a great part disposed of in such a way as to secure access to the balance by the settler who may wi*h to avail himself of them, but caution should be exercised in attaining so desired an ob ject. The educational interest may well be served by the grant of the proceeds of the tale of public land to settlers. I do not wish to be understood as recom mending in the least dtgree a departure from what is being done by the general government for the encouragement of education. THE CEXSt'8. The report of the Secretary of the Interior submitted with this will give you information collected and prepared for publication in regard to the census taken during the year 1870. The oper ations of the Bureau of Elucation for the year, the Patent Office, Pension Office, State Office and Interior Bureau are submitted. The reports of the Com missioner of Agriculture gives the oper ations of his department for the year. As agriculture is the ground work of our prosperity, too much importance cannot be attached to the labors of the depart ment. It is in the hands of an aUe head with able assistants, all zealously devoted to introducing ir.to the agricul tural productions of the nation all useful productions adapted to ? any of the various climates and soils of our vast territory, and to g'ving all useful information as to the methods of cultivating the plants, cereals, and of other products adapted to particular localities. Quietly, but surely, the Agricultural Bureau is working a great material good, and if liberally supported, the more widely its influence will be extended, and the less dependent we shall be npon the products of foreign countries. The subject of compensa tions to heads of bureaus, and officials holding positions of responsihilitv and requiring ability and character to fill properly, is one to which your attention is invited. But few of these officials receive a compensation equal to the respectable support of a family, while their duties areeuch as to involve millions of interest, in private life, services demand compensation equal to the services rendered; a wise economy would dictate the same rule in the Government service. I have not given the estimates for the support of the Government for the ensuing year nor comparative estimates between expen ditures for the year just passed and the one just preceeding. because the figures are contained in the accompanying re ports or in those presented to Congress These estimates have my approval. REMOVAL OF POLITICAL DISABILITIES. More than six years have elapsed since the last hostile gun was fired between the armies then arrayed against each other, one for the perpe tuatioo, the other for the destruction of the Union. It may well be considered whether it is not now time that the dis- 1 abilities imposed by the Fourteenth Amendment should be removed. The amendment does not exclude from the ballot, but only imposes the disability to hold offices of certain classes. Where the purity of the ballot box is secure, the majority are sure to elect officers reflecting the views of the majority. I j do not see the advantage or propriety i of excluding men from office merely because they were before the rebellion j j of standing and character sufficient to be elected to positions requiring them to take an oath to support j the Constitution, and admitting to : eligibility those entertaining pre cisely the same views but of leas standing in their communities. It may be said that the former violated an oath while the latter did not have if in their power to do so. If they had taken this oath it cannot be doubted they would have broken it as did the former class of them. Are any great criminals distingniahed above all other* for the part they took in opposition to the Government? They might, in the ? ? judgment of Congress, be excluded from such an amnesty. The condi tion of the South is not each as all patriotic citizens could desire. It will be a happy condition of the country when the old citizens of these States will take an interest in pnblio affairs, promulgate their views honest ly vote for men to represent their views, and permit the same freedom of expression and the ballot to those entertaining different political convictions. TH* TERRITORY OF COLUMBIA. Under the provisions of an act ap proved February 21, 1871, a territorial government was organized in the Dis trict of Columbia. Its results have thus far fully realized the expectations ot its advocates. Under direction of territorial officers a system of improve ment has been inaugurated by means of which Washington is rapidly becoming a city worthy of the Nation's Capital. The citizens of the District have volun tarily taxed themselves to a large amount for the purpose of contributing to the advancement of the seat of gov ernment. I recommend a liberal appro priation from Congress in order that the Government may pay its just share of the expen?esof carrying out a judicious system of improvement. BT THE GREAT FIKB in Chicago the most important of the Government boildi.p in J""* ^ consumed. Those burned bad already squire on which the burned baddmgs stood, provided it can be purchasedata lair valuation, and provided the Legia lature of Illinois will paw a law author \z\n" its condemnation for Government purpose?; and also an appropriation ?f L much money as can properly beex nended toward the erection of new build intra during this fiscal year. rt,an? The number of immigrants ignorant of our laws and habits comng into our country annually has become so great and the impositions practiced upon them so numerous and flagrant ^bal}euf?*? Congress should take action for theu protection. It seems to me a fair sub ject of legislation by Congress. I can not now state as fully as I desire the nature of the complaints made by immi grants of the treatment they receive, but will endeavor to do so during the session of Congress, particularly if the subject should receive your attention. HONESTY AND EFFICIENCY. It has been the aim of the adminis tration to enforce honesty and efficiency in all public Offices, and every public servant who has violated the trust placed in him has been proceeded against with all the rigor of the law If bad men have secured places it has been the fault, of the system estab lihed by law, and the custom of making appointments; the fault of those who recommend for government positions persons not sufficiently well known to ibem personally, or who give 'et^frs endorsing the characters of office seekers, without a proper senee of the grave responsibility which such a course devolves upon them. Cml service reform, which can correct these abuses, is much desired. In mercantile pursuits, the business man who gives a letter of recommendation to a friend to enable him to obtain credit from a stranger, is regarded as morally respon sible for the integrity of his friend, and his ability to meet bis obligation. A reformation which could enforce this principle against all indorsers of per sons for public place would insure great caution in making recommenda tions. A salutary lesson has been taught the careless and the dishonest servants in the great number of prose cutions and convictions of the last two. years. It is gratifying to notice the favorable change which is taking place throughout the couutry in bringing to punishment those who have proved recreant to the trusts confided to them, and in elevating to public office none but those who possess the confidence of the hontst and virtu ouh who, it will always be found, com prise the majority of the community in which they live. In my message to Congress one year ago I urgently rec ommended reform in the civil service of the country. In conformity with that recommendation Congress, in the ninth section of ?n act making appro priations for sundry civil expenses of the government, and for other purposes, approved March 3, 18 1 1, the nec essary authority to the Executive to inaugurate civil lervice reform and placed upon him the responsibility of doing so. Under the authority of said law, I convened a board of gentlemen eminently qualified lor the work, to de vise rules and regulations to effect the needed reform. Their labow are not vet completed, but it It believed that they will succeed in devising a plan which can be adopted, to the great relief of the Executive, the Heads of Depart ments and the members of Congress, and which will redound to the true interests of the public service. At all events, the experiment shall have a lair trial CONCLUSION. I have thus hastily summed up the operations of tbeGovernmentduringthe last year and mad# such suggestions as occur to me to be proper for your con sideration. 1 submit them with a con fidence that your combined actions will be wise, statesmanlike, and for tbe best interests of tbe whole country. U. S. Grant, President Executive Mansion, Dec. 4, 1871.
