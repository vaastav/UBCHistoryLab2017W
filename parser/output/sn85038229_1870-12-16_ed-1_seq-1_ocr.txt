New and Wonderful Form of Diseas in Illinois Chicago, Dec. 4. The city of Elgin, some forty miles west of Chicago, is greatly excited by the appearance of a strange disease in that vicinity, the first known case of which terminated fatally on Friday. The facts are as sol lows: On Fri day week Mrs. C. W. Daniels, a lady twenty-two years or age, wno was married two years ago and gave birth to a child eleven months since, was prostrated by what seemed at first to be promonitory symptoms of typ hoid fever, she had not been very well for some time previous, bat nothing serious was" anticipated till Sunday, when she was compelled to take to bed and place herself nnder medical treatment. She complained of pains in her bones and soreness in her flesh. Nothing very unusual, however, was obseived till ounday morning, when the milk from her breast attracted attention by its dark color, it looking like the was tings of an ink bottle. Submitting the milk to microscopic examina tion, it was fonnd to contain im mense numbers of animalcule, of different sizes and 6bapes from any human parasite which the attending physician had ever seen or beard of. They seemed to be somewhat hexa gonal in form, and longer one ' way than the other. They did not seem to have any head, but were evidently alive, judging from the way in which they moved about. Their 6ize was estimated by the doctor as varying from the one hundred thousandth to the five hundred thousandth of an inch in diameter. The power of the microscope used varied from 150 to 800 diametres, the former po wer being required to make the insect visible. They were not trie- hinia, as the ISoctor was well acqua inted with that form of parasite, and this kind was much smaller and of an entirely different shape. Authorities were searched, but none of them gave any clue by which they could be identified, and the Doctor and those with whom he con sulted were compelled to believe that they had discovered a new species of humaa parasite. In the meantime the patient grew worse, suffered terribly, and complained of of soreness all over her body. Noth ing could be done to relieve her. She could not bear a bath, and could hardly bear to be .touched. She lingered in agony till Friday after- noon at one o'clock, when she died. There was some reason at first to believe the parasites were the pro duct of some disease of the breast, and were confined to that locality. The doctor determined to test the matter, and, anticipating her death, he was prepared to do so five min utes after life was extinct, ana wnue the body was still warm. He made an incision in the calf of the leg, and drawing the lancet, examined the moisture which covered it. ile found three of the parasites, only one of which was alive. They were similar in all respects to those found inthefiluid taken from the breast He then dissected the tibial arteries and muscles of the leg, including a small portion of the surrounding flesh. The muscle presented a granular appearance, as if covered with grains of sand. These grains the doctors assume were parasites. The investigations were conducted by Dr. Clark, assisted by Dr. Tyrell, and neither of them nor any of the faculty who have been asked their opinion are able to explain the pre sence of what they regard as para siticical phenomena. A further ex amination of the muscles will be mude, and it i3 expected that some liht will be shed upon what is now a "mystery. The physicians think that the parasites hastened the death, if they were not the immedi ate cause. While some of the typhoid remained to the end, they were aggiavated, the pains and sore ness and throbbing especially, and death came sooner and more sud denly than in cases of uumistakaole typhoid. The baby had been pining some time before the mother took 6ick, but as soon as he was weaned he recovered his health, and is now more robust than ever. He was not weaned till his mother' was confined tn her bed. The doctor reports that he examined the child's blood, whihh wa perfectly healthy. FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE COUNTRY. Report of the Treasury. TaiurusT Dsraanniirr, W&tHlVQTOH, .Tecomber 6, 1870. THE RATE OF GOLD. Sra; The floanoial oonditioa of tbe country has improved dnnni? tbe vast year. 1 be ev erage rate of gold for the year 1869 aa shown by weekly sales was 32 9-10 eentom premium, and for the first eleven months of tha year 1370 15 2 oer entnm cremium. indicating an improvement in the value of paper oarrency of about 17 par centum. THE PUBLIC DEBT. From the 1st dar of July. 1869. to the 30th ui sue, ioiu, inclusive, mm puoiro ueui, ae snowa by tbe warrant aooooat, was reauoea in the sum of $10,160,191,689. From the 1st day of December, 1H69, to the 30tb day of November, 1870, inclusive the red action was euv,z&l,40.68, as shown by the monthly statements under the last session of Con gress. THE BANKING SYSTEM. I respectfully recommend that aa armroDii: uon Da made and aatoonty given to issue new bills upon such paper aad ia such form as may be designated by tha Secretary of the Treasury. The ComntroUer of tha Currency. in his report of 1869, reee (amended tbe estab. usnmeat or any agency la the eity of Sew York, under tha eoatrolof the aakonaljbenlu, for th redemption of their issue. Tbe sub stance ei this reoosnaeadatiaa seems to me aot only proper, bat asnesssry. The expense should be boras fay the banks. Coupled with the reoommendatioa I take this oeo sioa to say that the banking- system of tha country appears to be well managed, and to auswer reasonably tbe purposes for which it was es tablished. It ia no doubt true that tbe Trea sury notes representing an equal amomunt of we pubuo aeot witnout interest are the meet economical for circulation by tha government, but it should be considered that the banking institutions of the country are the agenciea by which business is established and teetered. Upon the whole, the system of banking should be extended only for the purpose of meeting the demands of business; but when the de mands of business are argent, conosesions should be made, upon the ground that the prosperity of business is more important than the mere saving of the interest arising from the circulation of Treasury notes, excluding redepoeits. THE AMOUNT OF DEPOSITS. The amount of gold and silver deposited at the Mints and its several branches during tbe nut nacai year was 3U,4ua,78S 10. The coin age for the year was 124,636,011, and the value of tbe gold and silver bars stamped was f bv 748,852 91. I respectfully call tbe attention of Congress to a bill prepared in this department, ana suoautieu at mv last sessions, ana accom panying a report relative to tbe Mints and the coinage system of the country The bill was prepared with care. and has since been submitted to the criticisms of a larga number of practical and scientific men w&ose views cava been published by tbe authority of Congress. During the year sev eral Drancn mints ana assay omcea nave been visited and examined by Mr. Knox and Dr. Lifldermans ot the assay omoe in Boise Citv. Idaho. It is nearly completed and will require a small appropriation for the commencement of batineas. Provision should be made for the redemption of bronse and other tokens issued by the government. The report of the eora mission of mining statistics lor the year 1869 has been printed since the close of the session of July last, and that for the year 1870 will be made during tea wmter. THE FOREIGN TRADE. The continuance of the war appears to be a matter of national importance. The propor tion of American Tooaols engaged in the lor sign trade has not-increased relatively during the year, although there hen been aa actual increase of entries of American vessels at the porta of the United Staue amounting in the aggregate to 13U,UUO tone. Toe total tonage engaged in the loteign trade entered at all the ports of the United States has increased from 6,683,000 tons in 1869 to 6,967,000 tone in 1870, but the proportion of American tonnage remains as in low, at on per cent, w ltnout undertaking to specify the means by which it ia to be accomplished, I cannot over -state the importance ol such legislation aa will secure the revival of American commerce. ' REPORT OF THE LIGHTHOUSE BOARD. The report of the Lighthouse Board sets forth in detail the difficulties which have ari sen in that branch of the pnblie service from the operation of the filth section of the aot of July 12, 1870, making appiopriations for the legislative and executive expenses of the gov ernment for the year ending June 30, 1H7I. .Legislation ia asked for by tha board, and it teems to me to tie necessary. . THE REVENUE SERVICE. The report of the Superintendent of the Coast Survey gives a brief but satisfactory, statement oi the progress made daring the laai surveying year. On the first day ot October last, regulations were issued concerning the transuortaBou of merchandise from porta ot importaucn to osrtain otner porta in taa V ru led States withoat toe appnueaawnt or liqui dation of tha dutwa at tne port of arrival, agreeably to a prevjooa est, entitled, "An act to reduce the ioternei tax, aad for other pur- approved July 14, 1970. A copy ol us rogulauoas will be traaosniUad to Louree la mature cease. neiwgnuusoas are stringent, but wben railroad eoenpasuee akau nave given the i onus required, and importing marohanfe in tha interior eiuea snail have snada arrange ment lor the importation of goods upon tue basis of the act, 1 am sstisttad taat no serious difficulties will ansa either trom the railways. the merchants or the government, witnoui doubt the act increases the opportunity for the introduction of foreign goods in the country, in violation of the revenue law but the exami nation which ! hara given to the subject in the preparation ot the regulation leads me to think that the business ean be safely conduc ted; The appropriation for tha collection ol custom (revenue) under an act approved May 31, 1866, is at the rate of 200,00U annually, in addition to euch sums aa may be received irom lines, penalties, and for fixtures and from storage, cartage, drayage and labor. Expe rience has shown that this amount is inauf- ficient, and an additional appropnatien win be needed at each session ot Congress until the permanent appropriation is increased. I have instituted a supervision in the Treasury De partment over this branch of the expendv tures, and agents are employed investigating the expenses of the custom houses of ths coun try for the purpose of ascertaining whether a reduction in the number of employes and sala ries is practicable By this means some say ing will be effected, but it will in any event be impossible to reduce the expenses within the appropriation. From 1358 to 1866 the depart ment appropriation was at the rate of 13,600, 000 per annum, in addition to the receipts be fore enumerated as applicable to this branch of the service. From 18a6 to I860 inclusive, the total receipts from customs were about 1271,900,000, and the expenses of collection were $16,879,000, or at the rate of more than 1-2 per cent. The receipt for the year end ing June 30, 1870, were $194,538,374.44, and toe expenses $5 912,113.33, or not exceeding 3 1-2 per cent. From 1858 to 1560 the revenue collected did not exceed an average of $50, 000,000 per year, and the temptation of smug gling and iraua was muwi ioo uuw m . system of duties than it is at the present time. At the principle importing cities of the country it is necessary to employ a large force for the nrotection n of the wharves and water lines within or near such cities. It is also necessary to guard against smuggling, by the presence of several officers upon and around steamers and other vessels importing large quantities of goods, while engaged in discharging their cargoes. It is also apparent turn mo caton sive line ot the coast on the Atlsntie and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico, every where furnished opportunities lor tbe intro duction of goods in violation of the revenue laws requires the presence of a large number of skillful and trustworthy persona The ac quisition of Alaska and tbe establishment of interior porta of entry for the accomodation of business by railways and steamers on the Northern fronties, and materially to the ex- rsnse of collecting and guarding t ,e revenue, therefore respectfully recommend aa increase of the permanent appropriation for collecting tha revenue for customs to the amount of $2, 600,000 for each half a year from and after the SUtb day of June, 1370. At several of the im portant ports there are two appraisers, whose powers are equal. I recommend such an alteration of the law as will povide for one principal appraiser at each port who shall be tor the business of the ofBee. ! 

PUBLIC BUILDINGS. The treasury department has the eare of one hundred and ten public buildings that are completed and seventeen more that are in the course of creation, all of which had cost to the 13th of June last, $35,900,998 93. The .r,rTiriat.inn for the repair and preservation of these buildings for the current year is $15, 000. The sum is manifestly inadequate, being less than one-third of one per cent, unless large annual appropriations are made the buildings will rapidly deteriorate in value, and finally will need much larger repairs or the erection of new ones in their stead. With the Increase of population in the country ap propriations must be annually made for the erection oi post buii hwu mt uu public buildings. The present mode of in augurating these works seems tome unwise, knnmeriations are often Bade without eni&V laat iaiomauaa ajea tts ratjsci, It is true that when a proposition is introduced into Congress for the erection of public buildings, the,rubject ia referred to the Treasury Depart ment, and by the Secretary to the Supemsina Architect of the Treasury; but it is also tro that the Supervising arthitect has only gener al information on the subject, and in answer to a sudden sail, and without time for the preparation of plans and estimates, eanno: give a safe opinion as to the necessity or east ol tbe work. I respectfully recommend thai "'' wh" applications are made for th construction of public buildings, the first step Tufvlrw1 r"18" wU1 struct SI eaeur, Department to make careful inquiry "totbafeTf the work, and aUoto prepare estimate, to be la.d beiore Congrt While this being done and the work author ixed, it would seem to be wise in m.t f appropriation sufficient to meet the entir. oost, and then hold the department and th SoperrisiEg Architect resnnnnhi. ,.. .w. speedy completion of the building substantial ly upon the plans duly authorized by the esti mate. I am satisfied that much waata of nnk lio money occurs and much complaint on th part of citizens arises from the small appro priations which are made necessary from year to year. Aa inevitable consequence oi the policy is that public works are injured in tne pnicess oi construction, and expenses art largely increased. The Supervising Architaci oi tne i reaeary states m bis report that thi expenditure authorized by law for the cou struction of a post otfite in the city of Nea I on will be inadequate, nnlesa the cbaractei of the work is changed from the original de sign, it seems to be ant to tbe city of iea I orx, ror general and apparent reasons, aau ra consideration of the f aot that a most eligi ble site has been secured bv the eo-ODeraticm. ana, in soma aegTea at the expense ot tbt eity, that the bnudings should not only be s fire proof structure bat also of such a desigr. and workmanship ask to rank amoeff tha besi public buildings to the country.

At the present time there are tarantv-fom steamers and ten sailing vaaaula attacned u the revenue marine service, tha numtMT hav ing oeen reduced durmu tne vear hv tha aai. of two vessels.

They recommend that tna number ne reduced to thirty-two aun tne aggregate tonnage reduced trom 9,21 tons to 7,1 75 ions. They also state that it wih be practicable upon the proposed basis to re- duo the total number ot ouicers, pilots, petty Otlioers and men from 1,26b, the number then in service, to 1,061, and the actual axDenae m maintaining the system, not including the ap- yiiiiAwiu iui uie construction ot the new vessels, from $1,446,490 to LH3,t39, making a saving of more than bait a milium dollars m a year. The report ot tbe Commission is the result of a eareiul and comprehensive examin ation of the subject by oompeteut men, and while it is the present pupoae of the depart ment to aot upon it, I am ot the opinion thai it should receive legislative sanction. On the 9th ot July, 1869, 1 convened a board of exam iners, who were charged among other things, with tha examination ot the officers. The revenne marine board is oom posed of Captama Fsnnoe and Blicer, of the the revenue marine, and Captain Patterson ot the ooast survey. The examination has not yet been completed, as only a small number ot the otfioers coaiu oe detailed tor examination at the same tuns. One hundred and ten lieutenants have been examined. Ten first lieuteuanta, nine seeoua lieutenants and six third lieutenants were re ported tor removal, and have been removed.

At the last session the attention of Congree was called to the subject ot transferring Davids Island, at New Yora, from the War Departs meat to the Treasury Department for the es tablishment of a marine hospital. This rec ommendation is now reepectiully renewed. 

PUBLIC BUILDINGS. THE REVENUE MARINE SERVICE. THE SEAL FISHERIES. Tncamnlianeewiththsectof July 1st. 1870. in referenoe to the seal tUheries, proposals were is sued and bids received for the exalmuv right to the naileries tor tbe term of twenty years. Xne phras eology employed in the act warranted the inter- pretatioa tnat tue wuwav. was u oe awaraeo 10 the Alaska Commercial Company if che pioposhioa was ss lavorable to the government as that of any other party. Upon that basis the contract was awaraeo. to tea uwawr- v7 ui toe contract and of the papers connected therewith, will be transmitted to congress. About eightytix thous and seal skins have arrived at San Francisco, as ths roducl of the year 1D69, on which the owners nave paid one dollar each, as required by the sixth section of said act. SALARIES OF OFFICERS. T consider it my duty to call the attention of Congress to tbe inadequacy and inequality ol the laries ot the officers iu the Treasury Department aa fixed by law. The om -es recently eatabtiahed are supported by proper salaries, but the salaries attached to many of tnose errated at tbe organiza tion of the government arw insufficient. As a tem porary mauM "f alienating the admitted evilCoa reaa uas fiom time to time, and for many yenrs. made appiopriations to be used at tbe discretion of the Be- reiary lor aaaiuoiiv to tne salaries ol ol S an at the Department. In the nature ol tha eaa ibis is a dia reeabie duty for i he Secretary to per- lormana IS swau j iihm suacwry to tne parties ID terealea, and tbe result baa not the sanction of and support incident to a aystem of speciaad salaries estab-ubed by law. At tne present time, the sum of ti i ,300 is distributed by the oecretary in his dia raion. After a eareiul examination of the aub I think an additional appropriation not ex. oeeding 16,000 a year, wul be euiii'-ient to provide adequate salariea for te officers of the Treasury Department, rheact of ISM, la regard to the ex aminauon of cleraa, has been obseived by ihide nartttaent. and with beueacial results. It is worthv of consideration, however that it would not be wise to prvide for an ezaminauoa board. Ths mv iority oi whose meaibers sooald not be o&oers of the depart - ent to which the lerk is to be assigned in ease of sppoint"eiit and approval. This sye tem should also be extended to the principal eas tern nausea and revenue omcea of the country. Bv saoh an arrangement a detinue security would be taken for the cnaracter ana quantisations ox cieras a far as they can be asoertained or tested without actual service in the discharge of official duty. It la well understood, ho war- r, that no examination ean furnish s-curity that the person examined will prove satisfactory upon tnai, ana tnere should al ways be a speedy and easy method of removing such a person from office. 1 do not therefore, ao eept the idea that the tenure of omce for t he clerk, and employees in this departmeatahould be chang ed. Indeed, I beli.ve that the tenure of otce fur nishes the beet security which ihe people f tha onnntry can have and that the business of ths tovern-nent wul ne emnentiy ana properly per. formed. The work of the Treasury Department does not differ essentially from the business done ia tbe bartxinf honaes and merchants eoaatine; moms, and there is ao reason why the tenure of atBee should be permanent in one ease that doss Botasnlr with scual force in the others.

Oscratary a tks 1 ra.i IrtaanrT. Report the Secretary of the Interior. The annual report of Secretary Cox has been given to tha public in advance of the assembling of Con gress. This is doubtless owing to the Secretary having withdrawn from the Cabinet shortly before the time for submitting the reports of the de partment, alonij with the President's message. The report is brief, and relates mainly to the Indian affairs under the new rxUicv of General Grant, the public laws. nenRinnn. the. census and the Pacific railroads. In the matter of the Indi an service the Secretary rDorts an esf.im.tr.1 expenditure for the flam! CPQr cf $5,070,000 against an appropriation of $GJ50,000 showing a reduction of $1,080,000. The amount naid for ne.nfiinna ring ing the year, including the expenses of disbursements was $27,780,911.81, being $342,072,27 less than was ex pended for the same purpose last year. Of the census tha Secretnrv re ports that the preliminary report is now pi insing ana win appear during the early days of the next session of ijongress. it will bi limited to pop ulation solely, and will exhibit the population of each county in the United States, from 1790 to 1S70 in clusive. A comparative table of the population of all civil divisions less than counties, at each census from 18o0to 1870 inclusive, will also be given. The Secretary says of the Pacific Railways, that the Union Pacific rail road earned for the vear endinar June 30th, 1S70, $3,34o,371.09 and expended for the same period $5, 649,573.45, leavine as net ear-nino-a. $2,694,787 63. At that date the road was indebted to tha Ilnitrl States for bonds $27,236,512, and in terest thereon $1,602,157.98. The net earnings of the Central Pacifio railroad for the Bam A ntaris-w. were $2,527,960. The sUtiatic-a air. en by the Secretary show the rapid ij growing wealth and importance of that immense portion of the Uni ted states opened by these roads.
