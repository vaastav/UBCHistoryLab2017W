While Lawers In Bontne Case Argue a Point. "Washington, Dec 7. In the Bonine triad today counsel for the defense pre cipitated a lengthy argument over the right to ask an exDert witness certain hypothetical questions bearing on the hip wounds of Ay era. The court direct ed the jury to retire during the discus sion. The defense stated that It would endeavor to show by the witness. Dr. W. P. Carr, that the government's con tention that Ayers received his wound at long range, was wholly untenable from the very nature of the wound. The point was not settled when the noon re cess was taken.

An effort Is belnar made by the mem bers of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows lodges in Topeka to regain pos session and absolute control of the old Odd Fellows temple at No. 623 Quincy street. The temple was built over 15 years ago by the members of Shawnee lodge No. 1. The original cost of the property was in excess of $40,000. The lodge rais ed over $19,000 of this amount in cash at the time the temple was built, bor rowing the remainder from a wealthy eastern money lender, and giving the property as security. Being unable to raise the remainder of the cost of the building the mortgage was foreclosed, and the possession of the building pass ed to the easterner. The man who gain ed possession of the building is now dead. The heirs to the property of this man wishing to turn all the western property of the estate into cash are anxious to dispose of the property and have offered it for sale for 513,000: It is considered an excellent bargain, and T. H. Bain is working up the pro ject among the lodges of the city. An arrangement will undoubtedly be effect ed whereby the Odd Fellows will regain possession of the temple. A large number of lodge Items are unavoidably crowded out until Mon day. &1Q0RE GUILTY. Winfield Jury Says Murder in Second Degree. Winfield, Kas.. Dec 7.

The supreme court today afflrraed Judge Hazen's decision in both of the cases involving the taxes of the Knights and Ladies of Security, thereby decid ing against the order. The officers of the order claimed that the real estate of the order, which consists of the Se curity building on the corner of Sev enth street and Kansas avenue, is ex empt from taxation because the order is a benevolent one. The supreme court decided that it is not a benevolent or ganization within the meaning of the statute exempting the property of suen organizations from taxation. In an other suit the order claimed that its invested funds were also exempt from taxation on the same ground, but the supreme court held that in addition to being a benevolent organization, the in come from its invested funds must be used for the support of the organiza tion, while in this order the investment is applied towards the payment of death claims.

JTlY0 11 In using medicines to stop pain, we should avoid such as inflict injury on the system. Opium, morphine, chloroform, ether, cocaine and chloral stop pain by destroying the sense of perception, the patient losing the power of feeling. This is a most destructive practice: it masks the systems, shuts up. and. instead of re moving trouble, breaks down the stomach liver and bowels, and. if continued for a length of time, kills the nerves and pro duces local or general paralysis. There is no necessity for using these uncertain agents when a positive remedy like RAD WAT' S READY RELIEF will stop the moat excruciating pain quicker, without entailing the least danger, in either infant or adult. It instantly stops the most excruciating pains, allavs inflammation and cures con gestion, whether of the lungs, stomach, bowels or other glands or mucous mem branes. STOPS PAIN EXHIBIT OF RAKE CHINA. Ceramio Art Display Will Close Tonight The exhibit of rare hand decorated china which has been held by the Ceramic club of Topeka since Friday morning at the First Congregational church, will close at 6 o'clock this even ing. The ladies have just cause to feel elated over the outcome of the affair, as it waa a financial as well as an artistic success, and will form a sub stantial little stepping-stone for the Topeka club house. The entire lecture room and the small room at the west were devoted to the exhibit. Starting at the right of the entrance was a large table on which was arranged tho china belonging to Mrs. Edwin Lang anLSIrs. H. C. Bow man. It was composed of rare pieces, both large and small, of which the owners may well feel proud. Next in line was the exhibit of Miss Jean Wallace, which comprised some very handsome pieces deserving spe cial mention. Coming next was the table belonging to Mrs. W. C. Webb and Mrs. S. J. Hodgins.' A large vase on which was an exquisite picture of Queen Louise was one of the striking pieces on this table, though there were many others equally as fine. One of the- very attractive tables was that of Miss Marie Witwer. Several of the beautiful vases were filled with fragrant flowers, which showed them oft to good advantage. One of the pret tiest things was a thistle piece, which she did under Fry. One of the most beautiful pieces on Miss Elizabeth Smith's table, which came next, was a bon boa dish con taining a copy of Hoffman's head of Christ. Miss Anna Marie Walsh's table was effectively decorated In yellow and white, the club colors and contained a rare exhibit. One worthy of special mention was a rose decorated vase for which she received the prize at Hardin college. Mrs. W. S. Kale had one of the largest and most attractive exhibits; among the most noticeable features were several framed placques, one with seagulls and a bit of the ocean being specially beautiful. Mrs. Clement Smith's exhibit with its exquisite punch bowl, cups and tray, decorated with roses and grapes at tracted muc) attention. Mrs. W. H. Davis and Mrs. W. F. Schoeh, Miss Lina Zeis and Miss Helen Francis followed with very handsome exhibits. In the tiny room at the west was a complete dining room furnished by Mrs. Charles Jordan- The table was arranged with a dinner set decorated in green and gold, and the decorations were green and white, , to further carry out the color scheme. The sideboard and the china cabinet were' filled with exquisite bits of china: all of the china used in this room was the work of Mrs. Jordan. A china cabinet in the main room contained the handsome exhibit belong ing to Mrs. Howard Hillis. Several vases done last summer under Mason at Chautauqua were among the at tractive pieces. At one side Miss Kittie Lindsay had a very attractive display. Two large placques, one Egyptian dancers, and the other, an Empire scene, were very fine. A quaint piece was a small vase, in conventional design, which is very popular in Chicago and eastern cities. Miss Aline Lamy enjoys the distinc tion of being the only miniature painter in the club and her display was espe cially noticeable. Down the center of tha room was a row of tables; three belonged to Mrs. W. T. Eckert and were filled with rare pieces of all kinds, a fern decorated punch bowl and an enormous rose dec orated vase being among the most elab orate. Last, but not least was the exhibit of the president, Mrs. C. O. Knowles which contained many handsome ar ticles. Her jardinieres raneing In size from the very small to the other ex treme, and her punch bowl, tray ami cupa were among those deserving spe cial mention. The exhibit was the finest ever given by the club and those who did not at tend missed a rare treat. A
