2 GIVE REASONS FOR SEGREGATION SAN FRANCISCO BOARD MAKES STATEMENT •chool Authorities Declare They Will ! Keep Japanese Children In Sepa rate Schools, In Accordanca with the Treaty Hy Awsoßlnted Press. •SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 7.— The board, of education, through City At torney William 0. . Burke, this after noon submitted tp United States Dis trict Attorney Roßert T. Devlin a state ment 'Of facts bearing on the segrega tion ;of Japanese children In separate schools, which It Is planned to make the 'basis of the legal action that the federal, government' ls to take to test the legality of the state statute under which. the board of education made Its ruling. The statement of facts pre sented to Mr. Devlin sets forth all the facts and circumstances leading up to the segregation of the Japanese and Is in the nature of an ultimatum from the local authorities who declare their In tention ■< of enforcing It. •■ Mr. Devlin Stated 'that It would be necessary for him 'to personally verify the facts as Bet; forth, and said that on next Mon day he would be ready to state whether he ' could accept the statement as a basis for legal action^ Telegraphed to Washington The statement was Immediately tele graphed to Washington, where It Is ex pected that if? will be considered by Attorney Oeneral Moody. The Japa nese government, through its local consul, has collected a mass of data In connection with the attendance of Japanese school children In the schools 6f this ity, some of which is at var iance with the statistics of the boßrd of education. To avoid the necessity of threshing out an enormous mass of evidence from both sides In the courts, the government is endeavoring to set tle and agree with the local authorities upon certain facts which will be con- ceded by all parties. The complainant In the case Is to be a Japanese pupil of the age of 10 years who has been barred from the Redding primary school. The United States district attorney Mated his intention to submit the mat ter to the state supreme court. He would assign no reason for choosing this court instead of a federal court other than an intimation tbat he pre ferred to have the matter decided by the Judiciary of the state where It is in dispute. Statement of Facts SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 7.—Proceed ings to be begun in the state supreme court by United States District Attor ney Devlin, having for their object the setting aside of the resolutions of the board of education which pro vides for the segregation of the Jap- Snese attending: public schools, will c based on the following statement Of fact: "It Is hereby agreed that the fol lowing facts are true: "That the United Stateß entered into an agreement with the empire of Japan, which was concluded Novem ber 22, 1894, the ratification of which was advised by the senate with amendments February 5, 1895, and Ifrhich was ratified by the president of the Tlnited States February 15, 1895, that ratifications were exchanged March 21, 1895. and that the treaty was proclaimed March 21, 1895, which treaty is now in full force and effect. "Section 1662 of the political code of California provides as follows: Hower of Trustees I • "Trustees shall have thp. power to establish schools for Indian children j,nd for children of Mongolian and (phinese descent. When such separate Schools are established Indian, Chi nese or Mongolian children must not be admitted into any other school ex cept In kindergartens at the age of four." • ■.■ On October 11, 1906, the board of education of San Francisco adopted fhe following resolution: '.' "Resolved, that in accordance with article 1, section 1662, of the school ifiVt of California, principals are here by directed to send all Chinese, Jap anese and Korean children to the Oriental public schools on and after October 15, 1906." The document then stages that a separate school had been established for orientals which is conducted in all respects as are other public schools of the same grade; that trustworthy and competent teachers are In charge »nd that the same educational privi leges, rights and advantages are of fered the oriental children as are af forded the children of all other public schools.

JAPANESE CONSUL APPROVES IDEAS OF PRESIDENT By Associated press. SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 7.— ln nn in terview published in the Call today hearing on the reenmmendations made In his message by President Roosevelt on Japanese naturalization and on the segregation of their children In SChOOlli General K. Ilyeno, the consul for Jap anese here, says: "The sentiment In practically univer sal among the ten thousand Japanese in San Francisco that the recommenda tions made by the president constitute the most rational solution of American- Japanese problems yet attempted. The Japanese are not only pleased over the message, but they regard It ns one of the most noteworthy documents on in ternational questions that have been Is sued from the White House. "There is no question but that the bonds between Japan and tho United States would be considerably strength ened by conferring the pi vlleges of ft-anchise on the Japanese In Califor nia. There are some fifty odd thousand Japanese in the state, and while I am not In a position to say how many of these would take advantage of natural ization privileges I do think that the number would be comparatively large. I think this would be especially so in the case of the Japanese in San Fran cisco. "Many Japanese have family and property interests hero, and they would naturally regard San Francisco as their permanent home once they be lieved that they had the same priv ileges as other aliens. "Concerning the school segregation Ti lot Is being written and talked about it that is due to misconception of the facts in the case. I think that tho entire matter will be solved satisfac torily and that there is no occasion for believing otherwise. The Japanese are not striving for anything unreasonable and are quite willing to let the facts In the dispute guide whatever decision is to be ultimately rendered."

ANGELES HERAT,!): SATURDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 8, 1908. EXHUMED SKULL AGITATES BESOLD (nntlnnM from Vnmf Onf ) 1 never call a man names when he has the shackles on. Admitted Being a Gambler "We had one more conversation, In which he told me that he had played some kind of a gambling game regu larly on the liners between this coun try and Europe and had made several thousand dollars at the game. I In quired Into the game In case ho might give me a few pointers, having made a. pile like that, but he iald it was some German gam« which, when . ho ex plained It, I failed to understand." "You thought it was poker?" sug gested an attorney. "Yes," said the sheriff; "that's why I wanted to get a few pointers." The attorneys for Resold , then de manded that his property, Including two feather boas, be brought Into court, and Sheriff White was excused from the stand and with Deputy Gilbert went to the county Jail to secure the evidence. . . Autopsy Surgeon Testifies puiiiis; hi«i absence thr proaectitlon cjiiicii i>r. Oeorße Campbell, the autopsy surgeon. As Dr. Campbell walked t<i the stand he carried i satchel witii him which ho placed on a small table to the right of the witness stum! nnd directly in front nr the Judge's bench. The little table was so situated thai any objert plarM on- It would fnoe directly m ions thn attorneys' tnblp nnd straight i' lirsold, who occupied a seat within blx feet of it. "November 24 T was called upon to attend the exhuming of a body ait the Roselawn potters' field cemetery al Santa Monica." testified the surgeon. "At that time a rrnve there whs re opened nnd the remains of an under sized human being taken from it. The body had evidently been exposed a long time before burial nnd there wns pruc tii ally no flesh on It. most of what was there being mummified. At the direc tion of the officers I took off the head, or skull, the feot, the right elbow joint and some of the teeth. "In the skull I found ft bullet wound showing that a bullet had entered In the loft temporal region, making a trim little hole and had cSWie out on the rißht, of course making a somewhat larger hole as the bullet splintered through the bone." Besold Becomes Panic. Stricken Twice during the explanation Dr. Campbell had made a motion as though to open his satchel and both times as he did so Besold watched him closely. The accused man became nervous and his gaze wandered about the room any where but to that small satchel which remnlned so quietly on the table on a line with his eyes. At the corner of his mouth the lines hardened and hi 3 eyes became almost colorless, while the pupils began to dilate with the look of a man who la panic stricken and wants to run. "Have you that skull with you?" asked Attorney McComas, and Dr. Campbell reached over and snapped back the clasps of the satchel. So still were the dozen or more spectators In the room that the snap of the clasps sounded unnaturally loud In that dingy little court room. * As for Besold. he sat as one in a trance. His eyes were centered on the satchel as though he would consume It with a look, yet there was the dull expression of an Idiot on his face. Slowly and carefully the surgeon rummaged his hand in the satchel and then withdrew it. It held something. A something that caused a cold chill of terror to trickle up and down the, spines of those who saw it. A musky smell, that horrible smell of an old grrave permeated the atmosphere, chok ing and stifling and filling the nostrils and lungs of the attorneys. It was not the odor of decomposition; there was nothing human about that odor. It was the smell of a mummy, the terrible smell of a long dead body, preserved from absolute rot by nature and it spoke of old vaults and devasted graveß. Even Lawyers Are Affected Even the attorneys shuddered as they looked at the thing- in the doc tor's hand. It was a human skull, small and dull colored. The forehead was bare, the temples bare of skin and tho skull bone shone through. To the left and right of the temples were cav ities, one small round and neat like an auger hole, the other big 1 and round, with ragged edges. The eyu sockets still retained a thin gray covering of parchment-like skin, which broke just .over the deepest and centermotJt spot of each cavity, show ing the dark Interior of the skull and looking for all the world like spectral eyes. Where the nose had been there was a cavity, but from the base of that cavity extended a Rtrlp of mummified flesh which fluttered gently In the air currents -of the room. The back of the head still boro a thin covering of skin and two or three lone and solitary golden hairs protruded from that cov ering. Skull Stares Besoid in the Face With care for details Dr. Campbell turned the skull first one way then another and explained the course of tho bullet. And then he did a strange thing. Whether from accident or not he leaned forward and placed that hu man thing on the little table to his right. The stump of the neck rested on the table like a support. The dark sockets with the gray covering glared in Steady light across that narrow table, across the attorneys' table and straight into v pair of gray eyes on the Other sldo. But the eyes were no longer gray then. The gray had faded from them and they looked white In the poor light of the room. The man's hamls seemed to turn pi4k>le, the knuckles Shone white through the flesh. Not a muscle of his face moved as lie stared back ut the sightless .sockets of tin- (ace he had once loved of the face of the woman whom he was charged with having murdered, and like a mes sage from the grave, grim uml eurning, vindictive and terrible In its silence, tha,t skull grinned, the salute of a wife to lii i huaband. The hideous scrap of flesh over the lip waved in the air an though beckoning for a kiss, the jaws parted ever ao little, seemed pleading for a spectral caress, while the teeth, five of them, for the others had been removed, arranged alternately above and below like; the Haw teeth of a pumpkin head, seemed cackling tsume hellish amusement. Just once did the accused man look at the sight and In his eyes was the look of the maniac. The pupils con tracted till there was but a pin point of black, the neck seemed to stiffen like a wolf at bay and Just over the cheek bones the flesh turned a purple hue, but the man never moved a fea ture. His control was superb. Sits in Deathly Calm Not once <iiii he ln"k at the thing again aa i >r Campbell, like an attend ant banking flowers about a punch bowl, i to set off the ukull »ith iv, ■ mummlfted feet, twisted -nut horrid, still bearing i stock- Ings which had been drawn on on that morning, uml net ofl the whole by v brukt-u itiiiiiunt of uiui buiio uud cartilage and a few lonely teeth. One by one th« pieces of body were Identi fied, one by one examined, and all be fore the man sitting there, restless In action but deadly calm* Dr. Campbell was requested to re move the slump* of otocklnga from the feet, but ho demurred. That perform ance was too. much even for him and he told the court that the woman had been afflicted with tuberculosis and ho didn't Intend to further endanger him '-■lf by digging his nails Into the mum mified flesh. Woman's Effects Identified Then a suit cute was produced by Sheriff White Two WAtcheS, one a man's, the other a woman's, were Iden tified as ' Jewelry found on IV>sold at the time of his arrest. One, the small er, bore a single name. It was "Cladle." ' Nine rlngx, for the most part plated gold with cheap, flnahy settings, were produced. Many of them were women's rings which Resold had given his various iidmlror> only to take away again. The' suit case was explored and * white boa of fine ostrich feather tips and a costly spotted plume ostrich fenther produced. They were Identified as gifts formerly belonging to Mrs. llesold and later given a woman In Washington. / AA A great white plume whs next to be exhibited and It also was filed. Las) of nil Sheriff White drew n magnificent lavender boa from the case, It was seven feet In length with huge tufts of, lavender ostrich tips at either end. ltI It nlsn had been a gift to Mrs. Besold, brought from France. Its soft, feath ery folds had once encircled that small, white neck, caressed that soft, white cheek. Sheriff Causes Dramatic Scene ■ Sheriff. Whlto is a tall man and he stood very erect as he held the mass of feathery stuff aloft to the vision of "the court. He took a step forward so that Justice Young might better Bee it and as he did so one end of the stuff slipped from his hand and dropped, dropped like the colls of a rope, to ii small table below, where it circled and colled. The eyes of every man In the court room rested on the end of the boa In weird fascination; not the pnd the sheriff held in his hand, but the fallen end, for as though to greet a friend the lavender, feathery stuff again rested about Mrs. Besold's neck, about a withered, discolored stump of a neck. It again caressed those cheeks, those bony, fleshless cheeks, ajid the grim sockets and grinning jaws looked out over a rim of lavender beauty. It would have beon a good subject for a moralist, but Los Angeles court officers are not moralists and the boa was removed and filed as an exhibit. At 3 o'clock Besold was held without bail and went back to his cell. SAYS HE'LL SUICIDE FOR $50 Writes Doctor and Offers to Sell His Body to Get Money for a Friend Dr. J. W. Trueworthy has received a letter from a man signing himself "C. J. C." who makes the grewsome propo sition to commit suicide and sell the physician his body for the sum of $50. The man says his object in so disposing of his temporal self is to benefit a friend by giving him the money. Being doubtful that such extreme un selfishness exists In a mere mortal, the physician communicated with Post master Flint and the police department regarding the strang epistle. Prior to this the man had called at the general delivery window of the postofflce ask ing for a letter addressed to "C. J. C." but as letters are often addressed with initials nothing was thought of the matter. However, an effort will now be made to locate the strange author of the letter to Dr. Trueworthy.^ It Is the opinion of the physician and of the police that the man made the offer with the intention of commlting murder to obtain $50 for the body.
