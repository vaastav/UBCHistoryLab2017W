Ittf&wliijg ?f0istci. DAILY. tKI- WEEKLY, WEEKLY. *i V ? LEW1N BAKEB * CO. WEDXEMItAY, DECEMBER 7, 1*70. Thb two Governors of Alabama still go through the motions." Each of them sent a message to th*" Legislature the other day. The Senate won't act upon Lixdsay's 'and the House will have nothing to do with Smith's, and j no it goes. The President did not say anything about it iu his message to Congrep, though it properly comes un der the head of "operations of the army." ? j Tub friends of Secretary Cox, who was turned oat of the Cabinet for in augurating and persistently adhering to a plan of reform ia his branch, of the civil service, will be no little anms?d by the President s assumption of zeftl in that direction. He is a new convert and must be put upon probation. A \ery good way of demonstrating his earnestness and sincerity in the cause would be the dispensing with the ser vices of some of the numerous retinue of Dents and wite's cousins who are pensioned upon the people. Some idea of the dreadful carnage of the late civil war luay be inferred lroni the fact stated officially that the bodies of .'>12," 15 dead soldiers have been col lected and interred at national expense. In addition to th(*e there are many' thousands whose bodies were taken home and buried by their families, and .probably thousands more whose names swelled the list of the "missing" after the battle. It is scarcely an extrava gant estimate which places uj?on the | muster roll of the Federal dead 500,000 men. IIow much can be said for the generalship of the leader who lost more soldiers than his enemy commanded ? The carpet-baggers and negro major ity in the Late Georgia Legislature passed an act fixing the pay of mem bers of the Legislature at nine dollars a ?lay. The President of the Senate and Speaker of the House have twelve dol lar They have mileage, live dollars for every twenty miles This is one of the many ways in which the people of 1 he south have been robbed under the reconstruction acts. The per diem of members in the Northern States is from three to five dollars. ? ('?n^nnaii En quirer. But then the Enquirer should remem ber that the wear and tear of conscience necessarily incurred by a Radical mem ber of the late Georgia Legislature must be compensated for, and it should not torget the exhaustive qualify of the le gislation performed. You can't expect to get such enactments as the Georgia election law lor the beeararlv pittance of three dollars per day. The President nay* "the people of San Domingo are not capable of main raining themselves in their present con dition and must look tor outside sup port."' At the same time he portrays in glowing colors the salubrity of the cliiuate, the fertility of the so:l, and the immense commercial advantages of the location. If, under all these favorable circumstances, the people of San Do mingo cannot sustain themselves and must look for outside support, what does the United States want to do with -uch a race of paupers and parasites ? Have we not already a good sized ele phant on our hands to provide for in feeding the hungry blacks ? Is there to be another "Bureau " constructed ? If so, some more skillful cabinet maker than President Grant should be em ployed to do the job. This JSan Domin go business is too much of a "job for him The FiNhcrio*. We hardly know whether to thank Mr. Butler or Mr. Grant for the in formation given in the President's mes sage concerning the wretched state nnd miserable condition to which the Ameri can people have been reduced by the bloody -minded inhabitants of the Do minion of Canada. Our people never knew before the delivery of Mr. But ler's speech at Eo.-ton and the publi cation of the President's message, how sadly they have been abused by these same Cannucks ami how atrociously we have' been deprived of our cod ti-h We never had a realizing sense of our misery and were utterly unacquainted with the depths of wictchedness into which we had been plunged by the "blue noses on our northern border. The newspapers (ailed to inform us from time to time how our coat-tails had been trodden upon, and how indig nant we ought to be. We have heard something of "the Oyster War which has recently raged between Maryland and Virginia, and have seen a few para graphs about "a Duck War'' between the same high contending parties, but never, until Bcti.er and Grant informed us, did we hear of "the Cod-fish War'' which is to summon the nation to arms. We wonder if it is not just barely possible that there may be two sides to the fishery question, to which President Grant devotes so much of his message to Congress and concerning which his language is rather more tart than is usually employed in State paper*. Is there not softie possibility that the | V ankee skippers of those fishing smacks that have been Beized by the Canadian Government may have shrewdly "lost their reckoning" and gone toe e?06e to the Canadian shore, thus violating the treaty and becoming trespassers them selves. Knowing as the people df the United States generally do. how prone the average New England man is to re- ' g&rd everything as fish that comes into his net, the suspicion will arise that the ! 'hardy fisnerwen" of whom the fresi- 1 deot speaks, may not have been quite at careful at they might have been in calculating tbe three leagues from abort beyond which it was. lawful for them to entice the sportive cod. About fifty year* *go, tbe fisheries were the bane of the Americaa people. There was more time consumed and eloquence wasted over the matter than , all the cod fish iu the Atlantic ocean , are worth. They came near bringing ; about a war then, but a tre.ity was finally agreed upon, and the people de voutly hoped they had reached the end > ol" tbe business. Those who have read i the history of those times or glanced ? over the voluminous mass of "debates in Congress" relating to the fisheries, | will view with dismay the resurrection ; of the buried controversy. If it be1 found that some of the fishermen haw . lost their little smacks by tres- j passing in Canadian waters, let J a national subscription be taken i up to pay them off, and let j us get rid of the matter as quickly lie I j>ossible. If we could only pay the Canad:an8 enough to induce them to capture and keep Bitler we would : save money by the operation, and we j wouldn't mind paying a few cents extra . if they would also take charge of Grant. The organization, equipment ' and transportatiun of ten thousand soldiers, or one day of war, or one, week of non intercourse with Canada, would cost the United States more thun the value of all the tithing boats de stroyed, and more than would atone tor any insult to our national honor which has yet been received. General Aiunenty. We have looked in vain through the President's message to Congress for that recommendation of universal am i uesty which was so confidently predict i ed by the Washington correspondents. I The removal of political disabilities from thousands of the people is not once alluded to, and he even fails to congratulate the nation upon the fact that, in West Virginia and Missouri, the people have decided against pro scription and are about to inaugurate pence. Possibly the recollection of ! souie iittle interference of his own in Missouri may not he very pleasant, and lie has not had time to see Senator I ScaiRZ anl set the intended recom mendation of amnesty properly fixed. I up. But, it matters little what the Presi* dent may or may not recommend, or what the Congress may do or omit to (Jo in relation to political amnesty and the return of harmony and good feeling between those estranged by the war. ; There is a mightier power than the i President or the Cong re- s at work for i pacification 'l'he people are tired of I dissensions and divisions rtbich cripple their prosperity and embitter their lives, and they are moving together of their own accord. The sober second thought of all sensible men is averse to proscrip tion, persecution and eternal hate: and j it matters not how anxious politicians ; may be to perpetuate discord, for selfish : ends and the gratification of private pur poses, the people w ill not approve it any longer. Notwithstanding it hns not been recommended by the President, an act of Congress relieving all persons from |K>Iitioal disabilities incurred dur ing the war would cause almost uni versal gratification From tlio Groeu brier Independent.] Innny. "Have you heard the election news?' i said a proscribed Conservative the other I day to a venomous Kadical. "Yes,1 I wan the reply. "I learn things have i taken an oncommon turn 1" "But," he continued, "lor my part 1 never was in favor of diefrancliisin' people!" "lTow have you voted?' inquired our friend. "Oh, I always voted the Kadi I cal ticket, hut 1 ani mightily opposed to disfranchisin' ; I think all ought to ' vote, and I am aguine for that now!" j "Ah ! you are too late, my Radical j Iriend ; we don't need you now !" "How are you, Mr. A- ?" said an ' other of the proscribed to another Rad j ical bequet. "The Democratic-Con servative party has laid you Radicals out as cold as clay' "Yes, I hear there has been a most wonderful turn," replied the Kad , "but 1 was never very streenous; 1 always was for allow in' all to vote; never was streenous ? never was streenous!'' "Don t look so sad, said another to i oi, e well-known as a very "streenous Radical: "We are now in power, and we intend to allow all the privileges yon allowed us. The Rad's counte nenee grew still sadder as he said : | "Theu you won't allow us to vote any , more!' "Well, you could not complain j ot that, could you? Wouldn't that be giving you your own medicine? Ha ? man was hung on the gallows he erect ed for Mordecai, the dew, and God and [ and man approved it as a righteous ret i ribution.' "W-e-s! W-e-e-1, I suppose it was I right 1 and the Kad drew a breath all the way from the soles of his boots. "But, sir, continued our friend, "1 i made a mistaKe. If we were to treat ' you as meanly as you have treated ua.1 we would thereby prove as mean as you ? have been. We won't do that We will allow you all the privileges that we enjoy ourselves ? no less, no more, j j How will that do?" "That," replied the Radical, his countenance brightening; "That will' bejnetis; and 1 see now that that is, w hat we ought to have done. I'm in 1 favor of eich as that !" ; From the Richmond Whtg.l Intermit of the State Debt. 2 Talbot Court, Grack Church St., \ London, November 17, 1870. j j To the Editor of the Whig : Dear Sir: ? We are large holders oft ? the coupon six per cent bonds of the j j State of Virginia. Nothing has been i uiore unexpected than the delav of Vir- [ ginia to provide for the payment of in terest. It is within her means, and surely for her prosperity. If Virginia shon id show her readiness to act, j and would aot, by carrying into ef- , feet the funding measures recommended j by Governor Walker, she would soon find her reward, not only in a sens? of1 i honorable action, but in the immediate i advantage to all her material J interests. With regular pay- j ments resumed, the old -interest , 1 - 1 11 ' 1 funded and the necessary legit-la tion to secure Confidence, very sabn the flnaneei of the State would be so re stored that, if tome assistance should be required to accomplish needed finan cial objects, no difficulty would arise in negotiating a loan upon very reasonable terms in this market. The writer would not be afraid to guarantee assis tance to be rendered within on? year from the proper resumption of pay ments by Virginia. Such askance could be" had here on the conditions' named : but what can Virginia expect if she still continues to defer so simple a taealure Qf justice as the payment of interest upon money borrowed on her plighted faith ? The writer, never hav ing doubted theyooe/ faith of Virginia, only wonders the more at her unac countable delay. J. B. S. A* V<r. Another Accident. A few days ago a fearful as well as painful accident befel Mr. J. L. Crane, 1 son of Mr. W. H. H. Crane, who lives in the Meadows in Greenbrier county, it seems that the young man was out ' deer driving, and whilst standing on a log- he attempted to change the position of his gun, and in the act of doing so the hammer struck against the log, bursting the cap, thereby causing an ex plosion. The contents passed partially through his thigh, making a fearful hole, but, forttiuafely, none of the lead ing arteries were touched.

Eminent men of our country assert that tlierolsno remedy like MIS HLER'H HKRB BITTERS for disease* peculiar to persons of sedentary habit*. It has long been claimed and Is now an established fact that a combi nation of certain herbs, rootsand barks will cure their ills. Such a preparation Is MISHLERS HERB BITTERS, for it has never failed, and It still continues on Its tri umphant career. For all diseases arising from any Impurity of the blood, or derange ment of the digestive organs, including Liver Complaint, Coughs, Colds, Sick Heudache, General Debility, Dyspepsia, Ac., It Is now proved beyond all peradventure that no man, woman, or child, however pale and ematiated, can use MISHI ER*S HERB BITTERS regularly tor twenty-one days, without the return of the rosy cheeks and fair complexion, characteristic of good health.

To give relief to Pulmonary Consumption is oftentimes all that it sought for lit the ad ministration of remedies. We know of ex treme cases that have been cured? cures are not common, however, and perhaps for the reason that few persons believe in its cura bility, and allow their lungs to be consumed in a fatal misapprehension. That far gone cases of consumption have been cured by Dr. Kkyhkr'h Lcng Cork is hardly to be questioned, especially when persons who have been cured can be pointed out to any who choose to make the Inquiry of them. 1 These. cases arenear at hand In this city and ' within a short walk of the Doctor's office. The Doctor doubtless does not pretend to cure every case; nor does he claim that the lung core will always cure without his per sonal direction ; In many cases it will. In every case It will relieve, and It will surely cure the Incipient symptoms that lead to that dreadful scourge; In other words, it will cnre when application is made to it In time. The Incredulous will not squander much in in a bare trial either of time or money. The Doctor will exam lite your lung* if you will call on him at his ofllce, 167 IJberty street, Pittsburgh, Pa.

Habitual Constipation. HOW TO EFFECT A CERTAIN AND PER MANENT CURE. Some occupations of life predispose to Cofltivenem, especially those which allow but little exercise. Persons who contract this unfortunate habit of body, under such circumstances, might possibly be relieved by changing their sedentary employments for others of a more active kind ; but thta is by no means certain. Habitual constipa tion fc a very obstinate disorder. All the I ordinary so-called remedies invariably ag- ; gravatait. Nothing can be more injurious j than the continued nse of strong aperients. ! They at first irritate and Anally almost , paralyse the bowels? rendering them so torpid that enormous doses of cathartic medicines have 90 effect upon them. A 1 mild aperient, combined with a gentle stim ulant, Is the true remedy ; and a combina tion in the happiest proportion of these in gredients Is found in Hostetter's Btomach Bitters. This famous stomachic invigorates , the whole intestinal canal, while quietly I removing from its convolutions all impedl- 1 menta to a free passage through than. No mere purgative ha* tkU doable operation. No ordinary stimulent effects the desired object. Ones of Constipation abandoned m hopeless by distinguished medical men have been cared in a few week* by the Bitter*. To those who have tried all the medicines of the dispensary in vain, we say liy this lrre slstible stimulant and aperient. There ia no sufficient reason wby conatipation should lie the consequence of sedeutary habits. Hostettert Bitters, by supplying the vi#or which would otherwise be derived from ex ercise, will in all case* enable the system to perform lis excretory function regularly and healthftilly.
