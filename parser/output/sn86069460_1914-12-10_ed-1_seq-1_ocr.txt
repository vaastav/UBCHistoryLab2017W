Now I want the children to have a good time. Now let all take their fire works and go home and have their fun and not on any of the streets of the city. For as every one knows it is ery dangerous, not only to children themselves, but people with teams. Our friends and neighbors coming in from the country want some assurance that they may come to town without danger to themselves or teams. It makes a more kindly feeling between people to know that all feel considerate toward one another. I shall ask the City marshall to enforce the laws. So please keep off the streets to shoot your fire works. GEO. W.
