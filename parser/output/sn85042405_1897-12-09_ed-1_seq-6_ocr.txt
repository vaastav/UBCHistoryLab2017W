DROPS DETAILS Stated That the President'# Message Will Not Follow Precedent, lu That It Will Only Deal With Important Questions ot the Hour. Department Details Being ¥ett to the Reports of Cabinet Officers. WASHINGTON, Deo. 8 —The message of Psesident McKinley will be devoted practically to the subjects of oar for­ eign relations and the onrrenoy prob­ lem. It will be unique in the respect that it will ignore the great bulk of matters usually constituting the depart­ mental portions of the president's an­ nual message. There is scarcely a ref­ erence to the subject matter of the an­ nual reports of the cabinet, the presi­ dent's purpose being to call attention only to the more important affairs of the government. For this reason the postal savings project of the postmaster general is not discussed in the message. While the details of the currency plank are not definitely known, it can be authoritatively stated that it is in the main an incorporation of the views submitted by Secretary Gage, though as to details the president leaves him* self freedom of action by not taking any position with reference to several features of the secretary's plan while endorsing its main object. Hawaii and Cuba. A strong presentation of the Hawaiian question is made and congress is urged to take immediate action by ratification of the treaty of annexation. This part of the ,, message strongly depicts the necessity for making the island part of the domain of the United States and re­ views advantages that would accrue to the country by its possession. As to Cuba the message calls attention to the recent trend of affairs on the island, re­ fers to the scheme of autonomy just offered by Spain and, after reciting other developments in the situation, reaches the virtual conclusion that exist­ ing circumstances do not warrant inter­ ference in the affairs of the island. Considerable attention is paid to the question of reciprocity negotiations with various countries in Europe. Special Commissioner Kasson has been working on this subject for some time and the message deals with some of the developments of negotiations already had and expresses the hope of the ad minstration to secure satisfactory results in the future. The policy of the administration on this subject is outlined and, citing French champagnes as an illustration, the point is made that if special conces­ sions are given any foreign products the United States must be given equal treatment by reciprocal concessions. The Alaskan problem is discussed at aome length and a plea is made for con­ gressional legislation, including the ex­ tension of the operation of the public land laws, and the granting of rights of way for roads by which all parts of the country may be made more accessi­ ble.

CHICAGO, Dec. 3.—A special from Washington says: Representative Walker of Massachusetts, chairman of the house committee on banking and currency, was asked, after a visit with the president, what he thought of the prospects for onrrency legislation.

ONE WAY TO 

ECONOMIZE. Cangrnss May Skip the River and Harbor Appropriation This Session. WASHINGTON, Dec. 3. Chairman Cannon of the house committee on ap­ propriations was with the president for quite a time during the day discussing the subject of receipts and expendi­ tures. Mr. Cannon would say nothing as to the object of his visit, but re­ marked that it was very hard to cut ap­ propriations and that the greatest sav­ ing could be effected by not passing the river and harbor bill at this session. Many important works, he said, were under the contraot system and many others had money available tor work on them. The fortifications appropria­ tion, he thought, could be kept down also.

Lists of lands selected by the several states and territories under the grant for educational purposes aggregated 739,417 acres. At the close of the year there were pending railroad selections embracing 11,436,809 acres. An approximate estimate of the num­ ber of acres of public lands in the sev­ eral states and territories at the close of the fiscal year is as follows: Alabama, 532,339 Arizona, 54,400,211 Ar­ kansas, 3,P22,012 California, 43,841,04-1 Col­ orado, 40,037,204 Florida, 1.797.GG2: Idaho, 45,062,855 Kansas. 1.01G.5S9 Louisiana, 845, 020 Michigan, 322,431 Minnesota, 6,248,809 Mississippi, 441,220 Missouri, 497,761 Mon­ tana, 71,432,917 Nebraska, 10,669,353 Ne­ vada, 61,578,586 New Mexico, 56,983.047 North Dakota, 21.3S5.293: Oklahoma, 8,105. 238 Oregon, 35.S92.318: South Dakota, 13, 250,713 Utah, 44,205,070 "Washington, 17,958.

The figures above given do not include the vacant land embraced in military timber and In­ dian reservations, reservoir SITS, tr-AF* covered by selections, filings, railroad grants, etc. The mining industry reached its low­ est point during the past year, but is now on the increase. In view of the ex­ pected filing of man j- locationsjncident. to the opening- up of the Upper Yukon district the commissioner favors the establishment of another land district in Alaska. Noting the fact that nu­ merous mining syndicates are already in the field, competing for title to many individual locations made on the rich mineral discoveries in Alaska, it is rec­ ommended that the law be so amended as to prohibit the including of more than one lode claim or more than 100 acres of placer ground in a single appli­ cation or entry. At the present timber dealers yearly sweep vast quantities of timber from the public lands in the in­ terest of speculations without pay­ ing a dollar to the government, and conflagrations rage through the public forests without government effort to check destruction. The tim­ ber loss yearly from these sources, con­ servatively, runs up into the millions of dollars. It is impracticable to pro­ tect and administer the forests upon the public domain without provision for the maintenance of a full local force to supervise the timbered lands and ex­ ecute these laws. Among the recommendations are: For prompt action by congress to terminate the suspension of Arkansas land claims a change in the course of pro­ ceedings for the adjustment of mineral lands modification of the law impos­ ing penalties for depredation of public timber, and ample appropriations for protecting and administering existing and prospective forest reservations.
