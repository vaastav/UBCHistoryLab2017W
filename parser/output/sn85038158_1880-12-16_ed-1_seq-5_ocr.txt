mm IIILLSBORO, OHIO, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 1G, 1880. .? TO Mil The Annual Message Of the President of the United States, States, As Communicated to the Forty- Sixth Congress. Touching Upon Universal Suffrage, Universal Education, CIVIL SERVICE REFORM COMPETITIVE EXAMINATIONS, EXAMINATIONS, And Our Amicable Relations With Foreign Governments. Frlloir-Citizcns of (lie SmI; and House of H-frvimUatives: I congratulate you on the continued and increasing prosperity of our country. Ey the favor of Divine Providence we Lave been blessed, during tho past year with health, with abundant harvests, with profitable employment for all our people, and with contentment at home, aaid vf ith peace and friendship with ether nations. The occurrence of the t .ventX'-fourth election of Chief Magistrate lias afforded another op portunity to the people of the United states to exhibit to the world a significant example of the peaceful and safe transiuissl on of the power and authority of governtneiitfr. cn the public serv ants whose terms of ofiice a.ie alxnit to expire, to their newly chosen sucec- fr-ors. This exam ple can not fail to impress p4ofoundly thought ful people of other countries with the advan tages which Republican institutions afford. The immediate, general and cheerfid acquies cence of all good citizetus in tho result of the election, gives gratifying r.ssurance to our coun try, and to friends throughout the world, that a Government based on the free consent of an intelligent and patriotic people, possesses ele ment of strength, stal ihty, and permanency not found in any otherfoini of govsernnicnt. THE 

ELECTIVE FRANCHISE. Continued opposition to tin: full dud free en joyment of the rights of citi.tenshipr conferred upon the colored people by tj ie recent amend ments to the Constitution, st Si prevails in sev eral of the late slave-holding mat'-s. It has, per haps, not been manifested in fiie recent-election to any large extent in acts of violence or" intim idation. It has, however, by fraudulent? prac tices in connection with the ballots, wiiih the regulations as to the places anq manner of vot ing, and with counting, n turning, and crsivnss ing the votes cast, been successful in defeating the exercise of the right preservative) Of all rights, the right of suffrage, which the Coifcti tution expressly confers upon oor enfranchised citizens. It is the desire of tho good people of the whole country that sectionalism as a factor in our politics should disappear. Tfcey prefer that no section of the country shouhl be united in solid opposition to any other seefc in. Tho dis-por-itiuii to refine a prompt and hearty obedi ence to the equal-rights aiiie:nlments to the Constitution, is al that now stands in the way of a complete obliteration of sectional lines in our political contests. As long as either of these amendments is flagrantly violated or dis regarded, it is sa1fc to assume that the people who placed thejm in the Constitution, as embodying the legitimate results of the war for tiio Uieijn, and who believe them to be wise an 1 necessary, will continue to act togeth'T, and to insist that they shall be obeyed. The paramount question still is, as to the enjoyment of tho right ty every Ameri can citizen who has the requisite qualifications, to freely cast his voto and have it honestly counted. "With this question rightly settled, the country will be reii.vcd of the contentions of t'.ie past; bygones will indeed be bygones, f.n 1 political and party issues witu respect to economy and cnieieney of administration, in ternal improvements; tho tari.T, domestic tax ation, eduaction, finance and other important subjects, will then receive their full share of attention; but resistance to, and liuiluica- tion of, the results of the war togt ther in resolute purpose support all who niaizitaiu the of the Government and the of the Union, and who adequately the value of the victo- achieved. will unite for their authority perpi -titty appreciate This de- termination proceed Lan no hostile senti ment or feeling to anf past 01 the people of our country, or to any of their interests. The inviolability of the amendments rests Upon the . fiindam -ntal principle of our Government. ! Thev are the solemn expression of thte will of the people of the United Stales. ' ., ' l-v a in j i I I THE FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT. Ti:e sentiment that tho constitutional rights of all ourcuizeiis must be maintained, does not o n-.v weaker.

It is not. hovvev.-r. t i at and surest iju;i;a:ite 1- foi4 itten ti-r-.t the - of thu oimiary righu of citizenship is "to be found in that capacity 10. self-protection which can belong only to a peo ple whoso right to nuiver.-ai suffrage is sup ported by universal education. The means at tile command of the local and state authorities are, in many cases, wholly inadequate to fur nish fnc instruction to ail who need it. This is especially true w lu re, before emancipation, the education of tho peopie was neglected or prevrntod, in the interest of slavery. Firmly convinced that the subject of popular educa tion deserves the earnest attention of the peo ple of the whole country, with a view to wise and comprehensive action by the Government of tho United States. I respectfully rocnmmend that Congress, by suitable legislation and with proper safeguards, supplement the local educa tional funds in the several States where the grave duties and responsibilities of citizenship have been devolved on uneducated people, by devoting to the purpose grants of public lands, rud. if necessarv. by appropriations from the Treasury of the United States. Whatever Gov ernment can fairlv do to promote free popular education ought to be done. Wherever general education is found, peace, virtue, and social order prevail, and civil and religious liberty are secure. THE CIVIL SERVICE. In mv former annual messonges, I have asked the attention of Congress to the urgent neces sity of a relorniatiou of the civil service system of the Government. My views concerning the dangers of patronage, or appointments for personal or partisan considerations, have been strengthened by my observation and experience in the Executive "otlice, and I believe these dangers threaten the stabilitv of the Govern pient. Abuses so serious in their nature can not I permanently tolerated. They tend to become more alarming with the enlargement of administrative service, as the growth of the country in population increases the number of nrtieers ifuu placemen enipioyeu. The reasons are imperative, for the adoption of titr-d rules for the regulation of apiomt nients. promotions and removals, establishing uniform method, having exclusively in view iu everv instance, the attainment of the best qualifications for the position in question. Such a method alone is consistent with the enual rights of all citizens, and the most economical and efficient administration of the public business. 

COMPETITIVE EDUCATION. Competitive examinations, in aid of impar tial appointments and promotions, have been conducted for some years past iu several of the Executive Departments, and by my direction this st em has been adopted in the custom house's end postofiices of tho larger cities - of the country. In the City of New York over two thousand positions in the civU service have l,wn mibiect ill their appointments and tenure of place, to tho operation ,f published rules for I hid nurrtose. during the past two years. The results of these practical trials have been von- ontisfnetjirv. and have cunlirmeu mv opin ion in favor of this system of selection. Ail are subjected to ths same tests, and the result is free from prejudice by personal favor or par tisan in.lueiice. It secures I',r the position ap pikd for, the best qualification attainable among tiie competing applicants. It is an ef fectual protection from the pressure of impor tunity which, under any o'.hri- course pursued, l.-irgciv cxa-'ts the time and attention of ap pointing ollieei s. to their great detriment in (he discharge of other otueiul duties, preventing the abuse of the service for the mere further mice of private or party purposes, and leaving tlie" employ of the Government, freed from the obligations imposed by patronage, to depend aolelv noon medt for mention and advance ment, and with tins ec-usUnt incentive, exertion and improvement. These invaluable results have txw. tl'.a'.ned in a high degree in the ollices where the rules for appointment by competitive examination have Leon applied. A method which has no approved itself by experimental tests at Himts where such tests mav be fairly considered conclusive, should be extended to all subonlii.'.itc positions under the Government. I believe that a strong and gV'ing puhiic sentiment uetuaods immediate l.KWsiu-es for M'cp.ring au-1 enforcing ii,o high est possible efficiency ill the Civil Service, and its i,r. , Set i-in from reeoirnizod abuses, and that the experiene r. fern-u to has demonstrated the feaslliiitv of stvh Measures.

Ike true principles of govu-iiiiKutcm ihc'i-iihjcct of appointments tv) to two to and one that office, as stated in the National Conventions of the leading parties of the country, have again and again been approved by the American peo ple, and have not been called in question in any quarter. These authentic expressions of pub lic opinion npon this all-important subject, are the statement of principles that belong to the constitutional structure of the Government, It is therefore recommended that an act be passed detining the relations of members of Congress with respect to appointment to office by the President, and I also recommend that the provisions of Section 1,767, and of the sec tions following, of the Revised Statutes, com prising the tenure-of-oftice act of March 2, 1867, be repealed. Believing that to reform the system and methods of the civil service in our country is one of the highest and most imperative duties of statesmanship, and that it can be perma nently done only by the co-operation of the legislative and executive departments of the Government. I again commend the whole sub ject to your considerate attention. POLYGAMY. The Mormon sectarian organisation which upholds polvgamv has the whole power of mak ing and executing the local legislation of the Territory. By its control of the grand and petit juries, it possesses large influence over the administration of justice. Exercising, as the heads of this sect do, the local political power of the Territory, they are able to make effective their hostility to the law of Con gress on the subject of polvgamv, and, in fact. do prevent its enforcement. Polygamy will not be abolished if tho enforcement of the law de pends on those who practice and uphold the crime. It can only be suppressed dv taking way the political power of the sect which en courages and sustains it. It controls now one of our wealthiest and most populous Territo ries. It is extending steadily into other Terri tories. Wherever it goes it establishes polvg amv and sectarian political power. Religious iinerty ana tne separation oi unnrcn ana state are among the elementarv ideas of free insti tutions. To re-establish the interests and nrin- ciples which polygamy and Mormonism have imperiled, and to fully reopen to intelligent and virtuous immigrants of all creeds that part of our domain which has been, in a great de gree, ciosed to general immigration by intoler ant ana immoral lnsiuuuons, is recom mended that the Government of the Territory of U tan he reorganized. I recommend that Congress provide for the Government of Utah by a Governor and judges, or commissioners, appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate a government analogous to the Provisional Government estab lished for the Territory northwest of the Ohio, by the ordinance of 1787. If, however, it is deemed best to continue the existing form of local government, 1 recommend that the right to vote, hold oftice, and sit on juries in the Territory ot Ltah, be conhned to those who neither practice nor uphold polvgamv. If thor ough tueatitij-ps are adopted, it is beheved that within a lew years the' twig which now afflict b tah will be eraoicateo. FORTUNE BAY INJURIES. Our relations with all foreign countries have beeu those of undisturbed peace, and have pre sented no occasion lor concern as to tneir con tinued maintenance. Within a few weeks I have received a com munication from Her Majesty's Government. renewing the consideration pf the subject, bpti of tuo indemnity icr tue lnpiries at rortune Jlay, and of the interpretation of the treaty in wliich the previous correspondence had shown the two Governments to be at variance. Upon both these topics the disposition towards a friendly agreement is manifested by a recogni tion of our right to an indemnity for ths transaction at Fortune Bay, leaving the measure of ouch indemnity to further conference, and by a;i ioS.nt the view of this Government, presented in 'tlie pvtiviotis carfeupcindDnca, thaf the regulation of oontlioting interests of ths shore liohery of the Provincial sea coasts, and the vessel fishery of our fishermen, should b made the subject of conference and concurrent arrangement between the two Governments. OUR FOREIGN RELATIONS. Tup state of peace and tranquillity now en joyed by ail iir nations of the continent of Europe has its favorahls indueuvA upon ourrh; plomatic and commercial relations with them. ComiresB to consider means for the protection of industrial property has recently been in ses sion in Paris, t( which I have appointed the Ministers of tlie United States in France and Bc.h'i'iiu as delegates. The Internation Com mission upon ft'eiglite Stjd SleaBures also conr tinucB its work in Paris. I invite your atten tion to the neifssity of an appropriation to b made in time to enable this Government to comply with its obligations under the Metrical Convention.

During the lant summer several vessels be; longing to the merchant marine of this country, a : M- T,i;.. sailing lit ueucrui watui s 01 ilia n pii luumr, were bred at, boarded, and searched by anarmtia cruiser of the Spanish Government. The cir cumstances, as reported, involve not only a private injury to the persons concerned, but also seemed too little observant of the friendly relations existing for a century between this country and Spain. Tlie wrong was brought the attention of the bpanish Government in serious protest and remonstrance, and the matter is undergoing investigation by the royal authorities, with a view to such explanations or reparations as may be called for by tho facts. to be of in THE FLORIDA TREATY. The claims against the United States Florida Treaty with Spain were submitted Congress for its action at the late session, I again invite your attention to this long standing question, with a view to a filial dis positlou ol tho matter. OUR CHINESE RELATIONS. The provision made by Congress, at its last session, for tne expense of the commission which had been appointed to enter upon negotiations with the Imperial Government of China, on subjects of great interest to the rela tions of the two countries, enabled the Com mission..; to proceed at once upon their mis sion. The Imperial Government was prepared give prompt and respectful attention to the matters brought under negotiation, and the conferences proceeded with such rapidity and success that, on the 17th of November last, treaties were signed at Pekin, one relating the introduction of Chinese into this country one relating to commerce. Mr. Trescot, of the Commissioners, is now on his way home bringing the treaties, and it is expected they will be received in season to be laid before tiie Senate early in January. Our Mmistcr m J apaji lif.- negotiated ji con- It of of the ing our are the j vention for the recipical relief of the shipwrecked seamen. I take occasion to urge once more upon Congress the propriety of making pro vision for the erection of suitable tire-proof buildings at the Japanese Capital for the use of the American Legation, and the Court-hoUBe and Jad connected with it. The Japanese Government, with great generosity and courtesy, has offered for this purpose an eligi ble piece of land. In my last annual message I invited the at tention of Congress to the subject of the in demnity funds received some years ago from China and Japan. I renew the recommenda tion then made that whatever portion of these funds are dne to American citizens should be promptly paid, and the residue returned to the nations, respectively, to which they justly and equitably belong. 

REAFFIRMING THE "MONROE DOCTRINE" RESPECTING THE PANAMA CANAL SCHEME. The relations between this Government and that of the United States of Colombia have en gaged public attention during tne past year, mainly hv reason of the nroiect of an inter- oceanic canal across the Isthmus of Panama, to be built by private capital under a concession from the Colombian Government for that pur pose. The treaty obligations subsisting between the United States and Colombia, by which we enarantee the neutrautv of the transit ana the sovereignty and property of Colombia in the Isthmus, make it necessary that the conditions under which so stupendous a change in the region embraced in this guarantee should be effected transforming, as it wouid, this Isth mus, from a barrier between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, into a'gateway and thorough fare between them, for the navies and the mer chant ships of the world should receive the approval of this Government, as heme com patible with the discharge of these obligations on our part, and consistent with our interests as the principal commercial power, oi tne vv est- era Hemisphere. The views which I expressed m a special message to Congress in .March last, in relation to this project, I deem it my duty again to press npon your attention. Subse quent consideration has but confirmed the opin ion "that it is the right and duty of the United States to assert and maintain such provision and authority over any inter-oceanic canal acrosB the Isthmus that connects North and Bouth America as will protect our national in terest, SOUTH AMERICA DISTURBANCES. The war between the Republic of Chili on the one hand, and the allied Republics of Peru and Bolivia on the other, still continues. This Government has not felt called upon to inter fere in a contest that is witlnn the belligereu rights of the parties as independent States. We have, however, always heid ourselves it readiness to aid in accommodating their differ ence, and have at different times reminds both belligerents of our willingness to render such services. The relations of tlie United dai.ss with the Empire of lUaitil continue to be moot cor- dial. The internal disorders with which the Argen tine Republic has for some time past beeu af flicted, are understood to have beeu brought to a close. INTERNATIONAL SANITARY MEASURED. In pursuance of the act passed al tne In session of Congress, iuvitafi.v is have been ex tended tii foreign maritime Suites to join in i sanitary conference in Wasluc-ton. beinnin, the 1st of January. The acceptance of tois u, vitation by many prominent Powers gives pr-p ise of success iu this important measure, ... signed to establish a system of interna lion'- notification try wmcn tlie spread oi unectieit- or epidemic diseases inav be more eifeci.ve! checked or prevented. The attention of Con gress is invited to the necessary approprrati'':: act rtf lined t(. OUR POSTAL-COMMENCE FACILITIES. The prosperous energies of our domestic in dustries, and their immense production of tin subjects ot foreign commerce, invite, and evet require, an active development of the wish-: and interests of our people in that direction. Especially important is it that our commercial relations witn i,iie Avianiio anq j-acinc coasts oi South America, with the West Indies, and tin Gulf of Mexico should be direct, and not through the circuit of European systems, and should be camea on in our own bottoms, u full appreciation of the opportunities which our front on the Pacific Ocean p'.vts to com merce with Japan, China, and the East Indie, with Auatraha'aud. the Island groups whha ne along these routes of navigation, should in spire equal efforts to appropriate to our owu shipping, aaa to administer by ourown capita , due proportion oi tins traae. wnaiever moll ifications of our regulations of (rado and navi- c..uuu may be necessa,- er useful to meet and direct these impulses to the enlargement of our exchanges ana or our carrying trade, I am sure the wisdom of Congress will be ready to supply. One initial measure, however, seenis to me so clearly useful and emcieiit that I venture to press it upon your eamoafc attention. It seems to be very evident that the provision of regular steam-postal communica tion, by aid from Government, has been the forerunner of the commercial predominance of ureal untain on ail these coasts and seas, a greater share in whose trade U now the desire and the intent of our people. It is also mani fest that the efforts of other European nations contend with Great Britain for a share of this commerce, have been successful in propor- uou Yiiiu uieir aaopuon oi regular steam postal communication with the markets whose trade they sought Mexico and the States of South America are anxious to receive such postal communications with this country, and aid in their development, Similar co-operation may be looked for, in due time, from the Eastern nations and from Australia. It is diffi cult to see bow the lead in this movement can expected from private interests. In respect foreign postal commerce, quite as much as internal trade, communication seems neces sarily a matter of common and public adminis tration, and thus pertaining to government. I respectfully recommend to your prompt atten tion such just and efficient measures as may conduce to the development of our foreign com mercial exchanges and the building up of our carrying trade. FINANCIAL. The condition of the financial affairs of the Goverumcnt, as shown by the report of the Secretary of the Treasury, is very satisfactory. is believed that the present financial situation the United StateB, whether considered with resjiect to trade, currency, credit, growing wealth, or the extent and variety of our re sources, is more favorable than that of any other country of our time, and has never been surpassed by that of any country at any period its history. All our industries are thriving: rate of interest is low; new railroads are be constructed; a vast immigration is increas ing our population, capital and labor; new en terprises iu great number are in progress; and commercial relations with other countries improving. the ordinary revenues, from all sources, for fiscal year ended June ot), 13-t. were: FYoni customs 136,522,0ti4 60 From internal revenue... 124.009,373 92 J,01G,iX'6 CO From sales j)f jrabli land to the of re-cognized From tax on circulation and de posits of National Banks 7,014,971 41 From repayment of interest by Pacific Rail way Companies. . . 1,707,3G7 13 From sinking fund for Pacific Railway Companies 7S6,G21 22 From customs lees, lines, pen alties, etc. 1,143,300 16 From fees consular, letters patent, and lands 2,337,029 00 From proceeds of sales of Gov ernment property 282,616 50 From profits on coinage, etc... 2,7'J2,ld6 78 From revenues of the District of Columbia 1.309,469 70 From miscellaneous boutccs... 4,0tf9,6j3 88 Total ordinary receipts 5333,526,610 98 The ordinary expenditures for the same peri od were For civd expenses S 15,693.963 55 For foreign intercourse 1,211,490 58 For Indians 5,945,457 09 For pensions, including $19,341, 025.20 arrears of pensions 56,777,174 44 For the military establishment, in cluding river and harbor improve ments and arsenals 38,116,916 22 For the naval establishment, includ ing vessels, machinery aud im provements at navy-yards 13,536,984 74 For miscellaneous expenditures.in cluding public buildings, light houses and collecting the reve nue 34,535,691 00 For expenditures on account of the District of Columbia 3,272.384 63 For interest on the public debt. . . .95,757.575 11 For premium on bonds purchased. 2,795,320 4J Total ordinary expenditures.

The debt of the United States, less cash in the Treasury and exclusive of accruing interest, attained its maximum of $ 2.756,4ol,571.43 in August, 18bo, and has since that time been re duced to $l,8flti.U19,504.i;5. Of the principal of the debt, .tli)8,758,10O has been paid since March 1st, lSii, effectuig an annual savmg ot interest of 6.107,5a3. W ithin a short period over six ha:ldred mil lions of five and six per cent, bonds will be come redeemable. This presents a very favor able opportunity not only to further reduce the Drinci'jal of the debt but also to reduce -the' rate of interest on that which will remain unpaid. 

LEGAL-TENDER NOTES. Thf-re are still in existence, uncanceled, 6346,- 681.010 of United States legal-tender notes. These notes were authorized as a war measure, made necessary by the exigencies of the con flict iu w Inch the United States was then en gaged. The preservation of the nation's exis tence required, in the judgmeut of Congress, an issue of legal-tender paper money. That it Bervod well tne purpose lor which it was cre ated is not questioned, but the employment of the notes as paper money indefinitely, after the accomplishment of the object for wliich they were providtd. was not contemplated ,v the framers of the law under w hich they were is sued. These notes, long since became like any Other DeCUniarV Obligation nf thft l.ni-prrm.Vl a debt to bepaid. and, when paid, to be can celed as mere evidence of an indebtedness no longer existing. I, therefore, repeat what was said in the annual message of last year, that the retirement from circulation of United States notes, with tlie capacity of legal tender in pri vate contracts, is a step to be taken in onr pro gress toward a safe and stable currency, which should be accepted as the policy and "duty of the Government and the interest and security of the people.
