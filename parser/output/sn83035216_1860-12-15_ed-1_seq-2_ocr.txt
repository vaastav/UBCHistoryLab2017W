As an abstract proposition it mj be ed mittrd tht od valorem dutici would, In the ory, l tli niot Just end equal. Hut if the fiperienceof tbis and of all other com mercial nation has demonstrated that audi dotici canuot be esesed and collected without great fraud npon the revenue, then H la the part of wisdom to resort tosper-ific duties. Indeed, from the very nature or an ed valorem duty this mast be the result. Under It the inevitable coneqnenee I thnt foreign goods will be entered at loss than their tine value. The treasury will, there r ; o If be ci fore, loose the duty on the difference, be tween their real and fictitious taluo, oud to thi extent we are defrauded. Tbc temptations which ad valorem duties nrescnt to a dishonest importer are irresist ible. II i object to pass bis goods through the cns!om-house at the very lowest valua tion necessary to save tbcm from conQscn tion. In this he too often succeeds in spite or the vigilance of the revenue officer Hence the resort to false invoice one for the purchaser and the other for the custom bouse, and to other expedient to derrnud the Government. The honest importe produces his invoices to the collector, stat inr the actual price at which he pnrchnshed the articles abroad. Not so the dishonest importer end the agent of the mauufactnr r. And here it mat bo observed that i very larjre proportion of tho maVaetures imported from abroad - arc consigned for aale by commission merchant who are mure gents cinplojcd by the manufacturers. In such cases no acU1.1l Sule hns been made to Ex their value. The fortigu manu!octurcr, if be be dishonest, prepares an invoice of the good, uot at their actual value, but at the lowest rate necessary to escape detec tion. In this manner the dishonest impor ter and the foreign manufacturer enjoys a decided advantage over tho honest mer chant. They are thns enabled to undersell the fair trader, and drive bira from the mar ket. In fact, tire operation of thia system has already driven from the pursuits of honorable commerce many of that class of regular and conscientious merchants, whose character thronghout the world, is the pride of cor country. The remedy for these evils is to be found in specific duties : so far as tbis may be practica ble. Tbev dispense with any inquiry at the tnstotn-hoase into the actual cost or value of the article, and it pays the precise amount of doty previously fixed by law. Tbey present no temptations to the appraisers of foreign goods, who receive but small salaries, and might, by undervaluation in a few cases, reuder themselves independent. Besides, specific duties best conform to the requisition in the constitution that "no prefer ence abail be given by any regulation of com merce or reveoue to the ports of one state over those of another.' Under our ad valorem sys tem each preferences are to some extent inevita ble, Dd complaints have olteo been mude that the spirit of tbis provision bad been violated by slower appraisement of the same articles at one port man ai anoiner. Ao impression strangely enough prevails to losne extent, that specific duties are necessarily protective duties. Nothing can be more falla cious. Great Britain glories in free trade, and yet ber whole revenue from imports is at the present moment collected under a system of spe cific duties. It is a striking fact in this connec tion that, in the commercial treaty nf 23 J Janu ary, I860, between France arid hnglund, one of the article provides that the ad valorem duties which it imposes shall be converted into specific duties within six months from its date, and these are to be ascertained by making and average of the prices for six months previous to that time. The reverse of the proposition would be nearer the troth, because a much larger amouut of re venue would be collected by merely converting the ad valorem dutiea of a tarifJT into equivalent specific duties. To this extent tho revenue would be increased, and in the same proportion the specific doty might be diminished. Specific duties would secure tho American manufacturer the incidental protection to which be is fairly entitled under a revenue tariff, and to tbis surely no person would object . Tho framera of tbs existing tariff have gone further, and in liberal spirit have discriminated in favor of large and useful branches of our manufac tory s, not by raising tbe rale of duty upon the Importation of similar articles from abroad, but what is the same in effeot, by a luiiuing articles free of duty which enter, into the composition of tboir fabrics. Under tbe present system it has been often traly remarked that this incidental protec tion decreases when the manufacturer needs it most, and increases when be needs it least, aud constitute a sliding scale which always oper ates against bim. Tbe revenues of the country ere subject to similar fluctuation. Instead of approaching a steady standard as would be the ease under a system of specific duties, they sink and rise with the sinking and rising of prices of articles in foreign countries. It would not be difficult for Congress to arrange a system of Specific duties wbicb would afford additional sta bility both to our revenue an J our manufactures, and without injury or injustice to any interest of tbe country. This might be accomplished by ascertaining the average value of any given article for a aeries of years at the place of ex portation, and by simply converting the rale of ad vaUrtm duty upon it which mi:ht be deem ed necessary for revenue purposes, iuto the form of specific duty. Such so arrangement could not injure tbe consumer. If be should pays greater amount of duty one yt-ur, this would tie counterbalanced by a lesser amount the next, nod in the end the aggregate wuuld be the same. I desire to call your immediate attention to the nraaent condition "f the Treasury, so ably etamrim nrecpntd bv tho Secretary iu his report to Congress ; and to recommend, that measures be promptly adopted to enable it to discharge its pressing obligations. Tbe other recommendations ot the report are well worthy of your favorable consideration.

Tbe ncommendbtioas and suggestions which they contain are highly valo&bie ami deserve your careful atteut ion. The report of the Postmaster Genes aj details the circumstances under which Cornelius Van derbilt, on my request, agreed, in the month of Jaj last, to carry the ocean mails between our Atlantic and Pacific coast. Had be not thus acted, tbis important inter-communication must bave been suspended, at least fur a season. The Postmaster General had no power to make him oy other compensation than the postages on t&e nail matter wbicb be might carry.

Mr. Vauder tilt, io eomnttfidsble spirit, was willing to rely poo the justice of Congress to make up tbe 'deficiency; and I, therefore, recommend that an appropriation may be granted for tbis purpoaa.

JAMES BUCHANAN. Washington City, Dec. 3d, 1860. WEEKLY TELEGRAPH. ASHTABULA: SATURDAY MORNING, DECE'R. IS, 1860 New Secretary of the Treasury. Ex Got. Thomas of Maryland, now a the bend of the Talent Office, hns been ap pointed Socretory of the Treasury, tine Mr. Cobb, and hns accepted. CoNOttRss. The transactions in cither bon? of Congress hove not been of special interest, The passsgo of tho homestead bill, and the West Point and another minor appropriation bill, with the appointment of d federal salvat'on committee of one from a state, with Lorwin o this state, chairman, is about tbe bulk of the pro ceedings of a definite and positive nature. Mr, Hawkins, of Fla. having refused to servo on the committee, a great deal of regret coaxing, a soft solder was put into operation by Mr. Cocb' ran. of N. Y. to induce him to stand. Afte allowing full plsy to the generous flow of so licitude and concern, and appearing to grow teuder under the melting operation, the bouse voted not to excuso him, and than ho refused to act II ilk, in the Senate after the reading of the message characterized tho presidents want of statesmanship and manliness, and said that the logic of current events was submission or force, which awakened a little smartness, but soon died away. There hns been some bluster about secession, but tho tone of congress does not indicate a very great amount of alarm. Compromise is alluded to, bat the south as sume to care nothing for meanness of that kind, and the Republicans, nlthough some ap pear favorable, their conduct indicates that it m jlit bo like the casting of pearls before those animals we read of, into whom the devils en tered. Another consideration is, compromis iig is not populur among tho people. The day for such things they pertinently Acll us has gone bye. The north gains nothing by them, and the south cares not a straw for them, only so long as they are operative for good in its favor. If there is no faith in the south :f dismembermeut is determined upon, lutit come. It my as well be met now, as at any other time, The prospect is that S. Carolina will be suffered to play with this snperanuated and imbecile administration, to tho length of his tether, and the worst state of things possible, bequeathed to the new administration, to embarrass its inauguration. Senator Wade, it is said is preparing for a speech, which will be- a tolling one upon sc cession. Public attention is turned in that di rection, and the views it contains will be sought for with earncstne-s. Docglas is also preparing for a demonstration speech in the course of a few duj3. TnuRLOW Weed's compromise feeler, which it was said Mr. reward would back up, has vanished into thin air. II ow ia This ? We are informed by tele graph that a messenger has arrived at Wash ington from Sonth Carolina, bearing the elector al vote of the State for President for the next four yeaM, and the telegraph further informs us that the messenger 'drew his psy for his services ' Mors Brooklyn Tiif.oi.ogy. While in the Postoffieo (be other dny wo were informed that another batch of the Yas Dvkb, God and slave ry theolopy had been received, for, as we sup pose, Ashtabula consumption. Iu channel of communication is the .Vtt York Herald. A fitness of things is always pleasing. The Treasury is so hard up that it is feared that the $1,500,000 interest due Januaiy lot, in coin, will bave to be drawn directly from the Mint The members of Congress are taking certificates from tbe speaker and presenting them at the treasury for their pay and mileage, instead of waiting to receive it from the Seargent-at-arms. In one instance tho threat of protest had to be resorted to to bring down the need ful. Such is the colapsed sta'e of the treasury. The cointry now gathers nothing but the bit terest fruits for its blind adherauco to bogus Democracy. Mobbing. A meeting of Garrison abolition ists of mixed complexion am) sex, convened at Tremout Temple, Boston, on the 3d inst., to commemorate the death of John Brown. A- mong those, present were Redpotb, Wendell Phillips, Fred. Doughs, John Brown, jr., &c. lue meeting was outnumbered by the conserva- tives, who assembled too, and did succeed in breaking up the meeting. The indicotions were i-'flkieutly threatening to call out the police, and hold the military ia readiness for action. When these people were permitted in peace to meet annually and resolve that the constitution was a compact with bell, and voting was a sin against God, it proved bov harmless amusement, but if mob violence and perseoulion is to be revived, who knows to what Importance they short step between them and the Southern diso- lutionists. Tbe New Orleans True Delta charges that the so-called Vigilance Committee of that city who make it ao especial duty to bunt dowu wan, dering Abolitionists from tbe North, is bogus and tbst it consists of an irresponsible mob, who take advantage of the exeitement of tbe times to levy block mail oo respectable citizeur, Tbe Delta intimates that unless these "roughs" curb themselves a eoooter, baa file Vigilance Committee will be formed, which will deal about ss harshly with these black mailers as with tbe blaok Abolitionists. A Srsitcu it Ma.DoiGLAS.-Mr. Douglas Is preparing to address the Seuats oo tbe present emergency, and will take diatioet ground that secession, involves war aud all iu calamities, and that that fuel must bs confronted by tbs men who ara now precipitating tbe cotton states in revolution, lie thinks it wiser to face tbe whole Issue, and let tbe people see the eooae queuces, than tfl L!!pk it until the real crisis is epon ns. From the N. Y. Journal of Commerce. Abolitionism Rampant Everywhere, The Anti-Slavery agitation, since it connec tion with the politics of the country, has wax ed hot in certain ditdricta, to the exteut, even, driving ministers of the Gospel from their pulpits. Ity a letter from a most respectable soarce, we learn that this has been the case io Ohio. Tbe Rev. J. Mill Gillett, a faithful clergyman or the 1 resnytermu Lhurch, was worried out of Ms previous charge becnuso be troud not preack aeatnit the $in of eUivn v. from there lie went to Ashtabula, Uhio, and became pastor of a Presbyterian Church (New School) which ia represented as "a substantial and conservative people, but, by tho working and worrying of a few rampant, radicnl men, who sought to apply him to their political uses or drive him away, a "secession movement nas been made." Our correspondent speaks of Mr. Gillett as "u sound man of good tulenls, un doubted piety aud devotion to true gospel prin ciples." In this unholy war against the Church and the ministry, which hug been led on by such men as Theodora Parker, Garrison, Wendell Phillips, &c, the low politicul press is found sorootimca arrayed against the sober and earn' est preachers of the eospcl. It Is so in this case, as we are told that "one of the most active and violent iu this war upon Hev. Mr. Gillett is a wild Abolition editor of a paper in Ashta bula," one of those "fanatic Englishmen' des cribed by Kirwnn, who thus sets himself up as a judge of what a minister shall preach, und on what topics he shall discourse. The tendency of such a course can easily be foreseen, enibit teriog aociety and destroying the best interests ot a community, under a pretense of serving a righteous cuuso. Such men, while thry would seem most religiously devoted to freeing the blacks, are as eager to make t-laves of white men, and especially to hold the church aud the minis try in bondage. There is no tyranny in the land more shamo ful than this ; and these 'proposed lovers of free dom come, thus, to be the most crncl slave driv en. Arc there not some good men iu such places as tho one here referred to. who will stand up for the common rights of the ministry, while they insist ou the rights of the slave? Must all proper freedom in the church be tram pled uuder foot, under the guise of making tho Africans free T Observn, the case under notice is not that the minister baa preached politics offendinir a part of the concrecation by obtrud ing his political sentiments upon them from the pulpit. No 1 But that ho refuse to preach politics, refuses to join in the raillery and slaug of tho porty press. Observe, too, Satan does not say : "AH this will I give theo if thou wilt fall down and worship me." No 1 But "all this will I damage thee, to the very death, if thou wilt not Tall dowu and miuisicr to my par ty cause." We plcBd for the right of Mr. Gillett and of all such to keep out of Iho-dirt and strife of this arena; a we hope he will be sustained. L. Tbe immortal Sam Patch has the credit of giving utterance to the axiom, that "Some things ca.i be done as well as others." Tbe force of the proposition mny be seen in every day life. It is true intellectually as well as phy sically. What one feeble head cannot accom plish, two may undertake with fairer prospccU of success, illustrating at the same time, the truth of that othar adage, trite, but forcible, that "two heads are better than one, even tho' one be a leather head." The editor of the X. V. Journal of Commerce, in a mountain labor with somo old fogy friend of ours the editor finishing tho brains and the other the rancor have brought to bear upon us the foregoing fulmination. They have evidently acted upon the Patch maxim, and the fervency with which they Lave engaged in their work shows bow much confidence they reposed iu the maxim. Tho doctrine, however, admits of temporary failure, a;;d renewed eOlit, and if poradveuture, this well chosen effort should prove impotent and unsuccessful, the field is still open. Aud who cannot see that iu such a case, a more formidable conclave could be enlisted and brought iuto action, -and the combined energy, moral force and strutcgy of the N. Y. Herald and Olecrver, might bo added to that of the Journal, in finding some vulnerable poiut in the armor of this villago nchilles, where somo shaft more lucky than tho rest could be mado to penetrate. Tbe cause is an important one, aud the emergency great. The means should be adequate to the greatness of the end. A crca ture of such proportions, striding like a coios- s is over the heads of a whole community, ex ertiog all tho prerogatives of "the most crnel s'ace driver,' "trampling under foot all proper rights of the church," "silting himself up as t judge of what topics the sacred desk shall dis- Courte npon," "embittering society, and destroy ing tho best interests of community," and "damaging to the very death" oh ! Jehosaphat "those who will not minister to his party cause," is au incarnation of power and evil, that should uot be tolerated for a day. What folly to recommend, as the Journal does, "pleading fur the right," with such a despot. The tender mercies of 6uch a monster, is cruelty, and to sue for right, wonld be as ignoble unmanly, as unavailing. Fogydom should be more in earn est.. Nothing but extermination can bring peace and tranquility to a suffering people. The quad ruple alliance, therefore, if necessary, must be entered into, and if the complete establish ment of the doctrine we started with is not shown, and the desired end attained, it wi.l only be because the means for such an achieve ment bave not all been tried. There willte no reason for discouragement. ccriousiy. jo inese remarks, and in copy ing tho article they refer to, no disrespect will be charged, we apprehend, towards the gentle man whose name our cotcmporury bandies about with such indiccreet ofTJciousuess, and from whose obtrusively patrouiziug air, there is rea son to believe, his soul shrinks with mortifica tion. From such frieuds, he will, no doubt, secretly, if uot openly, pray to bo delivered. The Journal's vulor is of tbe most gallant description. Its homilies about "making slaves of white men," ore read with effect. It hag tho advantages of experience. To be Bure, that ex perience has been confined to a more limited sphere than that cow chosen. Heretofore it has been collected to confine its labors to its own establishment, find, the fact of that office having been built op from the unrequited toil ot ita operatives from the sweat and weariness of its uupaid white slaves, mode so by its grind ing avarice, gives especial fluency and reeling to iU admonitions in thia direction. If It has any surplus piety to bless the world with, common fame about New York would suggest its exer cise at ita owo door.

This will be tha last ? usee oa me csmei s baefc. The Speech of A. H. Stephens. Mr. Stephen delivered a speech on Secession the Georgia House or Representatives, oo the 4th or Nov. I860, from which we take the following extract : If the policy t.f Mr. Lincoln and hi re publican nssoi-intc shall be carried out, or attempted to be carried ont, no man in Georgia w ill be moro willing or rendy than myself, to defend onr right, Interest and honor at every hazard, and to the Inst ex tremity. (Applnnso. ) What is thi policy f It is, In the first place, to exclude us by en net of Congress from tho Territories with onr slave proper ty, llo is for using the power of. the Gen eral Government ngainst the extension of our institutions. Our position on this point is and ought to be, at all hazard, for per fect equality between all the States and the citi.c.is of all tho States in the Territories, tinder the Constitution of the United States. If Congress should cxerciso it power a gainst this, then I em for standing where Georgia planted herself in 1850. These were plain propositions which were then laid dowD in her celebrated Platform as suffi cient for the disruption of the Union if the occasion should ever come : on these Geor gia has declared that she will go out of the Union ; and for these she would be justified by the untions of the earth for so doing. I say tho some ; I said it then ; I soy it now, if Mr. Lincoln's policy should be car ried out. I have told you that I do not think his baro election sufficient cause; but if his policy should bo carried out in viola tion of any of the principles sei forth in the Georgia Pint form, thnt would be such an act of aggression which ought to be met as therein provided for. If his policy shall bo carried out in repealing or modifying the Fugitive Slave law, so as to weaken its efficacy, Georgia hns declared that sh will, in the instant resort, disrupt the ties of the Union, and I say so too. I stand upon the Georgia Platform, and npon every plonk, and sny if thoRe aggressions therein provid ed for take place, I say to you, and to the people of Georgia, keep your powder dry, and let your assailants then have lend if need be. (Applause.) I would wait for an net of aggression. This is my position. The policy of the Republican party is cer tainty to exclude slavery from the Territories by act of Congress, and Mr. Lincoln is pledged, by his acceptance of the Republioan Nomina tion, to carry ont these views, so far as he has It In his power to do so. Mr. Stephens is fully aware of these facts, and he might as well pro ceed to act now, in accordance with his treason able intentions, as to await any further develope- monts upon the subject. Theie may be a Re publican here and there scared out of his boots. at the crazy threats of the South, but we ex pect to see upon the slave question a bold and determined front upon the part of the Repuh" lienn party, in support of their Constitutional rights. S. Carolina. A letter published iu tho Tri bune from a correspondent at Charleston, shows that even in South Carolina there is a feeling of opposition to the headlong course of tho men who have olrcady;brought tbe state to the verge of ruin. It is cot probable that S. Carolina will be withheld from declaring her secession from tbc Uuion, but it is probabta that the fiual plunge will be delayed. Such is also said to be the tenor of advices received by Mr. Buchanan. In return for his exceeding kindness to the revo lutionists, they are said to promise not to at tack tho forts in tho harbor of Charleston, aud not to refuse tho payment of duties until the inauguration of President Lincoln. Mr. Botts has written a strong letter against Secession which takes the ground now more or less common, even in the south, that Virginia will submit to the constitution of tho U. States, rather than to South Carolina. Our country has incresed in sizo more than three-fold since the closo of the revolutionary war. The United States have a territorial ex tent nearly ten times as large as that of Great Britain and France combined. Tho American Republic is one-sixth less in extent than the area covered by tbe Cfty-nino empires, states and republics of Europe. The presidential electors for the several states chosen in Nouember, assembled each in their several state capitols on Wednesday, and formal ly cast their votes for president. Their records are dispatched to Washington by special mes sengers, and there opened before Congress on the 13th of February, and the grand result offi cially announced. Senator Latham of California impressively declared 00 Monday the fidelity to the Union of that state. She will remain a part of the pow er which can and will build the I'aciGc Railroad. This manifestation of the Senator forms a pret ty conclusive reply to the prophecies of an in dependent Pacific Confederacy of late ao cur rent among those who are anxious for tbe totul destruction of the preseut Federal Government. California and Oregon Retcbxs. The Pony Express, with San Francisco dates to Nov. 21st, reached Fort Kearney on tbe 2d inst. The election returns of California are not quite complete. The total vote returned is 117,815. Lincoln 38,646; Douglas 37,318; Breckinridge 33,357; Dell 8,467. Tbe vote or the state can not exoeed 118,500. Lincoln generally conced ed from 700 to 1000 plurality. Returns from all the counties in Oregon give Lincoln 318 maj. over Dreckiuridge. Douglas ia number three iu the race. Attornkv Gkn. Black in'a letter to the pre sident ou tbe right of secession, holds thut there is no legal way io which the territory of a state can be entered by armed Federal forces except io aid of the regular Federal officers io tbe state. Aud where these bave ceased to ex ist, and their place cannot be filled, Federal troops can bave no mission or place therein ex cept by invitation of the state author! .ies. The authority to enforce tho collection of the reven ue he asserts to be tbe unquestionable preroga tive of the Oeoeral Government, after secession ss.well as bofore, and nntil Congress shall remit its control over the established ports of entry In the seceding state. Tub Union a Nlisancic. The Grand Jury of Montgomery, Ala., have presentod the Union as a nuisance. Kansas Matt tag. We have received infor mation from tbe scene of the late troubles to the 7th lost. Large parties of troops from Fort Leavenworth bad moved to Mound City, There joiuing their force with one buudred and eighty aica from Fort Riley, attempts were made to arrest Jeuniaon, but neither Le nor Montgomery could be foand. - The rumors of Montgomery's entrenchment and resistance are simply absurd. The Inhabitants of Moond City snd vicinity were much excited, fearing harsh treatment from tbs Federal authorities. A Washington dlspatoh y Mmmediste ef forts will bs mado to pass Mr. Morrill's Tsriff bill, as tbe most effective mode of restoring con fidence; securing revenue, snd srrestiogthe pre sent panic. Without some such measure, tbs wheels of Government will be stopped.' t Sf.ckssior in LoiisiAiiA.-The Governor, In his message to the extra session of the Louisiana Legislature, exhorts calmness snd deliberation, llo says the election of Lincoln shows that the Northern mind is poisoned sgainst the South j that the wise counsels or our fathers are forgot ten, and the fraternal remonstrances or the south are disregarded. He recommends a Convention, and says Lou isiana ought not to refuse to meet her sister slavcholding states In council to demand, of tho North the repeal of the obnoxious legislation, and guarantees against future similar .measures Ho says these questions should be met before tbe inauguration of Lincoln, because the self- respect and honor of the State does not com port with her remaining under a Black Repub lican President, recommends the erection of a Military Board, and asks an appropriation of half a million dollars for the purchase of arms volunteer companies. The members are not disposed to act hastily, but favor preparation for any emergency. Disunion. The transfer of the disunion ngitation to Washington, for the most part withdraws attention from the disaffected states. The South Carolinians are less rampnrt than they were a fortnight ago, but profess to be equally determined, ond there is no remaining doubt that their con vention will havo declared the state out of the Union by the latter portion of the month. The government will be compelled to con sider tho state still in tbe Union and to proceed to collect the revenues and defend the port of Charleston ns usual. If South Carolinnns obstruct the legitimate action of the federal government, the government must perforce maintain its authority ond punish treason and rebellion. This, accord ing to the sound and sensible portion of the president's message, will not be coercing the state to remain in the Union, but merely compelling the rebellious portion of its citi zens, who ore equally citizens of the U. S. and cannot repudiate that relation so long as they remain on the soil, to iulGU the r constitutional obligations, or rather to per mit the officers of the generul government to fulfill their duties. The president has shown that seccession is an Impossibility, and that name is actnally revolution. Not withstanding his inopportune and pusillani mous twaddle about the want of power in the general government to coerce a seceding state, ho will bo compelled, the momont South Carolina takes any decisive action involing tho assumption that she ia actually out of the Union, either to resist it by the force at his command or openly and shame lessly to violate his oath of office. Neither South Carolina nor any other state can go out of the Liuoii without war, uuleas by previous general consent and peaceful ar- rangomtit of terms of separation between the seceding states and the rest. When this reasonable ond proper view of the matter is fully comprehended by the people of the bouth, they will see the ucccssity of restrain ing South Carolina from ony overt net in volving war. That state has gone too far to begin to deliberate on her own account. But if the other states w ill only come to tho resolution, cs they are likely to, to go out, if at all, peacefully and by general con sent, it will Lc the end of disunion, not only for this time but for future time. The Cit.cu Case Decided. This trial, which uttracted so much attention, has ter minated nguinst the opplicatiou of Rurch for divorce. The Jury was out about one hour and a hulf when they returned a verdict in favor of Mrs. Burcb. The verdict was received with demonstrations of enthusiasm. The counsl for the defense made a motion fo the custoday of the children and alimony. Court adjourned. The trial occupied nine teen days. The news wns received with preat rejoicings by the friends of Mrs. Bnrch. One hundred rockets were fired from the roof of the Tremoiit House, Chicago. Rook Mokkis Si Co., who have been bor ing for oil on the south side of the Mahon ing river, opposite Youngstown, struck a vein of suit water on Saturday last, three quarts of which produced, by boiling, a tea cup full of Gue salt. The company feel quite elated over the discovery, and mean to turn it to account.
