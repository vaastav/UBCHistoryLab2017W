OPERA "TRISTAN AND ISOLDE" HEARD HERE FOR FIRST TIME Wagner Taxes the Physical Power of Grau Singers. Salve's Farewell Takes Place To=Night. BTT BLANCHE'PARTINGTON. 1DID not take my, prayer-mat down to the opera-house last night to kneel and listen; thus to "Tristan and Isolde," as* Wagner's young adorers in the Fatherland used to listen to the new "Lohengrin/'- but I felt that-one would have come in handily during the evening. It is one of the world love poems, fitted to music of the most In timately beautiful sort, by the master mu elclan at of his power. .Wagner's genius finds here its most characteristic expression, its ripest, noblest form, and in all music there is nothing so unap proachably lovely as some of its divine measures. It Is an epic of the loves of the elemental man and woman, primitive, powerful, all-possessing, wedded to theme and harmony that paint the lovely story in all its -wealth of brilliant and subtle suggestion with miraculous power. It Is Hooded with color, dazzling and yet most delicate, odorous half-tones and scarlet otes of passion color dreamed, and the iash of the brown of earth. Strange chro natlc intervals dominate largely the mel odic scheme of "Tristan and Isolde," and \ \\ agner obtains thus the distinctive effect cf the music-drama. The characteristic themes are almost all of this elusive char acter, crystallizing the undertow of erne uon, not personifying action. The music orama is the eighth of the Wagnerlan se ries to be given here, four of the "Ring" cycle, "Die Fliegende Hollander," "Tann hauser, "Lohengrin" and "Die Meister singer the others, and it compares with the rest as "Romeo and Juliet" compares witn the other Shakespearean dramas, the love story incomparable. There was a poor house to greet "Tris tan and Isolde" last night. The cast, de spite its masculine strength, lacked on the feminine side, and 6O, despite the nov elty of the music drama, the crowd stayed away. Van Dyck was the Tristan, and was a stately and noble figure. He sang as Van Dyck has never sung here before, his voice holding. out to the last colossal requirement of the role. Again his pow erful dramatic faculty helped to make an unforgettable portrait of the knight, ana the whole measure of • Van Dyck's attainment here is of the largest; The scene when the love philter is • talten aboard the ship, with its Quivering or chestral accompaniment, was acted with splendid power; the love scene in the garden was filled in with an ardent and dignified grace, and the scene where Tris tan, dying, sees Isolde in a vision was a marvelous bit of work. Tristan is a long time dying— Van Dyck is credited •with thirty-nine minutes as against the conventional forty— but the singer holds the interest in a truly remarkable fash- Ion. He is a pretty great man. Louise Reuss-Belce we must be thankful for, as without her the opera could not have eeen heard here. She Is one of the few fingers who can attempt the tremendous ;ple % and really did some . surprisingly strong work last night; but the voice— £ard, strained, shrill— hurts the ear, and one can only surmise what it may have been once and regret that its day has gone. But she has undoubted power, lifts to a. fine climax and acts, if not always with fine art. at least with sincere and earnest intention. The effort of memory alone is immense, and altogether Reuss- Belee's work last' night is entitled to a sincere respect. Mr. Bispham's Kurvenal was another excellent portrait in the Bispham gallery, and his vibrant, sympathetic voice was a particularly valuable addition to the ef fect. De Reszke was Marke, and in noble voice and form. He was a. mag nificent picture as usual, -and delivered his epic of reproach to Tristan with a splendid strength and dignity. Louise Homer again showed what she can do, and more, what she some day is going to do In *he music drama as Brangene. She sang. with delightful sympathy and acted with considerable truth of inspiration. Damrosch conducted with acclamation, and others who added were Mr. Muhl mann as Melot- and j Mr. ' Reiss. whose clear, pleasant voice came in valuably in a shepherd's nart. Californians in New York.

POSTUM CEBEAL. LOOK IT UP. Perhaps Coffee Is the Cause of Your Trouble. Eating or drinking the wrong kind of food or beverage will set up disease - If persisted in. That is particularly true of the more starchy foods and coffee. The trouble may show in a variety of differ- ent ways., . . ' ." " It is safe to say that if one Is ailing in any part of the body reached by the nervous system, it would be of ad- vantage to euch a one to exchange cof- fee for Postum Food Coffee, and quit much use of white bread and take on Grape-Nuts Breakfast Food. A" New Tork man's experience is worth knowing. He says: "I was for a long time troubled with general weakness and loss of ambition, without knowing the cause. Always after eating I would find myself practically helpless, and when I reached home at night could only find re- lief after dinner by throwing myself on the. lounge and hardly speaking a dozen words to my family the entire evening, and as a last resort go to. bed. •'I could look back to the days when I was athletic and full of ambition, but what made the change I could not figure out. I lost eighteen pounds of flesh, and eeemed to be entering a chronic state of invalidism. » "One day my eye caught the argument in one of the advertisements of Postum . Food Coffee, and it occurred to me that perhaps coffee was getting In its work on me without my knowledge. At any rate I must do something, so I quit drink- ing coffee altogether and took on Postum, and also began the use of Grape-Nuts Breakfast Food. In a short time I- be- gan to enjoy life again; found myself run- ning upstairs two steps at a time, and a general return of energy, ambition and etrength. I not only regained my eight- een pounds, but put seven more on top of It. Now we always have Grape-Nuts and Ppstum each meaL The children drink the Food Coffee as well as wife and myself, and I will guarantee there is no ; healthier family in New York.— Phil. M. Farley, 180 Williams street, New York." TWOVOCAL STARS OF-THE GRAU GRAND OPERA COMPANY WHO SANG LEADING ROLES LAST EVENING IN WAGNER'S FAMOUS -..- COMPOSLTION,;"TRISTAN^UND ISOLDE." ...... i . - FOR the first time in this city Wagner's opera, "Tristan and Isolde," was heard last evening at the Grand Opera-house by an audience that was very small, considering the importance of the produc tion. Though the many vacant seats would ordinarily discourage the artists, those who sang last evening did so with re markable vigor and impressed the audi ence by the physical power they dis played. That which pleased the audience last night was not the music, but the man ner in which the singers were able to sustain the arduous troies. van Dyck, in the role of Tristan, was called upon in the last act to recount the story of his life, and did so for the space of thirty nine minutes. • • Reuss-Belce and Louise Homer, with Eispham, Muhlmann, Bars, Reiss and De Reszke, also figured in the cast and sang the difficult music as if it were an every-day occurrence. It was the'geneTal opinion, expressed in the lobby between..acts, that in "Tristan and Isolde" Wagner had eclipsed himself in the orchestration. The weird music produced by the orchestra under Dam rosch was listened to most carefully. There was no spontaneous applause in the middle of scenes, for the music of the opera is of the heaviest kind and most impressive. . _ \'rL<'li. The plot of the opera deals with the love of Tristan, a Cornish knight, for Isolde, a Princess of Ireland. He is act ing as her escort on the journey she Is making to Ireland to become the bride of King Mark, uncle of Tristan. Isolde loves Tristan and in despair at his coldness, due to a blood feud, she attempts to.poi son him and herself. Her . attendant changes the poisoned cup for one con taining a love potion. Tristan and Isolde drink the draught and declare their love. In the second act Isolde is the wife of King Mark, but holds meetings with Tristan. • Melot, a Jealous friend of Tris tan, betrays him to the King. The guilty ASKS INCREASE IN SALARIES Attorney General Says Judges Should Be Better Paid. : : WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 3.— The Attorney General's annual report to Con gress shows that there was an increase of thirty-one cases docketed during the year in the United States Supreme Court appellate docket and a decrease of three in the number disposed of, leaving 336 re maining on the docket at the close of the year. The number of cases actually con sidered by the court was 36S, of which 179 were argued orally and 152 submitted .on printed briefs. Of the 368 appellate cases disposed of 132 were affirmed, fifty-seven reversed, fifty-seven dismissed, twenty eight settled by the parties. The report shows that during the' year there -were 4641 United States prisoners eervlng ' sentences in penitentiaries ; » 1611 were discharged 'during, the year and 1650 were received; forty-one died and-sixty three were pardoned. Of this number re ceived 1378 were born In the United States and 278 were foreign-born; 1620 males and thirty females: 1171 could read and write; thirty-two could read only and 457 could neither read nor write. : The Attorney General urges an increase in the appropriation for; a new Depart ment of Justice building; suggests that Congress consider the advisability of adopting: a new and | uniform system of commutation with respect to Federal prisoners, and recommends that the sal aries of United States .Judges be in creased.

TAKES SMUGGLER OFF A STEAMER Doric Sails^ for Orient Without One of Her Chinese Crew. > Joseph Alexander and George Alexan der, arrested for smuggling silk caps and other dutiable articles off the steamer Doric, were taken before United States Court Commissioner Heacock yesterday morning and were released on $500 bonds. The Doric sailed yesterday minus 'Leong How, her sailmaker, who sold a lot of smuggled goods to the Alexanders. Leong is a member of th© crew and not entitled to land in the United States, and for that reason It was thought inadvisable to arrest him, lest complications should arise be cause of the provisions of the exclusion act, but it was finally decided that his being arrested for a violation of the rev enue laws of the United States would be proper as a protective measure, and on complaint of Customs Inspectors J. B. Peppin a warrant was issued by United States Court Commissioner Heacock for the sailmaker' s apprehension.

Budd, Phelan and Beale* May Remain Here to Ed joy the . Climate. / ■ -% •■ The Oregon Supreme Court holds that the primary election law of that State is constitutional. The law was enacted by the Oregon Legislature after the Supreme Court of this State had declared the Stratton ' primary law unconstitutional, and it differs but t little from the present primary election "law of. California. : It contains what Is known as the party tesi, or the provision which requires the voter to designate the party ballot. The poli tical bosses In this State who are schem ing to overthrow the present primary law contend that the so-called party test pro vision renders the act unconstitutional. They boast that our Supreme Court will declare the act invalid on the ground that it violates the secrecy of the ballot. .. Re cent activity of the bosses to get posses sion Of the County Committee' of San Francisco created the suspicion that a scheme had been hatched to assail the law, and p'ave the way for the appoint ment of delegates to the next Republican State Convention. In the light of the Ore gon decision touching the constitutional ity of an act similar to the California law there is good reason for predicting that the bosses and not the primary law will be knocked out if the case goes to our Supreme Court:'. Chinese Exclusion Settled. The Democrats, must bring forward a new Issue for the next campaign in" this State. The question of Chinese exclusion has been settled by President Roosevelt. A law prepared jointly by Mr. Powderly, Commissioner of Immigration, and the California delegation in Congress will be passed early in the session and secure the immediate approval of the chief exe cutive of the nation. The folly ol the chairman of the late Exclusion Convention in garbling the message wired by Representative Need ham is now obvious. Had the dispatch in its true form been presented a junket ing committee of live to visit Washing ton would not have been authorized. The delegates were led to believe that a bitter fight against exclusion was inevitable. Mr. Needham's telegram in its true test gave Just the contrary intelligence, but the assuring clause of his message was withheld from the convention. No Use for Junketers. As there is no opposition in Congress to exclusion of the coolie Chinese it will not be necessary for Geary's committee of four Democrats and one high toned Republican to proceed to the national cap ital at the expense of the public. Ex- Governor Budd may be delighted when he reflects that he will not be, obliged to neglect for even a day his arduous duties as attorney of the State Board of Har bor Commissioners. He can stay right Where he Is on the water front ana advise against the ravages of the teredo. Truxton Beale will not be constrained to l'orego the pleasure of life in Burlin game during the holidays. He can remain here in the fullest enjoyment of the Cali fornia climate with perfect assurance that Congress will legislate wisely. Mayor Phelan will not be oblieed to abandon his preparations for a foreign tour in order to assist the President of the United States and the members of the Sen ate and House of Representatives in deal ing with the important subject of foreign immigration. On his way to Europe, at his own expense, Mr. Pnelan may have the opportunity of visiting Washington, paying his respe'ets to President Roosevelt and congratulating the latter on the re enactment of exclusion. In bestowing credit where credit is due, the Mayor, of course, will not neglect Senators Bard and Perkins or Representatives .Loud, Need ham, Metcalf, Kahn, Woods.'Coombs and McLachlan. , • . The Souvenirs Remain. Members of the junketing committee; ap pointed by Mr. Geary have beautiful sou venirs of the promised expedition. Each commltteeman can place in a gilded frame the commission issued to him by Gov ernor Gage. In the future the commission will call to mind that Gage was Governor of the State. To preserve the hormonies the frame might be wrought and gilded to resemble a gold brick, and then if time should dim the signature of Gage, the sign of the brick would attest the genuine character of the souvenir." , ; .

POLICE COMPLIMENTED FOB, EFFICIENT SEBVICE Sergeant Gorman's Grand Opera ■Hack Squad Beceives Com mendation. Police Sergeant Gorman and his squad, who 'have had; charge of the carriages at the Grand Opera-house during the pres ent opera season, are being. complimented for the efficient manner in which they are handling the crowd.

The way in which the arrival 'and departure of carriages during the season at the Grand Opera has been handled Is deserving of more than passing notice.

There should be no halt in the "work of the institution,, in accordance with the plans which its secretary has pre sented, for the preservation of the vanishing races of great North American animals in the National Zoological Park. The urgent needs of the National Museum are recommended to the favorable consideration of the Congress. Perhaps the most i characteristic educational movement of the past fifty years is that which has created the modern public library and de veloped it Into broad and active service. There are now over five thousand public libraries in the United States, the product of this period. In addition to accumulating material, •■ they are also striving by organization, | by improve ment In method, -and by co-operation, to give greater efficiency to the material they hold, to make: it more widely useful, and by avoid ance of unnecessary duplication in process to reduce the cost of Its administration. In these efforts they, naturally look , for as sistance to the Federal library, which though still the Library of; Congress, and so entitle'!, is the one . national library of the United States. Already the largest single collection of books on the Western Hemisphere, and cer tain to ■ increase more rapidly than any other through purchase, exchange and . the operation of the copyright law, this -library has a unique opportunity to render to. the libraries of this country— to American scholarship— service of the highest importance..

For the sake of good administration,, sound economy and the advancement of science the Census Office as now constituted . should be made a permanent Government bureau.. This would insure better, cheaper and more satis factory we-rk, in -the interest not -only -of our business but of statistic, economic and. social science. ?« ' 

POSTAL SERVICE STILL EXPANDS Success of the Rural Free Delivery So Marked That the Demand for Extension Is Considered General and Urgent. The remarkable growth of the postal service Is shown in the fact that its revenues have doubled and its expenditures have nearly doubled within twelve years. Its progressive development compels constantly increasing outlay, but In this period of business energy and'prosperity Its receipts grow so much fas:er than its expenses . that the annual deficit has been steadily reduced from $11,411,779- in 1S37 to $3,923,727 in 1901. '. Among recent postal ad vances the success of rural free delivery wher ever established has .been so marked, and actual experience has made its benefits eo plain, that the demand for its extension is general and urgent. ' It is Just that the great agricultural popula tion should share in the . improvement of the service. The number of rural routes now in operation is 6009, practically all. established within three years, and there are 6000 applica tions awaiting action. It is expected that the number In operation at the close of the current ftecal year will reach 8600. The mall will then be daily carried to the doors of 5,700,000 of our people who have heretofore been dependent upon distant offices, and one-third of all that portion of the country which is adapted to It' will be covered by. this kind of service. The full measure of postal progress which might be realized has Ions been hampered and obstructed by the heavy burden imposed on the Government through the intrenched and well-underctood abuses which have, grown up in connection ■' wltH second-class j mail ■ matter. The extent of this burden appears when it is stated that' \ while . the second-class matter makes, nearly three-fifths of .the weight of all the mail, it paid for the last fiscal year only $4,294,445 "of the aggregate postal revenue of 5111,631,193. 'if the pound rate of postage, •which produces the large \ loss thus entailed, and which | was fixed by * Congress ■ with the purpose of encouraging the dissemination of public information, were limited to the legiti mate newspapers and 'periodicals actually con templated by the law, no just exception could be taken. That expense would be the recog nized and accepted cost of a liberal public policy deliberately adopted fcr a justifiable' end. But much of the matter which enjoys the priv ileged rate. is wholly outside of the intent of the law,' and has secured admission only through " an ' evasion of its requirements or through lax construction. The proportion of such wrongly included matter Is estimated by postal experts to be one-half of the whole vol ume of second-class mail: If it be only one third • or " one-quarter, the magnitude of the burden Is' apparent. The Postofflce Department has now undertaken to remove the abuses so far as is possible by a stricter application of the "law; and it should be sustained in Jts effort.'

After protracted conferences the plenipotentiaries of the several powers were able to sign a final protocol with the Chinese plenipotentiaries; on th» 7th of last September, setting forth the measures taken by China in compliance with the demands of the joint note, and expressing their satisfaction therewith.

States deep and heartfelt sor row, to which the Government gave full ex pression. When President McKlnley died our nation in turn received from every quarter, of the British empire . expressions .of grief., and sympathy no less sincere. The death of the Empress Dowager Frederick of Germany, also aroused the genuine sympathy of the American people; and this sympathy was cordially re ciprocated by Germany when the President waa assassinated. Indeed, from every quarter of. the civilized world we received, at the time of the President's death, assurances of such grief and regard aa to touch the hearts of our people. In the midst of our affliction we rev erently thank the Almighty that we are at peace with the nations of mankind, and we firmly intend that our policy shall be such, as to .'continue unbroken these international rela tions of mutual respect and good will.
