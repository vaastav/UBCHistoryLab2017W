The OldEstablished Paper. Offi cial paper of the County. .A.. I Miller, Editor and Proprietor. CURRENT TOPICS. E old powder magazine built by the Union forces, which stood on Maoi street in the edge of the old cemetery at Va., baa been torn down. This is the last of the works left from the war. The fortifications which were around the grounds now occupied by the megnifi cent buildings ot Central University have long since disappeared. at deficit in the sug.r-beet crop is reported as between 33 and 50 per cent, less this year than last. It will have an important bearing on the price of cane sugar, when it is remembered that beet sugar is identical with that of cane sug ar, and that the beet sugar manufacture covers about one-third of the sugar pro duct of the world. A PATRIARCH of tho forest has been lately felled in California, and the great er portion of the wood taken to San Francisco. It was known by the epithet of'Old Moses.' It one might infer with accuracy its age from the numoer ot its rings, it must have been 4,480 years old. Its capacity is said to have been so great that 300 persons could find room within its trunk. IT seems a fact that the great cattle feeding districts of the West, and especi ally of Illinois, raise less and less of the cattle they fatten year by year. Tne amount of corn raised increases steadily. On the other hand, the breeding of swine keeps pare more nearly with the produc tion of fat hogs. Would it not be a good plan to breed more and buy less, and be more profitable in the end. A N Eastern contemporary says. The beet-sugar question in Maine is now ap proaching a point when we shall proba bly know whether it can be manufactured and furnished at a price to compete with the imported article. We all know that sugar can readily bo made from beets, sorghum, cane, etc., but we have not yet seen that it can be made with sufficient profit Irom beets and sorghum to bring it into thecatalogu of national industries. THR Pekin Gazette is nearly twenty-five undred years old, and every now and hen an old man hobbles into the office and pays a year's subscription with the remark that he has teen a subscriber ever since the nrat number was printed. The clerk, without betraying any sur prise, observes, as he hands him a receipt, "Yes, we have several names on the list who hava been subscribers from the start." Then the old man goes out, muttering something about this world being full of liars. IT is said that the Emperor Alexander ot Russia has become a confirmed hypo tondriac He shuts himself up for days and can with difficulty be persuaded to take tood, which must be left at his chamber door He frequently burets in to tears,, and is afflicted with strange dreams.

In short, it is supposscd lie is mentally affected, and his long seclusion at Liva dia, it is believed, is to be devoted to a system of treatment which will either kill or cure A LEARNED German doctor,says aPar is paper, has discovered a means of dye ing the eyes of animals in general, and of man in particular, any color ho pleas es. He is accompanied on his travel tor speculation by a dog with a rose-colored eye, a cat with an orange-red eye, and a monkey with a chrome-yellow eye. But the most curious specimens of his art are a negro, with one eye black and the oth er blue, and a ncgress with one eye gold colored, and the other silver white. The doctor says the process of ocular trans formation, far from injuring the sight, strengthens and improves it. TnKRE IB startling news from Europe to the effect that the Russians are ad vancing upon Afghanistan. That Eng land is preparing for the conflict and that diplomatic negotiations are sup nosed to have almost been exhausted. The terrible business depression in Eng land may possibty be an integer in Eng land's present warlike attitude, and she may prove that she can again enter the arena as a first-class war power, a role that of late years has not been particular ly shown. The condition «f Europe since E Landon 1 ttne*' Geneva correspond ent states that a fisherman has found a very remarkable weapon near the lake vrolling of Locras, in the Lake of Brienz It is a double battle axe of pure copper, forty-two centimeters long, and weigh ing three kilogrammes. Massive and heavy in the middle, it broadens out gradually into two cutting edges, each having a width oi twelve centimeters. It has been added to the collection of Dr. Gross at Neuvevillc. Several similar weapons have been fouud in Denmark: but so far as is known, this is the first ot the kind discovered in Switzerland. The lake dwelling of Locras is* assigned by archaeologists to the age of stone. ^2Slsfei£ii5SS^fe» *#-«*«,* ii W W 4 A Th* NEWS OF THE WEEK.

The Titusville, Pa., Herald has pub lalied a post mortem statement of Andrew Tracy, the young lawyer who was hung at Simthport, McKee county, Pa., for the murder of his cousin, Miss Mary Reilly, in Sept 1878 The account makes four columns in the Herald, and is written in remarkably well chosen and chaste language, and in itself is intcieating. It was prepared during the lal] ter months of Tracy's incarceration at a great expenditure of time and labor, and perhaps few posthumous statements have ever ap peared in mere highly attractive form Tracy claims that the deed was not murder, but was instigated by his lntenre love for Miss Reilly, whom he says he could not bear to think of marrying another Their love, it seems, was mutual, but her objections to their marriage was their near blood relationship.

DR. THOMPSON gives the following ex amples ot what is meant by combustion. When a stone or brick is heated it under goes no change except an augmentation ot temperature, and when left to itself tt soons cools again and becomes as at first. But with combustible bodies the case is very different. When heated to a certain degree in the open atr they sud denly become much hotter of themselves, continue for a considerable time intense ly hot, sending out a copious stream of caloric ana light. This emission after a certain period begins to diminish, and at last ceases altogether. Tho combusti ble body has now undergone a complete change, it is converted into a snustance possessing very different properties, and no longer capable of combustion. and Richard Gilchrist, auglneer of one of the trains, was killed, and the fireman, name un known, was badly injured.
