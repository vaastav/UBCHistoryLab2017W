4 NO BACKWARD STEP IN WAR ON CROOKED CORPORATIONS Militant Slogan Sounded by President in His Message to Congress Would Enforce the Laws as to the Rich and Poor Alike Greater Elasticity in Currency Declared to Be Pressing Need MESSAGE. Washington, Dec. 3ln his message to congress President Roosevelt urges th© better regulation of corporations and the curtailment of the power to issue securities also that pooling be permitted. Ho also speaks for an clastic currency based on securities approved by the government. He favors an income tax, and a heavy one on smaller fortunes. Panics. in any large body of men, he says, there aie certain to be some who are dishonest, and if the conditions are such mat ureae men prosper or com mit their misdeeds with impunity, their example is a very evil thing for the community. Where these men are business men of great sagacity and of temperament both unscru pulous and reckless, and where the cc mil lions are such that they act without supervision or control and at fast without effective check from pub lic opinion, they delude many inno cent people into making investments or embarking in kinds of business that arereaiiy unsound. When the mis deeds of these successfully dishonest men are discovered, suffering conies not only upon them, but upon the in nocent men whom they have misled It Is a painful awakening, whenever it occurs; and, naturally, when it does occur those who suffer are apt to for get that the longer it was deferred the more painful it would be. In the effort to punish the guilty it is both wise and proper to endeavor so far as possible to minimize the distress of those who have been misled by the guilty. Yet it is not possible to re frain because of such distress from striving to put an end to the misdeeds that are the ultimate cause of the suffering, and, as a moans to this end, where possible to punish those responsible for them. There may bo honest differences of opinion as co many governmental policies; but surely there can be no such differ ences ns to the need of unflinching perseverance in the war against suc cessful dishonesty. Interstate Commerce. No small part of the trouble that wo have comes from carrying to aa extreme the national virtue of self reliance, of independence in initiative and action. it is wise to conserve this virtue and to provide for its full est exercise, compatible with seeing that liberty does not become a liberty to wrong others Unfortunately, this is the kind of liberty that the lack of all effective regulation inevitably breeds. Only the national govern ment can in thoroughgoing fashion ex ercise the needed control. This does not mean that there should be any extension of federal authority, for such authority already exists uuder the constitution in amplest form; but it does mean that there should be an extension oi federal activity. This is not advocating centralization. It is merely looking facts in the face, and realizing that centralization in busi ness has already come and can not be avoided or undone, and that the public at largo can only protect Itself from certain evil effects of this busi ness centralization by providing bet ter methods for tile exercise of con trol through the authority already cen tralized in the national govt rnment Ly the constitution itself. The Railways. The most vnat need is m connection with, uie ranrouds. As to uiese, in my juugmeni there snouiJ now be t-anei u national incorporation act or a law licensing railway companies to engage m interstate commerce upon certain conditions. The Jaw should ue so trained as to give to the inter state ccmmerce commission power to pass upon the future issue of securi ties, wmle ample means should he proviaed to enable the commission, whenever in its judgment it is neces sary, to make a physical valuation of any railroad. Railroads should be given power to enter into agreements, subject to these agreements being made public in minute detail and to the consent of the interstate com merce commission being first obtained. Until the national government as sumes proper control of interstate commerce, in the exercise of the auth ority it a ready possesses, it will be im possible either to give to or to get from the railroads full justice. The rail roads and all o:he ' great corporations will do well to recognize that this control must cone; the only question is as to what governmental body can most wisely exeicise It There should bo additional legislation looking to the proper control of the great business concerns engaged In interstate business, this control to be exercised for their own benefit and prosperity no less than f or the pro* co tton of investors and of the general 1 übllc. Experience. has definitely ihowQ not merely the unwisdom but the tutility of endeavoring to put a slop to all business combinations. Corporation and labor union alike have come to stay. Each If properly managed is a source of good and not cvlL Whenever In cither there !s evil. H should b promptly held to ac count; but It should receive hearty encouragement so long as it is prop erly managed. The anti trust law should not be re pealed but it should be made both more efficient and more in harmony with actual conditions. It should be so amended as to forbid only the kind oi combination which does harm to the general public, such amendment to be accompan’ed by, or to be an inciden of, 9 grant of supervisory power to the government over these big con cerns engaged in interstate business. This should be accompanied by pro vision for the compulsory publication of accounts and the subjection Ox books and papers to the inspection oi the government officials. Combinations O. K.’d. The government must now submit to irksome and repeated delay before obtaining a final decision of the courts upon proceedings instituted, and even a favorable decree may mean an empty victory. Moreover, to attempt to control these corporations by law suits means to impose upon both the department of justice and the courts an impossible burden; it is not feas ible to carry on more than a limited number of such suits. Such a law to ho really effective must of course no administered by an executive body, and not merely by means of lawsuits. Among the points to be aimed at should bo the prohibition of unhealthy competition, such as by rendering service at an actual loss for the pur pose of crushing out competition, the prevention of inflation of capital, and the prohibition of a corporation’s mak ing exclusive trade with itself a con dition of having any trade with itself. Reasonable agreements between, or combinations of, corporations should be permitted, provided they are first submitted to and approved by some appropriate government body. The congress has the power to char ter corporations to engage in inter state and foreign commerce, and a general law can be enacted under the provisions of which existing corpora tions could he created. Ample, safe and speedy transporta tion facilities are even more neces sary than cheap transportation. There fore, there is need for the investment of money which will provide for all these things wihile at the same time securing as far as is possible better wages and shorter hours for their em ployes. Therefore, while there must be just and reasonable regulation oi rates, we should be the first to pro test against any arbitrary and un thinking movement to cut them down without the fullest and most careful consideration of all interests con cerned and of the actual needs of the situation. Only a special body of rnen acting for the national government under authority conferred upon it ay the congress is competent to pass judgment ou such a matter. The Currency. We need a greater elasticity in our currensy; prov.ded, of course, that we recognize the even greater ueeu of a safe and secure currency. There must always be the most rigid exam ination of the national authorities, provision should be made for an emer gency currency. The emergency issue should, of course, be made with an effective guaranty, and upou condi tions carefully prescribed by the gov ernment. Such emergency ,ssue must be based on adequate securities ap proved by the government, and must be issued uuder a heavy tax. This would permit currency being issueu when the demand for it was urgent, while securing its retirement when the demand fell off. It is worth inves tigating to determine whether officers and directors of national banks shoula ever be allowed to loan to themselves. Trust companies should be subject to the same supervision as banks; leg islation to this effect should be en acted for the District of Columbia ana territor.es. Yet we must also remember that even the wisest legislation on the sub ject can only accomplish a certain amount. No legislation can by any possibility guarantee the business community against the results oi speculative folly any more than it can guarantee an individual against the results of his extravagance. Revenue. The Income of the nation is in a most satisfactory condition. For the six fiscal years ending with the firs, of July last, the total expenditures ana revenues of the national government exclusive of the postal revenues ana expenditures, were, in round numbers, revenues, $3,465,000,000 and expendi tures. $3,275,000,000. The net excess of income over expenditures including in the latter the titty millions expend-1 ed for the Panama canal, was one hundred and ninety million dollars for the six years, an average o# about thirty-one millions a year. This repre-, sents an approximation between in ■ coma and outgo which it would be ha~d to improve. ; Th* Tariff. It Is probably well that every dozen 

IOWA COUNTY DEMOCRAT, MINERAL POINT, WIS., THURSDAY, DECEMBER 5, 1907. years or so the tariff laws should be carefully scrutinized so as I) see thaij no excessive or improper benefits are | conferred thereby, that proper reve-! uue is provided, and that our foreign j trade is encouraged. There must al- 1 ways be as a min.mum a tariff which wiill not only allow for the collection of an ample revenue but which will at least make good the difference in cost of production here and abroad, that is, the difference in labor cost here and abroad, for the well-being of the wage-worker must ever be a cardinal point of American policy. The quest .on should be approached purely from a business standpoint; both the time and the manner of the change being such as to amuse the minimum of agi tation and disturbance in the business world, and to give the least play for selfish and factional motives. The sole consideration should be to see that the sum total of change repre sents the public good. This means that the subject can not with wisdom be defilt with in the year preceding a, presidential election, because as a matter of fact experience has conclu-; sively shown that at such a time it is, impossible to get men to treat it from The wise time to deal with the mat-, the standpoint of the public good.! ter is immediately after such elec- ■ tion. Income and Inheritance Tax, When our tax laws are revised the question of an income tax and an in-, heritance tax should receive the care ful attention of our legislators. In my judgment both of these taxes: should be part of our system of fed-* eral taxation. I speak diffldintly about the income tax because one scheme for an income tax was declared un-| constitutional by the supreme court; w'hile in addition it is a difficult tax to administer In its practical working, and great care would have to be exer-j c-sed to see that it was not evaded by j the very men whom it was most de sirable to have taxed, for if so evaded it would, of course, be worse than no tax at all; as the least desirable of all taxes is the tax which bears heav ily upon the honest as compared with the dishonest man. Nevertheless, a graduated income tax of the proper type would be a desirable feature of federal taxation, and it is to be hoped that one may be devised which the supreme court w r ill declare constitu tional. The inheritance tax, however, is both a far better method of taxation, and far more important for the pur pose of having the fortunes of the country bear in proportion to their in crease in size a corresponding in crease and burden of taxation. The government has the absolute right to decide as to the terms upon which a man shall receive a bequest or de vise from another, and this point in the devolution of prop erty is especially appropriate for tho imposition of a tax. Laws imposing such taxes have repeatedly been placed upon the national statute books and as repeatedly declared constitu tional by the courts; and the laws con tained the progressive principle, that is, after a certain amount is reached the bequest or gift, in life or death, is increasingly burdened and the rate of taxation is increased in proportion to the remoteness of blood of the man receiving the bequest. These principles are recognized already in the leading civilized nations of the world. In Great Britain all the estates worth 15,000 or less are practically exempt from death duties, while the increase is such that when an estate exceeds live millions of dollars in value and passes to a distant kinsman or stranger in blood the government re ceives all told an amount equivalent to nearly a fifth of the whole estate. In France so much of an inheritance as exceeds $10,000,000 pays over a fifth to the state if it passes to a dis tant relative. The German law is es pecially interesting to us because it makes the inheritance tax an imperial measure while allotting to the individ ual states of the empire a portion of the proceeds and permitting them to impose taxes in addition to those imposed by the imperial government. Small inheritances are exempt, but the tax is so sharply progressive that when the inheritance is still not very large, provided it is not an agricul tural or a forest land, it is taxed at the rate of 25 per cent if it goes to distant relatives. There is no reason why in the United States the national government should not impose inheri tance taxes in addition to those im posed by the states, and when we last had an inheritance tax about one half of the states levied such taxes con currently with the national govern ment, making a combined maximum rate, in some cases as high as 25 per cent. The French law has one feat ure which is to he commended. The progressive principle is so applied that each higher rate is imposed only on the excess above the amount sub ject to the next lower rate; so that each increase of rate will apply only to a certain amount above a certain maximum. The tax should if possible be made to bear more heavily upon those residing without the country than within it. A heavy progressive tax upon a very large fortune is in no way such a tax upon thrift or in dustry as a like tax would be on a small fortune. No advantage comes | either to the country as a whole or to the individuals inheriting the money by permitting the transmission in their entirety of the enormous for tunes which would be affected by such a tax; and as an incident to its function of revenue raising, such a tax would help to preserve a meas ■ 'able equality of opportunity for the people of the generations growing to manhood. We have not the slightest sympathy with that socialistic idea which would try to put thriftlessness | and inefficiency on a par with indus try. thrift and efficiency; which would try to break up not merely private property, but what is far more im portant. the home, the chief prop up on which our whole civilisation stands. Such a theory, if ever adopted, would m*a the ruin of the entire country— a ruin which would bear heaviest up- Ol the weakest, upon thoaa least able to shift for themselves. But proposals for legislation such as this herein ad vocated are directly opposed to this class of socialistic theories. Enforcement of the Law. A few years ago there was loud complaint that the law could not be invoked against wealthy offenders, , There is no such complaint now. The i course of the department of justice | during the last few years has been; such as to make it evident that no man stands above the law’, that no corporation is so wealthy that it can not be held to account. The depart ment of justice has been as prompt to proceed against the wealthiest mal efactor whose crime was one of greed and cunning as to proceed against the agitator who incites to brutal vio lence. Injunctions. Instances of abuse in the granting of injunctions in labor disputes con tinue to occur, and the resentment in the minds of those who feel that their rights are being invaded and their liberty of action and of speech unwar rantly restrained continues likewise to grow. Much of the attack on the use of the process of injunction is wholly without warrant; but the president ex presses the belief that for some of it theve is warrant. This question is be coming more and more one of prime importance, and unless the courts will themselves deal with it in effective manner, it is certain ultimately to de mand some form of legislative action. Employers’ Liability. The national government should be a model employer. It should demand the highest quality of service from each of its employes and it should care for all of them properly in re turn, Congress should adopt legisla tion providing limited but definite compensation for accidents to all workmen within the scope of the fed eral power, including employes of navy yards and arsenals. In other words, a model employers’ liability act, far-reaching and thoroughgoing ' should be enacted w hich should apply to all positions, public and private, over which the national government has jurisdiction. Congress should consider the exten sion of the eight-hour law’. The con stitutionality of the present law has recently been called into question, and | the supreme cou-t has decided that the existing legislation is unquestion ably within thepporersw r ers of the con gress. The principle of the eight-hour ' day should as rapidly and as far as ! practicable be extended to the entire ‘work carried on by the government. Industrial Disputes, j For the live years ending December 31, 1905. the number of strikes w'as greater than those in any previous ten years and was double the number in the preceding five years. These fig ure* indicate the increasing need of I providing some machinery to deal with this class of disturbances in the interest alike of the employer, the employe, and the general public. Con gress should consider the matter of I creating the machinery for compulsory I investigation of industrial controver i sies. A comprehensive measure should be adopted at this session of the congress relating to the employment of women and children in the District of Colum bia and the territories. The national government has an ultimate resort for control of child labor the use of interstate commerce clause to prevent the products of child labor from enter ing into interstate commerce. But be fore using this it ought certainly to enact model laws on the subject fcr the territories under its own immedi ate control. Farmers and Wage-Workers. Nothing is more needed than the best type of industrial school, the schoo for mechanical industries in the city, the school for practically teaching agriculture in the ccantry. The catl ing of the skilled tiller of the soil, the calling of the skilled mechanic, should alike be recognized as professions, just as emphatically as the calling of lawyer, doctor, merchant, or clerk. The schools should recognize this fact and it should equally be recognized in popular opinion. The young man who has the farsightedness and courage to recognize it and to get over the idea ! that it makes a difference whether | what he earns is called salary or ; wages, and who refuses to enter the i crowded field of the so-called profes sions, and takes to constructive indus try instead, is reasonably sure of an ample reward in earnings, in health, In opportunity to marry early, and to ! establish a home with a fair amount of freedom from worry. It should be one of our prime objects to put both ' the farmer and the mechanic on a 1 higher plane of efficiency and reward, 1 so as to increase their effectiveness in the economic world, and therefore the dignity, the remuneration, and the power of their positions in the social world. The national government through the department of agriculture should ,’o all it can by joining with the state governments and with independent as sociations of farmers to encourage the growth in the open farming country of such institutional and social move ments as will meet the demand of the best type of farmers, both for the im provement of their farms and for the betterment of the life itself. Inland Waterways. Our great river systems should be developed as national water highways; the Mississippi, with its tributaries, standing first in importance, and the Columbia second, although there are many others of importance on the Pa cific, the Atlantic and the gulf slopes. The national government should under take this work, and the president hopes, a beginning will be made in the present congress; and the greatest of all our rivers, the Mississippi, should receive especial attention. From the great lakes to the mouth of the Mis sissippi there should be a deep water way with deep waterways leading from it to the east and the west. Such a waterway should pratcicaily mean the extension of our coast line Into the very heart of our country. It would be of incalculable benefit to our people. If begun at < nee it can be carried through in time appreciably to relieve the congestion of our great freight-carrying lines of railroads. The work should be systematically and continuously carried forward in accordance with some w r ell-couceived plan. The main streams should be im- I proved to the highest point of effi- I ciency before the improvement of the I branches is attempted. The inland j waterways which lie just back of the | whole eastern and southern coasts j should likewise be developed. More over, the development of our waterways j involves many other important water ; problems, all of which should be con sidered as part of the same general scheme. The government dams should be used to produce hundreds of thousands of horsepower as an inci dent to improving navigation; for the annual value of the unused w’ater power of the united States perhaps exceeds the annual value of the prod ucts of all our mines. As an inci dent to creating the deep waterway down the Mississippi, the government should build along its whole lower length levees which taken together with the control of the headwaters, will at once and forever put a com plete stop to all threat of floods in the immensely fertile delta region. Reclamation Work. Irrigation should be far more ex tensively developed than at present. Rot only in the states of the great plains and th Rocky mountains, but in many others, as, for instance, large portions of the south Atlantic and gulf states, where it should go hand in hand with the reclamation of swamp land. The federal government should seriously devote itself to this task, realizing that utilization of wat terways and water-power, forestry, irri gation and the reclamation of lands threatened with overflow], are all in terdependent parts of the same prob lem. Public Lands. The effort of the government to deal with th© public land has ueen ■based upon the same principle as that of the reclamation service. The land law system which was designed to meet the needs of the fertile and well-wiatered reg oris of the middle west has largeiy broken down when applied to the dryer regions of the great plains, the mountains, and much of the Pacific slope,, where a farm of 160 acres is inadequate for self-sup port. In these regions the system lent itself to fraud, and much land passed out of the hands of the government without passing into the hands of the home-maker. Trie department of the interior and the department of justice joined in prosecuting the; offenders against the law; and they have accom plished much, while where the ad ministration of the law has been de fective it has been changed. Some legislation is essential in order to preserve cue great stretches of public grazing land which a.e unfit for cultivation under present methods and are valuable only for the forage which they supply. These stretches amount in all to some. 

.’>6O,(KM),OOO acres, and are open to the free graz ing of cattle, sheep, horses and goats, without restriction. Such a system, or rather such lack of system, means that the range is not so much used as wasted by abuse. As the 'west set tles the range becomes more and more over-grazed. Much of it can not be used to advantage unless it is fenced, for fencing is the only way by which to keep in check, the owners of nomad flocks which roam hitner and thither, utterly destroying the pastures and leaving a waste bemud so that their presence is incompatible with the presence of home-makers. The existing fences are all inegal. All these fences, those that are hurt ( ful and those that are beneficial, are ! alike illegal and must come down. But it is an outrage that the law should necessitate such action on tue part of the administration. The un lawful fencing of public lands for pri vate grazing must be stopped, but the necessity which occasioned it must be provided for. The federal govern ment should have control of the range, whether by permit or lease, as i local necessities may determine, i Such control could secure the great ! benefit of legitimate fencing, whue at ; the same time securing and promoting the settlement of the country. destruction of the pablic range will continue until some such laws as these are enacted. Fully to prevent the fraud in the public lands which . through the joint action of the inte rior department and the department of justice, we have been endeavoring to prevent, there must be further leg islation, and especially a sufficient ap propriation to permit the department (if the interior to examine certain classes of entries on the ground be- I fore they pass into private ownership, i The government should part with its ! title only to the actual homemaker, not to the profit-maker wiho does not j care to make a home Our prime oo ' ject is to secure the rights and guard the interests of the small ranen man, the man who plows and pitches hay for himself. The preservation or replacement of the forests is one of the most impor tant means of preventing tAs loss. We have made a beginning in forest preservation, out it is only a begin ning. At present lumbering is the fourth greatest industry in the limited States; and yet, so rapid has been the rate of exhaustion o f timber in the United States in the past, and so rapidly Is the remainder being ex hausted, that the country is unques tionably on the verge of a timber fam ine which will ue felt in every house hold in the land. There has already been a rise in the price of lumoer. but there is certain to be a more rapid and heavier rise in th© future. The present annual consumption of lumber Is certainly three times as great as the annual growth; and if the consumption and growth continue unchanged, practical’? ail our lumber will be exhausted In another genera tion. while long before the limit to complete exhaustion s reached the growing scarcity will make in many blighting ways upon our na \ tional welfare. About twenty per ( cent of our forested territory is now reserved in national forests; but these do not include tue most valuable lim ber lands, and in any event the pro portion is too small to expect that the reserves can accomplish more than a mitigation of the trouble whic.* is ahead for the nation. Far more dras tic action is needed. Forests can be lumbered so as to give to the public the full use of their mercantile timber without the slightest detriment to the forest, any more than it is ad 'tri men t to a farm to furnish a harvest; so that there is no parallel betw-een forests and mines, which can only be | completely used by exhaustion. All the forest lands possible should I be acquired for the use of the nation, i These lands, because they form a na i t;onal asset, are as emphatically na fonal as the rivers which they feed. Tariff on Wood Pulp. There should be no tariff on any forest product grown in this count ry; and, in especial, there should be no tariff on wood pulp; due notice of the 1 change being of course given to those engaged in the business so as to enable them to adjust themselves to the new conditions. The repeal of the duty on wood pulp should if icssible be accompanied by an agree ment with Canada that there shall be no export duty on Canadian pulp wood. Mineral Lands. In the eastern United States the mineral fuels have already passed into the hands of large private own ers, and those of the west are rapidly following. It is obvious that these fuels should be conserved and not wasted, and it w-ould be w r ell to pro tect the people against unjust and extortionate prices, so far as that can still be done. What has been accom plished in the great oil fields of the Indian Territory by the action of the administration', offers a striking ex ample ot the good results of such a jolicy. The government should have the right to keep the fee of the coal, oil, and gas fields in its own posses sion and to lease the rights to develop them under proper regulations. The Panama Canal. Work on the Panama canal Is pro ceeding In a highly satisfactory man ner. Postal Affairs. The president commends to the fa vorable consideration of the congress a postal savings bank system and for t.n extension of the parcel post, es pecially on the rural routes. There are now 38,215 rural routes serving nearly 15,000,000 people who do not have the advantages of the inhabi tants of cities of obtaining their sup plies. These recommendations have been drawn up to benefit Ihe farmer and the country storekeeper; other, wise, he says he should not favor them. It is desirable that the country merchant should not be crushed out It would be a most desirable thing to put the fourth-class postmasters in the classified service. Foreign Affairs. In foreign affairs this country's steady policy is to behave toward other nations as a strong and self-res pecting man should behave toward the other men with whom ho is brought into contact. Substantial progress was made it the Hague towards the creation of a permanent judicial tribunal for the de termination >of international causes. Porto Rico. The president recommends that the nghts of citizenship be conferred upon tne people of Porto Rico. Alaska. Some form of local self-government should be provided for Alaska and icad building and railway building should be encouraged. Whisky sell ing to the natives should be made a fel ony. The coal land laws should be changed so as to meet the peculiar needs of the territory. Hawaii. The unfortunate failure of the ship ping bill at the last session of the last congress was followed by the taking off of certain Pacific steam ships, which has greatly hampered the movement of passengers between Hawaii and the mainland. Unless congress is prepared by positive en couragement to secure proper facili ties in the way of shipping between Hawaii and the mainland, then the coastwise shipping laws should be so far relaxed as to prevent Hawaii suff ering as it is now suffering. Mining. A bureau of mines should be cre eled under the control and direction of the secretary of the interior; the bureau to have power to collect sta tistics and make investigations in all matters pertaining to mining and particularly to the accident>and dan gers of the industry- The Hermitage. The president recommends to con gress to provide funds for keeping up the Hermitage, the home of Andrew Jackson, and that a naval monument be established In the Vicksburg na tional park. The Thirteenth Census. The establishment of the permanent census bureau affords the opportunity for a better census than we have ever had, but in order to realize the full advantage of the permanent organiza tion, ample time must be given for preparation. The Public Health. At last the public mind is awake to the fact that many diseases, notably tuberculous, are national scourges, The work of the state and city hoards of health should be supplemented by a constantly increasing Interest on the 1 art of the national government. This whole i- ranch of the government 5 hould be strengthened and aided in every way. Presidential Campaign Expenses. It is well to provid o that corpora tions shall not contribute to presi dential or national campaigns, and fur thermore to provide for the publication of both contributions and expendi tures. There is, however, always danger in laws of this kind. which from their very nature are difficult of enforcement; the danger being lest thjy be obeyed only by the hon est. and disobeyed by the unscrupu lous. so as to act onlv as a penalty upon honest men. Moreover, no such Ipw would hamper an nnscrupulou-i nan of unlimited means from buying his own way into office. There is a very radical measure which would work a substantial improvement in our system of conducting a campaign. The need for collecting laige cam paign funds would vanish in congress piovided an appropriation for the proper and legitimate exenses of each of the great national parties, an appropriation ample enough to meet the necessity for thorough organisa tion and machinery, w-hlch requires a large expenditure of money Then the stipulation should be made that no party receding campaign funds from the treasuiy should accept more tlvan a fixed amount fom any individ ual subscriber or donor; and the nec essary publicity for receipts end ex pendituos could without difficulty be provided. Gallery of Art. There should be a national gallery of art established in the capital city of this country. This is important not merely to the artistic but to the ma terial welfare of the country; and the people are to be congratulated on the fact that the movement to establish such a gallery is taking definite form under the guidance of the Smithson ian Institution. So far from there be ing a tariff on works of art brought into the country, their importation should be encouraged In every way. There have been no sufficient collec tions of objects of art by the govern meat, and what collections have been acquired are scattered and are gener ally placed in unsuitable and Imper fectly lighted galleries. Our Good Birds. The biological survey is quietly working for the good of our agricul tural interests, and is an excellent example of a government bureau which conducts original scientific re search the findings of which are of much practical utility. For more than twenty years it has studied the food habits of birds and mammals that are injurious or beneficial to agrhtilture. horticulture, and forestry; has dls tributed illustrated bulletins on the subject, and has labored to secure legislative protection for the beneficial species. The cotton boll-weevil, which has recently overspread the cotton holt of Texas and is steadily extending its range, is said to cause an annual loss of about $3,000,000. The biologi cal survey has ascertained and given wide publicity tr. the fact that at least 43 kinds of birds prey upon this destructive insect. It has discovered that 57 species of birds feed upon scale-insects —dreaded enemies of the fruit grower. It has shown that wood pikers as a class, by destroying the larvae of wood boring insects, are so essential to tree life that it is doubt ful if our forests could exist without them. It has shown that cuckoos and orioles are the natural enemies of th* leaf-eating caterpillars that destroy our shade and fruit trees; that oar quails and sparrows consume annually hundreds of tons of seeds of noxious weeds; that hawks and owls as a class (excepting the few that kill poultry and game birds) are markedly beneficial, spending their lives In catching grasshoppers, mice, and other pests that prey upon the prod nets of husbandry. It has conducted field experiments for the purpose of devising and perfecting simple meth ods for holding In check the hordes of destructive rodents —rates, mice, rabbits, gophers, prairie dogs, and ground squirrels—which annually de stroy crops worth many millions of dollars; and it has published practical directions for Ihe destruction of wolves and coyotes on the stock ranges of the West, resulting during ; the past year in an estimated saving I of cattle and sheep valued at upwards of a million dollars, i It, has inaugurated a system of in | spection at the principal ports of en try on both Atlantic and Pacific coasts by means of which the introduction of noxious mammals and birds is pre vented thus keeping out the mon goose and certain birds which arc as much to be . dreaded as the pre viously introduced English sparrow and the house rats and mice. In the interest of game protection it has co-operated with local officials in every state is the union, has striven to promote uniform legislation in the several states, has rendered important service in enforcing the federal law regulating interstate traffic In game, and has shown how game protection may be made to yield a large reve nue to the state —a revenue amount ing in the case of Illinois to s2B,oof> i in a single year. The biological survey has explored the faunas and floras of America with referneee to the distribution of ani mals and plants: it has defined and mapped the natural life areas—area: in which, by reason of prevai’ing climatic conditons, certain kinds of ; animals and plants occur—ami has 1 pointed out the adaptability of these areas to the cultivation of particular I crops. The results of these investi- I gations are not only of high educa ! tjonal value but are worth each year !to the progressive farmers of the 1 country many times the cost of main taining the survey, which, it may he added, is exceedingly small. This bureau, whose usefulness is seriously handicapped by lack of funds, should be granted an appropriation in some degree commensurate with the im portance of the work it is doing. The Army. Again and again in the past our little regular army has rendered service Ift oially vital to the country, and it may at any time have to do so in the fu ture. Its standard of efficiency and instruction is higher now than ever in the past. But it is too small. There are not enough officers, and It is Impossible to secure enough enlisted men. We should maintain in peace a fairly complete skeleton of a largo army. Wages have greatly increased in outside occupations In the last forty years and the pay of the soldier, like the pay of the officers, should be pro portionately Increased. Peraapa the most important of all legislation needed for the benefit of the army is a law to equalize and Increase the pay of officers and enlisted men of the army, navy, marine corps, and revenue cutter service.
