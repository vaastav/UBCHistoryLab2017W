Wilds P. Richardson, piesident! of the Alaska road commisfior, i eBoh ed Juneau from the Westward last Saturday, and in the evening wad en tertained at n banquet given in his honor, by bueinestmen of Juneau, Treadwell and Douglas. The purpose of the affair, which was boldly announ ad, was to eulist the good will of the colonel iu behalf of the bridge across the channel between Juueau and Douglas Island. Whether it was the persua*ive eloqnence, or the viands served at the banquet that influenced the colonel we caunot say. However, he is much takeu with the project and promises to give it hi* earnest support when he gets down to Washington, D. The new* comet) from the national capital that U. S. Marshal Faulkner and U. S. Attorney Rustgard, both of Juneno, me to have their official heads chi'j ped otf just now, almost eighteen mouths before (be term has expired for which ffcey were appointed. Ku mor has it that it was all brought about by a quarrel between the two men. The democrats, having an eje ou all fobs of this nature, are quite apt in discovering defects in the character or conduct of republican officers, and in asking them to sidestep to make room for the faithful. So it appears that the betl the two gentlemen can do is to fold their hands, close their eyes and wait tor the big knite If we may believe the JnneaP Dis patch, Judge U' beit W. Jennings of the fedeial bench, has announced that be will giant no more saloon licenses in Juneau until July 1, 1914. We pre sume that this may be taken as an in dication that the Judge is oonvinoed that there are now enough taloons iu the Capital city to atteud to all the business. It might be suggested that the same ruliug would bp advisable in regaids to grocery, stores and meat shops. We understand that the U. S. Judge has full power iu ruch matters and may refuse at any lime to give his sanction to the issuance of a business license. Altboag the people of Juneau may complain because a couple more saloons would mean two thousand dollars more for the alieady depleted oity treasury, yet it is better that the business shall not be overdone. For many yeais the people of Alaska have eweat under the authority given to United Stares judges, which at times becomes moie extcutive than jndiciary in its nature. The case in hand is one to which the measure of home rule, granted to the territory, does not extend. He Saw Double * A Douglas man came down towu the other morning and smiled as he re marked: 'Tm afraid 1 took a little more last night than a church member should take." 14 Why so?" said one of his friends. . "Well, you see, this morning when I. came to breakfast my wife said to me: 'William, what was the matter with you last night? You stood beside the bed for sometime looking at me and fiinal ly said: Well, 1 swear, you two girls look enough alike to be sittters'."' The Sheep Creek tunnel is again breaking records when it advances at the rate of twenty-four feet a day. The work is in charge of Foreman Paddy O'Neil. An editor who started about twenty years ago with only 55 cents ia now worth $100,000. Ilia accumulation of wealth is owing to his frugality, good habits and strict attention to business and the fact an uncle died and left Wilson With Us In bis message to oongress, President Wilson takes up the Alaska question in earnest, arid urges that this great storehouse of wealth be opened up for the benefit of the American people. Of Alaska, the Presideufc said: "A duty faces us with regard to Alaska, whioh seems to be very pressing and imperative. Perhaps I should say a double duty, for It concerns both the political and material development of the Territory. The people in Alaska should be given a full territorial, form of government, and Alaska as a store house should be uulooked. "The key to uulock that storehouse is a system of railroads. These the government should control' ki the in terest of all who wish to use them for the service and development of the country and its people. But the oon struction of railways is ouly the first step, it is the thrustiug iu of the key to the storehouse and throwing back the lock and opening the door. How the tempting resources of the couutry are to be exploited is another matter to which I shall take the liberty from time to time of calling your attention, fo: it is a policy which mut-t be woiked out by well oonsideied.stiiget^uGt upjQ theory, but upon Ikies of jpactiol expediency, it is a pait of our geneiul pioblem of conservation. "We most use the resources of the country, not loek them ap. The re sources in question must be osed, but not destroyed or wasted;- used, bat not monopolized upon canny narrow idea* of individual rights as against the abiding interests of the commnnities. "That a polioy can be worked out by conference and concession which will release these resources and yet not jeapord or dissipate them, I for one have no doubt and it can be done on lines of regulation which need be no less acceptable to the people and gov ernments of the States concerned than to the people and government of the nation at large, whose heritage these resources are.. We must bend our couusels to this^nd. A common pur pobe ought to make agreement easy.'*' Try Pleiechmann'd Yeast. Fresh on every bo?t, at FoxV 1
