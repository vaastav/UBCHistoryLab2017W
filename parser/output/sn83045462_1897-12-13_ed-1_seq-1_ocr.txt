Prominent statesmen, scientists and men and women prominent in Washington busi ness and social circles were present to do rcmage to the dead. Noticeable by their numbers were the young people, for Mr. Hubbard was a prime favorite with youth, and participated in their pleasures to no small degree. It was a few minutes past the hour when the remains reached the church. Headed by the ushers of the church, the procession moved down the miudle aisle.

To him, in very large measure, our organiza tion owes its existence. He recognized his duties as a citizen: and, among others, this, to do his share to give the national capital interest and attractiveness by car rying out the object of this organization. "He gave freely of time and money to preserve the house In which President Bin coin died: and It is largely due to his wide acquaintance and great influence that the Congress has purchased that property to be perpetually held as a shrine of patriotic pilgrimage. We feel that in his death our association loses one of its most efficient members, and all of us a true and valued friend. We tender our heartfelt sympathy to his bereaved household." SI 

BPOST OFFICE STATION. Lively Contest in Regard to a Pro posed Removal on 14th Street. There is a local fight on hand for the siibpost office station which Is at present located at the southwest corner of 14th and P streets northwest. Some time ago the drug store where the substation is no v located was sold, and the purchaser before he closed the deal called upon the post of fice officials and asked if there was any complaint, and If they contemplated mov ing the station. He was informed that everything was moving satisfactorily, and that no suggestions of a change had been mude. To make himself more certain he called upon Postmaster Wlllett and asked the same questions. Keceiving like replies he asked Postmaster Wlllett if any change were suggested would he stand by him, and it is understood the postmaster re plied in the affirmative. No sooner had the deal been closed, however, and the new proprietor safely in possession than a fight started to have the station moved to the northwest corner of 14th and Rhode Island avenue. This tight continue* now with unabated interest, and It looks very much as if the station would be moved. A num ber of citizens have called upon the first assistant postmaster general and urged the change. No reasons were advanced. Sen ator Teller, it is understood, has interested himself in the matter, and is in favor of moving the statlcn. The outcome will be announced in a few days. 

CIRTAILMEXT OF LEGISLATION. The House Without Power to Rule Out "Riders" by the Senate. A story was put out last night that Speaker Reed proposed an amendment of the rules of the House which would prevent "riders" being put on appropria tion bills by the Senate. There is no such thing contemplated and 110 such thing pos sible. The House cannot make rules which will control the Senate, and what may be add<a to an appropriation bill in the Senate depends upon the Senate rules and the Senate voles. The republicans of the house may adopt a policy for the treatment of such "riders" as may be put upon appropriation bills by the Senate, but this would simply deter mine the degree of resistance the House should offer to the will of the Senate. The House could not rule out any Senate amendment. It .could simply reject the amendment and permit the bill to fall, If the Senate insisted and stood Arm. No rule of the House could affect this matter in any way. except cne to make the House rules as liberal to riders as are the rules of the Senate. The subject Is cne that csn be dealt with only through an agreement between the two houses of Congress. If they con cur in policy the desired curtailment of legislation can be accomplished, or great firmness on the part of the house may cause the Senate to yield to a considera ble extent, but there Is no force that can be exerted tnrough the rules of the House. Death of Lieut. CoL MeK.ee. Adjutant General Breck received a tele gram this morning announcing the death of Lieut. Col. J. C. McKee of the medical department, retired, which occurred at his residence, 110 South Washington street, Butler, Pa. ON INTERVENTION Opinion in Havana on the Message of President McKinley. WHAT IS A "REASONABLE HUE" Opinions of Insurgents and the Spanish Elements. THE AMERICAN COLONY (Copyright. 1807, by Chas. M. Pepper.) HAVANA, Cuba, December <J, 18flT. International relations is a long term for Havana to digest. The people have no stomach for It. When their molders of public opinion put it more tersely as "this i business of the United States and Spain," the subject is better understood. The bull fight was over before the meeting of ;he American Congress and the message of President McKinley. Consequently they did not have to enter a competition in which the odds would have been all in fa vor of the bull fight as a topic of popular interest. So this business of the United Mates and Spain has a fair field for analy sis and discussion. Time has been given to correct first impressions where they vere nasty or based 011 meager information. The feeling of the community Is what might be called settled. What It Is today It will be a fortnight or perhaps even a month hence. The Date Fixed. An interrogation point would best sum r.arTze this state of mind. What is a rea sonable time? What the period in which Spain should re-establish peace and secure the adoption of autonomy? What is the near future? Probably the same questions are being asked In the United States, but thty have more significance In Cuba. Their meaning here Implies distrust. If confi dence in the ability of the government 10 pacify the island was strong these ques tions would not be asked. The inquiry is made and the answer given according to the leanings of the inquirer. The planters and merchants of Havana province, who some time ago decided to wait till May, and then, if Spain had not re-established her sovereignty, to ask a protectorate of the United States, have not put forward the time a single day. Five months is the limit of their loyalty to the mother coun try-, and in the meantime it is a half-heart ed loyalty, for they are not giving the new colonial policy the fair trial which Presi dent McKinley asks the American people to give it. They profess to find encourage ment for their notion of a protectorate in the reference which the message makes to the United States having Interests In Cuba which will not permit the suggestion of Kuropean interference. The brief ur.d vague synopsis cabled on this point is a doubtful straw for these Spaniards who j are annexationists to grasp at, but they 1 will do so. And May is their answer to ! what is meant by a reasonable time. Keollnif ?it the 1'uluve. The visible representation of Spain's au thority in Cuba, the palace officials, place the near future a year hence. While In dividuals have changed with the change in at ministration, the atmosphere of the palace is the same. And in that atmos phere President McKinley's message Is looked upon as less menacing than was - Ir. Cleveland's a year ago. The official mind seems to run in a circular channel If Spain could keep the United States from Intervening during the last twelve months, when the American people were worked up over Weyler's policy, the present of ficials think they may reasonably expect non-intervention, when they are carrying out a more humane policy. The elections in February, under autonomy, military operations against the insurgents if they continue to hold out, the coming on of the rairy season In May, when the movement ' of troops is impracticable, and a cessation of active movements till the dry season again, is the way Captain General Blanco hop?s to span the gap. Naturally, he also hopes there will be no gap to span, and that the island will be pacified by spring, yet he has to consider the embarrassments which may destroy this hope and call for a definite program. Doulit IteicardiiiK Congress. In this palace view of the time within which Intervention may come there is sometimes an Inflection of doubt-regarding Congress. Mr. Canalyas, the Madrid editor and political leader, after his study of the present conditions in Cuba, hesitates to hold out the idea to the people of Spain that they can look for early results, and solicitously asks his American friends whether they think Congress will be likely to take action before May. I have been asked the same question In a different form by palace officials, who are not familiar with our parliamentary methods, yet who have an indefinite notion that Congress, at some stage, dies a natural death. "Is It not the short session, and Is not your cortes dissolved In May?" asked one of tne offi cials who came from Spain with Gen. Blanco. Secretary General Congoste and others understood the practice better, but they all appear to feel that a crisis will be avoided If the national legislature Is not in session In May. t In the meantime the Havana newspapers hold out expectations of Congress being kept in check through executive influence. For Instance. "Diirlo de la Marina" re publishes approvingly, though with some sly malice, what purports to be the utter ance of a cjnservative New York news paper. It is as follows: '"The Pifsident has told that he has de cided to use all his resources, including the distribution of political favors, with the purpose of preventing the Cuban question from reaching a critical stage in Congress Some of the leaders of the Jingo element or last year have been already converted by this method, and the President has re ceived assurances or a support much stronger and more efficacious than any President has had for many years. This placating or the eenators is a work or diplomacy. To placate some of the sena tors Mr. McKinley has had the tact to harmonise differences. Besides a Judicious distribution of the patronage the President has made various Important concessions on certain subjects In exchange for the support which some senators will be able to give him." They lu.ow how to use the patronage in Cuba. also, pie officials have been chang ed. even to the administration of the gov ?riunent lottery, yet this has not resulted " bulging "P * Party of autonomy "Dlarlo" wai simply trying to show that there are restraining Influences which may k6?p Congress from running away with itself. The palace does not consider that the responsibility ror that body is in Ha vana. Congress, as viewed here. Is In the (Continued on rhir<i PM*) 

NARROW ESCAPE FOR GOMEZ Insurgent Leader Takes Refuge in Moun tains of Laa Delicias. Closely Pnranrd by Spanish Force I'nder Gen. Pan do?An to no mint Commissioner* Hangrd. HAVANA, via Key West, Fla., December 13.?It is officially announced that the Spanish forces under the command of Gen eral Pando in the province of Puerto Prin cipe have been pushing insurgent leader General Maximo Gomez so closely that he was obliged, with about 200 men of liis escort, to seek refuge in the woods unci mountains of Las Delicias. The commissioners sent by General Pan do to different parts of the island, with in structions to negotiate with the insurgents for their acceptance of the autonomous form of government proposed by Spain, have not returned In a single case, which seems to confirm the reports that some of them have been hanged by the insurgents, and others have elected to remain with the enemy. It is reported that Juan Delgado, the in surgent leader, has hanged the two com missioners who were sent to him with peace propositions. A dispatch recently received here from Madrid says that the autonomic cabinet for Cuba will not ue formed until the refomists and autonomists unite in one party, and it is added that the reformist deputy, Amb lard, who is now in Madrid, will, on his ar rival in New York, offer to Manuel Rafael Angulo, a member of the Cuban revolu tionary junta, a portfolio in the new au tonomic cabinet In otder to Induce hiin to return to Cuba. MESSAGES OF CONDOLENCE. President MoKinlcy's Frlend.n Re member Mlm In HIh Affliction. CANTON, Ohio, December 13.?Telegrams of condolence are pouring in by the hun dreds today.

In the United States Supreme Court to day an opinion was handed down by Jus tice While in thfe case of Thomas Br?m, under sentence of death by the United States circuit court for the Massachusetts district for the murder of the caotaln and the mate of the bark Herbert Fullei and also the wife of the captain at sea in July, 1896,. the name of the captain being Charles I. Nash and that of the mate Augurt W. Ulomberg. The decision of the circuit court was reversed, on the ground that the lower court erred in ad mitting the testimony of the detective with whom Bram conversed in Halifax. The vessel on which the tragedy o^purred was bound from New York to South Amer ica, and after the crime was discovered her course was changed and the first land ing made at HaBfax. A seaman named Brown was fir st arrested by shipmates, charged with the commission of the crime, and afterward, actuated by a statement of Brown's, they also took Bram into custody. The reversal -was based upon the admis sion of Bram's statement to the detective in Halifax. In the United States Supreme Court to day the case of the Bcyden Power Brake Company agt. the Westingfcouse company was restored to tho docket for reargument and assigned to the first Monday in March. This will make the third hearing In the case . i The decision of the Supreme Court of New Mexico in the case at the Springer Land Association vs. fatrJak P.

It was held in brief that the governor in accepting a list of swafnp lands in Michigan a former list hod been furnished and found to be erroneous, had forfeited the right to claim under the first list, and that, tha amen#ieat to the swamp land aot of 1867 did nol, altdfe the situation.

"This section shall not be construed to mean that so long as a clerk or employe is borne upon the rolls of the department in excess of the time herein provided for or granted, he or she shall be entitled to pay during the period of such excessive absence, but that the pay shall stop upon the expiration of the granted leave. Keeping lip to Date.

Twinty borings were made in and near the main channel of the Potomac during November. These borings required a total penetration of 280.8 feet, of which 1H0.3 feet were in mud. 117 feet In sand and gravel and 24.4 feet In rock. Borings were also made in the Little river behind the training dike and the lower end of Analostan Island. In that locality there vas a total penetration of 206 feet, of which 188 feet were In mud, 8.8 feet in sand and gravel and 9.2 feet In rock. Little river is now so shallow that the snag boat used In the work can be moved only at high tide, and as northwest winds prevailed during November, causing the tides below the average, the work has been greatly delayed.
