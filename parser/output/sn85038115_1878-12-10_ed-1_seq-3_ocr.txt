' This little fiction, calculated to make the superstitious on Pugh Ridge, Bel mont county, remain indoors at the time o' night when "grave yards yawn," appeared in the Barnesville Enterpris 61 the 5th inst ' The parties are Mr. Ham mono, in the flesh, and tbe departed spirit of Mr Louden: .. On or ahout the 4th of November, 1878, Mr. Hammond was visiting Mr. Noffsinger, one of his neighbors, and his general conversation was regarding the new director M be appointed for the school, and general topics that will come up during the evening's intercourse. Ahout nine o'clock he started for home. We let him tell the rest of the story ; -- After I bad, been "out of the . house and walked, say two hundred yards, at a point in the road where lays a black wal nut top blown down, I discovered some one walking towards me, and in a mo ment be was so near me that I involun tarilv put out ray hand, so as to lay it, on him, and found that I could not. I. however, continued walking with him along the road until I come to the gate of the lane that leads into my house 1 knew all the time who it was, and recog nized distinctly Mr. Louden. Although I was not home at the time of his tuner al, I saw him dressed in black clothes, with shoes on, in his bare head and with a handkerchief tied under his chin. His eves, mouth, teeth, whiskers and gener al expression of his face were as dis tinctly outlined to me, aa they were the last time I saw him before his death. did not speak to him; nor he to me, but all the time along the road he continued to waltc, keeping up with me, and I con fess I was walking pretty fast. At tbe eate spoken of, I had to slip my hand around the post to unfasten the - gate, and I did so very .quickly.passed through so as to avoid having further, company with, him , but quick as I . was, when bad closed tbe eate, I found that he was still near me.' At this I was compelled to place both hands on my hat, for all that I conld do, I felt it rising, as though it would leave' me.' I could distinctly hear the old man walking, could see bis motions, and if bo disposed could have touched him. The lane from the main road to my house is about two or three hundred yards long, and at a point in tbe road, where I had newly graded it to avoid, a little hill, and where tbe ground is lower than any other point on the road my companion seemed to stop and hesitate, as though he would speak to me, and then turned and walked rap idly away in the direction of the grave yard where he was buried. The dis tance to my house not being far, I was soon within tbe house, relating this won derful phenomena to my family. Why the old gentleman should be disturbed, or why Jbe should seek .me, especially, to relate any grievances from which he may he suffering, I cannot surmise, but the facts are as 1 have related them to you without exaggeration or equivocation.' jarTha i Committee appointed to ex amine the Annual Report of the Com missioners of Franklin county, say in their report to tbe Court : 'Your committee find that under the present statute regulating the payment of claims against tbe Infirmary, it would seem that the County Auditor has no discretion in the matter, but must draw his warrant on tbe treasury for tbe amount claimed when signed by the In firmary Directors; likewise that the County Commissioners have no control over disbursements for supplies on ac count of the Infirmary, and that the itemized bills for 6nch supplies only come before them in their semi-annual settlement with tbe Infirmary Directors, at which time said claims for supplies, etc i have already been paid.' J i "In view of the increasing expendi tures, on behalf of the Infirmary, . and in order that the disbursements of pub lic moneys may be! confined to as few officials as possible, tbe committee here by suggest the following amendments to the statutes which now exist :" First That all claims against the In firmary should be verified under oath, to be correct as to the amount and value by the person or persons furnishing such supplies. - -; - Second That all such claims, before payment, should be audited and allowed by the Commissioners as other claims against the. county are audited nand al lowed.: Y ;;; v.'l'T " ThlrdApplications for relief 'should be made under oath, specifying that the person applying is needy, and is - with out tbe available means of support. If the Legislature will not abolish the useless office ' of Infirmary 'Director, ' it ought to adopt the above . amendments. 1 jt-The Board of County Commis sioner's allowed the following bills last week : - .tH..J.
