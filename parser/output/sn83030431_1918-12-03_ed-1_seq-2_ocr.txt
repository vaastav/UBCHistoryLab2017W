THE SUN, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 3, 1918. 44 likewise. A few of them gave voice to the ahrlll "rebel yell'' In their- eager ness to stir Congress up to approval, One or two Senators clapped tlielr hands feebly. Instead ot stampeding the Congress the coldness of two-thirds of the House and practically all of the Senate was brought Into sharper relief by tho ex travagant behavior of the comparative handful of npptauders who sought to catch up their colleagues and carry them along with them. Not n llnml I'rom Itri?nllleuua, On tho Republican side not a single hand wos lifted, not one man stood up, The Senators gazed unbunkingly Into the President's face and made no move to Indicate anything but disapproval of the course he has selected without consultation with ono of them. Republicans remembering another appeal a little over a month ago bit terly resented the President coming to them for old again. As pooh as the President had left tho hall of the House they pointed out excitedly to each other that had the people of the nation followed the President In the appeal for the election of Democrats only In the next Congress none of them would be there to give or refuse aid or support. They recalled that on occasions when the Democrats fulled tho President on vital wnr measures Republican .Senators and Representa tives had saved tho Administration. To-day was the tlrat opportunity which the Republicans had to show whether they were willing, to forgive and forget what they cannot avoid feeling was gross Ingratitude when tho President asked the voter:! of the country to defeat them In the elec tions. They showed plainly In their reception of the President's appeal for aid that they have not forgiven and are not likely to forget. This almost uniform coluness on the part of the Senate grew more and more apparent throughout tho speech, becoming most pronounced when It be came evident that the 'resident was to content himself with nothing more than an appeal for support In his tasks abroad and that ho was not going to let down the barrier and take Congress Into his confidence. Cold Formality Observed. The Congress, despite Its bitter and cold attitude toward the President, did not forget tho deference due the offlce lield by Woodrow Wllaon. When he entered the House the House and Sen ate arose en masse until the President mounted the rostrum. Again when he had concluded his address and was on the point of leaving the Congress arose and remained standing until the Presi dent left. From the moment of the President's arrival It was evident thut the break at last had come between the Presi dent and' Congress. The President felt It immediately. Beginning at his cx tremo right he slowly scanned first the faces of the men of his own party and then those of his political oppo nents. Meanwhile the Democratic side applauded perfunctorily. Not a hand moved on the Republican side of tho centre aisle. Speaker Clark banged down his gavel and said: "Gentlemen of the Sixty fifth Congress, I present the President of. the United States." The President without further de "1 lay plunged Into his prepared speech. For fifteen minutes the President dwelt on tho achievements the United Htatea had to Its 'credit slnco entering the war. Beginning with the training and shipment abroad of an American army he traced the progress of the Avar through the great supportihgtir-- sanitation of the Industries of the country which made It possible to put this great army In France. He paid hlf h tribute to the mettle and quality ofthe men and officers sent over and the sailors who kept the seas and the national spirit behind both. Plea for Wdmnn 8anraie. The President's tribute to the women of tho country followed Immediately. With It ho coupled another plea that they bo made the equals of men so far as political right's are concerned. , "These great days of completed achievement would be sadly marred were we to omit that act of Justice." lie said. Throughout this part of the Presi dent's speech applause was liberal from both sides. The President de parted from this theme to urge the ttenate to ratify the Colombian treaty and then turned to purely domestic questions, mainly reconstruction and the question of railroad ownership. lie admitted frankly to Congress that In alt he had heard on reconstruction he had. seen no general scheme for work- . -ng ii oui. e iook me aimuue aiso that American business did not want io toe "coached or led." The President scouted the necessity of any reconstruction programme with this statement: "It the process of re turning business to o peace footing promises to outrun any Inquiry that may be Instituted and any aid that may b offered. It will not be easy to direct It any better than It will di rect Itself." Land for .soldlrra. The President warned Congress that In his opinion action must be taken to provide for returning soldiers and urged the frlondly consideration of the j)Ian evolved by the Secretary of tho anterior for tho reclamation of arid iind swamp lands. The lYesldent made an earnest plea to Congress for continuation of the naval building programme regardless fit the contemplated action of the peace conference in limiting armaments. "It would clearly be unwise for us to attempt to adjust our programme to n future world policy as yet undeter mined," he said. He then turned to the nuestlon of the railways and after out inlng the threo policies which might be followed admitted frankly that ho had -no ronnaeni juagmcnv or ins own at this time. Tho President emphasized tht point that It would be impossible to complete full equipment for the railroads planned by the Government during the period they have left to remain under Government control. The President set forth three alter nativesreleasing the roads outright, romplete Government control, accom panied possibly by Government own ership, and modified private control finder a more affirmative public reso lutlon, so as to avoid "wusteful com petition." He said It would ho a dis service to the public and to the owners if tho railroads to turn them back In their present condition. Port of Antwerp 0ivnrl.

VACANT PRESIDENCY AROUSES CONGRESS Hoih Houses Look to LMucing Marshall In "White Itonsc When Wilson Goes. TWO JtESJOLUTlONS JIBAUY .Senator Sherman Wants to . Have Klcction to Kill the Office. Speviul Deipnleh to Tin Htv. Washington, Dec. 2. Before Presi dent Wilson arrived at tho Capitol to day to make the announcement to Congress of his Intention to go abroad, action had been begun In both houses looking to the substitution of the Vice President as tho authoritative head of the nation In his absence. In the House Representative Roden berg (111.) Introduced a concurrent resolution which, after reciting at length tho various domestic problems with which the Chief Executive might be railed upon to deal In addition to the constitutional functions which he must perform, provided for the tem porary delegation of the. duties of President to Vice-President Marshall. In the Senate a similar resolution had been drawn? up by Senator Sher man (III.), the only differenco In tho two being that In Senator Sherman's document It was proposed to declare the Executive office vacant until an election mrgTtr-De held. There is considerable support for Representative Rodenberg's pro gramme. This senttment Is not bounded by party limitations. It is known that Senator lodge (Mass.), the Republican leader, is not In sym pathy with the suggestion, holding that the constitutional definition of "Inability to exercise the powers nnfl duties" of the Presidential office does not Include absence from the terri torial boundaries of the United States hut on the other hand Senator Hitchcock (Nebraska, chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations, admitted to-day that he believed the Vice-President should so serve and said that ho thought the absence of the President constituted that "in ability" mentioned in the Federal Con stitution. It is known that a considerable number of Democrats In both the House and Senate believe that the President's absence actually creates at least -a temporary vacancy and un doubtedly If tho Rodenberg or Sher man measures reach, n vote In either House these Democrats will vote for such a resolution. The legality of any acts performed by the President while abroad in ap proving or vetoing legislation, making appointments to office or exercising any of the executive functions and likewise the legality of any acts per formed by the Vice-President under the authority of the concurrent reso lution of Congress introduced to-day undoubtedly will be called in question in the courts if tho Rodenberg or Sherman resolution should bo adoptert. This is the principal deterrent to notion and the real occasion for doubt as to the enactment at least ot the less offensive of the two. Senator Cummins (Iowa) Introduced a resolution to send to France a com mittee of eight Senators, four of each great political p'arty, to keep the Sen ate In close touch with developments of the conference. The resolution was referred to the Foreign Relations Committee, which meets on Wednesday. It apparently Is more than likely that that commit tee in a day or two, after will report tho resolution to tho Senate with no comment. This would afford the Sen ate opportunity to discuss the merits of the proposal. It is regarded as highly essential that some such meas ure should be ready for adoption If the Senate finds Itself shut out from Infor mation of tho progress of the confer ences. Unless this occurs, however. It Is believed there will be little chance of Its adoption. 

LITTLETON URGES BARRING OF BERGER Says Socialism Is Merely Mili tarism Disarmed. Some way ought to be found to pre vent Victor Uerger, the Milwaukee Socialist who has been reelected to Congress, from taking his seat in March, so Martin W. L,ttlelon told tho "Flying Squadron" of the Na tional Security League's contingent of patriotic orators at the Bar Asso ciation last night. Congressmen, Mr. Littleton explained, are required to take an oath to support the Constitu tion of the United States, whereas "Mr. Uerger Is pledged, as is every Socialist, to destroy It." "The Socialist doesn't know much " ho added, "but he known HiIh: That as long as there Is a Constitution a Socialist can't thrive in thlH country. Socialism and Bolshevtkism are both Teutonic by-products. Tho Teuton of to-day is lncupablo of thinking of Individual freedom. Ho oscillates be tween militarism und Socialism. Mil itarism Is nothing lAit Socialism armed and Socialism Is militarism disarmed. Socialism stands for an archy and the destruction of civiliza tion. "The causo of the war was abso lutism. The curse of the mar waa ab solutism, and It's our business to see that tho consequence of the war Is not absolutism. There aro some who are preaching 'Athenian democracy' and they will bo Socialists if thoy keep on far enough, I am a constitutionalist.

"I expected," Dr. Butler said, "be fore ho went away a very careful set ting forth of tho policies tho country would be called upon to support. There Is a diffuse lncoucluslvcness about the wholo thing." "The most heartening and stimu lating thing about President Wilson's message is his recognition of tho ca pacity of the American business man to throw off the harness of Govern ment control and return to the arena of freedom without leading strings," said Martin W. Mttleton, "The policy, of reconstruction does not need to be discussed. Leave tho American alone with what lis has gained and he will work out reconstruction himself," 

LIMIT ON PRIVATE RAIL CONTROL URGED Continued from First Pagt approach the question, at once the most Important and difficult of all tho domestic questions which confront us, with a fair, open mind, ready to hear all that Is to be said, on It and willing to view It from every standpoint and then decide without fear, favor or prejudice. The third Is that Congress should go forward immediately with n painstaking, conscientious and ex haustive Inquiry Into tho whole prob lem and pursue It with the utmost diligence until a conclusion has been reached." Senator Kellogg (Minn.) said: "The only question of reconstruction which T desire to mention Is that per taining to the railroads. In tho main I approve of what the President said. I do not believe we should simply re lease the roads and go back to the o'd conditions or that they should' be taken over to government ownership and operation. I think the Immediate course suggested by the President should be adopted." Representative Eech (Wis.), Re publican, Vbo will succeed to the chairmanship of the interstate Com merce Committee, snld: "I think government operation has demonstrated the wisdom of open or common tormlnals In the large cen tres, the free Interchange of oars and engines, the short routing of freight so as to save time, the consolidation of offices, the control of Issues of stocks and bonds, and the pajment of generous but not extravagant salaries to officials In charge tf the management of transportation.

Architect, with Krward A. Keeler. former president of the New York State Association of Builders. Three conditions huve created this willingness to cut bids for futuro con struction work below war time prices. Th first Is the Increased stability of labor. Tho second condition Is the re appearance of competition lu the de livery of materials brought about by tho telief ot transportation hindrances and tho resumption of long haul deliveries. The third factor Is the elimination of irresponsible contractors during the stress of the war period and the re sulting grouping of contractors who have stood the tests of war emergency conditions.

DREICER&C0 I 8 PearlzAecfdaces m ffl riFTH AVENUE of TORTY-SIXTH LOCAL EDITORIALS ON WILSON SPEECH -The World' Dwells on Kcfer ence to I-rcsidcnt's Visit to Paris. SO-Mtf A II K UNAPPHOVING The -Times' Says Public Docs Not Know President's Heal Purposes. New York newspapers comment on tho President's message this morning as follows: Tho World Those who looked for an elaboration .of his reasons for at tending the Peace Conference In Presi dent Wilson's annual adircss to Con gress yesterday were disappointed, ot course. In the nature of things, the stronger his conviction thut his pres ence In Paris Is necessary the less he could say about It publicly. Aside from tho few words devoted by Mr. Wilson to his diplomatic er rand, his address was almost as per functory as one of tho old time written messages of the Presidents. He could have said no less of the triumph of our arms nt the crisis of the war, or of the devotion of the people, or of the necessity for wiso measures of recon struction, or of the importance of placing our vast Industries upon n peace basis with proper recognition of public rights. He might have said less In regard to woman BUffrage by national amendment, and If he had not been Intent upon going abroad upon nn errand which few Americans under stand, he' might have said a great deal more, on the subject of the railroad and shipping problems, for which, we nre sorry to say, he had no solution to offer. The Times Nobody can or will doubt the President's sincere desire to represent American thought at Paris. The trouble Is that upon many of the "bases" of peace drawn up by htm last January American thoight Is ns yet unformed and the American people know his thought only as lie has put It before them In the broadest outlines. Specifically, they havo practically no knowledge of what ho intends to say in respect to the freedom of the seas and tho Leiguo of Nations. ... It will be admitted that with all our sud den and Idealistic devotion to open diplomacy. It might have been inex pedient to open all these matters to public discussion, but for all the people know Mr. Wilson has made up his mind upon these weighty matters without resort to the counsel of other minds. The Herald What Congress wanted "to hear was the "why" of the visit to Europe. It heard about what It had heard before. The President said that the allied Governments had asked him to attend the peace conference In order to make clear the meaning of his "fourteen points," and he felt, there fore, that lie should go. Ho failed, however, to give his reasons for object ing to the Vice-President performing the duties that would setm clearly to devolve upon that official during the period when the President is unable to perform them. j o tne aiuimie or -Mr. wuson towaru Mr. Thomas Riley Marshall remains as great a mystery as ever. Tho Tribune: Mr. Wilson Is Impa tient with those who are continually requiring definitions and toxtual certi tudes. His mind function with prin ciples. Its attitude toward his errand In Europe cannot be altered by criti cism or analogy, for It is an emotional attitude. This is revealed fully In the exhortation at the end, which reads: May I now hope, gentlemen of the Congress, that in the delicate tasks 1 shall have to perform on the other Hide of the ea. In my efforts truly and faithfully to Interpret the principles and purposes of the country wc love, I may have the encouragement and the added strength of your united support? I realize the magnitude and the diffi culty of the duty I am undertaking. 1 am poignantly aware of Its grave re sponsibilities. I nm the servant of the nation.

ADDRESS COMMENT FROM OTHER CITIES Chicago "Tribune" Objects to "Present Agencies. Comment on the President's address to Congress yesterday by reprcsenta tlvo newspapers In various cities Is given In the following special des patches to The Si's, quoting excerpts from editorials which will appear to day: Chicago Tribune The President's address to Congress Is In large part an eloquent review of American achievement In this world war. It expresses with the felicity to which his public utterances have accustomed us what Is In the American mind and heart In these epochal days of victory. In respect of the President's con crete suggestions there will bo differ ences of opinion. The statement ns to the purpose of his Journey to the peace conference Is of a general na ture and does not attempt to answer the objection ralseda gainst thedepart ure. The proposal of tho President to fallow present agencies to preside 'over the critical and complicated conditions In which wc already are Involved Is neither reassuring nor Bafe. Boston Herald A notably brief frac tlon of the President's address to Con gress yesterday deals with tho subject of paramount Interest to the American peoplo, and that la the war's termina tion and his own part In It. We In cline to the bollef, however, that they uro disposed to trust him to perform his duty lu his own way. They would rrsent, we believe, any of tho plans, like that which Senator Cummins of Iowa has proposed, for sending over a special representation to which the course of events In behalf of the Sen nte. That would be unfortunate. The President Is entirely correct In saying that wo ought to establish a definite national railroad policy, that It Is not fair to either the public or the owners of the roads to leave the question unanswered. Wo ought to bo spared from having 2,000,000 rail road workers vote at each Presidential election for the .party which promises to pay them tho best. Boston Post The President's mes sage is much more along conventional lines than was are.ierally anticipated. But for Its fine and at times elo quent diction and but for Its flnm phrates It might tnke Its place among the old fashioned messages wherein a President Is called upon to glvo to Congress information of the state of the t'nlon and recommend such meas ures as he shall Judgo necessary. So reconstruction problems and. measures hold a very large place In the message. I.ouIstHIo Courier-Journal It Is on the question of our future railroad policy that he Is particularly discon certing. The regret is that the Presi dent does not make known with all his poSItIvene of conviction and clearness of purpos;- which course he means to urge and which he means to oppose. It would be worth something at tljis time If the great leader of thu great American democracy, forgetting for the moment the beauty and elegance of his diction, would thunder Just once and read Jackson's "By the Eternal Me" in the face of those who aro mak ing no concealment of their desire and design to take advantage of the pres ent situation to place the rallroai's permanently In the hands of the Fed eral Government. Philadelphia Pnbllc Ledger The President achloved tho somewhat no tablo feat yesterday of maintaining silence in n.OOO words on any contro versial peace topics which may bo In the air. He has chosen to play a lone hand. This is always a course of peril not only in this case for the player but for the country, and quite possi bly for humanity. We shall only get the proper per spective on the President's attitude to-, ward these perplexing problems of peace If we keep constantly in mind the fact rather difficult for us to en visage or even admit that Woodrow Wilson has become during this tre mendous war and worldwide uplieavul of long established political conditions something mora than President of these United States. He has made i .tnself and It surely was not an un American action the foremost spokes man of the forward looking liberals ot Europe. It is idle to deny that if Woodrow Wilson had not gone to the peaco con ference there aro long submerged millions on the plains of Czecho-Slo-vaklu, in Jugo-Shivia, in Poland and even in Russia, who would feci that a powerful friend rm whom they had confidently counted would be absent. Kansas City Star President Wil son speaks In fitting words of the Hilrlt of the nation in the war. His plea for preference In raw material for France and Belgium will meet with in stant response. His comment on the rapidity of Industrial reconstruction and on the future of the railroads Is Judicious. But on the subject that Is In everybody's mind, the subject of the peaco terms to be written In Paris in the next few weeks, he Is thor oughly disappointing. It Is a safe assumption that the na tion is not yet ready for any such rad ical change of policy as the President has urged. Certainly It has not given thorough consideration to such n pol icy or expressed aprrnvsl for It The Congress which will bo called on to carry out the provisions of the treaty will be hostile. St. Paul Pioneer Tress Neither the humblest of us nor the highest Is to have a share In safeguarding the fruits of victory that Is a matter which the President, In his queer sense of per sonal responsibility, has confided to himself alone.

Every Ilepub llcan who had anything to say about the President's address to-day disap proved of the President's determina tion to go to Franco as a peaco dele gate representing the United States. There also wero some Democrats who took the same course. The strongest criticism was directed at the failure ot the President to take ndvantuge of hla opportunity to-day and remove the cause of tho growing estrangement between the White House and the Capitol by taking the Congress fully Into his confidence In regard to what he hoped to accomplish at the peace conference. Senators Lodge (Mass.) and Martin (Va.), leaders of tlielr parties, with held any comment. "1 must leavo those matters to the press," said Sena tor Martin. "My rule ot never com menting upon executive utterances, either privately or publicly spoken, cannot bo broken.' Penrose Hneaks Oat, These comments wero made: Senator Penrose (Pa.', Republican: "The President nan employed such dic tatorial method and haa almost with out exception expressed his determined opinion upon nil legislation even when ho has changed his mind completely from views expressed In previous ut terances that considerable surprise was expressed among those that heard him that there Is at least one public ques tion, and that of overwhelming Im portance, on which he actually lias no opinion at nil; that Is the question of public ownership or control of rail roads. At least In this matter he Is courteous enough to Invite the opinion of the Senators and Representatives, and he will doubtless hear from them and from the American peoplo upon Government ownership In unmistak able terms after- the Railroad Com mittee has had full power to Investi gate the orders and methods under which the railroad systems of the country have been nearly ruined and certainly demoralized." Senator Simmons (N. C ). Demo crat: "His discussion of the business sit uation 'and the processes of readjust ment. Including his general observ ations with reference to the methods of dealing with the railroads, will have, I am sure, a ery reassuring effect upon business and on the public." Sriintor need Protects. Senator Reed (Mo.), Democrat: "The President says all nations have approved of the fourteen peace points. No nation approved of tho fourteen peace points. Tho President says our soldiers fought for these. Our soldiers fought to whip Germany. I wholly disagree with the President that we should assist in the rehabilitation of France. On domestic questions I am in substantial accord with the Presi dent." Senator Johnson (Cal ), Republican: "Tho deserved tribute to our fighting men found a sympathetic echo with us all, but the remainder of the Presi dent's address was intensely disap pointing. We know no more now than we did before the address. The Presi dent leaves us without an administra tive programme for reconstruction of definite American policies as to peace terms." Senator Sherman (ill ), Republican "The President does not convince by his reasons for going abroad. The more ho argues the less ho Justifies himself There s not a negotiation of perma nent peace that could not as well he conducted with the President at his seat of government in Washington as In Versailles." Senator Harding (Ohio), Republican: "The message was not revealing so far as peaco terms are concerned, but ono does not expect the spokesman of the Western hemisphere to reveal his hand In advance," Representative Mann (111 ), Republi can floor leader: "I was disappointed that the Presi dent did not tako Congress and tho American peoplo into his confidence regarding his attendance at the Paris Peace Conference." Representative Gillett (Mass.), act ing Republican floor leader: "It was the Inost disappointing nnd least effective message that President Wilson has ever delivered. This was duo largely. I presume, to the fact that we wero keyed up to expect that he was going to give us some of the teal reasons for going abroad and ulscusHing the particular projects he wants to urge ot the Peace Confer ence." Representative Fess (Ohio), chair man of tho Republican Congressional commutes: "The address was not up to the standard of the President. Staged as his farewell before leaving for 13u rope, the country was looking for reasons for his decision. His reference to It seemed n labored defenco of a very questionable proceeding." Champ Clark, Speaker of tho House: "It was a flno message, literary oh ull of tho President's messages havo been." Representative Kltchln (N.
