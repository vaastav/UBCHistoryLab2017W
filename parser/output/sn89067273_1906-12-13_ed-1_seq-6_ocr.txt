DETAILS IN ANNUAL REPORT THE BROWN8VILLE AFFAIR. PRE8IDENT TELL8 WATERWAYS DELEGATES HE FAVORS IN CREASED APPROPRIATIONS. NEED IMPROVEMENTS Feeta That the Government Should Concern Itself With the Better ment of the Great Water Trade Arteries. Washington President Roosevelt told the delegates to the national riv ers and harbors convention, who called on him at the White House, that he would consult with the leaders In con gress, and expressed the hope that something definite and effective could bo done in the way of increased ap propriations for the Improvement of the nation's waterways. The presi dent, after expressing his pleasure at meeting of the members of the delega tion, said: The President's Views. "I have come to feel a growing sense of the Importance to establish ing a far-reaching coherent plan for the general Improvement of the water ways of the country. I was first led to consideration of that plan by con sidering another plan for the use of water, not in connection with prepar ing the land at the head of the river to produce the harvests that later in part should be carried on .the rivers lower down that is, in connection with the Irrigation policy, in which 1 bo strongly believe as vital to the welfare of the Rocky mountain and adjacent states. Just as I feel that the national government should con cern Itself with utilization of the wa ter of rivers In their sources where the country Is dry, so I feel the na tional government should concern itself with the proper control and utili zation of the water lower down in the river, where they are fitted to be the great, arteries of communication. I have had It brought strikingly to my attention, but recently, how much we suffer at present because of the Inade quate transportation facilities of the railways for moving the great grain crops and cattle crop of this country. We need and must have further facili ties for transportation, and as has been well pointed out, one of the effctlve methods of effecting railway rates is to provide for a proper" sys tem of water transportation. It would not be possible for me to enter Into any discussion of the details of your plan until I have spoken with some of the leaders of the two houses of congress. I shall consult with them at once, and trust that somewhat defi nite and effective can be done along the lines that you mention. You un derstand, gentlemen, I could not off hand commit myself to the details of any policy without taking Into con sideration what the feeling of the co ordinate branch would be, and I must be guided largely by their views. 1 am Bure that you will find there the genuine, patriotic purpose to do what is best for the interest of our common country." Oppose Citizenship for Porto Rlcans. Washington The democrats in the house opposed the consideration of the bill conferring United State3 citizen ship on the inhabitants of Porto Rico. Chairman Cooper, of Wisconsin, un der the call of committees, called the attention of the house to the erroneous position of the bill on the union cal endar, insisting that its proper place was on the house calendar. Mr. Clark, of Missouri leading the minor ity, objected to its transfer, hut Speaker Cannon decided with Mr. Cooper that it properly belongs on the bouse calendar. i Holocaust at Cornell. Ithaca, N.

Washington In his annual report Secretary Taft devotes considerable space to a defense and explanation of the course of the war department in connection with the discharge without honor from the military service of the battalion of the Twenty-fifth infantry, which was stationed at Brownsville, Tex., last summer. The secretary de tails the events of the night of Aug. 13, Involving the "shooting up of the town" of Brownsville by anywhere from nine to twenty members of this battal ion. He is very severe In his con demnation of the non-commissioned of ficers of the battalion for failing to discover and report the perpetrators of the outrage, and of the enlisted men of the battalion who, by maintain ing silence when, as he says, they must have known the guilty parties connived at the crime. For Good of the 8ervice. "It may be that In the battalion are a number of men wholly innocent, who know neither who the guilty men are nor any circumstances which will aid In their detection, though this cannot be true of many," says the secretary. "Because there may be innocent men in the battalion, must the government continue to use it to guard communi ties of men, women and children when it contains so dangerous an element impossible of .detection? Certainly not. When a man enlists in the army he knows that, for the very purpose of protecting itself, the government re serves to itself the absolute right of discharge, not as a punishment, but for the public safety or interest. It goes without saying that If the guilty could be ascertained they should and would be punished, hut the guilty can not be ascertained, and the very im possibility of determining who are the guilty makes the whole battalion use less to the government as an instru ment for maintaining law and order. The only means of ridding the military service of a band of would-be murder ers of women and children, and actual murderers of one-man, is the discharge of the entire battalion." AID FARMERS, THE PLEA. House Passes Bill Permitting Banki to Loan on Real Estate. Washington The house has passed the bill permitting national banking associations to make loans on real es tate as security, and limiting the amount of such loans. The vote was 111 to 61. The bankers in tne house urged the passage of the bill, while the op ponents of the measure insisted that real estate was not a proper security for national banks. They contended that the system bad proved a failure wherever tried. Mr. Hepburn, of Iowa, and Mr. Wil liams, of Mississippi, the minority leader, were enthusiastically in favor of the measure, urging that the bill would aid the farmers very greatly and have a tendency to reduce stock speculation. A FLOOD-SWEPT TOWN. Clifton, Ariz., with 3,000 Population, Inundated Many Drowned. Solomonvllle, Ariz. As the result of thirty hours' steady rain over south ern Arizona, the mining town of Clif ton, with 3,000 population, is swept by a terrific flood, and hundreds of peo ple have fled to the mountains for safety. The known death list reaches 18, and will doubtless be much larger. A large majority of the population are Mexicans and Italians, who live in squalid huts. The town is built in three sections, Chase Creek and North and South Clifton. The catastrophe commenced with the breaking of a big reservoir in the mountain above, pre cipitating a vast flood upon the Chase Creek section. North and South Clif ton are swept by the current of tne San Francisco river. Big Strike of Seamen In Russia. Odessa Suppression of the Sea men's union by the government has been followed by a strike of the sea men, with the result that the business of the shipping companies is complete ly tied up. About 11,000 men are out. The government appealed to Admiral Skrydloff, commandant of the Black sea fleet, to send sailors from Sevasto pol to relieve the situation, but the admiral refused to do so, fearing that tne Bailors would Join the strikers.

Washington The house, by a vote of 110 to 164, defeated the bill of Representative Llttlefleld, of Maine, removing discriminations) against American sailing vessels in the coast ing trade.

PRESIDENT LET THE SENATORS , KNOW HE COURTED PEN ROSE RESOLUTION. THE SHIP SUBSIDY BILL Proposal That Thfe Measure Be 8o Amended aa to Limit Subsidies to South American and Oriental Trade. Washington During the debate In the senate on the Penrose and Fora ker resolutions in reference to the discharge of negro troops, the report was current among senators that the president felt it would be a matter of courtesy if the resolution should be addressed to himself, and so strong, It was said, was this feeling on his part, that he had intimated that un less this course was taken, there would be no response. Both Resolutions Adopted. Washington The senate adopted the Penrose resolution, asking the president for information regarding the discharge of the negro troops of the Twenty-fifth infantry; also the Foraker resolution, directing the sec retary of war to transmit information on the same subject. Both resolu tions carried an identical amendment by Mr. Culberson, asking specifically for the order to Maj. Penrose com manding the troops, which directed jt u fcrf w ttittd W WW w W'W W m Roosevelt's Message on Canal to Washington, D. C. President Roosevelt will breax another prece dent by sending an illustrated mes sage to congress. It will be bis spe cial message on the Panama canal. Accompanying this communication will be about fifty photographs, show ing the actual condition existing in the canal rone. When the message Is read and the photographs are exhib ited every senator and representative will be able to get a clear idea of ex actly what is being done there. The president holds that photographs, liko figures, do not He. A special photographer, with elab orate apparatus, was sent to Colon a few days ahead of the president. His arrival there was almost simultaneous with that of Chairman Shonts, under whose personal direction he set about making pictures. Almost every possi ble, view between Colon and Panama had been photographed before the ar rival of the president. After that the him not to turn over to the Texas au thorities certain of the troops asked. This action followed two hours' de bate on the propriety of asking the president for the information, or of directing the secretary of war to fur nish It. Mr. Spooner urged that in matters where congress had an absolute right to information in the possession of the executive, It had always been cus tomary to direct a cabinet officer to furnish it. In matters where It had not this right, and in which there was some doubt about the advisability of publicity, congress usually made a request on the president if it de sired the information with the under standing that it should be furnished "if not incompatible with the 'public Interest." The Ship Subsidy BUI. Washington Compromise on the snip subsidy bill seems to be in sight. At the meeting of the house commit tee on merchant marine and fisheries. Chairman Grosvenor suggested an amendment to the Galllnger bill, which will limit subsidies to the South American and oriental trade. The amended bill will be in harmony with Secretary Root's policy for trade ex tensions as outlined in recent speeches in the west; Representative Watson, of Indiana, the republican whip, expressed the opinion that the committee could get a favorable re port on a bill limiting the subsidies to Latin-American and oriental lines.

Yet Sooner or Later, Paper Declares, Westerners Must Recognize Asiatic Equality. London The Daily Mall publishes an editorial on the difficulties of tne United States with Japan over the school question in San Francisco. The paper is of the opinion that in spite of the gravity of the situation, owing to the fact that President Roosevelt has not power to coerce California, it is foolish to suggest that Japan would enforce her rights at the cannon's mouth. Japan certainly has no Inten tion of picking a quarrel with the United States, the paper says. Ameri ca has been ber firm friend in the past, hen rulers will be able to make large allowances for the difficulties of America, and as President Roose velt Is certain to meet Japan's re quests In a fair and kindly spirit, the incident will pass and be forgotten. "Yet sooner or later," the Daily Mall 1 concludes, "the west will have to reckon with the fact of Asiatic claims io peneci equamy wun me western er." Many Japanese Hear of Hawaii. Honolulu, via San Francisco F.. Y.

GILLETTE JURY VERDICT The Prisoner Showed No Emotion ( When the Foreman Read the Result How the Jury Stood. Herkimer, N. Y. The Jury In the trial of Chester E. Gillette for the murder of bis sweetheart, Grace Brown, at Big Moose lake on July 11, returned a verdict of guilty la the first degree. Former Senator Mills, Gillette' counsel, before adjournment, an nounced that when court re-convened he would move to have the verdict set aside. The jury, which had deliberated for five hours, sent word that a verdict had been reached. A moment later they filed Into the court room and an officer, who had been sent for Gillette, returned with the prisoner. Gillette Showed No Emotion. Pale and a trifle nervous, Gillette faced the Jury and when Marsnal Hatch, the foreman, declared that a verdict of guilty In the first degree had been found, the youthful prisoner gave no sign of emotion. A few mo ments later, when his counsel had an nounced his purpose of making a for mal motion that the verdict be set aside, and ihe judge was dismissing the jurors, Gillette bent over a nearby table, and picking up a pencil, wrote something on a sheet of paper. He then folded the paper carefully and placed it in his pocket. Immediately afterwards he was taken from the court room back to his cell in the Jail. It waa learned that the jury had some difficulty in reaching an agree ment, and that six ballots were taken before the twelve men agreed. Up to that time the jury had stood 11 for conviction and 1 for acquittal. The following Is what Gillette wrote: "Father I am convicted Ches ter." It was a message to his father who Is In Denver. "If the reporters want to see me," he said to Sheriff Richards, "tell them I have nothing to say, only that I did not expect that verdict." TWO IMPORTANT QUESTIONS. Liquor Traffic and Church and State In Oklahoma. Guthrie, Okla. President Murray of the constitutional convention, has ap pointed two more Important commit tees, namely, those on the regulation of the liquor traffic and on county boundaries. That on liquor regulation 1-j headed by Luke Roberts, of Olus tee, as chairman. The general be lief Is that two-thirds of the members of the latter committee, which will pass on the prohibition provision of the new constitution, favor state-wide prohibition. A resolution was presented by an Oklahoma delegate calling on the con vention to draft a law maintaining the individuality of church and state. The resolution was a practical embodiment of a memorial from Seventh Day Ad ventlsts. The memorial is signed by 5,000 and asks that no reference be made in the constitution to any day to be set aside for public worship. BUT 

FIVE WORLD POWER8. Thus Argues Prof. Coolidge, of Har vard, in Paris. Paris, France. A large audience as sembled at the Sorbonne to hear the op ulng lecture of Prof. Archibald Cary Coolidge, of Harvard university. Among those present were several French educators and publicists. It is the purpose of Prof. Coolidge to de velop In his lectures the theme of the United States as a world power. He defines a world power as a country vviiost. economic and political Interests av universal. He contended that there are only five such powers Gr;at Britain, France, Germany, Rus sia and the United States, the last named having entered the classifica tion alter the Spanish-American war. Cotton Growing In Africa. Manchester, Eng. Delivering an ad dress at the banquet of the British Cotton Growing association, Winston Spencer Churchill, under secretary for the colonies, referred to the necessity of building a railroad in Nigeria, to assist in the development of cotton growing. He said the day was not far distant when Great Britain would be forced to embark upon a great scheme for the amalgamation of the West African colonies of Sierra Leon, the Gold Coast and the two Nigerlas, which he characterized as an empire. The Case of William Nelson Cromwell.

The Ship Subsidy Bill May Be Brought to the Front, and Currency and , the Tariff Discussed. Washington The passage of the appropriation bills and as little other general legislation as possible, Such, in brief is the forecast for thr short session of the Fifty-ninth congress. It is evident that for various reasons It will not be possible to do much, on the appropriation bills before the- ... holidays and this circumstance will practically have the effect of con--denslng the consideration of the 14 large supply measures into two months. Considering that the aggre gate of the appropriations to be wilL approximate one billion dollars, same senators and members express the opinion that congress cannot do bet" ter than give all of its time to these measures. The Ship Subsidy Bill. The ship subsidy bill probably will be an exception to the rule for no general legislation. The friends of that measure have never been, morer Insistent than now. They are extreme--ly hopeful and yet very apprehensive. The bill has passed the' senate and. Is in committee in the house. The committee has heretofore been quite evenly divided, but the advocates of the bill believe that they will be able to get it out in due season,' and they hope for Its consideration when oncer reported to the house. One Incident that is very materially helping the' subsidy is the recent speech of Secre--tary Root in support of it. Currency and Inheritance Tax. Not a few members of both houses are anxious to meet the demands of the bankers and others for a more elastic currency, and It Is quite cer--tain that there will be efforts to sup--ply this want, but there are so many plans that even the most sincere be llevers in the necessity almost despair of accomplishing anything in that di rection during a short session. The Tariff and Other Questions. Among the questions slated for a, liberal share of discussion, the tariff stands at the head, of the list, but no one has the least idea' that any seri ous effort will now be made to secure the modifications which even many republicans think desirable.' The pres ident, who himself desires some changes, has recently promised his congressional callers that he will not ask to hare the subject taken up at this time. The Japanese question, the discharge of the negro soldiers, the- . desirability of an Income tax law, the result of the late elections an 1 th ' trusts are also slated for discussion. Senator Smoot'a Case. The senate will give attention to- ) the case of Senator Reed Smoot, but what it will do about It not even the senate wishes now to contemplate. There has from the first been a dis position to put the. Smoot matter aside, but with the report of the com mittee on privileges and elections on the calendar, and Chairman Burrows quite determined to pres3 considera tion, the fact that the matter must oe dealt with is beginning to impress ' itself upon members, and they are preparing seriously for lt3 considera tion. The Michigan senator will set the ball rolling Monday, the 10th Inst. The Panama Canal. Much interest attaches to the presi dent's forthcoming recommendations concerning the Panama canal, espe cially because of his recant visit to the canal zone. It is not expected that he will ask much legislation be yond the necessary appropriations, and there is a general dlspasltl n to grant these. The Increase of tho navy will receive much consideration, but there is still opposition to the proposed ship of the Dreadnaught class.
