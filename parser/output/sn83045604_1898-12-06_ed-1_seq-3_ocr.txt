Continued From Fa are On®. absence of any reference to "points con cerning which we mott desire Information." He said, however, that it was & valuable historical pater. and would oe convenient for future referent*. Senator Teller 'aid there would be disap pointment over the failure of the president to outline a government for the Philip pines, saying. "There will be some disap pointment in this, for I think the under standing has been that the president wouii indicate what form of government shouhi be provided for thrs-- n- - * ; -^s-iff".* but it is wise for the president not to indicate his views on that subject, for that i» pure ly and properly a leg.&latlve quest.on, and one that should be left to congress." On the recommendation in regard to cur rency, Senator Teller said: "The friends of bl-merallJsm. either national or Interna tional, will find no encouragement from anything that the president says in h s message. No reference is made to interna tional bi-metaii.sm. but the preside nt in the most emphatic way indicates his intention to maintain the gold standard. The so called Silver Republicans who remain In the Republican party and contend that the Republican party is friendly to silver will find no encouragement in the president's mi- and it will strike all as somewhat singular that if the Republican party, as it has beer, claimed, is in favor of inter national bi-mttaliiam, the preside#; makes no reference to it." Following are some of the opinions ex pressed by members of congress upon the president's message: Representative Hitt, chairman of the house committee on foreign affairs, said: "The president has summarised and solved in an able and felicitous manner many of the questions in men's minis everywhere touching the immense and rapidly suceee .- lng events and the situation in which th nation find* itself His simple proposition to let the new possessions alone under just anti firm governments and by the military arm which conquered them, gives us plen:> of time for discussion of all the propositions for their permanent government. The prob lem of governing the Cubans he deals with gently and hopefully and everybody will wish that his forecast of stable government there will l>e realised aooner than ever >vt has happened to a Spanish-American pop ulation." Representative Walker, chairman of the committee on banking and currency! "I am asked what I think of the currency and banking features. I do not see that it has any such features. I ha\e not been able to detect any. It contains only one recom mendation as to the currency, repeating thai of a former m-ssage to change the United States legal tender notes into gol I certificates, which would have no effect on the banking and currency s.tuation. but to add to the burden of taxation without in any d-pree favorably affecting the general banking and curren v situation."

Commenting on the president's aurprtsing language concerning the Nicaragua canal, which utterly ignores British treaty rights, the Daily Chronicle say* that "th.s matter w.il arise ere long in a more acute form." Tne editorial highly approves Mr. M ."Kin ley's referents to China and Great Britain. The Standard says Mr. McKinley's refer ences to China is a declaration that, had the open door been closed or obstructed, America would have interfered actively. It adds upon this paint: "For all purposes of British policy, no intimation could be more welcome than that the United States will appoint a commission to study the con ditions In China." The Daily Telegraph, which regards the announcement that the United States will support the open door in China as the weightiest which the message contains, says: "With such common interests to unite us a formal alliance is unnecessary."
