Our Next President, Mr. Lincoln. f 3 lit Government self imposed by tie modK' ia which eaoh recorrinr four Tears bring be'ore the country the ques tion, was shall be onr next President, the ahotoe to ba Bide la of taa moat Tltal con- aeaaeaM. Honesty, ability, devotion to the Constitution and the laws, ere among the requirements. ' The choice of that man lies primarily and legitimately with the people. Men nay endeavor to forestall it by pre-oocn pying public attention with the claims of then, but it will be impossible to defeat the txroular will. Availability alone ifconld not be the motive for the nomina tion ef any mam, whether civil or military. It most be a lubttantial conviction of the amiiV - Mtmlar keart that the nominee la the Tight Joan ia the Tight place. - The question it ; What is (he Wish of the loyal millions whose voice waa recent ly beard from sea to tea? How aie the large Colon majorities to be interpreted ? i Hot limply that the peoplf are deter mined on the re establishment of the Union, bat that they are satisfied with the policy of the President and have confidence ia him. i . : - Let sol the country be b'.lndfolded to this great faot. Overtowering ell other men in the respect and love of a great people, eminent in the practical wisdom and benevolenoe of all bis executive acta, Abraham Lincoln stands preeminent. Teweting above all other men in the good will of the people, he is to-day emphati- ally the people's choice. i Among the reasons why he should le renominated are the following : ; ' 1. The loyal masses have an unshaken oon&Jenoe ia his honesty and ability. In a Presidential contest these qualities are of the highest interest. They muBt of necessity be the most essential requl sites. In these perilous day! of tie Re public it would be unwise to lake an un- tried mpn when wehave one whose ability and wisiom have baen so repeatedly eon- finned. 2. He was elected Chief Magistrate o u TTnited States. He has baen euoh de lurt but not de Jaclo. It is but the just re. ward of his great toils and honest hearted devotion to the Constitution and the laws, that he should preside over a' united peo ple; be a President in faot as well as in rleht The rebels have sooffed at the idea of submission to hie Executive sway. He is fe representative of the people agaitst Whose choice these men rebelled. Ite honor and dignity of this great body of people domand that he shall preside over the entire nation. 6. It is lareely to hiB wisdom and Executive forbearance, as well decision, that the present proud position of the nation in the eyes of En rope is due. Y e are happily at peace with all foreign powers and left to conoenlrale Air immense resources against rebellion at home, instead of frittering it away in aivereal hostility. ! - The people should acknowledge this fact and their obligation to him in, the only fit' ting way : by re affirming their confidence 1 1 his distinguished abilities and sign.; success. There is not a man in the nation whose position for observation and superior knowledge of public affairs is such is is Mr. Lincoln's. S t - He knows what gigantic forses of gcoi ' ami evil are at work. He nn let-stands ex ' perimentally the difficulties that He In the way of re-oonsToctian, and can therefore D t adapt wisT means to deeirable end?. ' The coming four years are to be yi t - mire fruitful, not only in elvil problems a-, home and abroad bnt also,' probably In MHtary questions of most momentor-s ' consequence. The just demands and honor of the nation must be established abroad. -" Ia President Linooln we shall Lata a wise, jadioious, and determined leader. 4 He has begun the great work of e , ftroying slavery, and reconstructing our .'- nationality on the broad, humane and tn--. during basis of human equality. In the ' eyes ef the world he has become the great emancipator. His name is breathed with blessings by millions of cruelly wronged ' ' and outraged men and women. His name ' U known and loved in all the rice-fields aid ootton plantations of the Soutn. To "" the blaok race, he is a liberator and savior. Ia this great work he commands the sym pathy and admiration of the lending minds f the nation, the thoughtful, the wise, the benevolent, the patriotic Curses have fallen only from malicious ' pro-slavery partisans ; blessings from all whose heaits are la the work of restoring our nation ality oa a basis substantial as the granite kills. .. 6. He is needed where As it ; Gon. Grant where he is ; Seeretary Chase where he is. The financial and military difficulties aie ot yet entirely settled. The great finan cial brain of Seoretary Chase and the mil itary genius of Grant, or any other man, are needed where they can best serve the aUtica, just where they are. - - We believe we are simply giving ex pression to the popular will ia thus early snggestihg, our great chieftain and states snan, Abraham Lincoln as the right man ia the right place." No one can deoy his signal wisdom and ability thus far; let ts trust him for the future. Georgia Legislature. The Georgia legislature adjourned tn the 15th. The appropriations amount to I over f 14,000,000, of which $0,000,000 aie ; for soldiers families ; 52,000,000 for oloth ' lng the Georgia troops; J2;000,000 for the ' military fund ; $1,000,000 for the public debt ; $500,000 for the Georgia Relief As sociation ; $1,000,000 for blockaie run ners for supplies r and about l,0Q0,0CO for general State purposes. ' ' The American ladies residing in Mor trail, Canada, recently held a fair which yielded $T00. This sum has been placed at the disposal of the United States Sai i- ' tary Commission for the relief of sick tid Weualed soldiers. j The Border Congressmen. A singular condition In out legislation has been reached. The old stats ef affairs has bees reverted ; and, now, instead of audacious, but blind de fence of slavery and hesitating loyalty in the Border Slave States, we have an exhi bition of hearty anti slavery sentiment and determined devotion to the Union, which make a sad contrast with the man ner In which the great and most loyal State of Ohio is represented at Washington. Compare the voting of Messrs. Randall, tnderson, Clay and Smith, of Eentnoky, with that of our own renegade Congress men, all of whom, with but two exceptions, wereoverwhelmingly defeated in the re cent election. The only theory which satisfactorily ac counts for this sad spectacle, is based npoa the very evident faot that the loyal Con gressmen from Maryland, Delaware and Kentucky see that the people of these Slates are no longer to be decived on the subject of slavery. The Storm that is to burst in frightful fury upon that last and greatest vistige of barbarism is already gathering in thunder olonds upon the hor- iion. They, as loyal men, see that slave ry is the mother of treason and all her pes tilent litter ; that peaoe shall not dwell in our borders permanently until the foun dations of our social system are broken up and a new superstructure of universal liberty erected. They are mot daunted therefore by the bullying of such effete and semi-loyal sheets as the Louisville Journal. But our twelve Congressmen, who shamefully belie the wishes of their con stituency, are oniting with their con fed eratet in am attempt to get the "control of the Government into their own hands. Party iB exalted above patriotism. A love of the national treasury and patronage constrains them rather than the love of their country. On the following resolution offered by Mr. Green Clay Smith, of Kentucky, the voting was very significant. " Retolved, That, as our country, and the very existence of the best Government ever instituted by man, is imperriled by the moelcaoeeless andwioked Rebellion that the world has ever seen, and believing as we do that the only hope of saving the country and preserving this Government is by the power of the sword, we are ior the most vigorons prosecution of the war, until the Couttituion and law thall be en forced aad obeyed in all parti of thi United Statet; and to i not eno we oppose y omu tie, or intervention, ormediati'.n, orpropori- txun for peace from any quarter, to long at there thall be found a Bebel armt againtt the Government ; and we ignore all party names, lines and issues, and recognise but two parties ia this war, patriots and traitors. This resolution passed by 93 yeas to C4 niys. Observe carefully the langua italicised. What does this resolution af firm to which any whole-hearted loyal man could hesitate to subscribe. It simply af firms that no proposition for peaoe, inter vention or armestice will be listened to to bur as there are rebels in arms. The veto on this resolution by the Congress men from this State exposes these un scrupulous partisans of a so-called Demoo r icy. Behold Ihe figure the great State of Ohio, which affirmed its devotion to the Government by one hundred thousand ma jority, cu's before the wor'4 : - Ohio Teat Ashley, Garfield, Eckley, 6. icbenck, npanlding A'ayi Bliss, Cox, Finck, Hutchins,Wm Leblond, Long, McKinney, J.

In New York the vote was about equally divided, although the great Empire State scaled her devotion to the cause of the Union by the same majority. The Border States give a decided major ity for the prosecution of the war without cessation until rebels lay down their armr. The loyal free States, mis represented, on tie ecntrary, throw their influence in the line of party tactics and treason. A Sensible Criticism. The Toronto Globe is the Canadian journals. Standing, as it does, in the character of a disinterested spectator of political movements on this side of the border, and possessing, at the same time, abundant means of obtaining correct information, the Globe ia in po sition to form a very aoourate idea of the condition ef parties in the United States, The following is its comment upen the re oent summerset of the "Democrats" in Congress, on the Peaoe qnestion : The Democratic party in Congress have oome to the conclusion that resistance to ihe war is no longer possible, and that in order to have any chanco of success in the coming Presidential election, they must pledge themselves to an an active prose cution of hostilities. This decision is the liraot result of reoent successes of the North, which have brought the subjuga tion of the South within view; but it was certain to come sooner or later, and the Democrats have shewn no great shrewd ness in followinp so fast nd so far the lead o: such men as Vallandigham, of Ohio, and Seymour, of New York. If they had contented themselves with criti cising the Administration while support ing the war, they would have been stronger now than they can fairly o'.aim to be. They have thrown the whole war game into Mr. Lincoln's hahds, and they cannot beat him now whatever changes of policy they may adopt. Our Prisoners at Richmond. . From a private letter received from General i'cal Dow, dated Riohmond, De cember iith, we make the following ex tracts: "I learn, from the papers and by my letters, that contributions and subscrip tions have been taken np in many North ern oities for prisoners at Richmond. I hope that nothing will be sent here by in experienced parties, because such a course would probably involve loss and waste to a large extent. The only safe mode of managing the business wUl be to send all contributions for such purpose to the Uni ted States Sanitary Commission, or to some trustworthy Supply Association, through which all benefactions will be wisely dis tributed at points where supplies are most needed. The Government is now sending large soyplies of olothing and food for the use of our soldiers here, acd the Sanitary Commission and Supply Associations have sent to the officers of a great many neces sary and useful articles; and consign ments of 'such are arriving by every flag of trooe boat." , , ' Mr. Dow adds, that the prisoners would bo very glad if the publishing houses of New York and others would send them soma reading matter. Books of history, voyages, travels, mtgaiiaes, ele., would be very acceptable. Tttlmnt. The Dinner to the Hon. Schuyler Colfax. The members and representatives of the press la Washington paid their respects on Saturday evening last to the distinguished speakra of the House. A " table resplen dent with silver and glass " waa spread out before them at Willard'a Hotel. The occasion was one of rejoicing and gratifi cation in the honors paid to the press. The press is being recognised as a power in the land. It no longer begs an exist ence but has truly become, as Mr. Beeoher styles it, the monarch of the age. We ap pend interesting extracts from 'he speeches of Mr. Wilkerson, of the New York Times, and Mr. Colfax. . Mr. Wilkerson, the President of the mettiDg said : Eighteen years ego, at one o'olock of a winter moon-lightel morning, while the horses of the stage coach in whiob. I was plowing the thiok mud ot Indiana were being changed at Lbe tavern in souin Bend, 1 walked 'he root-way or tne prici Dal street to shake off a great weariness I saw a lisht throueh a window. A sign, The Blister " was legible above it, ana I saw through the window a man in his shirt sleeves walking quickly about like one that worked. I paused, and looked, and imagined about the man, and about his work, and about the lateness of the honr fo which it was protracted; and I wondered if he was in debt, and was strug gling to get out, aad if his wi:e was ex peoiing him and had lighted a new candle for his ooming, and if he was very tired. eominr steo interruDted this idle dream ing. When the walker reached my side I joined him, and as we went I asked him questions, and naturally they were about the workman in the shirt s!eeves. " What sort of a man Is he ?" "Hill very good to the poor; he works hard ; he is sociable with all people; he pays his debts; he does'nt drink whisky; folks depend on him : all this cart of Indiana believes in him." From that day to this I have never taken up the South Bend Register without thinking of this eulogy, and envying the man who had justly entitled himself to it in the dawn of his manhood. That man when 26 years of age, and again when 29 yean old, was sent by his neighbors to the National Presidential Conventions when 27 years old he was sent by his neighbors as a wise political reformer to the Constitutional Convention of the State of Indiana was sent by the sime neighbors to Congress in the year 1854, and kept there by them from that day to this.' On the first Monday of this month of December the Republicans of the House of Representatives unanimously elected him the Speaker of that body. My brothers you think you know the se cret ot this uninterrupted lavor oi n con stitaenoy to a representativa of this con tinued rerard of a community for a oitl (en of this appreciation of a statesman by statesmen. You find them in his fidel ity to srinciples in his thorough atten tion to business in his talents for legitJa tion in their eons tan t and useful devo tion to the public good. The Congressional Globe and the traditional and written his tory of Congress are full of the evidences of these virtues, and of this fitness for public trusts, and this tills to honor and oonfldenoe. Bat you don't know the secret. I do. I learned it by ohanoe. I got cossession of it by an nnwittirg and unwilling eavesdropping in the parlor of another nobis man, John w. rorney Eighteen years after my midnight watch ing of that printer, in his shirt sleeves at bis solitary taour, i neara mm in in is ony utter this his philosophy or life: "1 eon' sider that day wasted in which I have not done some good te some human being, or added somewhat to somebody a ftappiness. W hat success eould reeede from that man pursuit nay. what success would not pursue that man and forcibly orown him with honors and gratitude? Schuyler Colfax, editor of the South Bend Register, Congressmen from Indiana for eleven years, actor of a chilosophy of human life that Socrates might hive envied, you can not escape the love or your fellow-man 1i e journalists and men of the newspaper press do lore you and olaim you as bone of our hone and flesh of our flesh. Fill your glasses all in an invocation to the gods for long life, greater successes, and ever In creasing happiness to our editorial brother in the speakers Chair. Mr. Colfax said: I have been gladto meet you here to-night, and I am glad that, notwithstanding our varied and an tagontzing political shades of opinions, we can thus sit down together in social har mony. We know there ia to be a dayoom ing when the lion atd, the latab shall lie down tor ether. Laughter Some doubt ing Thomases think that this will only be realiiedby the lamb being, at the time, in side of the lion. Laughter ! Bu, pollti riiIv, the prophecy seems almost verGed to night. I e&nnot avoid saying that a few words in relation to the profession to which we have devoted our lives. 1 think you can- net but acknowledge that the American Congress has not overlooked the press Not only have they seen fit, for the first time in the history of Congress, to select a printer for the grave responsibility which cluster around their presiding ow, cer, but from the ranks of the same prafes slon they have taken a gentleman for the next office in order, the Clerk of the House, and one whom, with a modesty equal to his worth, I eee blushes as I allude to him, (Mr. McPherson). And besides these, we have also in the American Congress another gentleman, a printer, acting as postmaster Of the House. Having thus generously given a majority of alt offioes to the press, they have magnanimously al lowed " the rest of mankind " to take the remaining two offices. Laughter and ap plause. In the other branch of Congress we have as Secretary of the Senate (John W. Forney, one of the most gifted and dis tinguished journalists of our times. The Vioe President of the United States, also, was a newspaper man, and I doubt not, a good one. And so, also, was the Sergeant-at-Arms of the Senate, Mr. Brown, of Illi nois. And if our excellent President was not directly connected with the press, I think we can bear testimony to the faot of his having furnished material for innu merable editorials in its columns. rLaugh ter For muoh of this ennobling patriotism, for these marked developments of human ity, I bless to-night the American press. Applause. And, again, you have another duty to perform. It is the inouloatlon of morali ty among that large circle of people you thus reach. If the fountain is poisened, the water that flows from it shall be poisoned too ; and those that drink of that water shall have poison in their veins in stead of the pure blood that gives health and strength. It is your duty to see that not by your aid shall thee poisons reach yonr patrons to spread moral miasma within the cirole of your influences. Having at greater length than I intended alluded to what I believe to be the duties devolved upon ns as journalists, before I resume my seat' I must again warmly and gratefully thank you for your kindness manifested to ms to-night. This night shall be marked as a white atone in the history of my life. And as I look baek In the days that are to come. If God spares my life, I shall never forget the hours we have so happily pasted tegether here. For the great honor you have done me to-night,for such a reception as you have given me, I feel, with the Irish orator, like saying, "My heart would shake hands with all of you." Laughter and ap plause. And I beg leave to give you a sentiment, as a pla-fonn on which all of ytra can safely stand : Tma Ahkicaji Paiss If inspired by Patriotism, -Morality, and Humanity, it oannot fall to develop a constansly in creasing Vigor, Power, and consequent Independence. Loud and continued applause. General Grant on the Corner Stone. Ia a private letter of General Grant to to Hon. E. B. Washburne, dated August 23, 1803, he thus gives his opinion oa the amaahing of the corner atone of the re bellion. The New York Herald's denial of the genuineness of this letter, when it waa quoted by Senator Wilson, has brought oat the publication of its precise language and date : The people of the North need not quar rel over the institution of Slavery. What Vice President Stephens acknowledges as I ihe oorner atone of the Confederacy, ia al ready knocked out. Slavery ia already dead, and cannot be resurrected. It would take a standing army to maintain 81avery in the South, if we we were to make peace to-day, guaranteeing to the South all their former constitutional pnv -ileges. I never was an Abolitionist not even what would be called anti-Slavery but I try to judge fairly and honestly, and and it became patent to my mind, early in the rebellion, that the JNortu ana noutn could never live at peace with eaoh other, except as one nation, and that without 81very. As anxious as I am to see peace established, I would not, therefore, be will ing to see any settlement until this ques tion is forever settled. What Was it? The Boston Courier publishes an ex tract of a letter from a gentleman in the Southern States, who has always bsea a Union man, and who has been imprisoned by the rebels, in wMch occurs the follow ing: "He says, that during his confinement he conversed with prisoners from all of the Confederate States but Florida, and their unanimous testimony was, that if MoClellan and Buell had been continued in command, and the polioy wbioh they represented had been persevered in, the Confederacy oould not have lasted six montha longer than the date of their re moral; for the plain reason, that no new army oould have been raised. "What was the 'polioy which these Gonerala represented 1 ' How did it differ from the polich which has since been pur sued? Was it marked out by the Govern ment, or did these Generals take the liber ty of inaugurating a policy to suit them selves? We should very much like some definite information on these points. If any policy wbioh would have ended the war has been discarded, the whole country is interested in knowing what it was. Will not the Boston Courier enlighten ns? Tribune, Blunders. In telegraphing the President's Message to the country, our readers must have no ticed that many mistakes were made. The experience of the press in different parts of the country is the same. The Missouri Democrat, remarking upon this, says : "Take, for instance, one sentence. Speaking of the Emancipation Proclama tion, after raying that It was hoped the rebellion could be suppressed without re sorting to that measura, but that it waa all the while deemed possible the necessity for it might come, Mr. Lincoln waa repre sented in some papers as remarking as follows : 'It eame, and, aa intimated, It waa followed by dark and doubtful days.' In other papers thia was printed: 'Itoame, and, as was intended,' io. The Philadelphia Pess has it: 'It oame, and, as waa portend ed,' &s. The Washington papers have it: 'It eame, and, as was anticipated,' &o. The latter reading, we believe, ia according to the manuscript text." Rhetoric Without Sense. [From the Columbus (Secesh) Crisis.] When we look baek but three years, when this frse-negrodom came rampant into power, and cast a thought upon what we enoe were and what we now are, and still further to where we are rapidly drifting, it is enough to make the stoutest heart quail before tb storm yet to pass over the ',uil before the purification can teas place. As the sultry, sickly, un breathable atmosphere of a 8 a miner's olstios Is purified by the lightning's Sashes and the thunders roll along tbe valleys and the mountains, as the wild hurricane tears and slashes all in i'B course, so is the moral and political mias ma driven off by the upheaving, of popu larfrensy."('ltll) As we are not skilled in Interpreting the utterance of the disciples of the "black art," we would be obliged to any one who would tell us what all that fanfaranade of the Crisis means. Medary can't. A meeting of sailors was held In New York a few evenings since to consider the stoppage of grog in the navy. A resolu tion was adopted which pledged the men never U enter the service until the grog ration is restored. The following is ths resolution: Buolvei, That the abolition of grog In the navy was uncalled for, and ia very bati; that it was never attempted in any other navy in the world ; that the two gilla of whiskey per day which we got waa not enougu to intoxicate any body ; and that those who could do without grog landsmen, marines and boya never drank It at ail. Witty, Very. The Crisis has the following resplendent scintillation of its oharaoteristiA wit: Give these Abolitionists, by Democratic favor, "all the men and ail the money ' they desire, and the work will be dons. An old toper ones approached ns with a jug nnder his arm and very pleadingly said to ub, "I ha' the vessel, but ha' no got the means." All he wanted was the meant, and his empty jug would soon be replenished t Well, what of it?
