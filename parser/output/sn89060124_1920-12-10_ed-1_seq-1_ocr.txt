EQUAL RIGHTS IN MANDATES Colby Notifies Great Britain of Ob jections to Restriction of Dis cussion to League Nations. OIL FIELDS ARE ISSUE. Secretary Declares That United States • as Contributor to Success of War ! "Cannot Be Debarred From Dis cussion of Its Consequences.” | Washington.—Secretary Colby’s note to Great Britain on Mesopotamia made public here reveals the startling fact , that England has completed plans to exclude the United States from any participation in the resources of all mandate territory throughout the ! world on the ground that this govern ment is not a member of the League of Nations. Protesting that the United States as a contributor to the success of the war “cannot be debarred from the discus sion of any of its consequences, ’ Secre tary Colby in his note, demands “that the draft mandate forms,” particularly those of Mesopotamia and Palestine which have been kept secret, “be com municated to this government for Its :onsideration before their submission to the council of the League of Na tions.” In his note, which is regarded as the most important as well as one of the iblest sent out by the government since :he armistice, Secretary Colby strongly bints that Great Britain is guilty of the most flagrant duplicity lu Meso potamia. “This government,” he states, “finds lifflculty in reconciling this special ar rangement set forth in the so-called San Remo petroleum agreement” (by which Great Britain took 75 per cent to France’s 25) “with your statement that the petroleum resources of Meso potamia will be secured to the future Arab state as yet unformed.” The note was addressed to Lord Cur zon. Secretary of Foreign Affairs. It was made necessary by the failure of Great Britain to answer two previous notes demanding the open door in Mesopotamia, These notes, while not important in themselves, were aimed, it was stated by a high authority, to bring Great Britain into the open, and they have had the precise desired ef fect. Introducing this note Secretary Col by says: “I have .the honor to refer to your note of August 9. regarding the appli cation of the principle of equality of treatment to the territories of the Near East to be placed under mandates, and specifically to the petroleum re sources of those territories as affected by that principle. “Before considering the observations of his Majesty’s Government on the general principles advocated by the United States, and agreed to by the allied powers, for application to the mandate over former Turkish terri tory, as outlined in the notes of May 12 and July 28, addressed to you on behalf of this government, I think it will clarify the discussion to indicate certain of your statements and assur ances which this government has been pleased to receive. “Thus, I note that the assignment to Great Britain of the mandate for Mesopotamia was made and accepted subject to no friendly arrangements whatever with any third government regarding economic rights, which, of course, would have been wholly at variance with the purpose and con templation of any mandate. “It is also gratifying to learn that his Majesty’s Government Is in full sympathy with the several propositions formulated in the note of May 12. above referred to, which embody or Illustrate the principles which this . government believes should be applied in the mandated regions, and which are essential to the practical realiza : tion of equality of treatment. ■k ★ ★ LEAGUE CALLS ON WILSON * ★ TO SAVE ARMENIA. ★ ★ ★ ★ Geneva. —The Council of the ★ ★ League of Nations sent a cable- ★ ★ gram to President Wilson ask- ★ ★ ing him if America would act as ★ ★ mediator between the Armenians ★ ★ and the Turkish Nationalists. ★ ★ A similar message was sent to ★ ★ powers who are league members. ★ ★ By this action the Council ★ ★ upheld the view of England that ★ ★ an entirely new situation had ★ ★ arisen in the Near East, and ★ i ★ that although America had re- ★ ★ fused a mandate over Armenia, ★ j ★ she should now be asked if she ★ • ★ would act as mediator. ★ . !

AMENDING LEAGUE Assembly Commission at Geneva Votes for Deferring Changes Un til Harding Offers His Plan. Geneva.—The League of Nations will not undertake the task of making changes in the covenant- until it hears porposals from the next United States government. This fact was made known in commission No. 1 of the League Assembly. As the covenant has been in effect only a short time, proposed amend ments are to be set aside and a stand ing committee is to be appointed to consider these and all other proposals for amendments made between now and the second meeting of the assem bly, which will probably be held next May or June. The proposal to abandon the task of changing the covenant was made by A. J. Balfour. It was at first opposed by the Scandinavian countries, which had presented amendments tending to lessen the hold of the big powers on the League, but this opposition was finally withdrawn. As every govern ment is represented on the commis sion tlie decision is equivalent to adop tion by the assembly. Since amend ments must be approved by all the members present, if England opposed any amendment it could not be car ried. It is believed by the assembly lead ers that before the next assembly meeting Mr. Harding will have de clared his ideas on an international association and It willrae the task of the standing committee of the council to examine the American proposals and see how far the covenant can be altered In accord with them, thus pre paring the way, it is hoped, for Ameri ca’s entry into the League. Secret diplomacy is dying hard at Geneva. This is a very difficult mat ter, a change from the old system of secret negotiations to open debates, particularly between nations which have hitherto settled their difficulties secretly on a give-and-take basis. The embarrassments of the change are manifold. Thus the Franco-Brltish fight over the Turkish treaty came into the open and by a popular appeal Vivlanl won a victory which the French had not got by the old diplo matic methods. Then the council took hold of the matter and there England stopped the move, at least temporarily. There is no doubt that the great and growing demand for an end of the mystery In which the council shrouds itself is going to have effect. In fact, the council is having pretty “hard sledding” just now. o- -o WORLD NEWS IN CONDENSED FORM o— o GENEVA.—Mont Rosa of the French Alps is the highest peak in Europe, following the biggest landslide in his tory by which 600 feet of the summit of Mont Bianc, disregarding all inter national boundaries, sped from the French peak Into the Italian Valley without injuring a single person or de stroying a house.

BRITISH SPREAD A NET. Dublin Action First in Plan to Arrest All in “Irish Republic" Army—Brit ish Say Collins and Mulcahy’s Mur der Plans Involved Leaders. Dublin. Arthur Griffith, acting “President of the Irish Republic.” and other members of the Dail Eireann (Sinn Fein Parliament) were arrested in the early hours of Saturday morn ing. No official explanation so far has been given of the reasons for their arrest, but it is understood from an authoritative source that recent docu ments discovered show that the link between the Dail Eireann and the Irish Republican army was very close Indeed, and that the Dail Eireann was collecting funds for the Republican army. “It was undoubtedly known,” adds an official, “that the Republican army was engaged in a very extensive mur der campaign, and it is impossible for funds to have been voted by the Dail Eireann without some control of the purpose for which these funds were used.” It is said that the authorities con templatee some form of internment for those associated with the Irish Repub lican army. Several instances have come to light recently of forced con tributions to their funds. There was one instance in Wexford district where a farmer was asked if he had contributed to the munition fund. He replied that he knew nothing about it. His caller then told him he had a bill for £l7 to collect. The farmer handed over £5 and was informed that others would be found to collect the balance. The number of arrests is not yet officially stated, but it is believed that about twenty people were taken into custody during extensive raids. In ad dition to Griffith, among those arrest ed were Professor John Mac Neill, of the Nationalist University of Ireland and Sinn Fein member of parliament for Londonderry City, his son, and Eamonn Duggan, M. P. for the South Division of Dublin, and Joseph Mac- Bride, M. P. for the West Division of County Mayo. With regard to the case of Griffith it was stated from Dublin Castle that “Mr. Arthur Griffith was arrested at his residence, Lawrence Road, Dublin, at 2 o'clock in the morning. A large quantity of literature was taken from his home. No arms were found. Mr. Griffith was in bed at the time and was taken away in a motor lorry. He made no statement to his captors and the arrest was effected without any trouble.” Mrs. Griffith was with her husband at the time. She says that he had not been at homo for nearly a week. At 1:20 she was awakened by the sound of crashing glass. She went to a win dow and found seven men below be longing to the auxiliary police. They pointed revolvers at her and told her to come clown at once. She cried to her husband, who was still asleep, “Here they are, Arthur; jump.” She threw on a dressing gown, and on the way downstairs met men on the land ing who gained admittance by smash ing a pane of glass in the door and cutting the chain. They went into a bedroom and plac ed her husband under arrest. With him they went from room to room, making n careful search. Carpets were torn up, floors and walls sound ed, and the piano taken completely to pieces. Immense quantities of lit erature, letters, pamphlets, books and photographs were taken. The search was in progress for more than two hours. Her husband was not roughly treated, although when she asked the auxiliaries where they were going to take him one replied, “We are going to shoot him or hang him, as he jolly well deserves.” This frightened their little girl In the room, and she became hysterical, but as the men drove away one shouted, “We are taking him to the Bridewell.” 

WILSON MAY ACT AS MEDIATOR. Would End Turkish-Armenian Dispute | at Request of League. Washington.—President Wilson will accept the invitation of the League of Nations to act as mediator between the Turkish Nationalists and the Ar menians now engaged in war, it is believed by officials close to the ad ministration.

The organiza tions forming the council will organize their representatives in every town and community of the nation for the raising of the necessary funds.” Plea for Little Ones Abroad. Chicago.—A plea for the undernour ished children of Europe was voiced in this city by Herbert Hoover. Mr. Hoover, speaking to 300 Chicagoans at a dinner given by Howard B.

An investiga tion showed that millers are making large sales of flour to family trade in I all the Atlantic seaboard cities, • but especially in Baltimore.

I STATE I I CAPITAL I i : Roads’ High Cost Serious Menace. Annapolis.— > A serious menace to the completion of the program for construction of new roads especially lateral roads, advo cated by Governor Ritchie, is the pro hibitive cost. The program marked out for next year was based upon a post of $30,000 a mile. Bids received by the commission have been in ex cess of $50,000 a mile. One bid was for $55,000 a mile. Because of these excessive prices the commission will | not ask for bids until January 1 next, when there is a prospect, though re mote, that there will be a reduction in the coat of labor, concrete, sand, machinery and other items which enter Into road construction. If the bids for construction next year are not within the ability of the commis sion to meet road-building on the scale contemplated, work will have to be deferred. The commission has recent ly awarded two contracts for grading and drainage. This work does not in volve the purchase of materials, and can be done during the winter months if the weather is not too severe. For 1921 the appropriation for new construction are: St. Georges Island bridge, SIO,OOO. Reconstruction, $300,000. State’S share, lateral roads, SIOO,OOO. Maintenance fund, $1,300,000. Of these sums that for road main tenance is derived from motor vehicle licenses. This fund is also devoted to other road purposes. The bond issue authorized by the last legislature for new roads was $3,000,000. Of this sum $1,500,000 was realized this year.

Opposed To Reciprocity Of Auto Tags c Governor Ritchie declared unwield ing opposition to any effort which may be made in Congress at its next ses sion to bring about compulsory recip rocity between all states in the matter of automobile license tags, on the ground that such legislation wouldibe aimed directly at Maryland. This stand was taken following an apparently well-founded report from the Capital City that such a bill was to be introduced at the coming ses sion of Congress. Governor Ritchie declared that for many years the residents of the District of Columbia had worked ceaselessly to escape the purchase of a Maryland license for their machines. This state’s position in the controversy had been, and would continue to be. that since resi dents of Washington made use of Maryland's highways almost as much as dwellers in this state. It was but * fair they should contribute toward the upkeep of the Maryland roads. A conference on this subject was held in Washington between Automo bile Commissioner Baughman, of Bal timore, and Commissioner J. Thilman Hendrick, of Washington. Mr. Hen drick stated In view of the many differ ences in the automobile laws of Mary land and the District, it would be im practical to adopt a joint motor tag at this time. “While Mr. Baughman and myself are both favorable to the idea of a joint tag bearing one number,” said Commissioner Hendrick, ‘'there are a number of differences In the law here and in Maryland which would lead to numerous difficulties and would make necessary a vast amount of work to maintain the joint tag system.” The commissioner pointed out that the prices of tags were different In Maryland and the District. He also called attention to the title law for automobiles in Maryland, which does not exist in the District. To Study License System. Governor Ritchie will suggest to the State Survey Commission of Ex perts. appointed by him. that it scrutinize the whole license system with a view to securing larger revenue from this source, as well as to secure uniformity and centralization. Larger revenue is sought with a view to lift ing, in part at least, the heavy burdens on real estate, especially in Baltimore. With few exceptions licenses are un der state jurisdiction. Because of the onerous tax burdens imposed on real estate Mayor Broening declares that new sources' of city income must be found. He contemplates the urging of an enactment of a law by the next' General Assembly placing a tax on di rect as well as collateral inheritances, with wide exemptions. He believes that this is the least burdensome of all taxes. Frederick.—Major, George T. Castle, commander of the government stores in Frederick during the raid of Gen.
