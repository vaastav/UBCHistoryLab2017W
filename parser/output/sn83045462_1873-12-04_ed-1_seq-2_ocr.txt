The President's message seems to b? rather exceptionally well rcceircd by the pres.*, thocgh there Is considerable discrepancy of C|?nion m to the point* to it most worthy or commendation. The New York Tim*i regards the financial portion a* being moat deserving of approbation, and uj* no one expected that 4 len. < irant would discuss the aabject from the star.<tpomt or a theorist, and he does not, bat '-a remarkable pertinence and directness are noticeable In his suggestions, and his principles are extremely sound " The Tribune, on the other hand, does not find mich to endorse In the President's financial views, bat concedes tbat the President represents the Cuban case "very fairly, and treats it with such dignity and calmness as will meet the approval or Congress and the people.'' The Herald regards the mes sage in the light of a dispassionate record, and Veneres it was written simplr for the purpose of ( rercnting. as briefly *s deeme<t possible, the Acts of the Adminisirationduring the pa?t year, and the legislative measures which the Kxecu tive thinks necessary or expedient upon oar foreign and domestic affairs for the genera! welfare; ami baring thus discharged bis duty, with his mind relieved, he leaves the work sug gested to the consideration and the discretion of Congress. The Stm naturally has no admi ration to bestow ap<>n anything coming trom the Presideut, bat admits tbat it presents "a lair new of the condition of the different de partments of the Government." The Philadel phia Pr'Mi praises the condensation shown in tbe message, "considering how much the Presi dent had to say," and says "it is a satislaot ory s'ewaniship on the whole, and he gives authori ty to what was previously believed." The Rich mond IHspa'ck says the President "seem* to be an\ions to do his duty," bat that "his raitare to refer to l.oaisUna stands in striking contrast to his solicitude for the negroes In Cab*, who are not more truly deprived of their rights than are the white people of Louisiana." The Baltimore Sun notes a? an unusual omission tbat the mes sage contains no all-Ion to Divine Providence. , ? It Is important in every aspect ol the case that the nhme of Georgetown should be merged and extinguished in tbat of Washington. The two cities are one and should be one in name. Georgetown baring ceased to be a s-pars'.- mu nicipality and forming now an integral part ot" the city of Washington, governed by the same laws, and represented by the same constituted authorities, and every day becoming more and more identified by the increasing facilities of transit and inter-communication, this nominal distinction is a positive and manifest disadvan tage in manifold respects. It is opposed to a thorough ami cordial unity and fusion of social and commercial interests. It creates a vigue i lea of dirersity in substance, as well as in form, fosters a sentiment of local estrangement and rivalry, and repels the influx 01 population trade an.l wealth. It reduces Georgetown to a suburban grade and obscurity, to a sort of terra iitfynila to the world at large, while she is justly entitled to a share of the civic rank and prestige of the national Metropolis, and to be endowed with its postal and all other incidental benefits. It requires the supreme authority of Congress to effect the new b iptism with this il lustrious and venerable name. Minor details may safely be left to the legislature of t.ie Dis trict. Tbe popular voice is unanimous in sup ? of the proposition. Murmurs of dissent t-?n the office-holders, of course, are to be ex pected. Prompt and decided action before Congress is necessary by the Ir.eud- ot the measure. ? Housekeepers in thisse tlon, where anthracite coal is much o?ed tor domestic purposes, will be , glad to bear from Pennsylvania tbat the Coal i combination is said to be breaking up. A special to the New York Tin's from Phila delphia say* that the disturbance in the com- 1 bination is owing to the declaration of inde- j pci.dence by the Pennsylvania Coal Company, . * powerful corporation, which controls almost ' exclusively the Pittston coal region. The Penn sylvania company, although not properly be longing to tbe coal league, has always combined with it so far as prices were concerned, but has now made a reduction of fifty and sixty cents on all sizes ot coal for December, while the other companies connected with the combina tion hold to the prices made in October?the figures being neither increased nor lowered. Combining this with the fact that the trade is unusually dull for the season, those best informed say that there must be a redaction of price* at *n early date, and a consequent breaking ap of the combination. As some indi cation of the coming collapse, the Philadelphia and Ke*ding Company, which has been recog nized as the leader or the combination, has announced a partial closing or their collieries in Schuylkill county, as well as ? reduction ot' ten per cent, in the wages of all the employes of the company. There is a disposition on the part or many democratic journals or influence in Virginia to tre*t President Grant fairly, and to give him proper credit for tbe desire on bis part for the restoration of perfect good feeling between all Mctionsof the country. The Virginia Sentinel, a conservative journal, takes the Petersburg h. I't ami Ayya! to task for Its arraignment of the President and bis administration because o( tbe arrest in Montgomery county, Virginia, recently, or certain parties charged with vio lating the election laws. After faying that the administration was. probably, no more respon sible for those arrests than the writer of the strictures himself, tbJ Sentinel ad'ls: ??Let the .Ij-i-eal seek other cause of .|iiarrel. Or. rather, let it condemn the unjust judge or wocslen beaded ju-y who enourage these things but, at the same time, re:l'<ct that such cares of individual outrages will continue t j happen everywhere, but that the rulers, who exet ute laws! are not re?|>om-ible for them. And let it thus seek to allay the bad p i^ions, which cause them, ami uphold tbe President in his desire and purpose, which be has plainly indi cated, to wipe out the rankling memories which encourage and promote them." *mmm. - The experiment of woman sullrage in Wyo ming territory is pronounced a success by high authority. Gov. Campbell, in his late annual message to tbe Legislate e Assembly.tba* gives the measure his unqualified Indorsement: "Tbe experiment of granting u? woman a voice <n the government, which was inaugu rated tor the first time in the history of our rountry. b> the Legislative Assembly of Wyo -aiii2. ran win been tried for four year?. I have Imttcforf taken occasion to express my riews in regarii to the wisdom and J ustice or this meas ure ai d my conrlcllon that its adoption had been attended on.'* by good results.
