Dec, 6.— following , is the full text of President Cleveland's ! message: To the Congress of the United States: In the discharge of a constitutional duty and following a well-established precedent iv ! the executive office. 1 herewith transmit to j congress, at the teassembling, certain in- j formation concerning the state of the Union, together witn such recommendations for . legislative consideration as appear necessary j and expedient. Our government has con- ; sistently maintained its relations of friend- j ship toward all other powers, and of neigh borly interest toward those whose possessions \ are contiguous to our own. Few questions j have arisen during the past year with other ; governments, and none of these are beyond \ the reach of settlement in friendly counsel. i We are as >et without provision for the set- j tlement of claims of citizens of the United | States against Chili for injuries during the | late war with Peru and Bolivia. The mixed j commissions, organized under claims conven- j tions, concluded by the Chilian government j with certain European states, have developed '. an amount of friction which we trust can be j avoided in the convention in which our repre- i sentative at Santiago is authorized to ne gotiate. THE OR'- -L 

TREATMENT of inoffensive Chinese, has, i regret to say, been reptated in some of the far Western States and territories, and acts of violence against the power of the local constituted authorities to prevent and difficult to punish, are reported even in distant Alaska. Much . ol this violence can be traced to race preju- j dice and competion of labor, which cannot, ! however, justify the oppression of sti angers, ! whose safely is guaranteed by our treaty ' with China equally with tbe most favored ! nations, in opening our vast domain to alien : elements the purpose of our lawgivers was ; to invite assimilation and not to provide an ' arena for endless entagonisms The para- ' mount duty of maintaining public I order aud defending the inter- i ests of our people may require the ! adoption of measures of restriction, but I they should not tolerate the oppression of ' individuals of a special race. lam not with- j out assurance that the government of China, I whose friendly disposition towards us lam I most happr to recognize, will meet us half j way la devising a comprehensible remedy oy which an effective limitation of Chinese emi gration, joined to protection of those Chinese ; subjects who remain in this country, may be j secured. Legislation is needed to execute j tbe provisions of our Chinese convention of | 18S0 touching tbe opium traffic. While tbe good will of the Colombian government towards our country is manifest, the situa tion of American interests on THE ISTHMCS OF PANAMA has at times elicited concern, and invited j friendly action looking to tbe performance of t the engagements of the two nations, concern- \ ing the territory embraced in the interoceanic ! transit. With the subsidence of the Isthmian dis- J turbance and the erection of the state of Pan- | ama into a federal district, under the direct i government of the constitutional administra- j tion at Bogota, a new order of tnings has been ' inaugurated which. although as yet somewhat experimental and affording scope for arbi- | trary exercise of power, by the delegates of | the national authority promises mucb im- i provements. The sympathy between ihe peo- j ple of the United States and France, horn j during our colonial struggle for independence and continuing to-day, has received A FliE-H IMPULSE in the successful completion and dedication ! of the colossal statue of "Liberty Enlighten- | ing the World" in New York harbor, the gift | of Frenchmen to Americans. A convention ; between the United States and certain other : powers for the protection of submarine ca- i bles was signed at Paris on March 14, 18S4, j and has been duly ratified and proclaimed by ] this government. By agreement between the i high contracting parties this convention is to | goitro effect Jan.] next. but the legislation re- j quired tor its execution in the United States | has not yet been adopted. I eari e-;ly recom- I mend its enactment. Cases have Continued j to occur in Germany giving rise to much cor- ■ respondence iv reunion to the privilege of j sojourn of our naturalized citizens of Ger- , man origin revisi.ing the land of their birth, | yet i am happy to state that our relations ■ with that country have lost none of their ac cust<;mud cordiality. The claims for interest ! upon tne amount of tonnage dues illegally exacted from certain German steamship hues \ were favorably reported in both bouses of ' congress at the last session, and I trust will : receive final and favorable action at an early . day. SSwßi j THE FISHERIES ROW. Something ."Hnsi be Hone to Abrogate i lie Cim v. Worn Convention of! IS IS. The recommendation contained In my last annual message in relation to a mode of set tlement of the fishery rights in the waters of British North America, so long a subject of ! anxious difference between the United States aud Great Britain, was met by an adverse vote of the senate April 13 last, and there- I upon negot..it;eus mere instituted to obtain an agreement with her liritianic majesty's government for the promulgation of such in- ■ terpretation end definition of the article of ! the convention ot" J- ; > relating to the terri torial waters and inshore fisheries of the I British provinces as should secure the Can- i adiau rights from encroachments by United j Stales fisuermen, and at the same time insure enjoyment bt the latter of the privileges guaranteed to them by such convent. on. j The questions involved are of long standing and of grave consequence, and from tim^ to time tor nearly three-quarters of a ! century have given rise to earnest Inter .national discussion, not unaccompanied tv | irritation. Temporary arrangements by irea- I ties nave seemed to a.lay lriction, which, j however, has revived as each treaty was ter- ' minated. The last arrangement under the : treaty of lt>7l was abrogated after due notice i by the United States o.i June 30, 1S85: bat i ! was enabled to obtain for our fishermen lor . the remainder of that season enjoyment of the full privileges accorded by the terminal- ; teg treaty. The joint commission by whom ■ the treat) had beeu negotiated, although in- ; vested with plenary power to make a permit- { Bent settlement, were content with a tempo- | ran arrangement, after the termination of j which the question was relegated to the stip- ; ulations Of the treaty of 1818. as to the first article of which no construction satisfactory to both countries has ever been agreed upon. The proarress of civilization . and growth of population in TUE BRITISH PROVINCES, to which the fisheries in question are contig- : uous, and the expansion of commercial inter- ! course between them and the United States ; present to-day a condition of affairs scarcely realizable at the date of the negotiations ; of lSltj. New and vast interests have been : brought into existence, modes of intercourse ! between the respective countries have been J invented and multiplied, the methods of con- j ducting the fisheries have been wholly ' changed, and ail this is necessarily entitled to candid and careful consideration la the ad- j justment of the terms and conditions of in-' tercourse and commerce between the United j Slates and their neighbors along a frontier of j over 3,500 miles. This propinquity, commu- j nity of language and occupation, and simi larity of political and social institu- ■ tions, indicate the practicability and ob- j vious wisdom of maintaining mutually beneficial and friendly relations. Whilst I | am untciguedly desirous that such relations i should exist between us and the inhabitants Of Canada, the action of their officials during i the past season toward our fishermen has i been- such as to seriously threaten their ef- i forts to secure a satisfactory settlement of the fishery question. Negotiations are still pending, with reasonable hope that !>cforo ' the close of the present session of congress ' advancement may bo made and acceptable conclusions reached. At an early day there : may be laid before congress the correspond- I ence of the department of state in relation to j this important subject, so that the history of ! the past flsi.imr season may be fully disclosed ! and the action and the intention of the ad ministration clearly comprehended. More ; m 1 xtended reference is not deemed necessary ] n this communication. 

NEIGHBORS EAST AND WEST. Importance of Friendly Relational With Hawaii and Jia pan— Siberia, j The recommendation submitted last year, , that provision bo made tor a preliminary J reconnaissance of the conventional boundary I line b -twecii Alaska and British Columbia, is > reiienud. 1 express my unhesitating eouvlc- j lion t>iai the intimacy of relation with Hawaii . should be emphasised. As a result of the re- | ciproclty treaty of 1875 those islands on the | highway of Oriental and Australian traffic are | virtually an outpost of American commerce ; and a stepping stone to the growing trade of i the Pacific. The Polynesian island groups have beeu so absorbed by other and more I powerful governments that the Hawaiian j islands arc left almost alone in the enjoyment I of autonomy, wui h it is important for us should be preserved. Our treaty is now j terminable on one year's notice, but proposi- '■ tions to abrogate it would be, lv my judg- . ment, most ill-advised. THE PARAMOUNT INFLUENCE we have there acquired, once relinquished, could only with difficulty be regained, and a valuable coign of vantage, for ourselves might be converted into a stronghold for our commercial competitors. I earnestly recom mend that cxisiiug treaty stipulations be ex tended for a further term of seven years. A recently signed treaty to this end is now be- i fore the senate. The Importance of tele graphic communication between these islands and the United States should not bo over looked. The* question of a general .evision of tbe treaties of Japan, is again under discus sion at Tokio. As the first to open relations with that empire, and as the nation in most direct commercial relation with Japan, the United States has lost no opportunity to testify their consistent friendship by support ing tbe just claims of Japan to autonomy and independence among nations. A treaty of extradition between the United States and Japan, the first concluded by that empire, has been lately proclaimed. THE WEAKNESS OF LIBERIA and tbe difficulty of maintaining effective sovereignty over its outlying districts have exposed that republic to encroachment. It cannot be forgotten that this distinct com munity is an offshoot of our own system, I owing its origin to the associated benevolence of American citizens, whose praiseworthy ef- , forts to create a nucleus of civilization in the i Dark Confluent have commanded respect and j sympathy everywhere, especially in this I country. Although a formal protectorate I over Liberia Is contrary to our traditional policy, the moral right and duty of the United States to assist in all proper ways in the I maintenance of its integrity, is obvious, and has been . consistently announced duriug nearly naif a century. I rscommend that, in the organization of our navy, a small vessel, no longer found adequate to our needs, be presented to Liberia to be employed by it in the protection of its coastwise revenues. RELATIONS niTii MEXICO. The Need, of a Hew Treaty— The Cutting Case. The encouraging development of beneficial and intimate relations between tbe United States and Mexico, which has been so marked within the past few years, is at once the occa sion of congratulation and of friendly solici tude. I urgently renew my former representa tion of the need of speedy legislation by con gress to carry Into effect the reciprocity com mercial convention of Jan. 20, 1883. Our commercial treaty of 1831 with Mexico was terminated according to its provisions, in 1881, upon notification given by Mexico in pursuance of her announced policy of recast ing all her commercial treaties. Mexico bas since concluded with several foreign govern ments new treaties of commerce and naviga tion defiuiue alien rights of trade, property and residence, treatment of slipping, con sular privileges and the like. Our yet unex ecuted reciprocity convention of 1883 covers none of these points, the settlement of which is necessary to good relationship. I proposo I to initiate with Mexico negotiations for a new and enlarged treaty of commerce and naviga tion. In compliance wltu a resolution of the senate I communicated to that body on Aug. 2, last, and also to the house of representa tives, the correspondence in the case of A. K. Cutting, AN AMERICAN CITIZEN, • then imprisoned in Mexico charged with the j commission of a penal offense in Texas, of j which a Mexican citizen was the object. | After demand had been made for his release the charge against him was amended so as to include a violation of Mexican law within Mexican territory. This joinder of alleged offences, one within and the other exterior to Mexico, induced me to order special investi gation of the case pending when Mr. Culling j was released. The incident has, however, disclosed a claim of jurisdiction by Mexico novel in our history, whereby any offense committed anywhere, and of which a Mexicau is the object, ma, if the offender be found in Mexico, be there tried and punished in conformity to Mexican laws. Jurisdiction was sustained by th? courts of Mexico in the Cutting case and approved by the executive branch of the government. Upon the author ity of Mexican statutes the appellate court in releasing Mr. Cutting decided that the abandonment of the complaint by the Mexi can citizen aggrieved by the alleged crime (a libelous publication), removed the basis of further prosecution and also declared JUSTICE TO HAVE BEEN SATISIIED by the enforcement of a small part of the original sentence. The admission of such a pretension woul.l be attended with serious re sults, invasive of the jurisdiction of this gov ernment and highly dangerous to our citizen« in foreign lands. Therefore. I have denied it, find protested against Its attemptel exercise as unwarranted by the principles of law and in ernational usages. A sovereign has juris diction of offenses which take effect within his territory, although concerted or com menced outside of it; but the right is denied Of any foreign sovereign to punish a citizen of the" United States for an offense committed on our sod, even though the offense be against a subject or c.tizen of such sovereign. The Mexican statute in question makes tbe j claim boldly, and the principle, if conceded, j would create a dual responsibility in the citi- ; zen and lead to coufusion of that certainty In lav which is an essential of liberty. When citizens of the United States voluntarily go i into a foreign country they must abide by the j laws there in force, and will not be protected i by their own government from the conse- j quences of an offense against those laws j committed in such foreign country. But the watchful care and interest of this govern ment over it citizens are not relinquished j because they have gone abroad, and If rged j with crime committed In the foreign land, a j fair and open trial, conducted with decent j regard for justice and humanity will be de- I manded for them. With less than that this j govern men t WILL NOT BE CONTENT when the life or liberty of its citizens la at ; stake, whatever the degree to which the ex tension of criminal jurisdiction may have been formerly allowed by consent and recip rocal agreement allowed by consent and re- • ciprocal agreement among certain of the : European states. No such doctrine or prac- i tice was ever known to the laws of this coun- | try, or of that from which our institutions have mainly been derived. In toe case of Mexico there are reasons especially strong for perfect harmony in the mutual exercises of jurisdiction. Nature has made us irrevo- ■ cably neighbors, aud wisdom and kind feeling should make us friends. The overflow of ; capital aad enterprise from these United States Is a potent factor In assisting the de- j velopment of the resources Of Mexico and In building up the property in both conntnes. To assist this good work all grounds of appre- | hension for the security of person and prop- ; erty should be removed, and I trust that in i the interests of good neighborhood the statute referred to will »c so modified as to prevent j possibilities of danger to the peace of the two | countries. OTHER FOREIGN iFi'AIRS. The Discrimination Against Dutch Tohaicii-S .inoii,s:ni-i, Etc. The government of tbe Netherlands has g I bibited concern in relation to certain feat- i ures of our tariff laws, which are supposed ' by them to be aimed at a class of tobacco j p.o lured in the Dutch East Indies. Com- j ment would seem unnecessary upon the un- ' wisdom of legislation appearing to have a j special national discrimination for its object which, although unintended, may give rise to injurious relations. Tbe establishment less than four years ago of a legation at Teheran j is bearing fruit in the interest exhibited by the shah's government in the industrial ac- j tivity of the United States. Tbe opportuni- : ties of beneficial government are now happily restored in Peru by the election of a consti- j tutional president, and a period of rehabilita tion is entered upon. Uecovery is necessarily j slow from the exhaustion causeu by the late j war and civil disturbances. A con- ! vention to adjust by arbitration claims of I our citizens has been promised, and ' is under consideration. The naval officer who ; bore to Siberia the testimonials bestowed by j congress in recognition of the aid given to j the Jeanctte survivors has successfully ac- ! complished his mission. His Interesting re- i port will be submitted. it is pleasant to ■ know that this mark of appreciation has • been welcomed b» the Russian government > and people as befits the traditional friendship . of the two countries. Civil perturbations in the Samoan Islands have, during tho past few I years been * source of 

CONSIDERABLE EMBARRASSMENT to the three governments of Germany. Great Britain and the United status, wuuse relations i uuu u-i.a territorial rights in that important group are guaranteed by treaties. The weak- ; ness of tbe native administration and the conflict of opposing interests in tbe islands have led King Malietoa to seek alliance THE ST. PAUL DAILY GLOBE. TUESDAY MOIINI_TG, DECEMBER 7, 1886 —TEN PAGES. I or protection in some one quarter, re- • gard ess of the distinct engagements whereby no one of the three treaty powers may acquire any paramount or exclu- • sive interest. In May last Malietoa offered to place Samoa under the protection of the Uuited States, and the late consul, without authority, assumed to grant It. The proceed ings were promptly disavowed and the over- ! zealous official recalled. Special agents of the three governments have been deputized to examine tbe situation in tho Islands, with ! a view to a change in tho representation of j all three powers anil a unanimous under standing between them. The peace, prosper- . ity, autonomous administration and neutral- , ity of Samoa can hardly fail to be secured. j It appearing that the government or Spain ; did not extend to the Bag of the Uuited States j in the Antilles the whole measure of recip- j rocity requisite under our statutes for the continuance of the suspension of discrimina- ( tions .f AGAINST THE SPANISH FLAG { in our ports, i was coustraiced la October s last to rescind my predecessor's proclamation , of Feb. 14. 1884, permitting such suspension, j An arrangement was. however, speedhV i reached, and upon notification from the gov- \ ernment of Spain that all differential duties j in respect to our vessels and their cargoes ! from the United States or from any foreign country had been completely and absolutely relinquished, I availed myself of the discre tion conferred by law and issued, on the 27th of October, my proclamation declaring re- j ciprocal suspension in tho United States. It is most gratifying to bear testimony to the j earnest spirit in which the government of | the queen regent has met our efforts to avert i the initiation of commercial discrimination and reprisals, which are ever disastrous to the material interests and the political good will of the countries they may affect. The profitable development of the large commer cial exchanges between the United States and the Spanish Antilles is mutually an object of solicitude. Lyiug close at our doors, and finding here their main markets of supply and demand, the welfare of CUBA AND PORTO RICO and their production and trade are scarcely less important to us than to Spain. Their commercial and financial movements are 80 naturally a part of our system that no obsta- I cle to further freer intercourse should be j permitted to exist. The standing instruc tions of our representatives at Madrid and Havana have for years been to leave no effort uncssayed to further these ends, and at no i time was the equal good desire of Spain more manifested than now. The government of Spain thus removing the consular tonnage fees on cargoes shipped to tho Antilles, and by reducing passnort fees has shown its re cognizance of the need of less trammelled Intercourse. An effort his been made dur ing the past year to remove tha hindrance to the proclamation of the troaty of naturaliza tion with the Sublime Porte, signed in 1874, Which has remained inoperative, owing to a disagreement of interception of the clauses relative to the effects of the return to and sojourn of a natural issue of cities in the land of origin. I trust soon to be able' to an nounce a favorable settlement of the differ ences as to this interpretation. It has been highly satisfactory to note the improved treatment of American MISSIONARIES IN TURKEY", as has been attested by their acknowledg ments to our late minister to that government of his successful exertions in their behalf. The exchange of ratification of the conven tion of Dec. 5, 1385, with Venezuela, for the reopening of the -wards of the Caracas com mission, under the claims convention of 1886, has not yet been effected, owing to the delay of the executive of that republic in ratifying the measure. 1 trust that this postponement will be brief; but should it much longer con tinue, the delay may as well be remembered as a recession of the compact and a failure on the part of Venezuela to complete an arrange ment so persistently sought by her during many years and assented to by this govern ment in aj. spirit of international fairness, although to the detriment of holders of bona fide awards of tbe impugned commis sion. valuable RECOMMENDATIONS. Regarding Citizenship, Copyright and Extradition of Criminals. I renew the recommendation of my last an nual message that existing legislation con cerning citizenship and naturalization, be re vised. We have treaties with many states providing for the renunciation of citizenship by naturalized aliens, but no statute is found to give effect to such engagements, nor any which provides a needed central bureau for the registration of naturalized citizens. Ex perience suggests that our statutes regulat ing extradition might be ad van tag. ously amended by a provision for the transit across our territory, now a convenient thoroughfare of travel from one foreign country to another. of fugitives surrendered by a foreign government to a third state. Such provisions are usual in the le-is latiou of other countries, and tend to prevent miscarrying of justice. It Is also de sirable to remove the present obstacles that authority should be conferred on the secre tary of stat* to issue a certificate in cases of an arrest, lor the purpose of extradition, to the officer before wnom the proceed. ngs are pending, shoving that a requisition for the person charged has neen duly made. Such a certificate, if required to be received before the prisoner's examination, would prevent a long and 

EXPENSIVE JUDICIAL INQUIRY into a charge which the foreign government might not desire to press. 1 also recommend that express provision be made for the imme diate discharge from custody of persons com mitted tor extradition where the president is of tbe opinion that surrender should not be made. The drift of sentiment in civilized communities toward futl recognition of the rights of property in the creations of tne hu man intellect, has brought about the adoption, by many important nations, of au interna tional copyright convention which was signed at Berne on the Igth day of September. 1885. Inasmuch as the constitution gives to con gress the power to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for lim ited times to authors and inventors the ex clusive right to their respective writings an.l discoveries this government did not feel war ranted in becoming a signatory pending the action of confess upon measures of inter national copyright now before it, but the right. of adhesion to the Berne convention here after has been reserved. 1 trust the subject will receive at your hands the attention it deserves, and that the just claims of authors, so urgently pressed, will be duly heeded. Rep resentations continue to be made to me of the injurious effects upon American artists studying abroad, and having iree access to the art collections of other countries, of maintaining a discriminating duty against the introduction of the work a of their brother artists of other countries; and 1 am induced to repeat my recommendation for the aboli tion of that tax. OUR CON MU, AIt StYSTE.YI. flow It Should Ke Itlnin'ained— Tlie Nulara Qiie»tio > l> m ins Pursuant to a provision of the Diplomatic and Consular Appropriation Act approved July 1, 1888. the estimates submitted by the secretary of state lor tue maintenance of the consular service have been recast on the basis of salaries for all officers to whom sucu allowance is deemed advisible. Advantage has been taken or this to redistribute the salaries of the officers now appiepriated lot in accordance with woik performed, the im portance ol the representative duties of tue incumbent, and the cost of living at each post. The last consideration has been too often lost sight of in the allowance hereto fore made The compensation which may suffice for the deccut maintenance of a worthy and capable officer in a position of onerous and reprsentative trust, at a post readily accessible, and where the necessaries of life are abundant and cheap, may prove an in adequate pittance in distant lauds, where the | better part of a year's pay is consumed in I reach. the post Of duty, aud where the comforts of ordinary civilized existence can only be obtained with difficulty and at exorbitant cost. I trust that in considering the submitted schedules no 

MISTAKEN THEORY OP ECONOMY will perpetrate ■ system which in the past has virtually closed to deserving talent many offices where talent and attainments of high order are indispensable, and in not a few in stances has brought discredit on our national character and entailed embarrassment and even suffering on those deputed to uphold our dignity aud interests abroad. In connec tion with this subject 1 earnestly reiterate tbe practical necessity of supplying some mode of trustworthy inspection and report of the manner in which the consulates are con ducted. In the absence of such reliable in formation, efficiency can scarcely be re warded or its opposite corrected. Increasing competition in trade has directed attention to the value of the consular reports printed by the department of state, and the efforts of the government to extend the prac tical usefulness of these reports have created a wider demand for them at home and a spirit of emulation abroad, constituting a record of the changes occurring in trade and of the progress of the arts and inventions in foreign countries. They are much sought for by all interested in the subjects which they em brace. THE THE *SURY. Condition of tbe Public Finances and the Needs, for the Fiscal Year. The report of the secretary of the treasury | exhibits in detail the condition of the public finances and of the several branches of the government related to this department. I ) especiall,- direct the attention of the congress to the recommendation contained In this and the la.st preceding report of the secretary touching the simplification and amendment of the laws relating to the co lection of our revenues,. and, In the Interest of economy and justice to the goverment, I hope they may be adopted by appropriate legislation. The or dinary receipts of the government for the fiscal year endod Juno 30, 1886, were $33 439.727.06. Of this amount $192,905,023.41 was received from customs, and $110,805, --936.48 from internal revenue. The total re ceipts as stated wero $13,749,020.68 greater than for tbe previous year, but the increaso from customs was $11, --434,084.10, aud from internal revenue 84,407.210.94, making again in these items for the last year of $15,841,295.04, a falling off In other resources reducing tho total Increase to the -mailer amount mentioned. The expense at the different custom houses of collecting this increased customs revenue was less than the expense attending the collection of such revenue for the preceding year by $490,603, and the increased receipts of internal revenue were colleted at a cost to the internal revenue bureau of $1,559,419.01 less than the expense of such collection for the previous year. The TOTAL ORDINARY EXPENSES of the government for the fiscal year ending June 30. 1386, were $212 433.138.50, being less by $17,738,787 tban such expenditures for the year preceding, and leaving a surpius in the treasury at the close of the last fiscal year of 893,956,958.56 as against $63,463,771.27 at the close of tho prev.ous year, an increase in sum suplus of $10,492,817.29. The expendi tures as compared with those of tbe preceding fiscal year aro classified as follows: Veiar edJ.ng luar eua.ug June 30,1880 June 30.1885 For civil expenses.... 1*21.955,604 04 $23,824,942 11 For foreign in.er course 1,332,320 88 5,439.609 11 For Indians 8,0.0,158 17 8,553.492 63 For pensions 63.404.50* 03 56,102,267 48 For the military, in cluding river and harbor improve ments and arsenals. 34,324,152 74 42,670,578 47 For the navy, includ ing vessels, machin ery and improve- 1 ment of navy yards 13,907,837 74 16,021,079 69 For interest on public debt I 50,530,145 97 51,386.366 47 For the District of' Columoia | 2,892,32189 3,449,450 95 Miscellaneous expend itures, including public buildings, lit .chouses and col _lu -~g tne revenue. 47,986,633 04 54.728.056 21 For the current year, to end June 30, 1887, tbe ascertained receipts up to Oct. 1, 1886. with such receipts estimated for the re mainder of the year, amount to $356,000,000. The expenditures, ascertained and estimated. for the same period, are $286,000,000, indicating an anticipated surplus at the close of the year of $90,000,000. The total value ol THE EXPORTS from the United States to foreign countries during the fiscal year is stated and compared with the preceding year as follows: Year ending June3o, June 30, 1886. 1885. Domestic merchan dise 5665.964,529 $726,682,916 Foreign merchandise 13,560,301 15,506,809 Gold 142,952,191 8.477,892 Sliver 29,511,219 33.753,633 The value of some of our leading exports during the last fiscal year, as compared with the value of the same for the year immediately preceding, is hero given, and furnishes in formation both interesting and suggestive.

Merchandise $635,436,136 $579,580,053 Gold 20,735,349 26,691,696 Silver 17,850,307 16,550,827 In my last annual message to congress at tention was directed to the tact that the rev enues of the government exceed its actual needs, and it was suggested that legislative action should be taken to relieve tbe people from the unnecessary burden of taxation thus made apparant. Iv view of the press ing importance of the subje :t. I deem It m. duty to again urge its consideration. The in come of the government, with its increased volume and through economies in Its collec tion, is now more than ever IN EXCESS OF PUBLIC NECESSITIES. The application of the surplus to the pay ment of such portion of the public debt as is now at our option. subject to extinguishment, if continued at the rate which has lately pre vailed, would retire that class of indebted ness within less than one year from this date. Thus a continuation of our present revenue would soon result In the receipt of an annual income much greater than necessary to me it government expenses, with no indebtedness upon whic.i it could be applied. We should then be confronted with a vast quantity of money, the circulating medium of the people, hoarded in the treasury when it should be in their hands or we should be drawn into waste ful puulic extravagance with all tbe corrupt ing national demoralization which follows in its train. But it is not tne simple existence of the surplus and its threatened attendant evils which furnish the strongest argument ar.iinst our present scale of federal taxation. Its worst phase is the exaction of sucb a surplus through the perversion of the relations be tween the people and their government— a dangeious departure from the rules whic i limit the right of federal taxation. Good government, of which every American citizen boasts, bas for its objects the protection of every person within its borders with tho greatest liberty consistent with the good of the country, and his perfect security in the enjoyment of his earnings, with the least possible diminution tor the public needs. When more of the people's substance Is ex acted through tbe form of taxation than Is necessary to meet the just demands of the government, and the expense of its economi cal administration, such action 

BECOMES RUTHLESS EXTORTION, and a violation of the fund traental principles of a free government. Tue indirect manner in which these exactions are made has a tendency to conceal their true character and their extent. But we have arrived at a stage of superfluous revenue, which has aroused the people to a realization of tbe fact that the amount raised professedly for the support of the government is paid by them as absolutely, if added to the price of the things which supply their daily wants, as if it was paid at fixed periods Into the hands of the tax gatherer. Those who toil for dally wages are beginning to understand that capital, though sometimes vaunting its importance and clamoring for the protection and favor of the government, is dull and sluggish till, toned by the magical wand of labor, it springs into activity, fur ilshiug an occasion for federal i taxation and gaining tbe value which enables j it to bear its burden, and tbe laboring man is thoughtfully Inquiring whether in these circumstances, and considering the tribute he constantly pays into tbe public treasury as he supplies his daily wants, he receives his fair share of advantages. There is also a suspicion abroad tbat the surplus of our revenues Indicate abnormal and exceptional business poflts, which, under tbe system which produce* such surplus, increases, without corresponding benefit to the people .it large, the vast accumulations of a lew among our citizens whose fortunes, rivaling tee wealth of the most favored in anti-demo cratic nations, are not tbe natural growth of a steady, plain and Industrious republic. OUR FARMERS, too. and those engaged directly and Indirectly in supplying the products or agriculture see J that day by day, aud as often as the daily [ wa its of their households recur, they are forced to pa excessive and needless taxation, while their products struggle in foreign mar kets with the competition of nations which, by allowing a freer exchange of productions tban we permit, enable their people to sell for prices which distress the Ame lean farmer. As every patriotic citizen rejoices in the con stantly increasing pride of our people in American citizenship, and in the glory of our national achievements and progress, a senti ment prevails that tbe leading strings useful to a nation in its infancy may well, to a great extent, be discarded in tbe present stage of American Ingenuity, courage and fearless self-reliance; and for tbe privilege of indulg ing this sentiment with true American enthu siasm our people are quite willing to forego an idle surplus In tbe public treasury; and all the people know that the average rate of fed eral taxations upon imports is to-day, in time of peace, but little less, while upon some ar ticles of necessary consumption it is actually more than was imposed by the 

GRIEVOUS BURDEN WILLINGLY BORNE nt a time when the government needed mill ions to manitain by war the safety and integrity of the United States. It has been the policy of tbe government to collect the principal' part of its revenues by a tax upon imports and no chana\J in this policy is de sirable. ■ But the present condition of affairs constrains our people to demand that by a | revision of our revenue laws the receipts ot the government shall be reduced to tbe necessary e v ptoses of Its economical admin istration, and this demand should be recog nized and obeyed by the people representa tives in the legislative branch of the goverti mont. In readjusting the burdens of federal taxation a sound public policy requires that such of our citizens as have built up large and Important industries under present conditions should not be suddenly, and to their Injury, deprived of advantages to which they have adapted their business. But If the public good requires It, • they should be content with such considerations as shall deal fairly and cautiously with their interests, while the just demands of the people for relief from needless taxation is bouestlv answered; a reasonable and timely submission to such a demand, should cer tainly be possible without disastrous shock to any interest; and a cheerful concession sometimes averts abrupt and heedless action, often the outgrowth of impatient and delayed justice. Duo regard should also bo accorded in any proposed readjustment to tho interests of American labor so far as thoy are in volved. We congratulate ourselves that there is among us no laboring class, fixed within unyielding bonds, and doomed under all conditions to tbe inexhorable fate of daily toil. We 

RECOGNISE IN LABOR a chief factor in the wealth of the republic, and we treat these who have It In their keep ing as citizens, entitled to the most careful regard and thoughtful attention. This regard and attention should be awarded them, not only because labor is the capital of our work ingmen. justly entitled to its share of govern ment favor, but for the further and not less Important reason, that the laboring man, surrounded by his family in his bumble home, as a consumer, is vitally interested in all that cheapens the cost of living and enables him to bring within bis domicile additional oiufortsand advantages. Tais re lation of the workingman to the revenue laws of the country, and tbe manner In which it palpably influences the question of wages should not be forgotten In the justifi able prominence given to the proper main tenance of the supply and protection of well paid labor. And these considerations suggest such an arrangement of government reven ues as shall reduce the expense of living, while it does not curtail the opportunity for work, nor reduce the compensation of Amer ican labor and Injuriously affect its condition and the dignified place it holds in the estima tion of our people. But our farmers and agriculturists, those who from the soil pro duce the things consumed by all, are perhaps more directly and plainly concerned than any other of our citizens iv a just and careful system of federal taxation. Those actually engaged in and more remotely connected with this kind of work, number nearly ONE-HALF OF OUR POPULATION. None labor harder or more continuously than they. No enactments limit their hours of toil, and no interposition of the govern ment enhances to an/ great extent the value of their products. And yet, for many of tho necessaries and comforts of life, which the most scrupulous economy enables them to bring into their homes, and for their Implements of hus bandry, they are obliged to pay a price larirel. increased by an unnatural profit, which, by the action of the government, is given to the more favored manufacturer. I recommend that, keeping in view all these considerations, the increasing and unneces sary surplus of national lucerne annually ac cumulating be released to tbe people by an amendment of our revenue laws, which shall cheapen the price of the necessaries of life and give freer entrance to such imported ma terials as by American labor may pc manu factured into marketable commodities. Nettl ing can be accomplished, however, in tbe di rection of this much-needed reform unless the subject Is approached in a patriotic spirit of devotion to the interests of the entire coun try, and with a willingness to yield something for tbo public good. THE PUBLIC DEBT. The sum paid uuon tne public debt during tho fiscal year ended June 30, 1886, was $44, --5/1,043.36. During tbe twelve months ended Oct. 31, 1830, 3 per cent, bonds were cal.ed for redemption amounting to $127,233,100. of which $80,613,200 was to answer the require ments of law relating to the sinking fund, and $466,399 for the purpose of reducing the pub lic debt by application of a part of tbe sur plus In the treasury to that object. Of the bonds thus called $1(1^,269,450 became subject under such calls to r 'emption prior to Nov. 1.1886. The remainder, amounting to £25, --013,650, matured under tbe calls after that date. In addition to the amount subject to payment and cancellation prior to Nov. 1 there were also paid before that day certain bonds amounting to $5,072 350 which were anticipated, and at tbe maturity of which $2,664,850 had not been called. Thus $107, --341,800 had b -en applied prior to the Ist of November, 1886, to tbe extinguishment of our bonded and interest-bearing debt, leav ing on that day still outstanding tbe sum of $1,153,443,112. Of this accouut $80 848,700 were still represented by the 3 per cent, bonds. They, however, have been since Nov. 14. or will at once be, furtuur reduced by $22,606,150, being bonds which have been called, &i already has been stated, but i.o t re deemed and canceled before the latter| date. COINAGE. During tho fiscal year ended June 30, 1886, there were coined under tne compulsory silver coinage act of 1878, 29,334,8 49 silver dollars, aud the cost of the silver used in such coinage was 23,448,960.01. There bad been coined up to the close of the previous fiscal year, under the provisions of the law, 203,882,554 silver dollars, and on the Ist day of December, 1886. the total amount of such coinage was $247,131,549. The director of the mint reports that at the time of the passage of the law of 1878 directing this coinage, the intrinsic value of the dollars thus coined was 94% cents earn, and that on the 31st day of Jul 1886, the price of sll>er reached the lowest staae ever known, so that the Intrinsic or bullion price of our standard dollar at that date was less than 72 cents. The price. of silver on the 3dt l day of November last was such as to make the dollars intrinsically worth 78 cents each. These differences in value of the coins rep resent tue fluctuations in the price of silver, and they certainly do not indicate that com pulsory coinage b* the government enhances the price of that commodity or secures uni formity in its value. Every fair and legal effort has been made by the treasury department to distribute this cur rency among the people. Tho with drawal of United States treasury notes of small denominations and the issuing of small silver corns have been resorted to iv tno en deavor to accomplish this result, in obedience to the will and sentiments of the representa tives of the people in congress. On the 27th day of November. 1886, the people held of these coins or certificates representing to them the nominal sum of $166,377,041, and we still have $79,464,345 in tbe treasury, as against about $142,894,055 In the hands of the peopie and $72,865,376 remaining in the treas ur. one year ago. The director of the mint a*ain urges the necessity of more vault room for the purpose of storing these silver dollars which are not needed for circulation by tbe people. I have seen no reason to change the views expressed in my last annual message on the subject of compulsory coin and 1 again urge Its suspension on all the grounds contained In my former recommendation, re inforced by the significant increase of our gold exportation- during the last year, as ap pears by the comparative statement herewith presented, and for the further reasons that the more this currency 1-• distributed among the people, the greater it becomes our duty to protect it from disaster; that we no* have abundance for all our needs, and that tbere seems but little propriety in building vaults to store such curreucy, when the only pretense for Its coinage is the necessity of its use by the people as a circulating medium. CUSTOMS REVENUE SUITS. The great number of suits now pending in the United States courts for the Southern dis tricts of New York, growing out of the col lections of customs revenue at the port of New York, ana the number of such suits that are almost daily instituted, ar# certainly worthy the attention of tbe congress. These legal controversies, based upon conflicting Views by importers and the collector as 10 the interpretation of our present complex and indefinite revenue laws, might be largely obviated by an amendment of those laws. By providing such amendment, tbe present condition or this litigation would no relieved. Tnere are now pending about 2.500 of these suits. More than 1,100 have been com menced within the past eighteen months, and many of the others have been at issue for more than twenty-five years. These de lays subject tbe government to loss of evi dence and prevent the preparation necessary to defeat unjust and fictitious claims, while constantly accruing interest threatens to double tbe demands Involved. In the present condition of the dockets of the courts, well filled with private suits, and of the force al lowed the district attorney, no greater tban is necessary for the ordinary and current business of his offices, these litigations can not be considered. In default of tbe adoption by the congress of a plan for tbe general re organization of. the federal courts, as has heretofore been recommended, 1 urge tbe pro priety of passing a law permitting the ap pointment of an additional federal jndge in the district where these government suits have accumulated, so that by continuous sessions of the courts devoted to their trial these cases may be determined. It is entirely plain that a great saving .to the government would be accomplished by such a remedy, and tbe suitors who have honest claims would not be denied justice through delay. THE 

AR.TIY. What It Cost Last Year— The Cap ture of the Apactiee. The report of the secretary of war gives a detailed account of the administration of bis department, and contains sundry recommen dations for the Improvement of the service which I fully approve. The army consisted at the date of tbe last consolidated return, of 2,103 officers and - 24.946 enlisted men. The expenses of the department for the last fiscal year were $26,990,903.28, Including $3,294, --365.43 tor publio works and river and harbor improvements. I espe ially direct the atten tion of the oungress to the recommendation that officers be required to submit to an cx i ' animation as a preliminary to their promo . tion. I see no objection, but many advan tages. in adopting this feature, which has ; operated so beneficially In our navy depart- I ment, as well as in some branches of the • army. The subject of coast defenses and fortifications has been fully and carefully treated by the board on fortifications whose report was submitted at the last session of '. congress; but NO CONSTRUCTION WORK i of the kind recommended by the board has ! been possible during the last year, from the I lack of appropriations for such purpose. ; The defenseless condition of our seacoast ! aud lake frontier is perfectly palpable. The j examinations made must convince us all that certain of our cities named ia the report of j the board should be fortified, and that work j on the most important of these fortifications i should be commenced at once. The work has been thoroughly considered and laid out, the | secretary of war reports, but all is deia.edtn ;Jo fault of congressional action. The abso j lute necessity judged by all standards of pru ' deuce and foresight of our preparation for 1 an effectual resistance against the armored j ships aud steol guns and mortars of modern construction which may threaten the cities on our coasts is so apparent that I hope ef fective steps will be taken in that direction immediately. The valuable and suggestive treat mom of the question by the secretary of j war is c; r icstly commended to the considera tion of congress. THE APACHES. In September and October last the hostile Apaches, who, under the leadership of Ger onimo, had for eighteen mouths been on the warpath, and during tbat time had committed many murders and been the cause of con stant terror to the settlers of Arizona, sur rendered to Gen.Miles, the military commander who succeeded Gen. Crook In tbe manage ment and direction of their pursuit. Under the terms of their surrender, as then re ported, and, in view of the understanding which this murderous savage seemed to en tertain of the assurances given them, it was deemed best to Imprison them in such man ner as to prevent their ever engaging in sucb outrages again, instead of trying them for murder. Fort Pickens having been selected as a safe place of confinement, all tbo adult males were sent thither, and will be closely guarded as prisoners. In the meantime the residue of tbe band, who, though still remain ing upon the reservation, were regarded as unsafe and suspected of furnishing aid to those on the warpath, bad been removed to FortMariou. The women and larger children of the hostiles were also taken there, and ar rangements have been made for putting the children of proper age in Indian schools. TUE NAVY. Unless Something is Done Six Tears Will *cc tiling Left of It But the Name. The report ot the secretary of the navy con tains a detailed report of tbe condition of his department, with such a statement of the action needed to improve the same, as should challenge the earnest attention of congress. The present navy of the United States, aside from the ships in course of construction, con sists of fourteen siogle-turreted monitors, none of which are in commission, nor at the present time serviceable. Tne batteries of these ships are obsolete, and they can only be reded upon as auxiliary ships in harbor defense, aud then after such an expenditure upon them as mig.it not be deemed justifia ble: five fourth- rate vessels of small tonnage, only one of which wai designed as a war ves sel, and all of which ... •» auxiliary merely; twenty-seven cruising sa. * three of which are built of iron, of so. all tonnage, and and twenty-four of wood. Of these wooden vessels it is estimated by the chief con structor of the navy that only three will be serviceable beyond a period of six years, at whicb time it may be said tbat of the present naval force nothing worthy the name will re main. All the vessels heretofore authorized are under contracts In the course of construc tion, except the armored ships, the torpedo and dynamite boats and one cruiser. As to the last of these the bids wen- in excess of tbe limit fixed by congress. Tae production in the United States. OF 

ARMOR AND GUN STEEL ' Is a question, wnich it seems necessary to set tle at an early day, if the armor for war ves sels are to be completed with these materials of home manufacture. This has been the subject of Investigation by two boards, and by two special committees of congress within j the last three years. The report of the gun I foundry board in 1884, of the board on forti fications made in January last, aud the report of the select committees of the two houses made at the last session of congress, have entirely exhausted the subject so far as pre liminary investigation is involve 1. and in their recommendations they are substantially agreed. .In the event that the present invi tation of department for bids to furnish such Of this material as is now authorized shall fa I to induce domestic manufacturers to under take the large expenditures required to pre pare for this new manufature, and no otner steps are being taken by congress at its coin ing session, the secretary contemplates with dissatisfaction tbe necessity of obtaining abroad the armor and gun steel for tbe authorized ships. It would seem desirable that the wants of tne army and navy in this regard should be reasonably met, and that by uniting the contracts such inducements might be offered as would result in securing tbe domestication of these important Interests. TUE 

POSTAL SERVICE. * Marked and Carat if Improve ment Noted During tlie Paat Year. The affairs of the postal service show a marked and gratifying improvement during the past year. A particular account of Its transactions and condition is given in the report of the postmaster-general, which will be laid before you. The reduction of the rate of letter postage in 1883 rendering the postal revenues inadequate to sustain the expenditure, and business depression con tributing, resulted in an excess of cost for tbe fiscal year ended June 30,1885, of eiriit and one-third millions of dollars; an additional check upon receipts by doubling the measure of weight in rating sealed correspondence, and diminishing one-half the charge for news paper carriage was imposed by legislation, whicb took effect with the beginning of the past fiscal year; while the constant demand of our territorial development and growing population for the extension and increase of mail facilities and machinery, necessitates steady annual advance in outlay, and the careful estimate of the year upon the rates of expenditure then existing, contemplated the unavoidable augmentation of tue deli ;iency in the last fiscal year by nearly $2,000,000. THE ANTICIPATED REVENUE for the last year failed of realization by about $64,000, but proper measures of economy have so satisfactorily limited the growth of expenditure that the total deficiency, iv fact, fell below that of 1885, and at this time the iucrease of revenue is in a gaining ration over the Increase of cost, demonstrating the sufficiency of the present rates of postage ultimately to sustain the service. Tuis is the more pleasing because our pe.iple enjoy now both cheaper postage, proportionately* to dis tance, and vaster and more costly service tban any other upon the globe. Retrench ment has been effected in tbe cost of sup plies, some expenditures unwarranted by law have ceased, and the outlays for mail carriage have been subjec.ed to benefljlal scrutiny. At the close of the last fiscal year the expense of transpo -tattoo on star routes stood at an nual rate of cost less by over $56 i, 000 than at the close of tbe previous year, an 1 steamboat and mail messenger servi.ee at nearly $200, --000 less. The service has been in the mean time enlarged and extended by the establish- . ment of new offices, increase of routes of carriage, expauslo 1 of carrier delivery con veniences and additions to the railway m.iil I facilities in accordance with thegrowiug cxi i gences of tne country, and the long estab lished oolicyof the government. Tho post master general calls attention to the existing law for 

COMPENSATING RAILROADS and expresses the opinion that a method may be devised which will prove more just to tbo carriers and beneficial to tne government: and the subject appears worthy of your early consideration. The differences which arose during the ear with certain of the ocean steamship companies have terminated by the acquiescence of all in the policy of the gov ernment, approved by congress in the postal appropriation at its last session: and the department now enjoys the utmost service afforded by all vessels which sail from our ports upon either ocean a service generall >• adequate to the needs of our intercourse. Petitions have, however, been presented to the department by numerous merchants and manufacturers for the establishment of a direct service to the Argentine r p i die. and for semi-monthly dispatches to the umpire of_ Brazil; aud the object is commended to your consideration. It is an obvious duty to pro vide tbe means of postal communicotion which our commerce requires, and with pru dent forecast of results, tbe wise extension of it may lead to stimulate Intercourse and beoome the harbinger of profitable traffic, whicb will open new avenues for the dispo sition of the products of our industry. The circumstances of the countries at the far south of our continent are such as to invite our enterprise, and afford the promise of sufficient advantages to JUSTIFY AN UNUSUAL EFFORT to bring about the closer relations which greater freedom of communication would tend to establish. . I suggest that, as distin guished from a grant or subsidy for the mere benefit of any line of trade or travel, what ever outlay may be required to secure addi tional postal service necessary and proper and not otherwise attainable, should be re garded as within the limit of legitimate com ' Pensatlon for such service. The extension °f the free delivery service as suggested by l he postmaster general has heretofore re ceived my sanction, and It is to be hoped a suitable enactment may. soon be agreed upon. The request for an appropriation suilicient to enable the general inspection of fourth class offices bas my approbation. I renew my approval of the recommendation j of the postmaster general that another as ! sistant be provided for the postofflce depart ! ment, and I Invite your attention to the sev eral other recommendations in his report. I DKPAHTJIIJi I OF JUSTICE. ■ A Discussion of Hie Treatment of Prisoners— The Judicial System. j The conduct of tbe department of justice j for the last fiscal year is fully detailed in tha , report of the attorney general, and I invito j the earnest attention of the congress to tbe ! same, and due consideration of the recom -1 mendations therein contained. In the report • submitted by this officer to the last session of | congress, be strongly recommended the erec tion of a penitentiary for the confinement of i prisoners convicted and sentenced In the I United States courts: and be repeats the rec j ommemlation in bis report for the last year. ; This is a mutter of very great importance : and should at once receive congressional action. United States prisoners are 1 now confined in more than thirty dif ferent state prisons and penitentiaries, situated in every part of the country. They are subjected to nearly as many differ | ent modes of treatment and discipline, and j are far too much removed from tho control and regulation of the government. So far as they are entitled to human treatment and op portunity for improvement and reformation, tbe government is responsible to them; hut this duty can scarcely be discharged without more absolute control and discretion than is possible under the present system. Many of our good citizens have interested themselves with the question of prison reform. The gen eral government should be in a situation, since there must be United States prisoners, to furnish important aid in the movement, and should be able to illustrate what may be practically done in THE 

PRACTICE OF REFORM, and to present an example In the treatment and improvement of its prisoner* worthy of imitation. With prisouers under its own con trol, the government could deal with tha somewhat vexed question of convict labor, so far as its convicts are concerned, according to a plan of its own adoption and with due re gard to the rights and interests of our labor ing citizens, instead of sometimes aiding in the operation of a system which causes among them irritation ana discontent. UDon consideration of this su ject, it might be thought wise to erect more than one of these institutions located in sucb places as would best subserve tbo purposes of convenience and economy in transportation. The consid erable cost of maintaining these convicts, as at present, in state Institutions, would be saved by tbe adoption of the plan proposed, and by employing them in the manufacture j of such articles as were needed for use bj the government. Quite a large pecuniary benefit would be realized in partial return foi our outlay. THE JUI» 

ICIAL SYSTEM. . again urge a change in the federal ju dicial system to meet the wants of the people I and obviate the delays necessarily attending the presentation of affairs in our courts. All are agreed that something should be done, and much tavor is shown by those well able to advise to tbe plan suggested by the attor ney general at the last session of congress and recommended in my last annual message. This recommendation is here renewed, to gether with another, male at the same time, to such a change in the manner of compen sating district attorneys and marshals, and the latter subject is commended to con gress for its action in the interest of economy to the government and humanity, and fair ness and justice to our people. THE INDIANS. Their Condition and Prospects-** Expenses of Their tare. The report of the secretary of the interior presents a comprehensive summary of the work of the various branches of the public service connected with the department, and the suggestions and recommendations which it contains for the improvement of the service should receive your careful consideration. The exhibit made of the condition of our In dian population, and the progress of the work for their enlightenment, notwithstanding the many embarrassments which hinder the bet ter administration of this important branch of the service, is a gratifying and hopeful one. The funds appropriated for the Indian service for the fiscal .-ear just passed, with the available income from Indian laud and trust moneys, amount. in all to $7,850, --775.12, were ample for the service under the conditions and restrictions of laws regulating their expenditure. There remained a balance ' on hand on Juno 30, 1886, of $1,660,023.30, of which $1,337,768.21 are permanent funds for fulfillment of treaties and otner like pur poses, and the remainder, $322,255.09, is sub ject to be carried to the surplus fund as re quired by law. The estimates presented for I appropriations for the ensuing fiscal year amount lo $5,608,873.64, or $442,386.20 less than those laid before the congress last year. The present 

SYSTEM OF AGENCIES, win c absolutely necessary and well adapted for the management of our Indian affairs, and for the end In view when adopted. Is, in the present state or Indian management, in adequate, standing alone for the accomplish ment of an object which has become pressing in its importance, the more rapid transition from tribal organization to citizenshio of such portions of th* Indians as are incapable of civilized life. When the existing system was adopted the Indian race was outside of the limits of organized states aud territories, and beyond the immediate reach and opera tion of civilization, and all efforts were mainly i directed to the maintenance of friendly rela tions and tbe preservation of peace and quiet on the frontier. All this is now changed. There is no such thing as the Indian frontier. Civilization, with the busy hum of industry and the influence of Chrlstiaiiity.surrounding tnese people at every point. None of tbe tribes are outside of the bound of organized government and society, except tbat the ter ritorial system bas not been extended over that portion of the country known as the Indian territo y. As a race the Indians are NO 

LONGER HOSTILE, but may be considered as submissive to the control of the government, as few of them are troublesome. Except the fragments of several bauds, all are now gathered upon reservations. It is no longor possible for them to subsist by tbe chase, and the sponta neous productions of the earth. With an abundance of land, if furnished with the means and implements for profitable hus bandry, their life of entire dependance upon government rations from day to day is no longer defensible. Their inclination, long fostered by a defective system of control, is j to cling to the habits and customs of their ancestors and struggle with persistence I against the change of lite which their altered circumstances press upon them. But bar barism and civilization cannot live together. It is lmposible tbat such incon gruous conditions should exist on the same soil. They are a portion of our people, are under tbe authority of our government, and have a peculiar claim upon and are entitled to the fostering care and protection of the nation. The government cannot relieve itself of this responsibility until tney are so far trained aud civilized as to be able wholly to manage and care for ' themselves. Tlie paths to which they should j walk must be clearly inarkeu out for them, and they must be led or guided until the.- are lamiliar with the way and competent to as sume the duties and responsibilities of our citizenship. Progress in this great work will continue only at the present slow pace and at great expense, unless the systems and meth ods of management are Improved to meet the changed conditions and urgent demands ol the service. The agents having general charge and supervision, in many cases of more tban five thousand Indians, scattered . over large reservations, and burdened witb details of accountability for funds and sup plies, have time to look after the industrial , training and improvement of a few Indian! only. THE 

MANY ARE NEGLECTED and remain idle and dependent — not favorable for progress in civilization. The compensation showed these agents and tbe conditions of tbe service are not calcu lated to secure for tbe work men who are fitted by ability and skill to properly plan and intelligently direct the methods best adapted to produce the must speedy results and per manent benefits. Hence tbe necessity for a supplementary agency or system, directed to the end of promoting the general aud more rapid transition of tribes from habits and cus toms of barbarians to the wa.sof civilization, with an anxious desire to devise some plan of operation by which to secure the welfare of the Indians, and to relieve tbe treasury as far as possible faoin tbe support of an Idle, dependent population. In recommended to my. previous minimi message the passage of a h w authorizing tbe appointment of a com mission as an instrumentality auxiliary to those already estatdisbed for the care of the Indians. It was designed that this commis sion should be composed of six Intelligent and capable persons, three to be detailed from the army, bay ng piactical ideas upon tbe sub ject of tbe treatment of Indians, and: inter ested in their welfare, and that It should be charged, under the direction of the secretary of the Interior, with the management of such matters of detail as cannot, witb the' present organization be properly and successfully conducted, and which present different phases, as the Indians themselves differ in
