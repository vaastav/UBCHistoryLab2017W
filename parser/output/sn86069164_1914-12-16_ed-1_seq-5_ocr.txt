STOP BUYING EXPENSIVE COUGH REMEDIES. Make The Best At Home. Money spent for the old style, ready- made, cough syrups in bottles holding only 2 to 2J ounces is very largely wasted. because most of them are composed prin cipally of sugar and water. Yet you have to pay the same price as if it was all medicine. Stop wasting this money. You can make a better cough medicine at home at one-fifth the cost. Merely go to Henry L. Perry's Drug Store and ask for 2 ounces (50c worth) of Schiffman's Concentrated Expectorant. Mix this with one pint of granulated sugar and one-half pint of boiling water, which makes a full pint (16 ounces). This new. simple, pleasant remedy is guaranteed to relieve the worst cough or cold. Also excellent for Bronchial .Asthma, Bron chitis, croup, hoarseness and whooping cough. One bottle' will make enough borne mada cough medicine to probably bly last the' whole family the entire winter. Children like it, it is so pleas ant to take and it positively contains no chloroform, opium, morphine or other narcotics as do most cough jaix- tures. Keep it on hand in case of emer gency and stop each cough before it gets a firm hold. The above druggist has been authorized to return the money in every single case where it does not give perfect satisfaction or is not found the best remedy ever nsed. Absolutely no risk is run in buying this remedy under this positive guarantee. Adv. Dec. 2 to Jan. 6.
