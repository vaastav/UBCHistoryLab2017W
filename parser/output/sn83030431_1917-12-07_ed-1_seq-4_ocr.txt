At the reception of the Austrian delegations, jays a Vienna despatch, the Emperor remarked to the presidents of the parliaments: "It will be the finest day of my life When I can conclude peace."

By the Hennte and House of Representatives of the United States of America In Congress assembled, that ft state of war Is hereby declared to exist between the United States of America and the Imperial nnd Koyal Atistro-Hungarlan Government ; and that the President be, and he Is hereby, authorized and directed to employ the entire naval and military forces of tho United States and the resources of the Oovernment to carry on war against the Imperial and Hoyal Austro. Hun garian llovernment: and to bring the ronfllct to n successful termination all tho resources of the country are hereby pledged by the Cdngress of the United States. House Committee Report, The report of the House Foreign Af talis Committee begins by stating the text of the war resolution as perfected yesterday, and then goes on : The President has asked for the declaration that a state of war exists against Austria-Hungary. In his ad dress, delivered nt the Joint session of the two houses of Congress on Decem ber 4, he uses this language: "One very embarrassing, obstacle that stands In our way is that we are nt war with Germany, but not with her allies. I therefore ery earnestly recommend that tho Congress Im mediately declare the United States In ' a state of war with Austria-Hungary." The accompanying resolution carries out this recommendation of the Presi dent. The enactment of this declara tion Involves very little readjustment of the affairs between the United States and Austria-Hungary' because a state of war which this declaration declares to exist actually has been a fact for many months. The depreda tions on American lives and rights by Austrian naval forces have been small compared with that of Germany, but they liavo been Indulged In to an ex tent to constitute war upon this, coun try, nnd this fac!, taken in connection with other acta of Austria-Hungary, has more and more brought that Gov ernment Into a position where the American people have realized that she must be Included with Germany as an enemy. 3tr!l:e Were Fomented. In September, IMS, It was discov ered that Ambassador Dumba nnd Austrian Consuls In St. Louis and else where were Implicated In Instigating striken In American manufacturing plants engaged In the production of munition of war. An American citi zen named Archibald, travelling under an American pastrr.ort had been en trusted with despatches In regard to this matter from Dumba and Rern storff to their Governments. These acts wero admitted by Dumba, By rear-on of the admitted purpose nd tntciit of Dumba to consplrp to cripple business Industries ' In the United States and by reason of the flagrant violation of diplomatic propriety in employing an American citizen, pro tected by an American passport, as a serret bearer of official despatches through the lines of an enemy of Austria-Hungary, the Austro-Hunga-rlan Government was requested to re call Dumba. The Austrian Consuls nt St. Louis nnd New York were Implicated with Dumba in these transactions, partic ularly In the circulation of strike propaganda. They were implicated In procuring forged passports from the United States for the ue of their countrymen In going home. Long before the above activities were made public our Government had evidence that the Austrian diplomatic and consular service was being used In this country for Germany's warlike purposes. llrr fnlinmrtnrs rtntblrsa. While Austria's submarine warfare has been of a very limited character, Uicy have adopted and adhered to the policy of the ruthless submarine war fare ot the Imperial German Govern ment. After diplomatic relations with Ger many were broken, the Department on February 14, 1917, despatched the fol lowing telegram to the American Km bassy at Vienna, sun-eying briefly the position nf the Austrian Government on submarine warfare: "In the American note of December 6, 1915, to the Austro-Hungnrlan Gov ernment In the Ancona case, this Gov ernment called attention to the vlcwa of the Government of the 1'nllrd States on the operations of submarines In naval warfare, which had been ex pressed In no uncertain terms to the ally of Austria-Hungary' and of which full knowledge on the part of the Austro-Hungarlau Government was presumed. In Its reply of December 15, 1315, the imperial ana ltoyai Gov ernment stated that It was not pos sessed with authentic knowledge of

JHNDWID all ef the pertinent correspondence of the United 8'ates, nor wan It of the opinion that such knowledge would be sufficient to cover the Ancona case, which was of. essentially n different character from those under discussion with the Merlin Government. Fledgte That Was O Iron. "Nevertheless In reply to the Ameri can note of December 19, 191K, tho Austro-Hungariiut Government In Its note of December 29 elated : " 'An concerns the jirlnclplo ex pressed In the very esteemed nolo that hostile private ships In vo far as they do not flee or offer resistance mny not be destroyed without the persons on board having been plnccd In safety, the Imperial and Hoyal Government Is able substantially to useest to this view of the Washington Cabinet.' "Moreover, In the case of the Pcrsln, , I ho Auitro-Hungarlan Government In January, 1916. stated In effect that whllo It had received no Information with regard to the sinking of tho Persia, yet In case Its responsibility wero Involved, the Oovernment would be guided by the principles agreed to In the Ancona case. "Within one month thereafter the Imperial and Iloyal Oovernment, ro Incldently with the German declara tion of February 10, 191fi, on the treat ment of armed merchantmen an nounced that 'all merchant vessels armed with cannon for whatever pur pose by this very fact lose the char acter of peaceable vosscls,' nnd that under these conditions orders have been given to Austro-Hungnrlan naval forces to treat such ships as belliger ent vessels.' Torpedoed Without Warning;, "In accordance with this declara tion several vesel with Amerlcaim on board have been sunk in the Mediter ranean, presumably by Austrian sub marines, some of which were tor pedoed without warning by subrrm rlnes flying the Austrian flag, ns in the cases of the Hrltlsh steamships flfcondo and Welsh Prince. Inquiries made through the American Ambassa dor at Vienna as to thee cases have so for elicited no Information nnd no reply. "Again on January 31, 1917, eolncl dently with the German declaration of submarine danger xone In water washing the coaxts of the Kntcnte countries, the Imperial and Kiiynl Government announced to the United States Oovernment that Austria Hungary and In allies "would from February 1 'prevent by every meant any navigation whatsoever within a definite closed area.' "From the foregoing It seems fair to conclude that the pledge given in the Ancona case and confirmed In the FereiA case Is crseitlnlly th same no that given In the note of the Imperial German Government dated May 4, Hit, vix. : 'In accordance with the general principles of visit and search and destruction of merchant ves.eli recognlted by international law, such veesels both within and without tho area declared as a naval war zone, shall rot be sunk without warning and without raving humun lives un less these shirs attempt to escape or offer resistance.' nnd that thh plertie. has been modified to a greater or lesser extent by the declarations of the Imperial and Iloyal Government of Vbruary lfl. 1911. and January 31, 1917. Definite Itnllns; Is Asked. "In view therefore uf the uncer tainty as to tho Interpretation to bo placed upon these declaration and particularly this latter declaration, It is Important that th t'nlted States , Government be advised definitely nnd clearly of the attitude of the Imperial and Iloyal Government In regard to the prosecution of submarine warfare In these circumstances. "Pleare bring this matter orally to the attention of the Austrian Govern ment and request to be advised ns to whether the pledge given In the An cona and Persia cases . to twi Inter preted as modified or withdrawn by the declarations of Vebruaiy 10, 1916, and January 31, 1917.

In reply Jlhe Austrian Government In an aide Tnemolre of March 2, 1(17, after reviewing the Illegal blockade measure of the Allloa, stated that "It now as heretofore firmly adheres to tho assurances given by It" In the Ancona case. The Auslro-IIungarlan Ooverhment aim Mated that Austro-Hungarlan submarines had taken no part In tho sinking of the British steamship 8e rondo and Welsh Prince, atid that "the assurance which It gave the Washington Cabinet In tho Ancona caso and renewed In tho Perala case has nolther been withdrawn or re stricted by Its declaration of Feb ruary 10, 1910, and January 31, 1917." Direct Answer la Evaded. The Austro-Hungarlan noto endeav ors through a legal argument to show consistency between these assurances and Its declarations. In this way the Austro-Hungarlan Government eades a direct answer to the Ameri can Inquiry, but in Its argument It substantially adheres to the declara tion of, January 31, 1917, for It states that "the entire declaration Is essenti ally nothing else than a warning to the effect that no merchant ship may navigate the sea sones accurately de fined In the declaration," and that "the Imperial and Royal Government ls, however, unable to accept a re sponsibility for the loss of human liven, which nevertheless may result from the destruction of armed ships or ships encountered In the cloeed tones." In view of this acceptance and avowal by the Austrian Government of the policy which has led to a breach of relations between the United States nnd Germany the Government of tho t'nlted Slates found It Impossible to receive Dumba's successor. Count Tar nowxkl. The Oovernment felt that It could not receive a new Ambassador from a country' which joined Oermany In her submarine policy, even though Its participation might be by verbal and not physical cooperation. This wa communicated to the Austrian Government In n telegram from tho department dated March 23, 1917 Words of. the Presldrat.

The Auetro-Hungarlan Gov ernment has. Indeed, avowed Ita un qualified Indorsement lnd acceptance of the reckless and lawlem submarine warfare udopted now without dl'gulae by the Imperial Herman Government, and It has therefore not been possible for this Government to receive Count Tarnowskl, the Ambassador recently accredited to this Government by the Imperial and Hoyal Government of Austria-Hungary: but that Govern ment has not actually engaged In war fare against cltlicns of tho United Stales on tho seas, and I take the lib erty, for the present nt least, of post poning a discussion of our relations with the authorities nt Vienna. Wo enter this war only where we aro clearly forced Into It. be?nue there are no other mean of defending our rights." The Austrian note of January 31, 1917, proclaimed the same submarine policy as that of Oermany. nnd offi cially announced her Intention, If she aw fit to pursue the same ruthless submarine policy that Germany had Inaugurated. Many vessels have been sunk In tha Mediterranean the area In which Austrian submarines operate by sub marines which carried no flag or mirk and the nationality of which was un known. A great many of these under sea craft are believed to have been Austrian submarine or submarines commanded by Austrian officers or supplied from Austrian basea or by Austrian means. On April 4, 1917, the American four mnaterl sehnnnee Mamie1te wna sunk by submarine thirty-life miles from ' the coast of Sardinia, while en routo to Spain. The submarine carried no flag or marks to Indicate Its nation- , allty. It Is known, however, that Austrian was the language spoken by' the officer of the submarine who came aboard the vessel with the boarding ' party, nnd It Is believed that tho sub marine was Austrian. Before war was declared to enlst between the United States and the Im perial German Oovernment It was In timated to the United State Govern ment that If war should be declared by the United States upon Oermany Austria-Hungary would be under obli gation to break off diplomatic rela tions with the United States.
