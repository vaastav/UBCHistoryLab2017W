of Jsfersou BKXJAMIN F.BEALL, Editor. CHARLES-TOWN, V A;. Tuesday Uonrin^ December 12, JSCS. THE MESSAGE. President t'rtn-Nsojf's message to Congress is" a very able State,_paper; and its general totae will commend it to the approbation of all conservative tacn. To the people of the South he intends, evidently, to act in perfect gbod faith?to do all in his power to extend td them the protection of the Constitution,' and to place their several States back in the Union upon terms of equality with these that did not secede. lie says the General Government cannot exist without the States, uorth<T States with out the General Government. This propo sition is the basis upon -itfiiieh he has rested life plan of restoration; aud from which he shcws'no ir.din.1t:6n sOT? to recede. lie has, he tells u?, proceeded to re organize the States lately in retfcjllion. by appointing Provisional Governors, who had callcd Conventions of tbe jfcftple, and otherwise proceeded with the work assigned them; that the people have, generally, done what was lequired of them as precedent to the re-admission of their respec tive States; bave elected their State Govern ors, Legislatures, &c., and now corns to Con gress through their duly elected Sanatbrs and Representatives, asking their right to parti cipate in the legislation of the country.'? Iftwing-no power to compel^ Congress to ad mit these representatives, he-simply states the /acts surrounding their elections?Congress having the sole power, under' the Constitu tion, each branch for itselfy to judge of the election, return and? qualifications of its own members. Upon the question of "negro suffrage" ho is very clear, aud positive. He denies tlie right- of the Federal Government, or any bfanch Of it, to interfere with suffrage in the States; and, unless we greatly mistake his character, he will not permit Congress to vio late the Constitution, and the" rights of the several States in ihis matter. And he argue3 with .equal force against " military govern ment.-"* in his opinion, the war is ended, aad the military should once again defer to the civil authorities ; and lie only awaits- the restoration of -the Southern States to the Union,' and the complete re-organization of their various State governments, to " with dfew-the military," aud to suppress military tribunals. May God speed him-in the good wook ! There are other subjects of gr'eaE interest treated in the message, but we have not space for further comments. That portion of the message which relates to the States, aud their relations to the general government, will be found ou our first page. THE 

SOUTHERN jiembees. Congress, acting upon the clause of the Constitution which declares each house to be the judge of the election, Teturns and quali fications of its own members, and perverting its true meaning and inrtmt, has refused ad mission to the-Southern members?or rather, has sanctioned' the high-handed act of the clerk, refusing to place their names upon the rolls; and from present indications we see no likelihood of a change. T-his- action compli cates greatly the restoration of the States lately in rebellion to the Uniqn.^ .There is no power granted in the Constitution by which' the States, or any of them, can be held as conquered territory. The President is op posed to the continuance of military rule; and as the commander-in-chief of the army and navy, he will have the ordering of troops. Congress cannot expect that the States will give up tHcir'clear right to regulate suffrage ?within their several limits. ? The formerly so called Confederate States either had the right to secede from the Union, or they had not.? There was no middle ground. If they had no right to secede, they have never been out ef the Union?and their representatives are as much entitled to scats in Congress as those of any Northern State. If they had the right to seeede, Congress had no power to wasre war upon them for the act, or to govern them now as conquered provinces; the only thing it could properly do in this ca-e, would he to re-admit them upon their application, in the mode prescribed in the Constitution. If the State of*Tennessee is not one of the States of the Union, as Congress, by its re fusal to admit its representatives, would- seem to regard it, then Andrew Johnson is not Pre sident of the United States?for the Consti tution expreesly'declares that the President must be a citizen- of the United States?>not of any territory, or-eonquered province. Again: if Virginia'is-not in the Unica? if its ordinance of secession was valid, what becomes of its "restored government?"? And what becomes of the State" of Yvest Virginia? The State of West a irgkna has no other vitality than that given it by. this "restored government of a irginia," aud if Congress should now determine that \ irginia was not in the Union by virtue of its " re stored government;" it by tlie same rule, de termines tha^'the State of est \ irginia is not only not one- of the 1. nited States, but never had any Constitutional existence.? But Congress intends to regard this State, and the others, as iu the Union, or out of it, as suits its- schemes of forcing unconstitu tional and imp roper legislation upon our peo ple; and the only, hope of'otm Southern peo ple for justice aud right is in the honor and the patriotism of the President, r.ad we do not believe that hope 'is misplaced.' we be lieve the President will stand by us, aad put the strong power of the Constitution over u3. as well as over those who are- now-denying ? u? our plainest rights. . lecture at martinsburo. "We learn from the A'cio je>?,and from pri vate sources, that the llev. Dr. Schenck, of j5 dtimore, is to deliver a lecture at Martins burg, Priday evening, upon the su' jcct of Social Forces."

WELT. DOMEI Wo ?congratulate the people of 'JcffofiWf and Berkeley counties 1 The Lcgislnturtf of Virginia has unaniaioifely, in borK* JRllses, repealed the former acts, granting cdtisent to the annexation of those' twtJ'tfourUies to the State of West Virginia"; and has directed Governor Pierpoint tOtrWnstnit the record of its action to tho-'l^cdeVal government. It is our firm opinion that this action of our Legislature'*places it beyond the power of Congress tosanctiou the annexation to West Yirgi?ia-?-the Constitution of the Unite# Swtes requiring the consent of the Legisla tures of the States immediately concrtsdd to be given, as well as that of Congress; and as the former ^consent, given under improper j circumstances and against the"- will of the great mass of our people,'-lias been revoked before any action of Congress has been had on the subject, all tf.a't Congress cau legiti mately do will be to refuse its assent". As the question stands now?indeed' as it has stood all along?the authorities of West Virginia have -no right, whatever to exoTeiie jurisdietion'bf any sort over us, much less to collect taxes from us ; and wc* hope that the legislature will take the proper steps, and as soon as practicable, to have these two coun ties properly organized, under the Constitu tion'and laws of the old State to which they have ever belonged, and from whiclr they never desired to part. Wc remind our friends at llichmond that we have been deprived of the light ot representation in both Senate and llousc of Delegates, by military inter ference procured upon false representations by the so called Governor Doretuan, and are obliged to leave our eau^e in their hands? satisfied that they will do everything in their power to save us from the Unholy alliance, and our Stats*from th~ disgraceful mutilation sotrglst to Lc inflicted on us by tlie officious meddlers beyond the Allcghanics. FHIGHTENED. The pompous, dull-headed individual, who styles himself Governor of West Virginia, and who delights in many proclamations, and revels in the rascalities of his official under lings, has gone to Washington to look after his crown and empire. lie has been greatly frightened by the cool avoWa's made by sev eral New England radical journals, that "the so-called State never would have been form ed, had it been foreseen what manner of men would have represented it in tlic national councils," and that Virginia ?tfas getting four Senators instead of two. One of these jour nals is very bitter on the subject. In speak ing of the act ot Congress, sanctioning tie creation of the new State, it says :? "It docs not "modify or excuse the dish.oh cst character of that proceeding, that in point of fact the pretended State' does not, and never did exk-t. Its creation under the cir cumstances is in'direct and open violation of an express provision of the Constitution; and the Republicans in Congress and in the Lin coln Cabinet who connived at this violation of the Organic Law have succeeded only, in upholding a fraud, the fruits of which they have latterly found exceeding bitter, but they have to swallow the dose; for it was a dish of their own cooking. It seems they arc uow ready to undo the wrong they have done in this mattor. It is a pity their re pentance is not induccd by any higher prin ciple than th&t which impelled them to the commission of the wrong/' This end similar articles- have fallefi'like hot shot in the Wheeling camp; a:rd added to them was the action of the Virginia Leg islature, on-tlie memorial of the people'of Jef ferson and Berkeley?justly indignant at the outrageous frauds which had been perpetrated up<m iheni from the day West Virginia claim ed jurisdiction" over them down to the pre sent time. The so-called Governor hxs seen the denger, and, coining down from-his fonpicr lofty position-r?f arrogant dictation, has gone off to Washington, there to bend his knee to the higher Federal power*, and beg, in all fawning, that his State may b? spared him, and-that lie may still be Governor cf West Virginia, if not by the grace of God, by the miserable fiction of a " military necessity." If these New England gentlemen are really in earnest in their opposition to the new State, let them call upon Congress to dircct the Attorney General of the United States to sue out before the Supreme Court the proper writ to test the constitutionality of its creation,-and, our word for it, that august tribunal will decide that no consent of the State of Virginia, as required by the provi sions of the Federal Constitution, has ever been given, and as no "'mHrtuvy necessity" can operate in the formation of its judgment, I therefore the act creating it was ryull-and void. VIRGINIA LEGISLATURE. Tuesday.?Tlic Senate and the I [out did a good deed and did it quickly. A bill was parsed, and is now the law ot the State, repealing the actallowing the transfer of Jef ferson and Berkeley counties to West A'ir ginia. To the last named act, the sanction of Congress was necessary to give it vitality. That sanction has never becu given. The transaction was, therefore, only iucohate ; and its incomplete state gave Virginia aright to fly the yjroppsed bargain.- With one voice the two Houses declared th:>.4 tho counties ot Jefferson and Berkeley are not to bo yielded. A bill was reported in the Senate amend ing the yd Article of the Constitution/ re storing to certain persons who were disquali fied the rijiht of voting and holding office. In the llouse, Mr. Dickinson, of liussell, submitted a resolution, which was agreed to, that the Committee of Courts of Justice be instructed to inquire into the expediency of amending the law in relation to the collec tion if debts, commonly called the stay law," so as to obviate the necessity of giving notice, and to allow- ouly the interest, with one-fourth of the principal, to be collected per annum.

PAYMENT OF-TLIH STATE DEBT AND TAXA TION'. The holders'*of Virginia State' bands'sre pressing for the paynierot of the interest due. I On the first day or January next, the inter-" est d'ie on these bonds rt-ill amount to above six millions of dcrtlaV^. Various plans have been suggested for1 funding this interest, and I the issue of b'onds for the same, bearing dif ferent rateS Of interest; those \frho hold no bonds, for the most part, propose? that the bonds issued to pay this interest, shall not themselves bear interest, whilst others, in cluding the bondholders, insist on different amtrahts of interest, from one to'sii' per efirit. Thd Knglish bond holdeVs propose that the State shall fund the interest due? them, issue bonds for the sinne, and commence the pay ment of interest on the whole' debt ou the first day of Jailuary, T867. This whole subject addresses itself to your rotist careful consideration. The debt, with its "interest, must be paid ; at the same time, We 'mu'st look to tlte ability of the people to pay. At present, we must rely mainly upon the tax on licerisCs; and upou laud, for raising the means to supply the wants of, the Treas ury. The war has consumed-alar^e amount of the live stock in the Slate". We can ex pect little from a tax on'iae bm'c's ; a large por tion of our public' debt is h-cld by otfr Ov.'n citizeiis, aikI v.fy tax can' be raised from this Source' until the holder receive the interest due on it. The banks, with their dividends, arc gone, and some eight millions of their circulation, having at present only a nominal value, is, for the mcst part, in the hands of our own people ; a large portion oi the in come yielding wealth of the State was invest ed in Confederate bonds, or other issues a 1 of which are valueless Slavery being abol ished, 110 tax can be derived from that source. Suppose AY est Virginia shall pay her lull share according to the taxaticn ot J SOU, the residue is to be p*id by Virginia, i Ins 1'caVcs the assessment on each tax payer the same in proportion to the whole. A lie tax tlien was 40 cents tfpon the one hundred dollars of assessed value. A largo amount of improvements on real estate was destroyed during the war; this will reduce the value of real estate, in the aggregate, lrom its present assessment, so that it will require a tax on real estate of at least 00 centj 011 the one hundred dollars value, iu' acklition to all the reVeuue' that can be ruiscd from other sourccs. . .. , There has hecn much di.-tfussion in regard to the-right of a State to tax the income de rived from Voe dividends ot National l>atiK^ established under tl.ei act of Congress. Doubtless the State has no authority to tar: the bowls of the United States, which arc exempted from taxation by ast of Congress, whilst in the hands of an individual wHo holds them simply as an investment. The charters of the National Banks are granted by the Government of the L nited States; they are located in the several States, based upon United States bonds. AVlicn these bonds are used for banking purposes, a new value is given to them, and an income is de rived from their use, in addition to the yield of interest: The profits of banking, then, become a legitimate subject of taxation, whether invested in real estate or paid to the share holders in money, and the fas'011 the income should he required to be paid directly to the State. TfiV"tax should be on the" in come, and not on the dividend. The taxation of the privilege of taking oysters in the waters ot Virginia has for some years pvior to the rebellion been a sub^ ject of much- discussion. The opponents of such a tax lirfve urged the difficulty of exe cuting any law for this purpose, and have thus far succeeded in preventing the imposi tion of the tax by. the Legislature. Those who enjoy a great mouopoly are naturally prone Jo raise objections to the abridgement of their special privileges. These objections can only bo successfully met by those who arc familiar with the subject. The privilege of taking oysters is a legitimate subject of taxation, and the collection of the tax will be easily executed if the Legislature sli-jll take hold of the subject in earnest. There has been great prejudice W W>.jirila against taking oysters with the dredge, scoop ordra". From the most reliable information I can obtain on this subject, I am satisfied that this prejudice i's unfounded. A\ j'ere oysters remain on tlie rock, undisturncd for years, they become crowded, do not obtain a largo size, become poor, and soon die. when others are deposited which do not become more valuable. Dredging, whilst it takes many,disturbs and scatters the residue, which are improved in size and quality. Ly this mode greater depths will be obtained from 'which0the oysters arc taken, and the field thereby enlarged. I would recommend that th?'taking of oysters by tlw dredge, scoop or dras;, ?sh'cTjJtl he authorized by law in all the water.; of" Virginia where the water is not less than fifteen feet at low tide. But no steamboat, or vessel using machinery worked by steam, should be allowed to take oysters iu this way. All vessels eygaged in taking or carrying oysters, or employed in the oyster trade, should be required by law to obtain a license for the same from sonic person authorized to issue such license. The license should be required to be num bered, and the number, with the name of the State, placed in some conspicuous place on both sides of the vessel, and the license fla med and kept on the quarter deck in some place of easy access for inspection oy any duly authorized officcr of the State. For the first year the charge for the license should be low?say four dgifetfs person on the ton nage oP-ea'cli vessel. All persons who take oysters with tongs in shallow water, should be required to take a license from the clerk of the court of the county or corporation in which lie resides for the vessel, skiff or boat which he shall use; the number of his license, with the name of the county or corporation in which he takes such license, should be marked in some conspicuous place on both sides of such vessel, skiff or boat, tor the privilege of using which he shouldj be char ged s?y six dollars per season, the license not to be transferable. Tlfe season should commence on the first of September and ex pire on the first of May of each year; and no license should be gmr.ted-'fo: a less term than the"wliole season; nor should such lieensc he granted to any person, unless he shall have resided iu Virginia for one year before ob taining the same. A penalty should be im posed upon all persons enL'agsd in dredging for or carrying oysters without having firet obtained the license required by law; aud 111 addition thereto, the vessel of th? party so offending si.duld bo forfeited, with all i:3 freight, fixtui*Js and machinery. A penalty should also be imposed on all violations oft 1:5' law by vessels having a license. In all cases of the seizure of ves??;s in such eases, the hearing for condemnation should be had and the case adjudged by any Judge of a Circuit Court, to whom application may be made by the Complainant or informer, either in vaca tion or in term. ? CotfftUrrent jurisdiction in j this class of cases might also be given to the j county and corporation courts. One-fotrtli of the nroritey derived from the sale of for feited vessels and cargoes should be paid to the office? ordering the arrest; one-fourth to tliSse who 'Shall assist in making such arrest, ac?d the residue tolhe State. Lik<S prcrcfcd ings for ftffeiiures and fines might be had before a Justice of the Peace for violations of the law by persons taking oysters with ttfngs frdw boats arid canoes. Every- v.liitfe" person taking out liceuse for taking oysters should bC required to take an oath, prescribed by law.Tcf observe the oyster laws of the State, and to assist in the enforcement of the same, and should be constituted ai officer for this pttrpose. Land owners on the wafers of Virginia de siring to plant oysters, should b</ requested to stake or mark off. with stakes* or other wise, a space not exceeding an area of five acres, the metes and bounds of which should be recorded in thd deed book of the county in which his laud lies. The wilfnl taking of oysters within such oyster-bjtTs, without the permission of the owner, should be made a felony; but the oysters raised in such beds, if sold for market, should be required to be , earried in licensed vessels. Hulled oysters ! should be allowed to be carried from the ports and landings in Virginia? in kegs or caus in vessels not required' to take out license for the oyster trade. Tlits^would encourage the hulling of oysters in' the State, where the shell, which is of much' value as a fertilizer, would be left. The laws on this subject would require various details, which will suggest themselves to those familiar with the sub ject, and to which I have not alluded. To that feature of this recomu-.cnnation, which i looks to confiuing the carrying trade in oys | ters to actual sellers in Virginia, I ask your | careful consideration. It will doubtless meet \ with much opposition from persons engaged | in the trade who reside out ol the' State, and ' it may be', there are not a sufficietvS number | of vessels'owned by the citizens of the State, i at this time, to carry on the business. It j may, therefore, bo advh-ablc to postpone the j operation of this restriction for twelve months, | iu order to allow time for residents desiring to enter into this business to prepare for the trade. The State of Maryland has enacted a law similar to the law I propose, and confines | b ith the taking and cairying of casters in ' her waters to the residents of that Istate. If ? this business shall be confined to residents in j Virginia, it would very soon largely increase J the wealth and population of tile State. I | would further recommend, that that one j moiety of the tax derived from this source shall be reserved as a sinking fund to pay the public debt. The other moiety should be devoted to the maintenance' of public [schools in the State?the principal invested in good securities,-and only the interest used for that purpose. In the course of fifteen o i twenty ycaVsthis' fund would be adequate % pay a large part of the public debt, and cre ate aliterary fond and woui'(T"'cnsurd a common school' education for all the children of the State. The unsettled condition of tlie industrial, agricultural and financial interests uf the State, the scarcity of live stock in every pal't of the Commonwealth, and the fact that it is almost impossible for !lie farmers to borrow money to replenish their stock, concur to make to make the subject of taxation-, at the present time, one of peculiar embarrassment to the legislator. Wo have iit> batiks of circulation in the State, except National Batiks, and the tax imposed by Congress on the State Banks for bids the establishment of any others, 'jlie Circulation of all the National Banks it: the S'tate only amounts to about 81.1100,000, little more than one-half the iuJ^-cst of the State debt. Ot'.r people have jOule' efforts to increase the number of NaWBrel Banks in tlie State, and thereby to increase tlie volume of circulation ; but these facilities have been capriciously denied by the' Comptroller of the Federal currency. Tlie future ability of the people to pay tax depends much on their ability to re stock tlicir fanfis and carry on their industrial and commercial pursuits. Until we know what will be the policy of the Federal Government in affording National banking facilities, you should be very cau tious lest a tax should be imposed on the' people which they will be unable to pay. 

WEST Virginia." By inc ait'of the General Assembly, giv ing the cousent of this Stute to' tlie creation of the State of'Vest Virginia, it i.s provided that the State of'West Virginia shall pay its equitable share of the public dept. Sly im pression ist-hat this'settlement can be most satisfactorily made by reference to our com missioners, none of whom should reside in either State, two of them to be chosen by cach State, with authority conferred on these commissioners to choose an umpire in case of disagreement-all questions submitted for their consideration to be presented by agents appointed by the General Assembly of each State. A question lias arisen in regard to the status ot the counties of Jefferson and Berke ley. By the action taken these counties lc came organized by persons and ofiiceis who claim them as part of West Virginia. 1 'pon tlio gener;'} reorganization of the State. I found that I could n3t organise these coun ties under the laws and ordinances of Vir ginia, without producing strife and collision*; and as I could do nothing to settle the ques tion definitely, I considered it proper to let the v-hole subject be referred to the Congress of the United States, where authoritative ac tion could be taken, in which ail parties will have to acquiesce.' The fcicrieral Assembly may ad~pt such measures as iweiy be deemed proper for bringing the question to an issue. I think it may be done by a' petition of ei ther party asking Congress to pass a joint resolution expressive of its opinion in regard to the legislative and constitutional aetioa heretofore had in the case; LEGAL INTESEST MONEY. 0~injr to the scarcity of money in (lie Stat;r I think it very important to repeal our usury la'rfs, and that any price for the use of money should be allowed, which may be agreed upon bj- contract in writing between the parties. Let the legal rate remain at six percent. wherd no other rite-is agreed upon. I do not think it best,' at' present. to fix a limit of interest not to be exceeded" by con tract. If a limit were fixed Ly law tl:e high est rate allowed will be the rate charged in every case ; but when the rate hid to be fixed by contract i.v writing, it will shrays enter into the negotiation of the contract, and in terest on money, like the price of everything else, will be reflated by supply and demand. It will be'iapossible to induce capital to seek investment in-this State at six percent., while a higlier rate can be obtained in the other States; in fact, citizens of thfe State, having money to loan, and who do not wish to incur the" Lizards ot usury, carry it to other States for investment rather than loan it here at six per ceSt* ?2?"

Young, of this town, were playing in the hay loft of Mr. Bishop, they l'cll through the door of ihc mow, and were precipitated some twelve or fifteen feet to the hard ground beneath. The younger', ^George, about fif f.-ri years of age, i?il immediately on h:s brother, but his head striking first, resulted in fractures of the sWll, in the legion of the forehead and temple, with depression of the bone, rupture of oti-J of its internal arteries, and cstensivc hemorrhage into the cranium, causing compression of the brain. rlhe ope ration of trephining was practised by Dr. J. A. Straith, assisted by l>rs. J. J. II. Straitli and \V. F- Lippeti, the bone raised, and the clot removed; but the fracture extended so deeply into the ba.t:c of the skull, opening ,V*<p vessels, and the presure of hemorrhage damaged so extensively th'tf baser of the brain that the operation' could not avail, and the youth died on Sunday evening. In this con nection we are glad to learn that Miss Emma F. llcetl, Vfho suffered a similar injury, a few Weeks' a-jo?a large portion of the frontel bone being carried in and driven upon the brain, is* do:ti;f well and will recover. In this case also" the operation, removal from the brain of all the bono' corresponding to the seat of the blow, was performed by Dr. t. v. Straith and Dr. W. F. Lippett.
