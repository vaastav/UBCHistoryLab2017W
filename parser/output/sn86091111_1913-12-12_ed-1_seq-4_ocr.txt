SUBSCRIPTION RATES One year, in advance. Six months, if paid in advance. * « .11.50 * .75 m * Montpelier, Idaho, Dec. 12, 1913. m * The fact that every two years we hAve two elections instead of one as we did a few years ago, is one of the rea sons why the current expens es of the counties have in creased. The primary elec tions cost the counties within i $1 a few hundred dollars as much ! as the general elections. The 9S primary election last year cost Bear Lake county about $1 for every vote that was cast. Instead of wanting to reduce the number of ejections some of the would-be reform ers want more elections—they want elections to recall offic iais, elections to determine whether or not certain laws shall be enacted and elections for the people to pass judg ment on the laws enacted by the legislatures. If all these "reforms" were put into oper ation, the cost of government would be increased many fold and the people would be kept so busy going to the polls to vote that they would hardly have time to attend to their business affairs. President Wilson, in $bis message to Congress, sug gests that a law should be en acted providing for the nom ination of paesidential candi dates by primary elections. This wV»uld undoubtedly mean that every fourth year we would have three elections in Idaho, instead of two, for it is very likely that should con gress enact such a law, it would provide that presiden tial candidates should be nom inated at an eleclion held e j pecially for that purpose. That would mean more bills for the dear people to meet at taxpaying time. While the "reformers crying for more elections so that "the people may rule the Idaho legislature last win ter passed a joint resolution submitting to the electors of the state for their approval or rejection an amendment to the constitution extending the term of office of all state of ficers from two to four years. If the amendment is adopted, at the general election next November, the state officers elected at that time will serve for four years. f ' The adoption of this amend ment will reduce expenses to some extent, although elec tions would have to be held every two years to elect coun ty officers. m * m * * IS »? are Emmrnmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmimnmmma

BAXTER, Manager 'THE HOUSE OF ALL LICENSED FILMS" Remember We Change Our Pictures Every Night ' Pathe Weekly Every Friday and Saturday Las^ Monday's ^Statesman had a timely editorial on the tax questfbn. It was entitled "the cost of fads," and in the article were enumerated a few of the "fad" laws which have beeu enacted of late years and all of which have added to burdens of the trxpayers. Tbe opening paragraph of the article is as follows: "Some day every county in Idaho may have a taxpayers' organization not gotten up, and possibly controlled, by office seekers or others mak ing a profit in one way or other from public office. Such an organizotion will have for its prime purpose not only reasonable reduction of taxes but a more business like ex penditure of taxes. It will not be a tool of politicians. One of the duties of such a body will be to inquire into tbe cost of phblic service and into its relative benefit. When it strikes a balance, it will find the item 'fads and hobbies' in the red! * m m US m * 80, See Any little eye That's the wrong little eye It is the right little eye for me.
