Tuft, the American secretary of war, and tbe members of bis party, ar- - rived here to-day from Moscow. The - visitors were met at '.. the railroad station by. a deputation of officers' rep resenting, the minister of war, the uiiltiary governor ami other officials of St Petersburg. , Anion g those at the statiou were Count Kouitz, who has beeu appointed imperial ..aide ".to Secretary Taft during his stay ill St Petersburg, The secretary and his party took' up their quarters in the Hotel de L'Europe. .Immediately after his arrival at the hotel, the secretary, accompanied by Brigadier General . Clarence T. Ed wards, Montgomery, Schuyler, jr, the American charge d'affaires, aild Cap tain 8. L. V. Slocum, the American military attache at St Petersburg, started on a round of official calls. He went first to see Foreign Minister Is welsky and General Kusiger, the min inister if war, and then called - upon the grand dukes at present living here. These include Nichalos Nicholatevitch, Alexander MichaelovitcU and half a dozen others. ' Secretary Taft had desired to visit the duma this afternoon, but." this was made impossible by the late hour at which his train arrived here. The carriages of the American em bassy in which the secretary drove while paying his calls were recognized everywhere. Crowds gathered, in spite of the threatening weath?r, and -General Taft," as the secretary has come to be called here, was cheered again and again. Owing to the extraordinary rumors in circulation here regarding the-nature of his mission, the visit of Sec- rotary Taft has aroused the ' liveliest Interest. The Itossia, however, iuake3 an effort to correct these wrong im pressions;. The Itossia is the official organ of the government. . In extend ing to Secretary Taft an "open door Russian welcome," -the paper says: "The high position and-the personal. merits of Secretary-Taft explain the heartiness of his reception and " the honor of an andleneeof ,the emperor,' but It is a mistake to suppose that Mr Taft's. visit Is in any way connected with a change in the internal policy of Russia. There Is not a word of truth in the rumors that We are to give base for an American fleet at Vladivostok or any other Russian port, but the visit of Secretary Taft will renew and strengthen the old bonds of sympathy between Russia'; ami America."', 1 . Mr Taft is expected to allude to the romors in a speech at the banquet to be given him this evening by the members of the American colony of this city. He will then give them an American denial. The empress of Russia Is indisposed and probahly will not be able to re ceice Mrs Taft to-morrow, consequent ly the secretary will go to Tsarskoe Selo alone. To-morrow evening the secretary will attend an banquet at Foreign Minister Iswolsky's. which will lie followed by a big reception of the diplomatic corps and Russian offi cial society. Secretary Taft probably will 1m forced to go to Boulogne to catch the steamer President Grant on which he returns to the United Slates. The President Grant leaves Hamburg De Vemlier 7 ami Boulogne Ieccinber 8, thin will give him n day longer. Mrs Taft. accompanied by Mrs George Post Wheeler,, wife of the sec ond secretary of the American em bassy at Tokio, will go from here to Vienna nnd Taris. She will return to the United States several weeks after her husband. When questioned regarding the presidential Kitnation in the United State. Secretary Taft requested to be excused from expressing any opinion. He said he bad announced a year ago his readiness to accept the nomination In case it was given to Iilm and that bis attitude had not changed since.

DEMOCRAT Office ready to work Thorsdaj motrnzg at 8 o IT LOOKS SUSPICIOUS Washingon, Dec. 3. Ambassador Aoki has been summoned to Japan by his government to explain personally and in detail the precise situation in this country in regard to the Japan ese immigration problem. , The ' ambassador has been making careful inquiry of his own account and through the various Japanese consular offlcei'3 into the extent o the reported race feeling existing in some sections of the United States towards Japanese immigrants. Al ready Baron Ishii, one of the secre taries of the Japanese interior de partment, has made an investigation of conditions existing not only in California, Oregon and Washington but also in British Columbia on the north, upon which he has based a special report to his government. But it is believed that the purpose of the Japanese government in summoning Viscount Aoki to Tokio is to secure from him information which Baron Ishii could not possibly have acquir ed during bis short stay in America regarding the attitude of the admin istration here with particular refer ence to the measures of which have recently been applied by the Japa.ie.se government to restrict the departure from Japan for America of the coolie element. Also the Japanese govern ment desires a prudent forecast of the likelihood of congressional action in the direction of legislation provbMug for the exclusion of Japanese immi gration. At the Japanese embassy it is stat ed that the ambassador will prob ably leave Washington for i'okio by way of San Francisco or Victoria in about a fortnight, a fact of which hd yesterday notified the president and Secretary Root. There is no intima tion that he is not to return tr Washingon. During his absence Mr Miyaoka, the counsellor of embassy, will be in charge of the affairs.

He is stil! conducting the investigation, and al though it was expected that be would be finished taking testimony by this evening, it now looks as though Is will have to continue to examine witnesses to-morrow. The investiga tion, which is now going more slow ly than the first couple of days, was held in the office of the deputy cor oner. When lie conrcrreu wmi mc railroad authorities to-day is a iues tion which he did not care t ans wer. Neither did he know whether the railroad men were holding nn other Investigation of their own. As far as could le learned, there was no general conference to-day of the rail road otiieinlH and it seems they are awaiting the verdict of the corner. Judging from the action of the Con necticut Co in laying ofT fat rick Itocers. who is accused of lieing neg ligent at the ISank street crossing Sun day afternoon, all trolley employes are likely to lie made to live up to the rules or lose their jobs. It may help for .1 time at least.

Attorney Carmody represents the estate of Jane Kelly, who was killed and her sister, Teresa, who is in the hospital with an injured ankle. Friends of Sarah .Ryan, who was killed, have placed a claim with At torney Guilfoile to recover for her es tate. It is said this girl would have been in Ireland, her native . home, weeks ago. had not. the hn themselves of the three months clause. Miss Ryan's cousins, Kittle and Bridget Hanley, have also re tained Attorney Guilfoile and so has Mrs Elizabeth Brophil of North Main street. Attorney Bobbin has two claims for injuries and yesterday Attorney Mc Evoy settled for one. Mrs Mary Lehr of 113 Johnson avenue has given her case to Attor ney Lynch. This woman started off on a day's washing and was unable to speak when picked up. She is only recovering her speech. Attorney Slavln has two cases, in fact it seems that every lawyer in town has a case or two arising out of that terrible accident. In the cast of those who were killed outright only $5,000 can be recovered if it is proved that the car crew was neg lectful, for that is all the law al lows for. instanteous death. In the case of injuries it is different, dam ages being awarded in case the com pany is found responsible, according to the earning capacity of the injured party before the accident occurred that deprived him of his full earn ings. Claim agents and claim attorneys for the company have visited mostly all of those injured and the friendt of those who were killed. ONE PARIIOX GRANTED.
