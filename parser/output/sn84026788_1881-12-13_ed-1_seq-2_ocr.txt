The Guiteau trial still drags its weary length at Washington, without any special k new features. The evidence has not yet f closed. The Virginia legislature assembled on Wednesday. The Roadjusters organized both Houses, Govornor Holliday sent in his message, whieh is a strong state paper. James Morrow, Jr., and A.

Strother, "Port Crayon," recently visited the Luray Cave, and says, "Id my earlier days I explored a number of ?otable caverns, including the 'Mammoth Oa*e,' in Kentaoky, and 'Weyers,' in Vir ginia, bat I mast confess that my reoont visit f the Cave at Laray has been a new revela tion, surpassing as that does all I had pre Tioasly seen, in the richness and profusion of its ornamentation and its weird and dra matic effeotB." The Baltimore Gazette has been sold to a joint stock company, all of whom rcsiao in the State of Maryland. Mr. B.

The ?ew owners agree to invest $300,000 as cap ital with which to oommeceo. There will be many improvements and several new fea tures in the coming Times. Tho President's message, sent to Congress", last week, is a very elaborate one, covering a great deal of territory and entering minute ly into the discussion of tho affairs which relate to all departments of tho Government. It is emphatically a hard monoy document, ani this feature will draw out a wider dis cussion than any other part of tho message. He would atop the coinage of silver, retire the silver certificates, strip the greenbacks of their legal tender quality, and, in short, set up not only a gold standard, but presumably an exclusive gold currency. The President would at the same time reduce taxation on all articles save tobacco and spirituous li quors. He shows that at tho proeent rate of taxation the national debt would be paid in ten years, and we ean afford to mako haste a little more slowly in tho accumulation of a little surplus revenue. The first sossion of the Forty seventh Con gress commenced on Monday of last week The Republicans organized tho Douse in ao oordanoe with the caucus programme of the Saturday previous, when Gon. Kiefcr, of Ohio, received the caucus nomination on the sixteenth ballot. Edward McPherson, of Pennsylvania, was elected Clerk ; Col. Geo. W. Booker, of Vermont, Sergeant-at-Arms; Waller P. Brownlow, of Tennessoo, Door keeper ; Captain Harry Sherwood, of Michi gan, Postmaster; and Ilav. Frederick D. Power, of Washington, Chaplain. Tho Democrats voted for Hon. S. J. Kandall for Speaker, and the Greenbaokera voted for tho following named gentlemen, who had been Bominated by a oaucus held the previous Saturday : Hon. Nicholas Ford, of Miss souri, for Speaker; Hon. Gilbert De La Matyr, of Indiana, for Clerk of the House; Dee Cracdall, of Washington, D. C., for Sergeant-at Arms ; II. Martin Williams, of Missouri, for Door-keeper; and W. C. Moore, of Pennsylvania, for Postmaster. Few honsea. in any line of business, have ex tended their trade all over tLe entire conntry Ha have D- M. Ferry &. Co.. the celebrated Seedsmen, of Detroit. Mich. They furnish em ployment to about 1.000 persons, and keep 00 commercial travelers on the road, looking aftor their interests. TJiey crow on their own Seed Farms a. very larce proportion of the Seeds they sell, which is probably one of the piincipnl reasons why their Koods are held in such Inch esteem all over the land- We wonld advise all our readers seeking information regarding seeds to send and procure a copy of their now and beautiful Seed Annual for 1SS2. A Word to Mothers ?

COMMUNICATED. Just after the late State eleolion in Vir ginia I sailed attention, through the oolamnB of your paper, to the faot that the victory of Mahone was io no sense a victory /or the Roadjustors of that State, and that the Re publican leaders would dictate the policy of Mahone and his followers. The following interview whioh took place a few days ago between President Arthur and a delegation of Republicans and Rcadjuxters of Virginia puts all doubt on the question at rott : The Virginia Sena tort hip.?A delega tion of nino Virginia politicians yesterday visited President Arthur in rcferoDee to the Senatorial contest. Two ot the delegation wore Messrs. Paul and Fulkorson, the Read juster Congressmen. Ono of the narty took from his pocket a dispatch from Richmond, Va? in which it was represented that the President would throw the supper! ef tha Administration with the Readjuster candi date, Mr. Riddleberger. The President pre nouncod the story false, fie then took oc casion to assure the delegation that bis sym pathies were quite to the contrary. He thought the best thing the Virginia Legisla ture could do was to elect Mr. Lewis or some other sound Republican to the Senatorship. The President said further, that in his opin ion this was duo to tbo Republicans of Vir ginia, beoause the Readjusters were already represented in the Senate, and the Republi cans who voted the winning tieket and who oast the most votes for it should also be rep resented. * * * HOW TO
