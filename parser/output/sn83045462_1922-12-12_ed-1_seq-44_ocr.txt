IMstrict Firm to Build Adjoining Temple Heights. The district Commissioners yesterday authorized the issuance of a building permit to Blessing & Warwick for the erection of a combination public garage and apartment on 19th street north of 9 Florida avenue, adjoining Temple Heights. The question of whether this permit .should be issued has been under consideration for more than a mouth, following a public hearing at which a number of protests were received. The garage will not be visible from 19th street, for th?- season that the apartment will occupy the front of the lot. A considerable portion of the garage in the rear will be below the street level.
