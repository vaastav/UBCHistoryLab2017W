The President's Message is before us, but too lengthy for our issue. We present our readers with the following brief synopsis : After the usual congratulations as to "peace and prosperity" the Presi dent assures the near approach to complete restoration of the Union, and indulges the hope that all will join in the payment of the National debt. He gives his reasons for not taking a more active part in the present Eu ropean trouble, "that the true inter ests of the United States forbade her to interfere in European questions with other European powers." In ref erence to the Cuban question, he states that the condition of the insur rection has materially changed since the close of the last session, and that steps have been taken to submit the matters of difference that have arisen out of the insurrection, between Spain and this Government, to a joint tri bunal to be established in the United States, having full jurisdiction over all claims that our citizens may have against Spain. He States that the feigns of the times indicate that at no distant period European political con uectlon with the South American States will cease, and he recommends such a course by this government as shall ally the commercial interests of the Spanish American States more closely to our own. He earnestly recommends the rati fication of the San Domingo treaty that failed at the last session of Con gress, and argues of a long list of blessings that will flow to our people from the acquisition of that Island. The Message is brief on the Alabama claim, only recommending that all claims for loss be heard by a Commis sioner appointed by our Government, that the Government pay the individ ual los.-es that are allowed by the Commissioner, and hold her claim for future settlement with Great Britain. The Message claims that the Cana dians during the past year, have been unfriendly to our fishermen, and com plaint is also made of the claims of the Canadians to the entire naviga tion of the riwr St. Lawrence. This subject is disponed of with the ex pression of a hope that the govern ment of Great Britain will see the justice of abandoning the narrow and inconsistent claim to which her Cana dian provinces have urged her adher ence. Attention is called to the depressed condition of our Commerce and he recommends that some measuies be adopted to restore the same, even though it be at the cot of some mon ey to the government. He al-o rec ommends an appropriation for the erection of new buildings for the Pub lic Archives. The Message recites the fact, that extradition treaties have been conclu ded with several of the Central Amer ican Republics, aud that others are in progress. The President, in his message rec ommends that Congress consider the propriety of transferring to the de partment of thef nterior all powers and duties in relation to the Territories with which the Department of State is now charged, and fiom the Interior Department to the War Department the Pension Bureau, so far as it regu lates soldiers' pensions. It is further recommended that the payment of Navy Pensions be transferred to one of the bureaus of the Navy Depart ment. Referring to finances it is shown that the expenses of the Government exceed the appropriatians for the present year by S,y72,127.o6. In referring to the National Bank ing system, the President expresses himself satisfied with their workings, and recommends that the system should be extended only for the pur pose of meeting the demands of busi ness. He also calls the attention of Congress to a bill submitted at the last session relative to mintsaud coin age system of the country. The Message seems to advocate an early return to specie payment or its equivalent, and to be in that Revenue reform that will cause the tax gather er to disappear from the door of the citizen almost entirely, but conceives that this reform must be the work of legislation and time. The Secretary of War's report shows a reduction of the expenses of the army. In the Navy the expense, ending the year Dec. 1st, 1SG9, are less than $19,000, 000, or about one million less than they were the previous year. The ex penses since the commencement of this fiscal year, since July 1st, show for the five months, a decrease of ov er $2,400,000. The Postmaster Gener al's report shows a most .satisfactory working of the Department, aud by the abolishi ug of the Franking priv ilege it is believed that u self-sustaining postal system may speedily be looked for, and at no distant day a further reduction of postage. The President refers to his Indian policy, and believes it will speedily result in placing all the Indiana upon reserva tions. In reviewing the appropriations of Government lands for the purposes of 'education and interior improvement he expresses himself strongly iuclin d to the inexpediency of either, and In concluding the Message he says : I would sum up the policy of the Administration to be a thorough en forcement of every law, a faithful collection of the taxes, a provison for economy in the disbursement of the same, a prompt payment of the debt of the nation, a reduction of taxes as rapidly as the requirements of the country will admit, a reduction of taxation, and the tariff to be so ar ranged as to afford the greatest bene fit lo the largest number; honest and fair dealings with all other people, to the end that war, with all its blight ing consequences may be avoided, but without surrendering any right or obligation due to us ; a reform on the treatment of Indians and in the whole civil service of the country ; and finally, in securing a pure, uu trammeled ballot, where every man entitled to cast a vote may do so just once, at each election, without fear of molestation or proscription on ac count of his political faith, nativity, or color. 2 s 

WATCH PRESENTATION TO PROF. McKEXZIE OF STATE NORMAL SCHOOL. The surprise demonstration : pre sentation of a watch and chain to Prof. McKenzie, late Principal of the State Normal School, at Peru, Tues day evening, was one of the most in teresting and pleasant occasions we have witnessed for many years. The Professor was taken entirely by sur prise. The presentation addresss was made by Miss Ella M. Stafford, of Grant, in this county, assisted by James W. Williams, and Mis? Libbie Neal. The address of Miss Stafford was appro priate, to the point and exceedingly well delivered. It was as follows : Prof. McKenzie: In behalf of the students of the Normal Depart ment of this school, I come to offer you an expression of our kind feeling tf ...-. and regard. We can never, by any gift, cancel the obligation we are un der to you, not only as a school, but as citizens of this new State. We feel that you have not only aided us dur ing the tune we have been with you, but you have conferred a lasting bless ing upon us in the effoitsyou have made to establish and buiitl up this free institution of learning. We know you have not considered vourown convenience, or comfort, or thought of pecuniary gain but un- selfishly worked on, that the Slate might enjoy the advantages which Education alone can bring. After much deliberation, as a school, we de cided that as you were to enter upon a new field; one in which you would be compelled to leave behiud you the faithful co-worker of so many years; and since we could not go with you, we thought that it would be proper to furnish y ju with a companion, which would be trusty and tiue ; one which will not refuse to accompany you in all your journeyings. While this will beaAiithful monitor, we trust you will avoid its example, and never go "on tick." At the proper time, the tiny little Miss Libbie stepped forward, placing the watch in" the Professor's hand and fastening the chain to his vest. Prof. McKenzie is characterized for non-embarrassment, and has often boasted that he could not be discon certed. This demonstration on the the part of his students was too much for him, however. He completely broke-down. After a few moments he recovered himself "and delivered an appropriate and elegant response, in which he briefly referred to the pro rro.s of Education in this new and rapidly developing State; his new connection therewith, aud ins determ ination to serve the youth of the State to the best of his ability. The following inscription was neat ly engraved on the watch : "Pre sented to J. M. McKenzie by Nebras ka State Normal School, December 7, 1S70." Tronic Road Proposal to Build. It. A meeting of the Board of Direc tors of the St. Louis & Nebraska Trunk Rail Road Company, was re cently held at Nebraska City. At which a written proposition was sub mitted by J. F. Joy, to build the road from the Kansas aud Nebraska State line to the Platte river, there to con nect with the Omaha & Southwest ern R. R., already constructed to that point. The points in the proposition are that he will build the road, with in the boundaries mentioned, within the year 1871. That he wants no compensation, of any kind until the road is completed, and in running order. When completed he is to have county bonds, running twenty years, and bearing eight per cent interest, as follows: From Riehadson county, $100,000; Nemaha, Otoe and Cass, $150,000 each. The company to trans fer to him the franchise, together with assets preseut and prospective. We submit this proposition for the consideration of the counties interest ed. Nemaha county has already voted $132,000 to the Trunk, which now stands ready to be handed over in compliance with the stipulations of the voting : $1500 per mile when graded; $1500 per mile additional when ready for the iron, and $1,000 more per mile when ready for the rolling stock. Richardson county voted $3,500 per mile, about on the same condi tions as those of Nemaha, but the time at which the work was to have commenced, expiring in June last, there will needs be new action of some kind, on the question. What will Otoe and Cass do? This is an important matter, and requires prompt action. The new Catholic Church at Bulo was blown down during th o-ale on I Sunday night. EMIGRATION. The following is the letter from Jay Cook, referred to by our Philadelphia correspondent a few days since. It wa3 addressed to the National Emi gration Convention which recently met at Indianapolis. The two most important features, or suggestions, in this letter, hag always been almost en tirely lost sight of in our efforts to promote emigration. The emigrant should be conferred toith at his' old home. In other words, our agents should be sent direct to the country from whence the emigration is ex pected, or desired. Then he should be provided for from thence to his new home. Particular arrangements should bo given to the colony idea, that the neighbor in the old home may be the neighbor in the new home. As Mr Cooke very appropriately says. To confer with the emigrant at his home in the fatherland, more time and attention can be given to details by the agent, and the emigrant will have more faith in representations. At Castle Garden, or any other land ing in this country, emigrants expect, or at least are continually fearful of imposition. Although for years we have as a nation derived a large share of our marvelous increase in numbers, wealth and power from emigration, this vast interest has been singularly neglected by our national govern ment, while State authorities and private corporations have accomplish ed much. Experience has shown that the General Government is the only power competent to do the real ly national work of fostering emigra tion on an adequate scale, and pro tecting each emigrant while in tran sit between the old home and the new. In addition to the government neglect of the emigration interest, it seems to me it wholly lacks a business like method of promoting the rapid settlement of our public lands by our landless citizens, native and foreign born. Our liberal Homestead and Bounty laws' are rendered inoperative through the failure to dissiminate, among the classes they are specially designed to benefit, that minute and full information without which the proflered gift of free land has little value. For example, what farmer's son, what laborer in an Eastern city, much less what newly arrived emigrant, knows where to fiud desirable public lands, or how to secure them when found? A simple and inexpensixe system of furnishing this information to the laudless masses, by means of maps, plots and printed documents, would quadruple the presentence of settlement of our public domaiu, give prosperous homes to thousands who are now poor and homeless, and add proportionately to our national growth and wealth. As some intimation of my own views on certain points of the sub ject you have in hand, I may remark, in organizing the emigration depart ment of the Northern Pacific Rail road, perhaps the most extensive movement of the kind yet undertak en, this company aims: First. To select as its emigration agents at home and abroad only men of the highest character. To permit on rep resentation to be made by its author ity which the facts will not fully war rant. Third. To promote, as far as possible, emigration by colonies, so that neighbors in the fatherland may be neighbors in the new West. Fourth. To exercise over emigrants, from the time they leave one home until they reached another, whatever supervision their best interests may require, seeing lo it that transporta tion charges are the lowest attainable, that acommodations on ships and "cars are comfortable, that their treat ment is kind, and their protection against fraud, compulsion and abuse of all sorts complete, aud that every dollar of unnecessary expenditure en route is avoided, and the emigrant enabled to husband his scanty means for the work of starting a homestead. These matters of detail, though seem ingly unimportant, make just the dif ference between the content and dis content, the success and failure, of thousands who come among us, stran gers to our language, our geography, and our. ways of life. The corpora tiou for which I have taken the liber tv to speak above, intend to complete the work of cariug for the emigrants who move to the line of. their road by furnishing lands at such moderate prices, and long credit that the poor est need not remain landless ; by aid ing all who prefer it to secure home steads from the government domain ; by transporting settlers, their families ahd goods at reduced rates; by seeing to it thatall the elements of a sound civilization, including educational, church and mail facilities, keep pace with the progress of the road.and the growth of communities. Hoping for the best results from the deliberations of your convention, I am, yours truly, jay Cooke. It may not be understood, why the President hesitated to cenfer upon Admiral Porter, the "honors of the late Farragut. The fact is that Por ter during the war wrote to the Secre tary of the Navy a letter complaining of Gen. Grant as ambitious and sel fish seeking to take to himself honor that did not belong to him, and throw ing upon others the blame of his fail ures. This letter has been exhumed from the files of the Department and published. Hence the difficulty. AYe think the President might afford to fonret this matter. There were many to complain of Grant at the time Por ter wrote this letter. Lincoln would have cashiered him about that time, had it not been for Washburn. Mat ters all terminated well, and as timss have changed, he might change with them. The place of Farragut is va cant by death, and no one else enti tled to it.

MORTOX'S LECTURE "BRASS" Was delivered under the auspices of the Brownville Literary Associa tion, Fridaj evening to the largestand most attentive audience we have seen assembled on such occasions, in this city. Mcpherson's large new hall was J nil; nearly every chair occupied. Such an attendance at the opening Lecture of the Season, is highly grat ifying to those who have been labor ing to mako the association a success. It is an indication of the refined and literary tastes of our people, of which we feel great pride, As a Lecturer, Mr. Morton acquit ted himself very handsomely and creditably, indeed. The subject of the lecture, "Bras9," or in other words "cheek," "effort," "persever ance," "work," "self-ieliance," "en ergy' "pluck," is one to which the author has given much attention, and handled it admirably in its practical applications to success in life. The speaker was frequently and heartily, applauded during the delivery, thus showing the appreciation of the audience. NEBRASKA INSANE ASYLUM. A corespondent of the Nebraska City Chronicle Anthony Angle gives the following description of the Insane Asylum at Lincoln: "It is located on the high prairie south of Salt creek and about two miles southwest of Lincoln, com manding a line view of that City, and built of brown sand atoue. The cen ter or main building is 90x72, live stories in hight with basement. A wing S0x42 four stories high runs nosthwerd making the present frout 170 feet. Another wing of same di mensions will eventually be added on the south, which will give the en tire structure a front of 150 feet. The workmanship tluoughout is of the first order, and it is supplied with all the modern improvements. Every Hall and room in the Asylum is heat ed by means of seven immense fur naces in the basement. Hot and cold water is carried to every lloor, and ou the fifth lloor are immense tanks, the capacity of which are 125 bbls. eacb The building contains six wards, with sick room, bath room and clothes and water closets to each ward, with capacity for 100 patients. Aside from these are thirteen rooms for attend ants. The other rooms are in dimen sions as follows : Billard room, 25x30; Lecture room, 25x50 ; Three dinning looms, 18x25; Chapel, 25x55 Stew ard's and Matron.s rooms, i5xlS each; Seamstress room, 12x18 ; Reception room, 15xlS; Superintendent's ollice, 15xlS. The Supt. aud Assistant Supts. family rooms are eight in number all of the officers appartments are nicely and neatly furnished. The halls are spacious, aud as far as ven tillation is concerned it cannotr be ex celledeverything about the institu tion has a light airy appearance. In the basement are the Store rooms, Laundry kitchen, &c. The kitchen is a model, fitted up with every con venience imaginable. The farm con nected with the Asylum only contains 100 acres, which is not sufficient, and I would suggest that another 1G0 be added while land can be had at a reasonable figure. According to Prof. Ranneys last report, the pro ducts of the Asylum farm In Jowa (340 acres), ata fair valuation, amount ed to nearly $5,000 in 1S69, aside from the butter and milk. The number of lunatics, when all are gathered up from different parts of the State will amount to about 40. Officers of our State Asylum aro as follows : N. B. Larsh, M. D. Supc. J. N. McAusland, M. D. Asst. Sup. Win. L. Shumaker, Steward. Mrs. Finn, Matron. Superintendent Larsh seems to be the right man in the right place, and enters upon his duties with a vigor that will ceitainly insure success to the institution. 

OMAHA AND SOCTAVESTERN. We learn that there is a temporary hitch, in the negotiations between this company aud Cass- county. The city authorities of Plattsmouth, desir ing to have the road to run through the corporate limits, the O. & S. W. It. R. offer to run within three-quarters of a mile of the city limits. They state that, were they to accede to the proposition of the city, they would be compelled to tunnel through the hills that surround Plattsmouth. The present financial outlook of the com pany will not permit them to do that. Should the Cass county difliculty be disposed of soon, the company could have the road completed and in run ning order to Nebraska City by the 1st of next May, the negotiations be tween the company and Otoe county being virtually concluded. Omaha Herald. The Lincoln Literary Association, has made arrangements for the fol lowing course of lectures this winter: "Phoebe Couzins, "Woman before the Law." Hon. J. H. Warwick, "New Nation." Col. J. P. Sanford, (three lectures) first subject, "Paris during the war," "Fat Contributcr," 'Injun Meal.' B. F. Itavlor, 'Thought and its Chariots.'

The defeat of the French at Orleans has created great alarm at Tours and a number of citizens and several newspapers have left the city. The telegraph lines have been cut by the Prussians, and communication is now maintained partly by couriea.

IVILLIE AND THE APPLE. Llttlo Willie btood under an apple tree old The fruit was all shining with crimson and Hanging temptingly low; how he longed for a bite! Though he knew if ho took one it wouldn't he right. Said he, "I don't see why my father should say. 'Don't touch the old apple tree, Willie, to day," I shouldn't have thought, now there hanging so low. When I asked for juat one ho would answer mo "Jfo." "He would never And out if I took but Just one. And they look so good, shining out in the bun; There are hundreds and hundreds, and he wouldn't miss So paltry a little red apple as this." He stretched forth his hand, but a low mournlug strain Came wamlerfiig dreamily over his brain ; In his bosom a beautiful harp had long laid, That the angel of conscience had quite fre quently played : And he sang, "Little Willie, beware, O be ware ! Your father is gone, but your Maker is there; How sad you woul feel if you heard the Lord say, 'This dear llttlo boy stole an applo to-day I" Then Willie turned around, and as still as a mouse Crept blowly and carefully luto the house ; In hib own little chamber he knelt down to pray That the Lord would forgivo him, and please not to say, "Little Willie almobt stole an apple to-day." Double Meanings. The English language is peculiarly abundant in words and phrases which are capable of two meanings, and which thus give rise to an endless number of mistakes, catches and puz zles, which afford a gre.:t deal Of amusements of every day life. A fa miliar example is the word got, which may mean either was or procured. Thus one boy says to another with a grave face, "Fred got shot to-day." "Where?" asks the other, in alarm. "He got shot in a hardware store," is the answer, meaning, of course, that he bought it. A man assured a storekeeper, who hesitated to trust his companion for a purchase, "If -he refused to pay for it, I will." His companion refused to pay for it, and so did the speaker, as iu one sense he had said he would. It it thus very easy, by using uncer tain language, to convey a false im pression. A sheriff asked the wife of a Qua ker, against whom he had a writ, if her husband was at home. She re plied, "Yes, he will see thee in a mo ment." The Sheriff waited, but the Quaker did not appear. He was con tented with seeing tho Sheriff, he did not care that the Sheriff should see him. The position of words in asenteuce, and the use of stops, often entirely alter the meaning. Thus an account of a funeral declares, "The remains were committed to that bourne from which no traveler returns attended by his friend." Ignorant people arc apt to use phra ses with double meauing, without in tending to do so. Among the adver tisements we may sometimes read that a respectable young woman wants washing. The proprietor of a bone mill advertises that parties seuding their own bones to be ground will be attended to with fidelity and dispatch. It was once related in a city paper how, during the celebra tion, a child.was run over, wearing a short-red dress, which never spoke afterward. Many popular puzzles depend upon the ambiguity or double meaning of words and phrases. Thus we are told, there was a man had six chil dren, and had never seen one of them. We are led to suppose that none of the children had ever been beheld by their parent. But the words may mean equally as well that one had been'born while the parent was on a journey, and he had, conse quently, never seen that one. Anoth er puzzle is this: There was a poor blind beggar who had a brother; the brother died, but the man who died had no brother. What relation was the beggar to the man who died ? We are apt to think the beggar was a man, but when we think that the beggar might be a girl, the answer becomes quite plain. We are told of two men who met each other at an inn, and greeted each other affectionately. The hotel keeper inquired of one how he was related to the o'ther, who replied : "Brothers and sMer have I nonp. Yet tliis man's father was my father's son." This is a perfectly plain statement, aud 3'et there are Vew whose minds are clear enough to see at once that this jingle of words is only a round about way of saying that this man was the speaker's son. ms m The Supposed "Wealth of Napoleon III. The Independancc Beige, Oct. 2S, contains a letter from M. Thelin, the private treasurer of Napoleon III., dated fiom Wilhelmshohe, Oct. 25. He whites: "In the Indcpendance of the 10th inst., M. Max Pol, whom I have not the honor to know, calls on me to prove that the Emperor, dur ing his reign of eighteen years, in vested considerable sums abroad. M. Max Pol is wrong. It was not abroad, but at home that the Emper or made numerous new investments, of which I will give you a statement as exact as possible. His civil list was $5,000,000, which, with $400,000 derived from the Crown forests, made a total of $5,400,000. Of this sum the ordinary' expenses inscribed on the budget of the civil list absorbed $5, 000,000." M. Thelin proceeds to de tail what these expenses were, nam ing, among other items, the repar and general maintenance of the im perial palaces, the establishments of the Empress and Prince Imperial, and the expenses of the Sevres and Gobelin imperial manufactures. The Emperor, M. Thelin continued, had remaining an annual sum of $1,000, 000, which he could spend as he pleased. Of the $1,000,000 per annum for IS vears, the sum of $14 835,000 in all is accounted for in various ways. There were a large number of sub snrintions for works of public utility. the reclamation and cultivation lands, pensions, presents, and chari table donations, including $1,SOO,000 to the Empress for charitable purpo ses, and $720,000 for presents to diplo matists and players. The Indcpendance regards the let ter as in no way refuting the current statements respecting the wealth of Napoleon, since it does not account for the disposal of the funds of the War Department, which was ciiargea during the 13 years with $1,4000,000 000, and its treasury was nearly emp ty when the war began. . mm 9 mTm ' " Susan B.

A Skillful Theft Cunningly Detected. A man a.t Constantinople, having left in charge of a friend of his,. a purse withoutseani or joint,. Ju which he had placed a considerable number of diamonds, complaining on his re turn from a distant land that his num ber of diamonds was not correct. The friend sustainad the integrity ot his trust, and adduced as proof the entire woof of the purse, in which neither seam nor joint appeared, and the seal of the owner still remained untouch ed at the mouth of the purse. The owner of the jewels was forced 4o ad mit both facts, but still persisted that the amount of diamonds was no Ion-' ger what he left. The case was brought before more than one Magis trate, but nothing could be elicited upon the subject, and the unaltered condition of the- purse, which the owner could not deny, was consider ed conclusive evidence, againyfc his claim. In despair he applied; to the Sultan himself, and the strange per-' sistency of his demand impressed the latter so .much tht, though compell ed, upon the face of the "facta, tq dis miss his claim, as unteauble, the sub ject remained impressed singularly on his mind and induced him to try the following experiment: At morn ing prayer the next day, when the slave who ustlrtlly brought the carpet, updn which heknelthad withdrawn, he made a long slit iir it, and Jeft it to be again withdrawn by the slave. When the latter came to fulfill his duty of rolling up and removing the precious carpet, he remained aghast at the injury it had received, and im mediately apprehending the dreadful eflects of the bultau's displeasure,, hastenod with the rug to the quarter of the city where tlie Jews resided, and seeking out one peculiarly re nowned for his skill, committed it -to his best exercise of it, aud carried.it back o restored that the next morn ing it laid spread for the Sultan's use, without the trace of oithcr damage or reparation. The Sultan no sooner perceivedlwhat had been done than he called the slave, who tremblingly confessed what he had done. lie was immediately dispatched in search of the pre-eminent cobbler, and when the Jew appeared, before the Sultan, the latter, sending for the sealed purse about which the controversy had been held, chargee him with having in like manner .repaired a silt in the woof of the apparently uninjured bag. The Jew instantly admitted the fact, and thus the story of the poor defrauded friend and diamond owner was substantiated. Australian Gold Mines. A de posit of gold and quartz recently sup posed to have been discovered in Vic toria, Australia, created much excite ment. A company was formed, and the shares were rapidly taken and paid for. Further investigations, however, showed that the mine had been veneered with gold leaf, laid ou with size or varnish. The projectors of the company "have been arrested. It is considered extraordinary that the delusion could have lasted so long, as five minutes' examination of tlie spot by 'any person in the slightest degree skilled in mining, would have caused the detection of the swindle. The shares, however, were probably subscribed for by persous living far away from the supposed mine, mid who paid out their money without even looking at the specimens.

Gathered under the quiet roof, elders and children lie alike at rest In the midst of a great peace and calm, the stars look on from the heavens. The scene is people with the past: sorrow ful remorses for sins and shortcom ings, memories of passionate joys and griefs raise out of their graves, but not alike and calm. Eyes, as I shut mine, look at me that tiave long ceas ed to shine. The town and fair land scape sleep under the starlight wreath ed in the autumn mists. Twinkling among the house a light keeps watch, here and there, in what may be a sick chamber or two. The clock tolls sweetly in tho silent air Hero is night and rest.
