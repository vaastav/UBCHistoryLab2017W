I'd rather nieet you here than in the Hon house." .v "Ha, ha," said the Wood Duck, "quack, quack, you're a funny fellow." The Mandarin Duck looked much pleased to be called a funny little fel low. He was making every effort to be thought so, even If he were not as funny as he might be "I must tell you something quite in teresting," said the Wood Duck. "Do," said the Mandarin Duck, "I'd like to hear what you have to say." "Not long ago," said the Wood Duck, "there was a paper which published many pictures of interesting animals from the zoo. "Yes," he continued, "and there was a picture of our pond with many of us swimming about." "What a great honor," said the Man darin Duck. "Yes, wasn't it?", said the Wood Duck. "I do hope," he added after a few moments, "that you will not think I am conceited when I say that I heard that below the picture was written these words—or words something like these." "Try to get the right words," said the Mandarin Duck "Ah yes, I'll get 'the right ones. I may not get them in quite their right order. But I will certainly give them to you so you can understand them, and I will not give any wrong meaning to them. It "was'a'great'compliment paid me and I do not need to make it up! It was there, right in the paper." "Do„ tell it to me, I am getting wry much excited," said the Mandarin Duck.

PresidentSends 1 stow vt before-the duced THURSDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1919. Washington, Dec. 2.—President Wilson today sent congress his message urging an extensive program of leg islation. The communication was devoted entirely to the V* 1 great problems confronting the nation. Legislation was recommended to-curb Bolshevism in, America, reduce high living cost, remove the grievences of labor which are the causes of industrial trouble. Aid farmers to produce bigger crops. Simplify the taxation 'i built up during the war for controlling government expen-'. ditures by a budget system and taring for the nation's soldiers and sailors who have left the service. Though the president several times referred to the1 peace treaty and the league of nations, he did not discuss. the treaty situation. He will do so in a later message, ac cording to reliable information today. He also will deal later with the railroad question, he informed legislators. Much of the message was devoted to the discussion of the labor problem. To solve it the presi dent said, congress "Must help in the difficult task of finding a method that will bring about genuine democrati zation of industry, based upon the full recognition of the right of those who work in what ever ranks, to participate in some organic way in every decision which directly ef fects their welfare.", No better means of doing this can be found, the pres ident declared then applying in legislation the business set up in the labor section of the league of nations covenant. The president suggested establishment of a tribunal before which disputes between labor and capital can be taken for settlement. To go b^ck to the old standards'of: labor and wages is impossible, he said. Age long antagon ism between capital and labor must be ended he declared, before real work stability can be accomplished. In this, the United States, he said, is bid by the world unrest "to put our house in order," and be the fifst to lay the founda tion stones of industrial peace.. He warned against anti-strike legislation. "The right of the individual to strike is inviolate," he declared, "and ought not be interfered with by any process of gov rnment." He added that the government has the predom inate right to protect all the people against aggression by any single class. A summary of the subjects covered in his message follows: Unrest-r-Blame for the unrest in the country was placed upon the senate for its failure to ratify the peace treaty. Another cause of the unrest, thie president, asserted is "the failure on the part of the government to arrive speedily at a just and permanent peace, permitting return to normal conditions While congress should deal with the activities of "Reds" and agitators, the president advised against action either "impatient or drastic." He urged that the causes of unrest be sought and removed and outlined them thus: The causfe of unrest while various and complicated, and superficial, rather than deceited, broadly they arise from or are connected with the failure on the part of our government to arrive speedily at a just and permanent peace—from the transfusion of rabid theories from Euro pean centers—from the heartless profiteering. Stronger laws againstanarchism should be enacted at once, he urged. The high cost of living. The president urged en actment of the comprehensive program, he proposed at the special session to lower living costs and only one mea sure of each became a law. This program includes. Extension of the Levdr control act. (Closer regulation of food distribution "and cold storage. Licensing of all cor •porations dealing in interstate commerce. Budget sys tem—President wilson opened his recommendations with the hope that a budget* system will be established which, will put the percentage of appropriation estimates uifer^-^ the direction of the president. Also providing an audit system to determine whether the money has been econo mically spent. Taxes and tariffs—Immediate necessity, dictates simplification of the income and profits taxes, the president said, fie warned that if income and profits tax rates were, left toothigh they might prove destructive to business and production of revenues. He also warned against building a high tariff wall too high for European, manufacturers. Unless Europe can sell goods, it can not pay its bills to the business men Of the United States, he declared.
