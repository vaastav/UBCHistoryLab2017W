President Wilson has again appear 1 before the nation's lawmakers and personally delivered his message in fcreordance with the rekuirements of the office that he shall inform congress of the state of the Union." He Jwells not a little upon the fact that the country is "at peace Vith all. the world," but in urg jig the ratification of several treaties f arbitration awaiting: renewal, atten tion Is called to a matter of much im portance particularly in view of our Volley of peace and the firm belief Which is manifested in the restoration ft constitutional order in Mexico as he- result of the attitude of this gov UTiment. When the president calls attention te the urgency of reform in the bank ing and currency system and hopes Tor its early accomplishment he must recognize the careful attention and ac tion which such an important change should receive. It is something which ought never to be rushed through congress without proper knowledge of what is trying to be accomplished and whether the proposed changes will ac complish It. Much time was given to the question of farm credits and the need of a proper handling of that im portant matter. On the question of trusts he favors Jetting the Sherman anti-trust law remain, but working to decrease the debatable ground about it. Thus he would perfect an im portant law instead of destroying it. Attention is called to the importance of the necessary legislation for the national primary and he reiterates his position upon the Philippines and the Alaskan question and advocates mak ing the bureau of mines broader and more powerful and the enactment of a railway employes' liability law, and lays particular stress upon the latter when he declares that "social justice comes first." The message is one which follows the recommendations of the demo cratic platform touching upon the mat ters In a general way without offering farts or arguments, those being left fer oongress to gain from the depart ment reports. It is a noticeable fact that the president considers it unnec essary to refer to needed legislation upon the high cost of living. RED 

CROSS SEALS. There is no more worthy undertak ing than the anti-tuberculosis move ment which gathers speed at this sea son of the year through the sale of the Red Cross seals. It is a matter in which everyone should be interested whatever their means and through the method adopted the opportunity' is provided for general participation. Recognition of the excellence of the cause is to be found in the increased receipts from stamp sales since they were first issued in 190S. In the past five years nearly a million and a half has been raised in a national cam paign for the fight against the pro gress of tuberculosis in the different states. The Red Cross stamps and the pur pose for which they are offered cannot help but Inspire everyone who is in terested in philanthropic work, and surely such should be the desire of each and every person however much they may be limited in their expenses. The seals are designed to overcome whatever burdensome feature might be connected with such work and when It Is realized that five seals to each person would more than dispose of the local allotment, the important part which all can play is Indicated. The value of the efforts of states and f sanitations in fighting the white plague la well Vnwn, To assist in each work should be considered not only a privilege but a duty and it should be ta ths credit of Norwich at the cloee f the campaign and the hol iday thai U iaa eoiiideKfed it wist to invent in lti&.MQ of mjorv of the saks which are handy, Rot tut postage, but tor decoration, ' The faeently eWetwd gwepn&F of Maseaettfiaettjj Iiasra't taken oftiee yet, 1ut there are already four candidates for the republican nomination for gov ernor a year hervee.

WILL IT SUCCEED OR PERISHf In accordance with its continuance from the extra session, the Hetch Hetchy bill is now before congress to succeed or perish; Early considera tion of it should mean early action in whatever direction may be decided upon, but it is a measure which should not be disposed gf without first learn ing the facts and conditions The op position to the proposal for which San Francisco seeks the sanction of the government, conies from the fact that the destruction of a national park is Bought that that city may obtain wa ter and power privileges at less ex pense than in some other direction It means the disregard ing of the na tional feature to serve the purpose of one small section of the country. Immediately the bill passes it means the end of that western beauty ground but the defeat of the bill simply meana that San Francisco must seek to sat isfy its demand for public and pri vate water rights in another direc tion. The passage of "the bill will mean a precedent which can be expected to be broug-ht into frequent use. It is therefore an action which is going to have a widespread instead of a local effect. With the advocates and the opposition assembled' in the national capital it is proper that the matter should be threshed out upon its mer its and once and for all end the inclin ation to break up national parks. OUR 

SAILORS ABROAD. From all directions the reports in dicate that the sending of the fleet of warships to Mediterranean ports has been of much benefit. It was intended as an educational trip for the sailors on the several battleships and there is ample reason for believing that it was successful. Such is not only the declaration of the men themselves, but their actions indicate that full advan tage has been taken of their oppor tunities. They have put in their time to the best advantage and at the same time dispelled any unfavorable impres sions which had been gained through the action of a few at other times. Jack ashore has been generally con sidered a troublesome fellow. How well those in the fleet overcame that idea is evidenced by the reports from every point they touched praising their behavior. There is no reason why this should not be so. It is because it has not always been the rule that it calls for attention now. Relaxation from the discipline on ship- has often led the bluejacket into various forms of mis chief but the example which has been given in the recent test not only in dicates the worth of such foreign cruises but it makes certain that such behavior is the kind which, will give greater encouragement to them. It shows that our sailors are getting a benefit from their training and making good use of it as they should do. It is such compliments as they, have re ceived which gives them greater pride In being American sailors. STATERELIGION IN CHINA. It "Is an important question which the president of the new republic of China has before him in the matter of adopting a state religion for that coun try. There are many others of a po litical nature which need adjustment but in no instance is the future of China more involved than in this pro posal. Such a move as is now being made in behalf of Oonfusianism is agaln.st the best interests of China and it is meeting with the same opposi tion that was given to the movement two years ago to have Christianity made the state religion. This opposi tion -comes -from all the representatives of other religions upon the ground that the state and religion should be sep arate in order not to hamper business and government. That Yuan Shi Kai, the new presi dent of the republic, is a Confucian- ist has given strength to' the belief that he would listen to the urging of its adoption as the state religion, but that he realizes that China is in need of Christian ethics if the republic is to progress .and profit in- its endeavor to rise from the conditions of the past, is indicated by his personal statement. President Yuan holds a most influen tial position in the new republic. It is much the same as under the old empire and the solution of the matter lies in the ability to persuade him that the action which Is being sought is against the best interests of China. It would .mean not only a hindrance to business and politics, but it would hamper missionary effort to which China owes a great deal. 6 

EDITORIAL NOTES. The man on the corner says: There are times when it pays to be a city father. Now that the football season is over the popular colors among the players are black and blue. It must have pleased Congressman Donovan that the nw session of con gress could start off with a quorum. Inasmuch as eighty per cent, of the Mexican people can neither read nor write gossip must have an enormous circulation. No one is going to show a greater appreciation of the value and conve nience of the parcel post this year than Santa Claus. We can enthuse over that "on to Mexico" cry more now that it is raised by Carranza and Villa than we could if it concerned our army. When Boston gets Its school teach ers unionized those pupils who do not happen to come from a union home will probably be boycotted. Chihuahua has fallen. The ease with which it was accomplished might in dicate that the federals relied upon the name as the sole defense. The only thing for Turkey to do was to apologize to Russia. There would be no chance to regain any lost territory once they became involved In combat. When It comes to another cup of cof fee, Maypr Dunn of Willimantic seems to know how to get it, while Mayor Maedonald of Putnam received his on a silver platter. The man who is living on nine cents a day is tf course a frugal citiaen but he is making a great waste of his resource i comparison with the ma Who Jives in his friends. With a ttal of 135 deaths among deer hunters in 21 states and as many more 6hot or injured this fall, sports manship is upheld at no small risk in these" days of careless shooting. The praise accorded the men on our warshiiw for conduct while on shore leave in France is only wtuU it should be. They conducted themselves in :i manner whirta was not oJy a credit to themselves but to their eo-umry. THE TRIALS It began so gradually that Brixbill did not notice it at first. One by one the. parlor rugs disappeared and there came a day when there were no por tieres. He was suspicious the evening his wife tried to hinder him from en tering the parlor bv the suggestion that it would be so much cozier in the upstairs sitting room. Peering in, Brixbill saw that the lace curtains were gone. "Serena Brixbill," he broke out ac cusingly, "you are I believe you are cleaning house!" "Ves, I am!" Mrs. Brixbill answered, in the defiant tones of the cornered housewife. "There's no sense in your raising such a row over housecleanlng that I'm driven to doing it in an un derhand way. If there ever was a finicky man, it's you, John Brixbill. I wish you'd tell me how I'm to1 have a spick and span house if I don't house clean! Answer me that!" "I won't!" declared he husband. "Only you ought to! It's all wrong making a tired man uncomfortable twice a year this way, when, if you women would bend your minds upon it, you could devise some way of housecleaning while we men were away or asleep. I want comfort in my home. "I'm sorry the loss of the parlor curtains is causing you such acute agony," declared Mrs. Brixbill. "And I didn't dream that you were so at tached to the back library portieres! But if you've begun to suffer you might as well have something to suf fer about, and I shall throw all pre tense aside and begin to housecUean in earnest! This place needs renovating from top to bottom!" "I shall advertise for a cave to morrow!" shouted Brixbill. "A nice, dry cave, with dust six inches thick all over it, and a chopping block for any woman who tries to dust it up with a duster! This is horrible!" "I wish you would!" declared his wife, unfeelingly." "Then you'd ap preciate your own home when you got back to it!" Brixbill's expression of acute, suffer ing began to come into his face five blocks from home the next night. When he reluctantly opened the front door his worst fears were confirmed. T:here were bare floors, bare walls, stepladders, empty rooms or shrouded furniture, where furniture remained, and buckets and messy wet brushes lying around and floor cloths speckled with paint and calcimine. Mrs. Brixbill met him with stern eyes. "It will be lots worse." she promised, "when they begin scraping and revarnishing the floors. You will OTHER VIEW POINTS They killed about 5,000 deer in New England this fall and the sport cost the lives of thirteen persons, while seventy-two others were injured. If you stop to figure that up it is worse than automobiling or aeroplanlng. Meriden Journal. That pencils promiscuously used are disease carriers Is the discovery of the health officer of Suffolk, Conn. Now if that official can find the same thing true of the spellin' and 'rithmetic books he will be the unanimous choice of the Juvenile populace for re-election for life. Bridgeport Standard. Mr. Richter believes that Connect icut people should own and operate Connecticut public utilities and develop them. They are certainly domestic in stitutions which need to be operated for the convenience of their patrons. If they become paying utilities so much will be gained for the inhabitants o"T the state. Middletown Sun. The democratic caucus on the cur rency bill refused to adopt a resolu tion" obligating senators to support the measure as a matter of party loyalty. This is a great .concession, considering the dictatorial 'attitude of the administration on currency re form. But at the present time it ia mighty good politics. Waterbury American. Farmers and all others, even house holds that ' employ one domestic, are keenly interested in the working out of the employers' liability act. It was supposed at the time of the passage of the law that those employing five or less persons were exempt. There was the biggest kind of a joker in the act. however, and there are no exemp tions in the. law itself. Bristol Press. It is of course impossible to say what action will be taken by the court on the arguments of Becker's counsel, but there is a general belief that the In terests of Justice will b eproperly cared for by the court and that the case will be decided on broader grounds than mere technical defects in procedure that have before now given respite to men like the accused gunman. An sonia Sentinel. Announcement that the president ate a Kentucky turkey at Thanksgiv ing is another evidence that there has been a change in the government. The Rhode Island bird was considered the proper kind by republican executives, but things are different now. One thing is sur and that is that there are no better turkeys in the country than those raised in Rhode Island. New London Day. Meanwhile, one great and needed lesson has been taught to the mem bers of congress, namely, that they are expected to stay on the Job and do the work which the people sent them to Washington to do and for which they are liberally paid. It is a long time since they had sUch a thorough realization as now that they are public servants, not the masters of the people. New London Tele graph. Eventually the cold storage problem is pretty sure to be frozen down for keeps. ' Besides the Sherman act which is supposed to deal with egg com bines as well as others, there are at least three bills before congress fram ed for the express purpose of regu lating the cold storage business. Ap parently the framers of these new measures are not content to let the Sherman law "do its worst." Hart ford Times. ' After everything is sand and done, Frank Brandegee, measured by repub lican standards, has acquitted himself well in the senate. Just as Mr, Hill did in the lower house. The obvious thing suggested by this fact is the renom ination of Mr. Brandegee for the sen ate and of Mr. Hill for the house, and we are at a loss to understand upon what other theory of promoting republican party interests uny differ ent, course will be taken, New Ha ven ITnitfii, ' Didn't Know Carnegie. During a wiater visit to Florida, Andrew Carnegie attended a service in a little Negro church. When the contribution p;ate came around, Mr. Carnegie dropped a fifte-dollar bill upen it.

BRIXBILL then .have to skip lightly from crag to crag! Dinner is served, darling in the kitchen!" "Gosh!" moaned Brixbill, miserably. "And you call this home!" The men doing the walls quit when they were half done, because of an order from some mysterious person somewhere and the men doing the floors half did them and then dropped from sight. The stepladders and buckets remained. Brixbill was at home when the portieres were re turned from the cleaners, and hope sprang up, but his wife promptly quenched it. 1 "Tbey can't go up." she said, "till the floors are done. And everything else is done. f And until the rugs are here. They're being cleaned. And af ter they finish the ceilings! Haven't you any sense at all?" "No," said Brixbill, "I'm clean crazy. I've lived so long in this disheveled barn that I don't care what happens next! Serve breakfast on top of the furnace in the basement if you want to I won't say a word." "It won't take a minute to settle this house when I once get hold of those workmen!" declared Mrs. Brixbill. somewhat worn and wild looking. "Everything's clean, ready to put up and down'-" "Oh, piffle!" scoffed- the pessimistic Brixbill. "It will take ten years and six months to dig out of this mess!" He calme home late that night, and stepping into the hall of his home, said "Ugh!" as though he had been hit hard. Then he stood blinking. Soft shaded electric lamps threw their glow on richly colored rugs and hangings in their proper places. The floors posi tively glistened. Every inch of ma hogany shone. Flowers and ferns drooped above Jardinieres. Brixbill crept upstairs dazedly. "I beg your pardon!" he ejaculated when he set foot in his bedroom. He was used to a blue room and this was a pink room pink from the cretonne hangings to the rosebud paper, and the last ribbon now on the dresser fixings. The woman in pink negligee and pink decked boudoir cap who reclined on the couch languidly reading a mag azine as if there was nothing else on earth for her to do gazed up at him scornfully. "You said," she remarked in cold tones, "that I couldn't do it!" "Yes, it's your voice," said Brixbill relievedly. "That's not changed! Yes and I'll bet you could have done it long ago, only you wanted to torment me! Say! It seems good to have a home again!' Chicago News. EVERY DAY REFLECTIONS Big Cities For Privacy. One reason why people flock to ci ties is that they may be able to mind their own business. Political economists seek complex and devious reasons for the tremend ous rapidity of city growth and for the desertion of the country and of the country town. The cause, how ever, is quite simple, as simple as human nature. The people go to cities because they "want to." That's all. Take the village of Podunk. In the first place, you would not be allowed to go there to live without explaining why you came, where you came from and what your business is. If you do business in Podunk and usually get down to the store at 9 and some morning you do not appear until 10. the town will not rest until it knows why. Your neighbors know all about you and your wife, your sons and your daughters. The bank cashier knows the size of your pile, the grocer and butcher know what you eat, the dry goods merchant knows what sort of underclothes you wear and how much your women folks spend on corsets, and they all meet and check up. It Is all a very cozy family ar rangement. You live in the constant glare of the limelight. Some people like it, and feel lost and lonesome in the city. But more and more that class is growing to whom this perpetual invasion of privacy is disagreeable. LETTERS TO THE EDITOR Two More Centenarians.
