No one in Richmond will deny that the Virginia Railway anil Power Company should be permitted to charge a straight G-cent faie if it can prove that it deserves it. But tha proof should be forthcoming. it is loo big a question to be decided until after the com pany has laid its books wide open before its patrons, and the latter are convinced that its revenues are not adequate to maintain ef ficient service and Rive a fair return on its ^ invested capital. Put an expert accountant ; on the books and wait bis report. That is the wisest co.ursc. With Garfield fighting for coal and lloover I for food, with the War and Navy Departments I demanding thai their supplies be given | priority, and the Shipping LJoard equally in sistent that its requirements be met tirst, railroad traf.U' is in a seemingly inextricable jam. aud the country's affairs grow more and more tangled. Need of one big boss to take over the job daily becomes more acute. While j the varied interests pull and haul in different directions, the people are suftering lor food and warmth. The present system is a dismal failure, and a new one must be found. Of the 100 counties in Virginia, eighty-six are paupers, that is, they receive more money from the State treasury than they pay in. Tbev may be considered ,ln the light of poor relations of Richliiotul. which last year paid to the State $900,000 more than it received in return. Richmond is glad to aid these needy members of the Commonwealth's big family, but as is too often the case where benefactions are freely bestowed, we doubt if they are received with grateful recognition of their source. Apparently Virginia is ripe for the introduction of a modern system whereby each county can be made self busiuiuihg and lift itself out of the pauper class. Charity too long sustained is likely to become irksome. Congress is holding up its hands ami gasp ing in utter surprise at the country's unpre pared ness for war. and is instituting investi gations, here, there and everywhere, no mat ter what joy the results may bring to the heart of the Kaiser. Had Congress stuck less closely around the pork barrel during the past quarter of a century anil devoted more of its efforts to putting the country in a state of preparation, present conditions would have been impossible. Congress can not plead ignorance, nor can it shift the bur den of its own responsibility to other shoulders, for our military shortcomings have been dinned tinto its ears for many years. Nothing has happened except what was ex pected to happen, and whal every one except Congress knew must happen. Nothing now remains but to make the best, of it. Won derful things have been achieved already, considering that we started almost from zero. Secretary of War Maker's stand against universal military training as a permanent policy for the Cuitr-d State* i: a sad blow to the hopes of thoM- tens of thousands of loyal citizens who believe that only by the adop tion of this system can this country main tain I tec! f in a state of preparedness for what ever untoward eventualities the future years may bring. They have given of their time and their money to secure the necessary con gressional action whereby we might be ren dered safe for all time from foes without our borders. The proposed system does not go beyond bringing about a state of pre paredness. Militarism is not its object. r. Jtather. it offers as a permanen policy the thorough disciplining of the nation's youth for the arts of peace as well as \<ar, should the latter again be forced upon them. It is too? much to hope in the present stage of human development that, this will be the last ? great war We knofr that it is not. America's leaders belfieved this Huropcuu struggle would not penetrate our isolation, but it did, and it lotifid us as a military fac ? lor almost as helpless au China. Wo aro paying for our past blunders of unprcparcd ness, as it takes no more than the dally dis closures in Congress to demonstrate. With the continuance of our liaud-lo-nioulh mili tary policy, the next war, "when it comes, will find us in a similar condition. The sccrc tarv s optimism is superb, but the American people will gravely doubt his wisdom, for how can we expect to make the world safe for democracy when we refuse even to make democracy safe for ourselves? It never will be safe so long as we blink the future and fail to adopt a military system which shall be permanent and universal. I Brotherhoods Against It |1 Is not surprising that the railroad brother hoods are opposed to government owner ship of railroads, government operation of railroads or even government control of rail roads. It was to be expected that these or ganizations would fight any move which tho government might make in the direction of Federal supervision of the interior trans portation business. In the first place, the government i-s an employer has never tolerated a striker, Meu who sell their servicos to Uncle Slui have the right to petition him for the redress of wrongs, but not the right to paralvze the government's activities by walking out in a jiody. They may ask for more money and they ma> get it, but they are never per mitted to subject the government to a hold-up, forcing it to "come across" at the point of a pistol. In the next place, any government which is at war and decides that a certain industry is vital to its life has tho privilege of draft ing its citizens in such numbers as may bo necessary to keep that industry operating to full capacity. The mere fact that the United States government should undertake the con trol or operation of the railway system of the country means that the government re gards the service of the railroads as vital, and if it is vital, railroad emplovees might properly bo drafted. Theso are the general considerations which might be expected to array tho brotherhoods against any plan of Federal control of the railroads. The men represented in these brotherhoods cannot regard with favor any condition which bars them against either strikes or threatened strikes. The exercise of this privilege has worked so advantageous ly for them in the past that they naturally cherish it as an inalienablo right. The chances are that President Wilson will re mind the brotherhood heads that this govern ment will exact as much from them as it will exact from the owners of the railroads. If tho government must draft tho properties of railroad owucrs in order to win the war, it may properly draft the men who make tho wheels go round. If the railroad presidents and railroad managers are legislated into the service of their country for the period of the war, the railroad operatives may expect to be legislated into it as well. No action along this line will cost any rail road employee who does his dutv Ms job Nor will it cost him a dollar in pay. The men on tho trains and in the yards will be called upon to perform their work for tiie government in cxaetly the name manner in which they perform It for the individual rail road companies. Perhaps when all this it made clear to the brotherhoods, these organi zations will patriotically withdraw their ob jection to any measure which the President may regard as ..ecessary to the country's -ar efliciency. Will Kus.sin Disintegrate? A ' ' E.Mj made by the de facto government ot Finland for American recognition seems to foreshadow the breaking up of the old Russian empire, if there is any power in that country which can hold it together, that power has not asserted itself. Already the nation is in a state of chaos. Germany flatly announces that it will not give up a fool of ground which its troops now occupy, and does noL even guarantee autonomy for Poland. I his is not all. Siberia is refusing to deal with the regime set up by the Bolsheviki in etrograd and Moscow. Vladivostok is iu the hands of Japanese forces, and lower Alan una has been invaded by Chinese troops ostensibly to protect Chinese interests there. The Cossacks are holding the southeastern provinces of Russia, and the Russian Po'es aro clamoring for ar. opportunity to set up a new government in Warsaw. I here is no cohesion anywhere in the broad land. Certain cowardly elenieuts of the army still support the futile Trotzky group of leaders, but the great body or the peasantry has repudiated the radical Social ists. Kcrensky is still at large, and still labors in an effort to restore the old revolu tionary government. Koruiloff. nominally a prisoner lor a time, has been sot free, and is urging his countrymen to rally to his support Ka cdines, the leader of the Cossacks, is pulling m another direction, threatening J etrograd with famine if the Socialists do not yield to his demands. faken all in all, it seems to the outside world to be impossible for Russia again to logain its place among nations, it seems to he on the point of utter disintegration and about to become the prey first of the enemies troin within, then the prey of enemies from without. With a separate state in Finland a separate state in Siberia and a separate state In Poland, not much will be left for . he rotzkys and the Lciiincs to trifle with. ,u"\ ,r t"l a ETP of sma!l principalities ! ?? ,?n C ruins of lhc old empire, | there will |)C no single unit left with re I sources enough to resist the invader. Cer t many and Austria may stop in and take wh, i 1 tliey please. No doubt the Hun is boasting about tho changed military situation in the west but his boasts seem to have had at least a basis of fact in front of Carubrai. j A half-million-dollar fire, started by an i incendiary 011 Norfolk's water front, indicates I that all alien enemies have not been caught ; in the net set for them. j Persons accustomed these days to scoi?? their own money fly have great hopes of those floe? ,000 tU 1,0 Upprol,rIatod for an air Tho thirteen negroes who wore hanged at ?San Antonio died firm boliovers that their number was unlucky.

No book that I have read so helps one to insight into the deeper forces that have produced this great war; and none so illumines the way along which each one must tind personal triumph of spirit, and the. way i.n which wo must look for any condi tion that will produce an enduring peace." The subtitle of Professor Dresser's book is "Moral Ideals in Wartime."

(Charles Scrlbner's Sons), j discusses the problem of tho*c children who are . really abnormal. The purpose of the book It* I to give a perspective of the entire situation, and j to suggest ways and means of coping with the | problem in its various aspects. It is plain that j the problem is one which presents more than one feature. It is concerned with educational 1 procedure, indeed. Hut the character of the | human material which Is to be educated plays ; a fundamental part. Thus questions of heredity and family history; of environment and social- , economic conditions: of child hygiene and public ! sanitation; of medical inspection and clinical j work; of psychologic and psychopathic Investl-I Ration, and other elements loo numerous to ! state, enter Into the discussion. The investiga tions take the reader into juvenile courts and , Into the hovels of crime and prostitution: into the almshouses and charity bureaus, and \vl\pr- j ever humanity's woes and shortcomings are studied and methods of relief are considered. Margaret Wvcherly, charming actress, now starring in "The Thirteenth Chair." has found soir.e interesting food for thought In Certrude ; Atherton's new book, "The Divine Present" ; iStokesl. Mrs. Atherton has discussed freely ; the problems of women, the work they ought to be doing in the war. and the much-mooted \ questions of love, marriage and children, and , "a career versus the home." "I r.gree with Mrs. j Atherton." says Miss Wycherly, "tint it is a , good tliir.g for women after the lirsl flush of 1 their emoiional life is over, to work. I don't j think it hurts a young child In the least to be. put in the handr. of e::pcrt strangers. The early j needs of a child are almost entirely physical.

She. may seem cruelly neg lectful of her children in their infancy, but she will know belter how to look after them when they begin to flower Into real human beings." Which, on the whole, accords with Mr. Ather ton's view of the situation. Current Editorial Comment Colonel Housb bringa back ! Briusjs pood news. Much relating to his , ll?elf mission must naturally be kept ' .. f?>r the President's ear. Hut the j Oooil Ac\VS account of it which he is willing! to cive to the public is unusually ; explicit. Perhaps the most interesting statement j he mal.es is that the representatives in the i allied eonferencc were "absolutely unanimous on every plan." Germany has so often protlted by j divided counsels among them that this una- | nimity is the best assurance that eould be given of their ability to win the war. That the Presi- ; dent will decide upon our continuous participa tion in the supreme war council, which is in- j tended lo unify military policy, inay be taken for granted; any other course would impair the ! great influence we have already gained as well as make our participation in the conflict less j effective. The closest kind of naval co-operation : has been determined upon already, and this is i equally needed in land operations. It is inter- j csting to note that Colonel House does not agree > with those who think that the morale of either' armv or people has been impaired in France or j in ICngland.

"Our country is to-day in sorrow and suspense over the fact that we urc forced into v:ar with an enemy, power ful. resourceful and desperate," says Governor Stephens. "Our sons, broth* ers and husbands have been called and taken from us. We do not know even where many of tliem are. The govern ment has prior claims upon them, and many have been snatched from us, per haps, never to return again. God only knows the hearts that are saddened and broken throughout our land over this sudden and unexpected realization. We feel, too, it is perhaps tho English fleet which protects us from attack upon our coast cities, and possible deso lation. and our country from invasion by the most ruthless, merciless, heart less and unscrupulous enemy the world has ever had to contend with. With all these terrorizing and disturbing thoughts in my mind, I do not feel ihey are still the greatest menace to our peace, happiness and safety that we arc to-day forced to encounter. "In my honest judgment, the greater menace to our people at this moment is not the devastating war, with its horrible possibilities, but P. is the greed and avarice qf so many of our own people. This greed and avarice is not confined to any one class or section, but the whole business population seems to have caught the infection. "It is America's; greatest curse. It Is.

I note that Mayor Aim.lic Is fearful of a deficit, if the present method of taxa tion is continued. This brings to my mind a way io more than make up the deti'it. It also relieves* property of unjust taxation. The answer Is. mukc the consumer of gas pay to the city the co.st of the 1 gas, which h^ is not doinj; lo-day. The , Cur can uf Municipal Research stated 1 in its report that the ?!as Works show ed a suiplus last year of $110.00". but this surplus would be wiped out by thft loss this year: this means that the coal of pas lias increased l'JSti.000. Since tiiit-- report the superintendent has siak ! ed for an increase of som<- $<7,000 to pay ihf increased com of oil and other I materials not provided for iii previous | appropriations. Wo know that coal I that cost SI. 15 a I the mines early in I the year costs now $2.75 and fixed by i law. Kreight has been advanced 10 ! cents per ton. and will l>e increased in 1 the near future. The price of oil ! has gone up. and is going up. as evidenced by the request for increased appropriation. The general taxpayers arc bearing the burden of this increased cost when ! it should be borne by the gas consum j ers. Th? above does not truly show the 1 cost of gas. as nothing is allowed for , interest on cost of plant, insurance and the taxes lhat a privately owned plant 1 should pay 1 The city authorities in the. past have ! valued the Gas Works at from $3,000,000 to S5.000.000. The city is paying 4 per 1 cent for its money, which means, on the i lowest valuation $1"0.000, none. of ! which via figured in the cost of gas. j The tax on this property would be j $45,000. I I ask in the name of fairness ami | honesty that the general tax be relieved j of tills burden, and that at least the ' cost of gas be borne by the consumers. ! even though the bond Interest on the i valuo of plant and tho loss In taxes bo ' omitted from the co.st of gas. Why should property be taxed to help pay tho gas users' gas bills? M. S13NA. Richmond, Va? December 17, 111?. Sly Prnjrer. ! Great God. I ask thee for no meaner pelf !
