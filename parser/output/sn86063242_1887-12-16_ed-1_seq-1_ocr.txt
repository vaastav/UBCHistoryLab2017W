Slyersvlllc n Prosppntlvu Cnmllriatc for Coiiri oss Tlie pxesenre of Hon D D Sublett of Salyersville Magollin county in our city for a few davs this week naturally sUirted a talk about his candidacy for Congress as the time for sclccthg can didates for that oflicc is approaching In u brief conversation with him we asked hint if he would seek the nomina tion and though we can not recall the exact language we think wecan produce his ideas He said something like this I have no ambition above my party My aspirations are subordinate to the intercut of the Democratic party and if some other Democrat is the choice of the party I am the last to stand in the way What I most desire of all things is the succcrs of the Democratic party at the next election Uirt if the party should tender me the nomination I would not feel at liberty to decline and would leave no stone unturned to achieve suc cess A seat in Congress is nn honor to be coveted and why should not Dave Sub lett modest though ho may he desire to gain this high distinction Thousandtof friends throughout the district have long desired that he should represent them and now they think this an opportune time to press we say press deliberately his claims upon the people and press him into the canvass for tlie nomination We near the people talk the iJcnio erats are not afraid to talk to the Sentinel-Democrat and from expressions we can outline the intentions of Mr Subletts friends Thev claim that a lone experience in business and political life fully qualifies him for this position For years he was a member of the Kentucky Legislature and an oflicer of the House and Senate a number of terms Official life at Wash ington enabled him to become familiar with the working of Congress While in the Kentucky Legislature he was not ed for his energy and efficiency Some siying that he was the best member of the bodv As a parliamentarian he is recognized as among the best As a speaker he can hold his own with nnv man in the district lie is wen iniormeu upon all subjects and especially so upon all matters with which he would have to do in Congress The ins of Legisla tion to him are an open book no man can get away with him He is sharp shrewd wiry untirinjr all push energy and git tin and git Dave Sublett never broke faith with any man his word is as good as his bond and that is undoubted and unques tioned No claim of infallibility is made for him but his faults are as few its any in private or political life He probably knows more people in the district than any man in it He has not a personal enemy Tiie only point that could be used against him is that he resides in the same county that Mr Taullee docs and that some other section of the district is entitled to it Hut locality has noth ing to do with it and no Dcmociat would refuse to vote for the nominee on that ground alone Mr Sublett is not encumbered with any predjudiees and every Democrat in the district could and would cheerfully vote for him He is sound on all ques tions mid is a clean man personally and politically In manner he is pleasant and ullable a more kindlv heart never beat in a human bosom lie is a philan thropist with broad views of life of men and of things a broad man in every sense He is entirely free from the vices great and small which alllict and a fleet many of our public men In short his friends elaim him to be a model man and just the man to repre sent this district in Congress and will insist upon his taking the nomination of the Democratic party and then they will elect him We can say that a long acquaintance with Mr Sublett enables us to testify to his merits as a man and an official and we would feel that victory is assured with him as our nominee Sentinel Democrat Astonishing Succosb It is

roper mid the People llnvc To Sny About It Nkw York December i The Times in its editorial on the Presidents message says Mr Cleveland has done an act of statesmanship in the best sense Kecog niring a great duty he has performed it with courage with firmness and at the right time and he has performed it so that every honest man must see that it is an honest act Judged by any ordina ry standard of political expediency the Presidents act is inexpedient He has forced upon his party an issue as to which the party is divided and so divid ed that unless the minority yield it can defeat the will of the majority He has done this on the eve of a national con test in which a considerable number of men of influence in his party have been urging him to avoid this issue and threatening him and the party with dis aster if he did not avoid it On the oth er hand there is nothing in this issue as thus presented by which Mr Cleveland could hope to draw from the Ivepublican party any votes Nor this alone for if the protectionist faction in the Demo cratic party carry out their own desires ordo what they have continually declared that they would do Mr Cleveland has done the one thing by which he could imperil the prospect of his own renonii nation It places Mr Cleveland far above any of the leaders to whom the Hcpublicau party has of late lent a hear ing and above most of the leaders of his own party The Sun says It is not a commonplace document for it is simple intelligent and loherent and the quality of brevity is chiefly due to the fact that all other top ics of National interest are dismissed in a lump i postponed us inconsequential in the presence of one problem of supreme importune the ii stion of tariff revis ion d eiuif s Unit the theo retical question as otwvn protection ami free trade is irrelevant and yet the most striking and lotvii sting part oi nis messago is devoted prct - iv to that sort of an aigumeut with win ii any free trade representative in Cougars or any free trade protesHor in a college class room or the author of an free trade text Ixiok of political economy would begin an attack upon the theory of protection This we say is the most iiouiuiciacMiooiibiiic message utevi and has never before in a public paper for i u i i Cob taken sides squarely iiiswii tins 11 He has done so now in a manner that leaves room for no misunderstanding It is a bold thing to do and the President deserves credit for the plainness of his speech Nobody can accuse him of hedg ing or haggling or juggling with words So far does he go upon the familiar lines of free trade speeches in ongress or else where that we find him betrayed here and there perhaps unconsciously into an exhibition of slight irritation agaiust American manufacturers as a class al most as if they were conspirators and public enemies The World savs The admirable mes sage of the President has given the Dem ocratic partv what it has long lacked an issue and a leader The issue is tax reform The leader is the President It can hardly be that the President has at this juncture influence enough to secure the union of the Democrats in the House upon a measure ol revenue re duction and tariff reform The Herald savs The message is an able conservative and statesman like document which unlike many other uu ssages will he read by tho people ami discussed bv them We arc glad to sec that he favors free wool which would give greatly increased and perma nent prosperity to our great woolen industry ami enable our manufacturers in other branches at the same time to dispose of large quantities of their pro ducts in wool producing counties to the immediate benefit of workman in almost all branches of American manufacturers The message will not please ex tremists of either side free trailers or protectionists but it will we believe please ami satisfy the people at large and it puts upon both parties in Congress the solemn duty to relieve the country from a most serious danger What tho Iron Mon Think of It BlKMiKfiHAM Ala Dec 7 To say that Clevelands message was a surprise to the iron men of this city would express - II II I I a - there are now in course of erection
