Summnri rd Growth of the nvy Washinoton Dec 4 Tho message of Prcbidont Clovelnncl was shorter than usual for him containing but about 1800 words In brief it was as follows To the Congress of tho United States I The constitutional duty which requires Hbo president from time to time to Rive to tlie congress infqrnintion of the state of tbe Union and recommend to their consid eration such measures as ho shall judge necessary and expedient is fittingly en tered upon by commending to the congress a careful examination of the detailed state ments and well supported recommenda tions contained in the reports of tho hends of departments who nre chiefly charged with the executive work of the govern ment In an eftort to abridge this commu nication as much as is consistent with it purpose I Bhall supplement a brief refer- euce to tho contents of these departmental reports by the hiention of such executive business and incidents as are not embraced therein and by such recommendations as appear to be at this particular time appro priate rorelgn Relations While our foreign relations have not at all times during the pnst year been en tirely free from perplexity no embarrass ing situation remains that will not yield to the spirit of fairness and love of justice which joined with consistentfltiuneas characterize a truly American foreign policy My predecessor having accepted the office of arbitrator of the long standing missions boundary dispute tendered to Uhe president by the Argentine Republic and Brazil it has been my agreeable duty to receive the special envoys commissioned by those stated to lay before me evidence and arguments in behalf of their respective governments The outbreak of domestic hostilities in -the Republic of Brazil found tho United States alert to watch tho interests of our citizens in that country with which we carry on important commerce Several vessels of our new navy are now and for some time have been stationed at Rio de Janeiro Tho struggle being be tween the established government which controls the machinery of administration nnd with which we maintain friendly rela tions and certain officers of the navy em ploying the vessels of their command in an attack upon tne national capital and chief seaport and lacking as it does tho mentsof divided administration I have failed to sec that the iusiugentscaii reason ably claim recognition as belligernnts Tnus far the position of our government has been that of an attentive but impart il observer of the unfortunate conflu t Tho convention between our government and Chili hnv ing for its object the st ttlement nnd adjustment of tho demands of the two countries against each other has been made effective bv the organization of the claims commission provided for Tho two governments failing to agree upon the third member of the commission the good oflius of the piesidint of the Swiss republic w ere invoked as pro uled in the treaty and the selection of the Swiss representative in this countiy to complete the organization was gratifying alike to the United btafcs and Chili The eatiotis question of so called legation asvlumfor offenders

attempt at revolution ami against whom ciimiunl charges vvre pending grow ingoutofafornieiabortivedistui bailee the doctrine of asylum as applied to this case is not sanctioned by the best precedeats nnd when allowed tends to encourage se dition nnd strife Inder no circumstances can tho representatu v - of this government be permitted under the ill defined fiction of extra territoriality to interrupt the ad ministration of criminal justice in the countries to which they are accredited A temperate demund having been made bv tho Chilian government for the correction of this conduct in the instance mentioned the minister was instructed no longer to harbor the offenders The legislation last year known as Tlie Geary Lair quiring the registration of all Chinese la borers entitled to residence in the United States nnd the deportation of all not com- plying with the provisions of the act vvitu ln the time prescribed met with much on position from Cninese m this country Acting upon the advice of eminent counsel that the law was unconstitutional the great mass or UMncso laborers pendiig jurdicial inquiry as to its validity in good laithdtcliuid to apply for the certiflcnt s required by its provisions A test case upon proceeding by habeas corpus was brought before tlie supreme court and on Way 13 1893 a decision was made by that tribunal sustaining the law It is believed that under the recent amendment of the act extending tho time fpr registration the Chinese laborers thereto entitled who desire to reside in this country will now avail themselves of tho renewed privilege thus afforded of es tablishing by lawful procedure their rignt to remain and that thereby the necessity of enforced deportation may to a great de gree be avoided It has devolved upon tho United States minister at Peking as dean of the diplo matic body and in the absence of a repre sentative of Sweeden Hnd Norway to press upon tho Chinese government reperatlon for the recent murder of

does not admit of question Led by a desire to compose differences and contribute to the restoration of oider in Samoa which for some years previous had been the scene of conflicting foreign

unaaio to earn a support The execution of this law in its early stages docs not seem to have been in ac cord with ita truo intention but toward the close of tho last administration nn authoritative cosstrpction was given to the statute and since that time this construc tion has been followed This has had the effect of limiting the operation of the law to its intended nnmncn Tim Alarnvaw having been made that many names had been put npon tho pension roll by means of Wholesale and gigantic frauds tho com missioner suspended payments upon a number of pensions which seemed to be fraudulent or unnuthorizedv pending a complete examination giving notice to the pensioners in order that they might have an opportunity to establish if possible the justice of their claims notwithstanding ap parent invalidity ThJsj I understand is a practice which has for a long time prevailed in the pension bureau but after entering upon these re cent investigations the commissioner mod ified this rule so as not to allow until after a complete examination interference with the payment of a pension apparently not altogether void but which had merely been fixed at n rate hlghor than that authorized by law I am unable to understand why frauds in the pension rolls should not be exposed and corrected with thoroughness and vigor Every name fraudulently put upon these rolls is a wicked imposition up on the kindly sentiment in which pensions havo their origin every fraudulent pensioner has become a bad cit- every juise oatn in support ot a pen sion has made perjury more common and false and undeserving pensioners rob tho people not only of their money but of tho patriotic sentiment which the survivors of a war fought for tho pieservation of tho Union ought to inspire Thousands of neighborhoods have their well known fraudulent pensioners and recent develop ments of the bureau establish appalling conspiracies to accomplish pension frauds By no means tho least wrong done is to bravo and deserving pensioner who cer tainly ought not to be condemned to such association Those who attempt in tho lino of duty to rectify these wrongs should not bo ac cused of enmity o indifference -to the claims of
