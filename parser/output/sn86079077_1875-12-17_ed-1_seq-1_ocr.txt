As the unfortunate Cubans are afraid to travel around during the daytime for the same reason, the will probably have to stay at home and reflect upon the grand eur of Spanish domination. I n a review of j.ondon pauperism re cently published, a striking contrast is drawn 1>ctween the present state of things and that existing sixty years ago. Then the number of persons relieved by the poor rates was eight per cent, of the population. Now it is only three per cent. The population has more than trebled in thai time, yet the number of persons wanting relief remains nearly he same. The treasury officials now estimate that the government will recover more than $2,000,000 from the crooked whisky cases. They at first estimated that only one million five hundred thousand dollars would be recovered. They attribute this success to the evidence directly obtained by the means of the new system of com paring accounts, which was inaugurated by solicitor Wilson, and which led to the détection of the frauds. Chiee Justice White , of Utah— formerly known in Alabama as "Bonnie Blue W hite"—has rendered a decision releasing Brigham Young, and demolish ing formar decisions of an adverse char acter. White's decision unravels one of the Mormon Gordian knots, and will al low attorney general Pierrepont to breathe easier. In the meantime, Ann Eliza's chances for alimony are growing smaller and beautifully less. A lawsuit that is likely to be of wide public interest, as it is [practically one of much importance, is that just com menced by Palace-car Pullman against Palace-car Wagner, for using his patents and inventions. Wagner whose alias is Commodore Vanderbilt, has "acknowl edged the corn" by paying Pullman a royalty of $5,000 a year, for using the latter's patents on his cars between New York city and Buffalo; but now that Vanderbilt has pushed the Wagner cars on, and the Pullman cars off, the Michigan roads, Pullman appeals to the law for redress. Gen. Jural E. Early ,* president of the southern historical society, says that this association possesses nearly a com plete set of all the reports printed by the confederate departments, including the president's messages, reports of battles, acts of the confederate congress and state governments, etc. It has also a full set of manuscript reports of Gen. Longstreet's corps, the papers of Gen. J. E. B. Stuart, all of Gen. Ewell's reports, a full set of papers of Gen. S. D. Lee's corps, and many other valuable reports of confederate officers, besides a number of federal official reports. A gigantic hotel is about to be built in London, with American capital, by an American architect, with American speed, after an American plan, and to be managed on the American system. A site not far from the house of commons, and close to St. James' park, has been purchased, and it is said that a year hence the first visitor may take up his abode in the new establishment. This hotel will make up 1,000 beds; the din ing-room will accommodate 700 persons at the same time, and a staff of 400 ser vants will be required to carry on the duties of the house. Recent events in the history of San Francisco more than ever prove the mer curial character not only of its institu tions, but of its people. San Francisco lives upon the Nevada mines. The con dition of the mines, therefore, has a great deal of influence upon the business and temper of the people of San Francisco. The recent firfc in the bonanzas has de pressed San Francisco trade. At the same time the agricultural enterprises of the state are tempering the sensational spirit of the San Francisco people. There is an undergrowth of business in the city which does not depend upon the mines, and it will supplant the sensa tionalism. Pertinent to the question of & war with Spain, the New York Herald publishes a statement of the navies of all nations. This shows that Spain has eight "line of battle ships of the first class," while the United States have not one. The tonnage of the navies of the two are about equal, but that of the United States is largely in amphibious craft for coast defense. Counting our inshore craft and all, Spain has a quarter more guns than we. As we have clung to the cast-iron smooth bores, in which no material improvement has been made m a century, we can not boast of the su perior power of our gun3. But there is one source of consolation: the monitors can not leave onr shores, so our defenders can not desert us. Minister Schenck has addressed a etter to the London press in regard to false degrees. Having ascertained that persons have been engaged in England in selling degrees or diplomas purporting to have been conferred by certain Ameri can colleges and universities, and being satisfied that these distinctions and hon ors were pretended and spurious, he made the imposture ä subject of correspond

Inquiry has been especially made in relation to 'The Philadelphia University of Medicine and Surgery,' and ' The Livingston University of America'—in stitutions, so «died—of which there are professed agencies in London and other English cities. The latter institution never existed, and the charter of the former was revoked in 1872, on account of the issue and side of sp"rious diplomas. The famous submarine tunnel of the English channel will soon be begun. The members of the French commission, com posed for the most part of practical men and engineers, declare that an under ground communication between France and England is only a question of ex pense, and their report leads to the belief that the project can be carried out with less expense than was at first imagined, and that the danger of leakage and infiltration will not be so great was at first supposed. A shaft will short ly be sunk on the French side of the channel near Calais, to a depth of 350 feet, for the purpose of hauling up the earth and rock from the excavation. There were important disclosures last week in the trial in St. Louis of McDon aid for defrauding the revenue. The man who collected the enormous sums of blackmail from the distillers was on the stand. He swore that something like $400,000 a year was collected and dis tributed among the thieves for four years; that the "emoluments" were more than $8,000 a week, and that one of the ring who believed in "the policy of si lence" received $50,000. A bad lot all around, but the worst of them is this Megram, who willingly made himself a confederate of theirs for five years, and now betrays all the rest in order to retain his own share of the plunder and keep out of jail. The St. Louis ring seems to have been conducted by shrewd and cun ning men, and it is to be hoped that their punishment may serve as a warn ing instead of a profitable trick to be imitated by unscrupulous officials in other heavy revenue districts. It is pos sible thatjthere is some "crooked whisky" here in New York. The bank of England clips every light sovereign that comes into the bank. Three thousand are weighed in an hour with one machine. Last year the bank weighed coin to the amount of $115,500, 000, and rejected $4,200,000, or about 3.6 per cent., as being light gold. For this amount the bank paid the full value making a deduction for the deficiency of weight, which is generally about six or eight cents per light sovereign. Mr. Hodgson, M. P., a bank director, says that in a box of 5,000 sovereigns the number which will be found to have turned the point of light weight will generally be about eight, if they have not been disturbed, and he adds : " You are aware that the sovereign which is in your pocket at 8 o'clock in the morning is not the same sovereign at 12 o'clock at night." After this rather alarming an nouncement it is satisfatory to find Mr. Hodgson stating also that the charge for light weight on the eight deficient sov ereigns would be about four cents per coin, making only thirty-two cents on the box of $25,000; so that " it really amounts to nothing."— Exchange. LATEST NEWS SU MMARY. KAUT. New York has 450 miles of street rail: way, .1,500 cars, drawn by 12,000 horses, and carrying annually 160,000,000 people. Full official returns from all the coun ties of New York state show a majority for Bigelow, the democratic candidate for secre tary of state, over Seward, republican, of 14,812. The temperance candidate received 0,882 votes. The total vote of the state was 765,574. _______ WEST. Disastrous prairie fires are sweeping over portions of Kansas. They can be seen in almost every direction every night, and the damage bids fair to be enormous, proving more disastrous to many than the drouth. Reports from the west show a heavy fall of snow, and a very severe storm extend ing from Laramie City on the east, to beyond Corinne and Elko on the west, during the past week. The official count for members of the Colorado territorial legislature shows that the republicans will have four and the dem ocrats nine members of the council, and that the republicans will have sixteen and the democrats ten members of the house. SOUTH. The new constitution of Alabama has been ratiged by a majority of over fifty thousahd. Six Italians were arrested in New Or leans last week for passing counterfeit nickles, and jailed. The failure of Wallace & Co., whole sale dry goods, of New Orleans, is reported. Liabilities §750,000 ; assets half a million. The bonded debt of St. Louis at the beginning of its present municipal year was $25,992,000, and is now $16,270,000. With the floating debt added, tho entire liabilities of the city foot up $17,417,000. The Galveston New« says : " It is learned that the total value of the City of Waco's cargo did not fall short of eight hun dred thousand dollars, whieh, with the value of the ship, makes the total loss by the dis aster over a million of dollars—ten times the loss in and about the city by the late storm." The Jetty commissioners' report ad vises the use of more and heavier stone. Ii •tates that much has been done, but mue!; more will have to be done before any gooij results are obtained. They regard the South Pass of the Mississippi as more susceptible of improvement than was the Sulina mouth of the Danube, where a twenty feet channel has been secured by jetties. FOREItiX. The Madrid senate has elected Romero lîubio, president, and Senor Saavedra vice pesident. The lower house has elected Vidal Castaneda president, and Sebastian Damaeho vice-president. The compulsory edubation bill hus been introduced in con gress. Official information has been received showing that in consequence of war in Liberia, between the Liberians and na tives, much distress has been produced. The Liberians in the interior are almost in a s täte of starvation. It further appears that several natives, students at the theological eoll at Cape Palmas, are in sympathy with their fellow-natives, and give them encouragement in their attacks on Liberians, and that number of Englishmen'are trading with the natives, supplying them with fire-arms, am munition and other means of war. The Spanish minister has been offici ally advised from Madrid, that his govern ment has conceded that in future, American citizens on trial before court-martial in Cube, shall have the privilege of selecting conn for defense. The treaty of 1705, in the on ion of the Spanish government, was not suf ficiently definite to meet the ease of eourts martial in the event of war or insurrection in the Island, but the present arrangement settles the question in accordance with the desire expressed in a friendly note addressed by secretary Fish to the Spanish government, and disposes of the exaggerated reports on this subject.

ELLA XKOU,«i. Senator Ferry, of Michigan, president of the senate pro ten t, will be Vice-President Wilson's successor. There will be twenty-four contested election cases to settle in the next nation;;! house of representatives. Nine of the con testants are republicans and fifteen awe democrats. , Considerable activity prevails at tire Gosport navy yard. Orders have been re ceived from Washington to thoroughly fit out the monitors Lehigh and Montank, with all possible dispatch. A contract has been closed between parties in Chicago and Liverpool, England to build a number of sailing vessels to ply between these two ports in the grain trade each vessel to have a carrying capacity Of thirty-eight thousand bushels. They will lie constructed in time for the opening of navi gation next year.* From July 1 to Oct. 31, there was a falling off in customs receipts probably to the extent of three millions, as compared with the corresponding months last year. This month thus far, the receipts are much larger. The internal revenue receipts show an increase for July, August, September and October of $2,400,199, and it is exj>ected the increase for the present month will be one million and a half of dollars. The in crease in the receipts from the increased tax on distilled spirits has not been as large as anticipated, but there has been an increase of receipts from tobacco and snuff, owing to the change of the tax from 20 to 22 per cent, per pound. Gen. Ord, in command of the depart ment of Texas, in his annual report gives a lengthy account of the border operations of the Mexican banditti, most of which has been anticipated by press publications. The report closes with the following suggestions: More effectual means must be adopted, than sending troops to look on, while our people are being despoiled- and murdered; for it is evident that soldiers, however willing, can do nothing if confined to this side of the river, and an order to make reprisals with means to carry out the order has sometimes resulted in indemnity as well as security. General Sherman's report.—The an nual report of Gen. Sherman, after stating the geographical limits of the various com mands, says the aggregate strength of the line of the army according to the last re ports received, is 1,540 officers and 25,031 en listed men, made up as follows: Five regi ments of artillery, 270 officers and 2,504 men ; 10 regiments of cavalry, 422 officers and 7,206 men; 25 regiments of infantry, 848 officers and 11,000 men, available recruits, hospital stewards, ordnance sergeants, etc., 33,201. During the past winter troops in the depart ments of Missouri and Texas were employed in arduous and severe winter campaigns against the Kiowa, Cheyenne and Comanche Indians on the Staked Plains, that have for years been engaged in depredations on the Texas and Kansas frontier, resulting m their disarmment and subjection to authority. If military commanders can have control over supplies needed by these Indians, as they 0ow have over their persons, I am convinced, by a recent visit, that a condition of peace .can be maintained. The Sioux Indians hav? re cently made incursious into northern Ne braska, mostly to steal cattle and horses from the farms along the Pacific railroad and north of it. Gen Crook is of the opinion that an army acting defensively cannot prevent these incursions, and suggests that troops be ; sta tioned in the midst of the Indians so as to watch and prevent them leaving on a -pre tense of hunting. This is impracticable unless the army can have supervision of the neces sary supplies of these tribes within th<i re servation; whieh is now not the case. The reports of several commissioners, which have under military escort recently been engaged in exploring the country and in negotiating with these Indians, will throw much light on this subject. Generally speaking, the damage to life and prosperity by the Indians lis be lieved to be less during the past year than in any former year, and the prospect is that as the country settles up it will be less and less each year until all the Indians are established on small reservations; but until they acquire habits of industry in farming orstock-raistng they will need food from the government, be cause the game on which they have hitherto subsided has diminished rapidly.
