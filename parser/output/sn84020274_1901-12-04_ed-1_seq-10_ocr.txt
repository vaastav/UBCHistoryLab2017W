GAMBLING. Judge Clark's opinion in the poolroom feses may be the law of Missouri. If go, this city will suffer severely before ." more effective anti-gambling act can be passed. The Invention of "telegraph" pool rooms, if supported by law, will revive the worst of the old "wide open" days gmd renew the most murderous and thieving scenes of the pool alleys. Of course the effort to check .this new .'formof the old evil will not cease with lodge Clark's decision. The authorities must get a settlement of the question from the highest courts. Pending that, If there are any powers "known to the law by which these eva sions of the anti-gambling laws may be Jtteld under restraint, they saouia ue Tucd to the fullest extent. Unrestricted aambllng will rot the Jilier of the strong est community ever fotnided. 1S03-1S71. -"In Its efforts to fasify the hUtory of Missouri finance the Globe-Democrat lias the impudence to refer in laudatory terms to Bepublican management be tween 1863 and 1STL The Globe finds ground for eulogy in the fact that in the six years the Interest Fund re ceived 51CS0,59S, all of which was ap plied to payment of the State bonds and coupons.

The general tone ( the ii!--:ice is distillled, palrlotle and enn-erv:itie. In mo-t in"tani-e it N r-hariieteritib: of .Mr. Itooseyi-h :il(, ther4-fore. to this eMeiit ftillill- pojuilar expectation. Where tin. ine:ii:e fails in Mich re-pect.s it i ay to perceive the elfeyt vt indiielice.-, which, in all likelihood, the I'roldeut was unable to resist as a Republican and to whicli he yielded bis obedience to the point of refraining from the fnll-e-t and frif't expression of liis indi vidual views. There miit necessarily be some dis appointment that .Mr. Heosevelt. wlioe jierivonul couvietlous are so well known to the American people, has been con tent with so mild a recommendation conceruiug the triors. lli advocacy of publicity of trust affairs i good a far as ic goes, and .sound-thiukiug persons wili agree with him that "the mechan ism of modern busine-s U so delicate that extreme care must lw taken not to Interfere with it in a spirit of rashness or Ignorance." But tiie President might well have been more assertive in sug-gi-sting measures witli regard to a sys tem which, not properly regulated, works much of evil to the people. "There i.s a wide-pread conviction in tho minds of the American people," the 1 'resident's message itself declares "that the greatj corporations known as trusts are in certain of their features and tendencies hurtful to the general welfare." Yet the message seems to Imply a keener solicitude for the Inter cuts of these great corporations than for the people's good. The machine pres sure on Mr. Roosevelt is apparent here. Especially was the President negli gent in failing to treat frankly and fully of the very root of ail rhat is evil in the trust system, the tariff protection of the trusts, the tax paid by the people, which has created monopoly and which alone makes possible the maintenance of monopoly at the people's continued cost. The wrong of the higli protective tariff Is now kuown to the people of this country. They cannot regard as "infant industries," Incapable of existing with out subsidy, ihe great American manufacturing-corporations which" are how underselling all competitors in foreign markets. They see plainly that there is absolutely no excuse for the mainte nance of an oppressive tariff for the "protection" of these giant corporations. The only effect of such a tax on the people is to increase corporation profits in this country and to perfect tlio mo nopoly enjoyed by such corporations owing to the fact that competition is made impossible. The President's recommendation of the policy of reci procity fails utterly to satisfy the Ameri can people on an issue so important. Ami even this recommendation is so hedged about with warnings not to un duly disturb the present tariff as to lose what little strength it might otherwise have possessed. In the matter of our colonial posses sions the President's message leaves the s-iruation unchanged and as vague as ever. AVe do not know whether Mr. Roosevelt contemplates the ultimate dignity of statehood for Hawaii, Porto Kleo and the Philippines. AVe do not know whether he would recommend in stead the holding of these islands as dependencies simply, with no prospect of their peoples arriving at American citizenship. He declares that "our aim is high," but he does not specify In defi nite terms what that aim is. There is absolutely no new light on the Re publican policy with regard to our colonies. As to the Philippines, the President's greatest fear, repeatedly ex pressed, is that we may unwittingly give them a greater degree of self-government than is good for them. The message rightfully makes a forci ble recommendation for legislation to suppress anarchy. This recommenda tion follows Mr. Roosevelt's touching review of the assassination of the late President McKinley by the anarchist Czolgosz. Tho urgency for the prompt and rigorous crushing of anarchy as a malign and Incongruous element in American life Is strongly stated and will meet with instant popular approval. So, also, as maintaining tiie traditional American attitude, will the President's reiteration of the Monroe Doctrine as the cardinal feature of the American foreign policy be approved by the American people. Tho unusual prominence given to army and navy affairs in the uiosago is due, to President Roosevelt's deep and intelligent interest in tho two branches of tho American militant service. As Assistant Secretary of the Xavy he be 'camo potently familiar with our condi tions of sea power and manfully shared in preparing the American Xavy for its splendid achievements during the war with Spain. As a Colonel of volunteers ho served Iu the American Army throughout that same war and thus completed his fitness for buch a dis cussion of army and navy needs as is now found in his message. The recom mendations made in this field are en titled to peculiar consideration as com ing from an American President who speaks with more than the conventional knowledge of the American Army and Xavy. President Roosevelt's first annual mes sage, submitted to "the Fifty-seventh Congress yesterday, is now before the American people. It is commended to their earnest attention. As a political utterance It is a carefully considered 'ex pression of Bnpnblican'polhzj-.. Itsitone ludicates that Mr. Roosevelt has al ready come under the restraining ln tlnenco of the party leaders and is largely surrendering himself to their views. A 

PUBLIC MATTKB. In refeiTing to Mr. Shannon's explana tion of the sale of United States bonds belonging to the School Fund, Hie Clobo UeniDeRit fails to di'-en-.s a single fact presented by him. This admission of tie- nliMdutu eorroctuess of lus tat.- li'eiit is a tribute to the wii-dom dbv ilay(l iu the iransnetion. intivej ill- ehaipe that the conver sion of the School 1'iitid was don In a i-nriier Is without foundation, an the rec otiK of the ;eiiL-r:il Aseuilly shoiv. A .-ar liefore tijc f'nitcd Slates liomis v.eic old 11. '. I'roknii-yur, Clialrinau of the Way-, and Me.tus (.'oiuiillltei (f i he Senate, inin.iiiir.-.l a bill providing "fr tin- transfer of fuiiil Stat bunds belonging to the School Fund of tiie Si.ite of Jli-soiiri, to the Sinking Fund, and to reimbui.se the School Fund." Senator Urokmeyer called up the bill a fortnight later and it was psw-ed unauiniou.-Iy. i 'overuor Woodson recom mended tliis aeiion. The lack of a full attendance of member during the la.st days of the session permitted the .Sen.uu bill to be killed in the House, 1 Li-.-are seven votes of :t two-third jnrlty were lacking, there being oer thirty members absent. Governor Hardin in his campaign ad vocated the conversion from every stump where he spoke. The voters were thoroughly informed regarding the en tire deal. Tiie papers published the de tails No one but an anonymous "ex pert" was or is in ignoiance of the mut ter. These farts were recited fully In The Republic voterday. The people will note that II. C. Urokmeyer was an -tire supporter of the plan, and knew all about it, from AVoodsou's lime. TRUST REGULATION'. Representative Littleficld of .Maine has. been prompt to introduce in Congre.-s a bill providing for enforced publicity of trust affairs along the lines laid down by President Roosevelt's message and also offers another measure so amend ing the Sherman anti-trust law as to faeilitue tiie procuring of evidence in proceedings against; a trust or monopoly. The favorable action of Congress on these bills would be a forward step in the movement to regulate the trusts. There shoititl not, however, be a ten dency to rest content with such action. Publicity of the workings of the trusts is but the beginning of trust regulation. AVhere the trade control of certain ginnt corporations Is found to amount to mo nopoly, the necessary restoration of normal and healthy conditions should follow. Also, in the event of discovery of excessive capitalization, corrective action must be forthcoming. There is no reason to believe that a Republican Congress will take steps seriously menacing the more evil trust organizations against which the Ameri can people demand remedial action. What Is more likely is a make-believe attemptrat regulation which will-intentionally protect the trusts against a re striction of their excessive privileges. Tlio signs of tho moment point strongly to this likelihood. Monopoly corpora tions are in the hands of their friends so far as the Fifty-seventh Congress is concerned. Judge Priest tells frankly the history of the contribution from himself and his friends to the Democratic campaign of 1M18. As usual, the Globe lied and lied and lied. It could not rest with the actual partisan material furnished by contending and noisy Democrats. The Globe seems to itch until somebody prove-? it to be a liar. Then it itches again. Ux-Governor lirokmeyer knew nil about the conversion of the School Fund from United States to State obligations. Ho remembers, no doubt, his alliance with Governors Hardin and Woodson on that admirable plan of investing the school moneys. As an evidence of confidence in Its own party -the St. Louis Republican Club, chief dispenser of Federal patron age in Missouri, has chosen to refuse representation to Republicans from eleven wards. "Harmony" is at hand. General Fred Funston has yet to fight a dangerous enemy. Kansas politicians want htm to stay In the Philippines, where the natives do not show any pre dilection for making him their Gov ernor. In some 2u,000 words, more or less, President Roosevelt tells the American people that the party machine pressure has been tco much for him on the issues of monopoly and protection. Saturday and Sunday Hospital As sociation collections are the largest in the history of the organization. Such a fact is worth a volume of pessimistic argument. Missouri's gift to the battleship Mis souri must be worthy of botli Miss-ouris. Figurehead, tablet or whatever the form, it must be rich ami beautiful. As touching upon the trusts and the tariff the President's message sounds like the voice of Roosevelt uttering the sentiments of Hauua. Becanso 3,0X bills have been, intro duced in Congress you mustn't conclude that the members have their working clothes on. A St. Louis cat stayed on top of a highball for three days, a performance that the best Scotchman will hardly try to beat. Senator A'est was the first to take his seat when the Senate .-useuibled. It was a great bliow and lie's from Mis souri. Missouri's delegation drew the best seats In Congress. Some Missouriaus can draw to a jackstaff and get a steam beat. Three thousand bills have been intro duced in the House of Representatives. The pigeonhole is a blessed institution. President Roosevelt's message, is -a mighty mild 'utterance to come from such. a strenuous man. NEW
