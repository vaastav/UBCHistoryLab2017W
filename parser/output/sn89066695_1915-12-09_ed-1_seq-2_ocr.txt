FOR GREATER REGULAR ARMY Citizen 8oldlry Part of Hit Plan Problem of Commercial Mobilization Stated Oialoyalty Among Cer tain Elements in Our Na tional Life Serious Menace to Peace. Washington, Pec. 7. President Wil son today delivered the following mes sage to congress: Gentlemen of the Congress: Since 1 lent bad the privilege of addressing you on the state of the Union the war f nations on the other side of the sea. which had then only begun to disclose its portentous proportions, has extend ed Its threatening and sinister scope until it has swept within its flame pome portion of every quarter of the globe, not excepting our own hemi sphere, has altered the whole face of international affairs, and now presents a prospect of reorganization and re construction such as statesmen and peoples have never been called upon to attempt before. We have stood apart. Btudiously neu tral. It was our manifest duty to do so. Not only did we have no part or interest in the policies which seem to have brought the conflict on; it was necessary, if a universal catastrophe was to be avoided, that a limit should be set to the sweep of destructive war and that some part of the great family of nations should keep the processes of peace alive, If only to prevent col lective economic ruin and the break down throughout the world of the in dustries by which its populations are fed and sustained. It was manifestly the duty of the self governed nations of this hemisphere to redress, if pos sible, the balance of economic loss mid confusion in the other, if they could do nothing more. In the day of readjustment and recuperation we earnestly hope and believe that they can be of infinite service. American Nations Partners. In this neutrality, to which they were bidden not only by their separate life and their habitual detachment from the politics of Europe but also by a clear perception of international duty, the states of America have be come conscious of a new and more vital community Interest and moral partnership in affairs, more clearly conscious of the many common sym pathies and Interests and duties which bid them stand together. There was a time in the early days of our own great nation and of the re publics fighting their way to inde pendence in Central and South Amer ica when the government of the Unit ed States looked upon itself as in some sort the guardian of the republics to the south of her as against any en croachments or efforts at political con trol from the other side of the water; felt it its duty to play the part even without invitation from them; and I think that we can claim that the task res undertaken with a true and dis interested enthusiasm for the freedom f the Americas and the unmolested elf-government of her independent peoples. But it was always difficult to Maintain such a role without offense So the pride of the peoples whose free dom of action we sought to protect. : end without provoking serious miscon ceptions of our motives, and every thoughtful man of affairs must wel come the altered circumstances of the new day in whose light we now stand, when there is no claim of guardian ship or thought of wards but. Instead, a full and honorable association as of partners between ourselves and our neighbors, in the interest of all Amer ica, north and south. Our concern for the Independence and prosperity of the states of Central and South America is not altered. We retain unabated the spirit that has inspired us through out the whole life of our government and which was so frankly put into words by President Monroe. We still mean always to make a common cause of national independence and of po litical liberty in America. Attitude Toward Mexico. We have been put to the test in the case of Mexico, and we have stood the test Whether we have benefited Mexico by the course we have pursued remains to be seen. Her fortunes are In her own hands. But we have at least proved that we will not take ad vantage of her in ber distress and un dertake to Impose upon her an order xid government of our own choosing. We will aid and befriend Mexico, but ire will not coerce her; and our course VHh regard to her ought to be suffl tlent proof to all America that we seek no political auxerainty or selfish control. The moral Is, that the states of merle are not hostile rivals but co operating friends, and that their grow ing tns of community of Interest. aUlk la matters political and In mat ters economic, is likely to give them new significance as factors In Inter aatloaal affairs and la the political history f the world.

PRE5IH WORD tage because of the economic readjust ments which the world must inevi tably witpess within the next genera tion, when peace shall have at last re sumed its healthful tasks. In the per formance of these tasks I believa the Americas to be destined to play their parts together. I am Interested to fix your attention on this prospect now because unless you take it within your view and permit the full significance of it to command your thought I can not find the right light in which to set forth the particular matter that lies at the very front of my whole thought as I address you today. I mean na tional defense. No one who really comprehends the spirit of the great people for whom we are appointed to speak can fail to perceive that their passion Is for peace, their genius beet displayed In the practice of the arts of peace. Great democracies are not belligerent. They do not seek or desire war. Their thought Is of individual liberty and of the free labor that supports life and the uncensored thought that quickens it. Conquest and dominion are not In our reckoning, or agreeable to our principles. But Just because we de mand unmolested development and the undisturbed government of our own lives upon our own principles of right and liberty, we resent, from whatever quarter It may come, the ag gression we ourselves will not prac tice. We Insist upon security In prose cuting our self-chosen lines of nation al development. We do more than that. We demand it also for others. Question of Preparedness. Out of such thoughts grow all our policies. We regard war merely as a means of asserting the rights of a peo ple against aggression. And we are as fiercely Jealous of coercive or dic tatorial power within our own nation as of aggression from without. We will not maintain a standing army ex cept for uses which arc as necessary in times of peace as in times of war; and we shall always see to It that our military peace establishment is no larger than is actually and continu ously needed for the uses of days in which no enemies move against us. Put we do believe in a body of free citizens ready and sufficient to take care of themselves and of the govern ments which they have set up to servo them. Put war has never been a mere mat ter of men and guns It is a thing of disciplined might. If our citizens are ever to fight effectively upon a sudden summons, they must know how mod em fighting is done, and what to do when the summons comes to render themselves immediately available and Immediately effective. And the gov ernment must be their servant in this matter, must supply them with the training they need to take care of themselves and of it. It is with these ideals In mind that the plans of the department of war for more adequate national defense, were conceived which will be laid be fore you, and which I urge you to sanction and rut into effect as soon as they can be properly scrutlnlied and discussed. They seem to me the essential first steps, and they seem to me for the rresent sufficient. Larger Army Plan. They contemplate an Increase of the standing force of the regular army from its present strength of 5.023 officers and 102.S5-3 enlisted men of all services to a strength of 7.1 36 officers and 134. TOT enlisted men, or 141.S43. all told, all services, rank and file, by the addition of Cfty-two companies of coast artillery, fifteen companies of engi neers, ten regiments cf infantry, four regiments of field artillery, and four aero squadrons, besides 750 officers required for a great variety of extra service, especially the all Important duty of training the citizen force of which I shall presently speak, 792 noncommissioned officers for serv ice in drill, recruiting and the like, and the necessary quota of en listed men for the quartermaster corps, the hoepital corps, the ord nance department, and other similar auxiliary services.. These are the ad ditions necessary to render the army adequate for Its present duties, duties which it has to perform not only upon our own continental coasts and bor ders and at our Interior army posts, but also in the Philippines, In the Hawaiian islands, at the isthmus, and In Porto Rico. Ry way of making the country ready to assert some part of Its real power promptly and upon a larger scale, should occasion arise, the plan also contemplates supplementing the army by a force of 400.000 disciplined citi zens, raised in Increments of 133. 000 a year throughout a period of three years. This It Is proposed to do by a process of enlistment un der which the serviceable men of the country would be asked to bind them selves to serve with the colors for pur pose of training for short periods throughout three years, and to come to the colors at call at any time throughout an additional "furlough' period of three years. This forca of 400.000 men would be provided with personal accoutrements as fast as enlisted and their equipment for tho field made ready to be sup piled at any time. They would be assembled for training at stated in terval at convenient places In asso ciation with suitsble units of tba regular amy. Their period of annual training would not necessarily exceed two months In the year. At least no much by- the way of preparation for defense seems to m to ba absolutely imperative now. We cannot so less. The Naval Program. The program which will ha laid be fore yon by tba secretary of tho nary ta similarly conceived. It Involve only a shorten lug of tba Urn within 

STRIKING POINTS IN PRESIDENT WILSON'S MESSAGE The department of war contemplate an Increase of the standing force of the regular army from its present strength of 5,023 officers and 102.985 enlisted men to 7,136 off cere and 134,707 enlisted msn, and supplementing the army by a force of 400,000 disciplined eltizsns. It will be to tna advantag of the country for the congress to adopt a comprehensive plan far putting the navy upon a final footing of strength and efficiency. The gravest threat against our nations! peace and safety hava been uttered within our awn borders. It I necessary for many weighty reason of nstlonal efflclsncy and development that w should have s great merchant, marine. It seems to me a clear dictate of prudent statesmanship and frank finance that in what ws are now to undertake we should pay as w go. We should b following an almost universal example of modern gov ernment if w were to draw the greater part or even the whole of the revenues we need from the Income taxes. We hava been put ta the test in the case of Mexico and we hava stood the test. Whether wa have benefited Mexico by ths course wa have pursued remains ta be seen. Our concern for the Independence and prosperity of the state of Central and South America la not altered. which plans long matured shall he carrted out; hut It docs make definite and explicit a program which has heretofore been only Implicit, held In the minds of the two committees on naval affairs and disclosed In the de bates of the two houses but nowhere formulated or formally adopted. It seems to me very clear that It will be to the advantage of the country for the congress to adopt a compreb.cn slve plan for putting the navy upon a final footing of strength and en clency and to press that plan to com pletlon within the next five year. We have always looked to the navy of the country as our first and chief line of defense; we have always seen It to bo our manifest course of pru dence to be strong on the seas. Year by year we have been creating a navy 1 which now ranks very high Indeed among the navies of the maritime n tions. We should now definitely de termine how wc shall complete what we have begun, and how soon. Tho program to be laid before yen contemplates the construction within five years of ten battleships, six b.tt tlo cruisers, ten scout cruisers, fift" destroyers, fifteen fleet submarines, eighty five coast submsrlnes, four gun boats, one hospital ship, two ammuni tion ships, two fuel oil ships, and one regular repair ship. It Is proposed that of this number we shall the flr?t year provide for the construction of two battleships, two battle cruisers, three scout cruisers. Often destroyers, five fleet submarines, twenty five coaM submarines, Iwo gunboats, and one hospital ship; the second year, tmo battleship, on scout cruiser, ten de stroyer, four fleet submarine, fifteen coast submarines, one gunboat, and one fuel oil ship; the third year. two battleships, one battle cruiser, io scout cruisers, five destroyer, two fleet submarines, and fifteen coast submarines; the fourth year, two tat tleshlps, two battle cruisers. Iwo scout cruisers, ten destroyers, two fleet sab marines, fifteen coast submarines, one ammunition ship, and one fuel oil ship; and the fifth year, two battle ships, one battle cruiser, two scout cruisers, ten destroyers, two fleet sub marines, fifteen coast submarines, one gunboat, one ammunition ship, and one repair ship. More Men for the Navy. The secretary of the nary Is asking also for the Immediate addition to the personnel of the navy of T.&fO sail ors. 1,200 apprentice seamen, and 1.500 marines. This Increase would be sufficient to rare for the ship which are to be completed with in the fiscal year 1917 and also fur the number of men which must be put In training to man the ships which will be completed early In 1918. It is also necessary thai the number of midship men at the Naval academy at Annap olis should be increased by at least three hundred If this full program should be car rled out we should have built or build ing in 121. according to the estimates of survival arid standards of classifi cation followed by the general beard of the department, an effective navy consisting of 17 battleships, of the first line. ( battle cruisers. 25 battleship of the second line. 10 armored crul ers. 13 scout cruisers, S flrsi-clas cruisers. 3 second class cruisers, 10 thlrdlass cruisers. 10R destroyers, 18 fleet submarines, 157 coast submarine. 6 monitor . 20 gunboats. 4 supply ships. IS fuel ships. 4 transport. 3 tender to torpedo vessels, I ves sels of special types, snd 2 ammuni tion ships. This would be a navy fit ted to our needs and worthy of our traditions. Hut armies and Instruments of war are only part of what has to be con sidered If we are to consider lb preme matter of national self sufficien cy and security In all Its aspects There are other great matters which will be thrust upon our attention whether we will or not There Is. for example, a very pressing question of trade and shipping Involved In thl great problem of national adequacy. It la necessary for many weighty reav sons of national efficiency and devel opment that we should bare a great merchant marine. It I high time we repalrd our mis take and resumed our commercial Inde pendence on the aeaa Need of Merchant Marin. For it I n question of Independ ence. If other nation go to wsr or seek ta hamper each other' com merce, out merchants. It seems, r at their mercy, ta do with a they pi vase. Wa mast as their snipe, and asa them as they determine. Wa hava not nip enough of oar own. Wa cannot handle eur ana commerce on the aeaa. Oar Independence I provin cial, and la only ea lead and wtthla ear awn border. W are not Mkelr to ha permitted u are even the nhrpa of other nation In rivalry of their own trad", and are without mean to extend our commerce even where the doors are wide open and our good desired. Such a situation Is not to bo endured It I of capital Import ance not only that the United State should be It own carrier on the sea and enjoy the economic Independence which only an adequate merchant ma rine would give It but alao that the American hemisphere as a whole should enjoy a like Independence and self sufficiency. If It Is not to be drawn into the tangle of European affairs. Without such Independence the whole question of our political unity and self determination Is very seriously clouded and complicated Indeed. Moreover, we can develop no true or effective American policy without ships of our own not ships of war. hut ships of peace, carrying goods and carrying much more: creating friend ships and rendering Indispensable services to all Interests on this side the water Must Provide Ships. With a view lo meeting these pressing necessities of our commerce and availing ourselve at tb earliest posslhl moment of Ihe present un paralleled opportunity of Unking the two Americas together In bonds of mu tual Interest and service, an oppor tunity which may never return again if we miss It now, proposals will be made to the present congres for the purchase or construction of ships to be owned and directed by tb govern ment similar to those mad lo the last congress, but modified In some essen tial particulars. I recommend these proposals lo you for your prompt ac ceptance with Ihe more confidence because every month that has elapsed since lb former proposals were made fass made the necessity for such action more and more manifestly Imperative That need was then foreseen, it I now acutely fell and everywhere real lied by those for whom trad I wait Ing but who can Bod no conveyance for their good. I am not so much In terested In the particular of the pro gram is 1 am lo taking Immediate ad vsr.:ag of the great opportunity which avails u If w will but set In this mergency. The plans for the armed forces of the ballon which 1 bare outlined, and for the general policy of adequate preparation tor mobilisation and de fense Involve of course very large a4 dilional expenditure of money ex penditures which will considerably ex ceed the estimated revenue of Ih government. It is made my duly by law. whenever the estimate of ax penditure exceed the estimates of revenue, to call the attention of the congress 10 the fact and suggest ny means of meeting the deficiency thai It may be wise or possible tor me to suggest I am ready lo believe (bat It would be my duty lo do so In any esse. and I feel particularly bound to speak of the matter when It appear tbal the deficiency will arise directly out of the adoption by the congress of meas ure shlch I myself urge It to adopt. Allow me, therefore, to speak briefly of the present state of the treasury and of the fiscal problems which the next year will probably disclose, Stat of th Finance. On the thirtieth of June last there wa an available balance In ih gen eral fund of ihe treasury of i 104.170, 105 71. Tbe total estimated receipt for the year 1)11, on th assumption that th emergency revenue measure passed by the last congress will not b extended beyond It present limit, the thirty first of lecember, 1J1S, and that the present duty of on cent per pound on sugar will be discontinued after th first of May, 11. will be tt7O.36S.SO0. Th balance of June last and these eellmated revenues com. therefore, to a grand total of $774. 435.S0S7S. The total estimated dis bursement for Ihe present fiscal year, including $75,000,000 for th Panama canal. $12,000,004 for probable de ficiency appropriation, and $50, 004 for miscellaneous debt redemp tion, will be fTSlitl.OOO; and tba balance In lha general fund of the treasury win be reduced to $20,414. 405.7$. Th emergency revenue act. If continued beyond H present time lim itation., would produce, during th halt year then remaining, about $41,004,- 040. The duty of ooa cent per poind on sugar, if continued; would produce during th two month of th tsoal year remaining after th first of May. about $15.00 004. The twa sum. amounting together to tM.044.gv4, tf added to tha revenue of th seooad half of tha fiscal year, would yield th treasvT at tha and of th year aa available balance of t7C.C44.gOS.TI. Th aadHtonal revenue required ta carry out th program of military nd naval preps rUloa af which I hava spoken, won id, a at present estimated. b tor the flacai year HIT, 91,$00,000. Tho figure, taken with Q figure for th present fiscal year which I hava already given. dlclo our finan cial problem for th year 11T. sumlng that th tax Imposed by tba emergency revenue let and the pre nt duty oa sugar are to b discontin ued, and that th balanc at tba cio of th present fiscal year will be only S20.644.S06.7S. that tha disbursement for th ranama canal will again be about twenty fir million, and that tba additional expenditure for tha army and navy are authorized by tb congress, tb deficit In tb general fund of tha treasury on th thirtieth of June. 1917, will ba nearly two hun dred and thlrty-flv million To thl sum at least fifty millions should ba added to represent a safe working bal ance for th treasury, and twlv mil lion to Include th usual deficiency silmata In 1117; and these sdditlons would mak a total deficit of some two hundred and ninetyneven millions. If th present taxes should be continued throughout this year end th next, however, there would be a balanc In lb treasury of some evenly six and a half millions at th end of tb pre ent flacai year, and a deficit at th end of lh next year of only some fifty millions, or. reckoning ta sixty two millions tor deficiency appropriations nd a safe treasury balance at the end of th year, a total deficit of some one hundred and twelve millions. Tha obvious moral of the figure I that It la a plain counsel of prudence to con tinue all of th present taxes or their equivalent. nd confine ourselve lo the problem of providing $ 1 1 2.000.004 of new revenue rather than IttT.ow,. 000. New Source ef "levenu. How shall w obtain the new reve nue? It seems lo me a clear dictate of prudent statesmanship and frank finance that In what wa are now. I hope, to undertake, we should par as we go. The people of th country are entitled to know fust what burdens of taxation tbey are to carry, and lo know from th outsci. now. The new bill houlJ be paid by totem! taxation. To what source, then, shall w tarn? Thl is so peculiarly a question which lb genliemeo of th bouse of representatives r expected ander Ihe Constitution to propose an answer to that you will hardly expert nse to do more Ihsa discus It ta very gen rral terms We should be folios leg an almost universal exsmpSe of mod ero government if we were to draw the greater part or even Ifc whole of Us revenue w need from the in come taies liy somewhat lowering Ihe present limits of exemption and lh figure at which lh surtax shaft begin lo be Imposed, snd by Increasing, step by sup throughout th preeetii grada atlon. th surtax Itself, tb Inrc-m tales at present pprtrtlned would yield sums sufficient lo balance Ihe books of th treasury at th end of th fiscal year 11 T without any where making lh harden unreason ably or oppressively heavy Tb pre rise reckonings are fully and aecursle ly set out la Ihe report of Ihe secre tary of the treasury which will be tm mediately laid before you And there are many 4 lttior.nl sourer of revenue which cn Jastiy be resorted lo without hampering the In dustrles of th country or putting any loo great charge upon Individual ex pendllur. A ooa per cent Us per gallon on gssolin and aapth would yield, at tb preeent estimated pro duction. lU.SO.; tax of t-0 reals per horse power an automobile and Internal explosion engine. llVooO. ftoo; a stamp lax on bank check probably lU.OOOf; lax of 24 reals per ton on pig Iron. $i0.w.ea; a tax of K csnls per ton on fabricated Iron and steel, probably $l6.9,m In country of great Industrie tike this It ought 10 be easy ta distribute Ihe bur den of taxation without making them anywher bear loo heavily or too ex cluslvely upon any on set of persona or nndertaklngs. What Is clear is. thkt th laduslry of thl generation should pay th bill of thl generation. 1 hava spoken to you today, gentle men, upon a single theme, the thnr ough preparation of the nation lo car for Hs own security and to mak sure of entlr freedom to play th Impartial role In thl hemisphere and lo lh world which we all believe to bv been providentially assigned lo It.
