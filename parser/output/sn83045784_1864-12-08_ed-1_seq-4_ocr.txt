Tbe liberal provision made by G'ongreai for paying peu slous to inval d soldiers and sailors of the republic, and the widows, orphans, and dependent mothers of those who have fallen in n title, or died of disease contracted, or wounds iceeived in the service of tbeir country, have beeu diligently administered.

The Agricultural Department, under tbe supervision of its pressnt energetic and faithful bead, is rapidly commend ing itself to the great and vital interest it was created tf) advanoe. It is peculiarly tbe people's department, in which tbey feel more directly concerned than in any other I commend it to the continued attention and fostering care of Congress. " Tbe war continues. Sine# the last annual messige all the impoitint lines acd positions then occupied by our forces bave been maintained, and our arm* have steadily advanced; thus liberating the regions left in rear, so tbat Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, and parts of other States have again produced reasonably fair crop#. The moat remarkable feature in the military operations of the y?mr is General Sherman's attempted march of three hundred miles directly through the Insurgent region. It teoda to show a great increase of our relative strength tbat our Genera!-in-Chief should feel able to confront aud hold in cheek every active forj* of the enemy, and yet to de tach a well ap(jointed large army to move on such an ex pedition The re?ult not jet being Known, conjecture in regard to it ia not here indulged. Important movements have also occurred during tbe year to the efisct of moulding society for durability in tbe Union. Although short of complete success, it is much la the right direction, that twelve thousand citixens in each rt the States of Arkansas and Louisiana bave er ganizod State governments, with free constitutions, and are earnestly struggling to maintain and admiuister tbem. The movements in the same direotioD, more extensive, though leai definite, in Missouri, Kentucky, and Teones aee, should not be overlooked. But Maryland preaente the example of complete success. Maryland is secure to liberty and Union for all the future. The geniua Of rebel lion will no more claim Mar>land. Like another foul spirit, being driveo out, it may seek to tear her, but it will woo her no more. At the last session of Congress a proposed amendment to the Constitution, abolishing slavery throughout the United States, passed the Senate, but failed for lack of the requisite two-thirds vote in the House of Representatives. Although the present is the same Congress, and nearly tbe same members, and without questioning the wisdom or patriotism of those who stood in opposition, I venture to recommend the reconsideration and passsge of the meas ure at tbe present se?-i> n Of course tbe abstract qu?? tion is no! char ged; but an intervening election rtowi, almoat certainty, tbat ths next Congress will pass tbe measure if this does not Hence there is only a question of fme aa to wLca the proposed amendment will go to tbe States for Ibeir aetion. And as it is to go, at all events, may we not agree that the aoone r the better f It is not claimed tbat tbe election has imposed a duty on members to c*iar?ge their views or their votea, any further than, as an additional element to be considered, their J udg ment may be aff'C'ed by It. It is the voice of the people now, for the first time, heard upon the question. In a great national crisis like ours unanimity of actios among those seeking a common eod is very desirable, almost in d sp-osable. And yet no approach to suoh unanimity is attainable unless i me deference aball be paid to the will of the majority, aimply beeause It is tbe will of the msjo rity. In this case, the. common end ia tbe maintenance of tbe Union ; and, among tbe meana toaeeure that end, such will* through the election, is moat clearly declared in favor of such constitutional amendment- , Tbe moat reliable indication of nublio purpose in this country is derived through our popular elections. Jedging by tbe reccnt canvass and its result, the purpose of the people, within tbe loyal Statea, to maintain the integrity of i ha Union wa? never ni re 11-m nor more needy un?nim>u? than now. The extraerdinary calmness and good order with which tbe m llions of voters met and mingle! at the polls give strong assurance of this. Not only all those who sappoited tbe Unioo ticket, so called, but a great majority of the opposing party also msy be (airly claimed to enter tain and to be actuated by tbe same purpose. It is an unanswerable argument to this effect tbat ih> cand'date for any i fflae wh*?ev-r, high or low, bas ventured to seek votes on tbe avowal that he wai for givinc up the Union. Th*-re bas been much impugning of motives, and macb heated controversy as to the proper means and best mode of advancing the Union canae ; bat on the diatiart is-ue of Union or do Union tbe pol tioians bave showo tbeir iastinct ve kn wiedge tbat there is no diversity among the people. Id affording tbe people tbe fair opportunity of sbowiog, ooe to another and to tbe world, this firmness and unanimity of purpoae, the eiectiou has been of vast value to the oat io Sal cause. The election hss exhibited snotker fact t*ot less valuable bo be knowa?the fact that we do not spuroech exhaust n m tbe most important branch of national reaoaroee?that of living men. While It Is melancholy to reflect that the war bsa filled so many graves, and carried mourning to so many hearts, it is some relief to know tbat, compared with tbe surviving, tbe fallen have been an fow. while oorps. and divisions, and brigades, and regiments have formed, and fought, and dwindled and gone out of existence, a great m? jority of the men who eompnsed them are s?tll living Tbe same ia true of the naval servioe.

ABKATIAM LINCOLN DeciMBtfi 6, l6t>4. OUR PARIS CORRESPONDENCE. Paris, November 18, 1804. The extension of public worka in Paria h&abeeu ao pro digioua of late aa to give riae to a report that the Govern ment waa about to contract a loan, to be called a " peace loan," in order to carry them out. The alleged plan waa aaid to consist of the foundation of a new I^ank of Public Worka, with a capital of five hundred millions, fo be raiaed by loan. Or rather, to apeak more correctly, thia Bank was to be empowered lo issue its oblig tiont, or bonds, for the abo7e amount, reimbursable at the end of fifty years. The liquidation of principal and interest waa to he effected ia the interim by the Bank by means of an anuutl payment, or dotation, aa it ia called here, to be made to it out of the funda of the ?xtraordipary Budget, to the amount of twenty five millions. And thua it waa argned by the chief prom<>tera of the *cbeme, among whom waa M. de Peraigney, that inatead of being tied down to the paltry expenditure of the twenty-five millions per annum, which refused the interest only of the transaction, the Government might spend the capital at once, give tfce public the beuefit and advantage of all the contemplated Improvements, and throw the. liquidation of them over the next fifty yeara in the manner contemplated. The plan ia no doubt apecioua and temptiog and quite in accordance with the fiuaaeial policy of the aeoond Empire, which ia decidedly of a "goahead " character, and alwaya ready ts apend " capital " profusely, whether monetary or po lit cal. There waa, to be aure, one " little " -objection in the way of thia acbeme of amateur financiers?(for what ran M. le Due de Ptraigney know really and practically about finance ?)?and that was the consideration whether the present moment, when the rates of discount at the banks of France and England had just been at eight or nine per cent, and wtii!e a severe financial criaia waa making itself felt In the latter ountrjr, whether that were precisely the best moment for sinking five hundred mil* lions of hard cash io the comparatively nc productive in vestment of public worka and embellishments f The Imperial Government seems to have been wise enough to regard .the measure as being at leaat inoppor tune ; and consequently an official note waa inserted the ?iber day in the Moniteur to the effect that the plan ao much talked about by the public had not bren " adopte i" The use of the word " adopted" clearly intimatea, how ever,That the design haa not been definitively abandoned. And indeed the extension given to public worka and eoo belliahmentR in all directiona is tueh that it is clearly im possible that the Government can hope to liquidate every thing by the budgets, (itber ordinary or extraordinary There are at thia moment several acres of ground c m pletely denuded of houses iu one of the most densely in habited parts of Paris, near the Havre railway station, In the heart of the town Every thing baa been pulled down to make way for the new Boulevard Haupmano, ao calltd after the Prefect of Paris, and other new and splendid lines of thoroughfare. To look at the huge gapr left and the havoc made one would auppoae that a battery of cannon had been playing on the spot for twenty-four boura. On the north aide of Paria a small mountain ia being lettllrd d >wn and carted away to fill up a valley on the arutb side, where a apace of more than a mile aquare is preparing for aew building sites, and will form an entirely new quarter of the capital. Beaides the stupendous repairs, or rather restorations of the Cathedral of Notre Dame and of al most every other religious tdifice ia Pari*, half a dozen new churches, some of them of gigantic sice, are rising at different points. The new Grand Opera is costing millions, and is rapidly urged forward. Then there is the prodlgioua tiak of rebuildiog the imroenae Hotel Dien, or Great City Hoapital, the largest pethapa in the world. And, again, in the northeast of the town, In the midat of the great manu factoring acd iron-forge diatriot, a new " people's paik" is being laid out, formed if what are called the lultei or knolls of ?t. Chanmont, very high rising ground in a rough state, and worked as chalk and gravel pits. More than tarolve miles of rail and tram road have been laid down upon this to bring it into order, and five hundred wagons, drawn by steam enginos and horses, with im mense gangs of laborers, are at work upon it All this of course involves indefinite tutlay. There are parts of the town where the " old-st inhabitant" quite loses him self, so wholly are they transformed. I passed throngh One of these the other dav and found police stationed to show people their way, which I was obliged to ask myself after a fifteen years' acquaintance f All this is very won derful and beautiful, but at the same time very costly. European news ia a complete blank for the last few daysi We await anxiously the result of the election in Xmerica, ou which public attention ia now exclusively fixed. In deed, American news alone presents at this moment any decisive interest THE 

COST OF WAR It ii stated that the armies of Europe have a toUl of 4,694,000 men, costing annually $426 000,000. Russia baa tb? largest *rmy, nuaibe-int l,?00,00i> men. That of Frsnce numbers over 700 000 men. This i? on a peae? baeia If war prevailed toe number of soldiers won id doubtless be largely increased. All this vast outlay ia de voted to the wa?tiujf'of human life aod property. It ia ua*d to destroy, not to boiJd up Who c ?n eatimate the good tbia amount of labor could accomplish for the bapph nets of tba human rnoe if It was employed in the arts of peace instead of war ? It ia almost toealeulable. In our <>wn country, for the past three years, more than a million of men have been engaged in the work of dettnmtion, con suming and destroying what baa required years of industry to aocumnlate. If th# same eoergy ani expends tore had been used in de/elopmg the resources of tbe coun try, iocreaaiog the facilities ot intercommunication, and adding to all tbe various mean* of moral, intellectual, and physical improvement as has been in the civil war whieb b?a been consuming our accumulated wealth, it would have made us not only the strongest nation upon the face of the earth, bq< odded vastly to the individual well-being of th* people. The experience of thousands of years has, however, failed to tearu mankind the coat of war, nor has tbe beaated increase in civilisation and Christianity dimin ished in tbe least the resort to brute force In the aettlMMBt of either nationnl or individual difflenittea. In that regard mankind seem to base made o<> advance upon tbe darneat agaa In the world's history.?-Albany Argut, aEriujt oe co?ofiKA.iuiLs. We publish below the Important intelligence ol the huai teault of the great piratical aoheine to wiee the Paeitte fi>ii tUoacubip Company a vessels, au account ol the in ception ot winch was copied from tbe Now York Tuuee iuto the lutolligencer ol the l'Jth ultimo. Referring to that I acoouut, out readers will remembtir that the plot waa laid in Havana, froui which city the rebels proceeded to Pansina and New Granada to carry out their villany. Part of them arrived at Panama about November 1, but fouod that the Guatemala, the vessel which' they intended to aeifo, hadlaailed, and they therefore waited uutil the 10th ultimo, the cay of sailing of the ateumer Salvador. In the mean ti<ne every tbiDg had been got ready, the pirates were allowed to get on board,and when thirty mile* out a guard of sixty mariuea suddenly appeared ou the aceue, and the parties were taken into cuatody. The detail* are given In the following letter 2 Panama, Tuesday, Nov. 16, 1664 One of the most important captures of the war?a cap ture that bna saved the whole of our eitensive commerce ou the Poeillo from destruction?has just been made In these waters. ... On the 85th of laat month information was received by Ooueul McKee, at Panama, from Thomas J. Savage. Esq., Acting United States Consul General, which detailed wub great particularity a plot of Confederate pirates to seise one of the ships of the Panama R*ilroad Company, the Guatemala, and with ber to make war on our commerce generally on the Pacific. The 25th was the day appointed for the departure of the Guatemala for Central American ports, but it was the intention of the agent to h<>l>l her a oouple of days for freight destined for the Great Fair of San Miguel, Salvador. Hearing that the conepirators were on their way from Aspinwall, and wishing to have a good look at them before they should embark, the agent came to the conclusion to aeud the Guateinela to sea at once, and let the pirates wait for the Salvador, of the mute line, to sail on the 10th instant. Jell's gang reached Panama, and wore much disappoint ed to find the Guatemala had left, but there being no help for it, they quietly settled down into the best hotels to wait. Here they were all recognised, from the description ol the Consul General, and a watch kept upon their movements. The leader purchased three hundred pounds of cannon powder, saying it was for blasting purposes in Guatemala? had it put up in tins^by advice of Mr. Nelson, oommercial agent of the Panama Railroad Compacy, and agent of tbe steamer, and in due time shipped it and took his bills of lading. In the mean time, Admiral Pearsou, on board tbe steam corvette Lancaster, had been informed of the plot, and all the preparations made for the capture of the gang. It was arranged that sixty men should be ready in their boa's and placed under the lee of the Pacific M*'1 Company's steamship Sacramento, which vessel was scarcely a stone's throw from the'anchorage of the Salvador. That as soon as the passengers, who were embarkf d on the tug, shou'd touch the deck (f the Salvador, they should all be invited into the large upper saloon by Capt. Douglusc, to show their ticket*, and there kept till the Lancaster's men could Jump on board and surround it. All the doors were closed but one, and all the state-rooms Wcked, so that no one could enter from the saloon to des'roy pip rs, or <hrow ihSto from the portholes. When the sigi.al was given from the balvador for the boats to come alongside, it wa promptly responded to by Capt Davenport, whose bout* were in an iustant alongside tbe vessrl, ana la another iiittant the whole force was on deck, and had complete possession ol the ship. The Lancaster had previous ly gone down the bay, leaviog orders for the Salvador to follow her till both vessels should be at least three ma rine miles from a headland, which would take them a dis tance of about one hundred miles from Panama. As soon as the Salvador was under way the list of pas sengers was read over, and it was found toe following per sons, comprising most of tbe loaders of the gang, wpre on board, vie: T.E.Hogg, alias iirson, acting*master and cemmander of the expedition; E. A. Swain, alias Young, acting master's mate and execut va officer, John Hid dle, acting chief engineer; T. J. Giady, acting assistant engineer- J. L. Black, acting assistant paymaster; B B. Lyon, sailing-master; arid Joseph Higgins, (wbos? name is believed to be Reed,) paymaster's clerk. The baggage having previously been-received, every suspicions.person on board was thoroughly searched, in eluding three or four gamblers, who had been exercising their vocation in Panama, and who, it was believed, were in the league. Nothing was found on any ooe, however, except a lew ug'y-looking dirk-knives. But Capt Brad bnry, of the Sacramento, who was on board the (Salvador, had previoutly made a most important discovery?that of the papers of the chisf, which had been hidden, on the first alarm, under the cushions of a sofa in the siloon. Among the papers were the duplicate orders of Hogg, signed by 8. K Mallory, Secretary of the Confederate Navy, and a list of initials corresponding with tbe names of the gang, asrgning the pritf-^har. ? to the parties, Irom the chief down to the co<k The plan of the pirates, as developed by these papers, was to take tbe> Guatemala, then captuie tie fcalvador, then Intercept and oaptur* the California steamers; then 10 proceed to the neigtborbood of the Cbincha Islands, capture all our vessel#there; then to capture and destroy our Pacific whaling fleet, and af.er to destroy or molest our commerce generally on the Pacific. ...... At about thirty miles outside ol Point Ma!o, at daylight on the 11th, the Lancaster and-Salvador hove to, and thu seven pritoners, with their baggage, which had b*en de nuded during the night of lots of pistols, balls, caps, knives, handcuff*, &.C., were transferred to the Lancaster, which immediately started back for Panama, while the balvador proceeded on ber voyage. Nothing but very strong sus picions having been fastened upon tbe gamblers and a few others, they were released, but a strict watch will be kept opon ibem by Capt. Douglass during the voyage, The following ia the offioial report of Commander Da vekPohT, of the United States frigate Lancaster, who had been ordered by Aoting Rear Admiral Pearsos to arrest the pirates : United State* Steamer Lahc4?ter, Panama, A a vernier 12, 1B64. ADMIRAL: Your ordera to me of tbe 9 b instaut have bcenobejed "vttbatimit litfatim."

However, If their suspicions were aroused they took no advantage of it. After all were com fortably on board the Salvador the signal which I had directed to be made was hoisted, and I was on board in one minute. I bad pievicusly instructed tbe officers aa to their 0 urie ao soon as we should get on board the r alva lor, and 1 am proud to say that my orders were moat implicitly obeyed. All the passengers had been assembled in tbo cabin by Captain Douglass, the commander of tbe Salvador, Appar ently with tbe view of examining their tickets. This 1 had arranged with him some days previoosly. 1 Every officer and man went to the staffion 4 had aligned so soon as he wbs on board. By this I was enabled to capture paper# of value, orders from Mr. Mallory, oath, distribution of shares r>f the price, A c A 0. A c. 1 had cautioned officers and men to seita every scrap of paper they might see. After having examined the passengers I informed them I was on board simply as a polioe officer, to see that noth ing was wrong; they were under the proteelioa of tbe Government of New Granada, and that they were perfectly free to go whithersoever they pleased. I ordered the oap taiu to get under way as anon as possible and overhaul the Lancaster, which had gone to sea. Having given all neces sary orders secretly I threw off all appearauee of beiog au offioer on board on duty; conversed freely with every body, and think thereby disarmed " our friends" of all suspicion. At daylight the next morning, being twelve miles outaide tbe territorial jurisdiction of New Granada, on tbe broad bosom of the Pacific Ocean, I ordered the ensign to be bolsted, assembled all tbe passengers, and thm informed them that, in virtue of my commission, being now under the American flag, I desired the pleasure of the company of several of them on board my ship.

EXECUTION OF MULLKft. The London papers ol tbe l&th ultimo contain full parti culars of the execution of Franz Muller, recently convicted of the railway murder. An immense number of specta tor*, estimated at not less'than one hundred thousand per son*, assembled to witness the execution. Mailer made no confession until Le reached tho gallows.
