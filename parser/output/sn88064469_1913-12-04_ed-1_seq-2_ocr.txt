The message of President Wilson to Congress is receiving the ap proval of the people, irrespective of political views., Unlike some of his predecessors he has refrained from an indulgence in a circumlocution of phraseology which only the very few can understand. He has ad dressed himself plainly to the peo ple, and what he did say is in the reaching of the masses. Besides the t;ubjects he has submitted to Con gress for consideration are respon sive to the people's anticipation of a betterment of present conditions. It, may be said in the fullest sig nifloance of the term that Woodrow Wilson is the President of the peo pie with whom he is in full sympa thy. In his official personality Pres ident Wilson has impressed Con giess with the importance of its duty, and instead of Congress con trolling the President, President Wilson has controlled Congress in the cordiality of the spirit which is the opposite of dictation. It is the Caucasian's opinion that Woodrow Wilson is developing into a. executive of this Nation that will .title him as being the greatest of i; relidents of the United States st se the days of Washington, Jef rmeson and Jackson.

T HIS may be said to be a season. Furs of all kinds are worn in every imaginable way. The woman who can not afford a fur set shows a hat trim med with bands of fur or a gown on which it is a charming embellishment Fur there must be somewhere. For the woman who seeks for nov elty there is a wide range of choice. Everything is modish from leopard to mouse skin, but when choosing furs it is as well to bear in mind their wear Sing properties. Fox, for instance. wears very badly. Sable, astrakhan and Persian lamb are durable, while bearskin, though moderate in price, wears better than almost any other fur. Of late years furs have become more and more expensive. The really better kinds are quite beyond the reach of the woman with an average purse. Happily nowadays, with the vogue for fur trimming, the woman of small - means can work wonders with just the tiniest little bit of real fur. This year white and black furs are in vogue. Squirrel is very popular, and S its soft gray tints are becoming. It is moderate in price also, though dear er than it was several years ago owing n to its popularity. A pretty squirrel s stole and muff may be had for quite a moderate outlay. L What more useful garment can there p be than a long gray squirrel coat? Its price is not ruinous, and, although it is not the most expensive of furs, nothing is more becoming to a woman with S dark hair and a fresh complexion. Chinchilla, Persian lamb, seal, leepard skin, moleskin, ermine, Siberlan mouse and pony are among the popular furs. r) S ss =are tbe ost caweted of furs. Thuw miat.. among the -most azpi at'w . 3!

Women who do crocheting, knitting and other forms of needlework know how aggravatingly the yarn can tangle up and the spool or ball roll away. A Washington man has designed a brace let spool that prevents all this. The spool is revolvably mounted on a bracelet, which opens at the bottom and which can be clasped on the wrist in an instant. The yarn or thread feeds over the back of the hand into the needle, and there is no slack and no possibility of tangling and the conse quent tedious untangling. The spool is held lightly in two spring clasps, sc that it can readily be removed and a fresh spool put in its place. Being open at the bottom, the bracelet will fit any wrist, and it is made with a I finish that will not tarnish. ROast Turkey. A turkey should be dressed and cleaned at least twelve hours before iuing. Make filling of soft part of stale bread. Pour over this hot melted butter; season with salt, pepper, sage and onion if liked; mix well together; salt well the inside of turkey and fill and sew up.

Place the turkey in pan with breast up; push the legs up under the skin; fasten with' small skewers to the bone of the rump. Turn the wings back; run another skewer through them and body of tur key. Tie legs together; wrap twice around the end of skewer; bring it up the back; wrap it around the ends of the wing skewer and tie tightly. Put little pieces of butter over the turkey itf it is not very fat. Baste every ten minutes. When done remove strings and skewers, place on hot platter and garnish. Possum and Sweet Potatoes.

Lle'vellyn. the Dartmouth university quarterback, has been spoken of for the All American teams this year. Hie is a wonderfully caupable lad in passing and kicking the pigskin. Llewellyn and Ghee were rivals for the p,)sition on the varsity team this year. and the former finally won the job permanently. Plans of the Colonels. There is a chance that the Louisville Colouels will take a spring training trip to Florida in 1914. A story was published in a Louisville paper during the ptist week to the effect that the location had already been selected and that said location is Fort Meyer. Colo nel Wathen has not confirmed this re port as yet, but he admits that he is contge.plating such a venture. Other American association teams have gone south for their spring train ing in the past, but only one has made the trip to Florida and done the thing up right. That club was Toledo, Charley Somers taking the Mud Hens along with his crowd of Naps to Pen sacola, but the final showing of the club doesn't prove that the jaunt was beneficial in the- least. Owner Wathen hasn't made a deft nite announcement of the proposed trip for the simple reason that he hasn't decided whether it will be advisable. He has two or three spots in Florida picked out and is going over the propo sition from every angle. If the colonel can land a suitable location it is highly probable that his club will be taken south for the early workouts. Pro Golf Tourney Abandoned. Plans for a tournament open to pro fessional golfers residing within a radius of 100 miles of Chicago have been put in storage for the winter. Owing to the lateness of the season Tom Bendelow, who had the matter in charge, found that it would be im possible to get a representative field, and the tournament was dropped until next year. President Douglas Smith of the new Winnetka Country club, near Chicago, announced that the course would be ready for play in the early party of July. The clubhouse is in- course of construction and will be ready by next June. The officials of the club are: Doug las Smith, president; Robert Steven son, Jr., and Archibald W. Shaw, vice presidents; W. Walling, secretary and treasurer. The board of governors in eludes W. G. Hubbard, Jr.. George Higginson, Jr., N. Landon Hoyt, Per cival Manchester, Tom Taylor, Jr., and Rowland D. Whitman. Williams May Succeed Sharpe. It is rumored that Dr. H. L. Wil liams, present football coach at Min nesota,.is to be engaged to succeed Sharpe as the head of the gridiron staff at Cornell. There are big influ ences at work to oust Dr. Williams from his position with the Gophers, and it is almost equally certain that Cornell men are not entirely satisfied with the way football matters are be 4tg conducted at Cornell. it is asserted that Dr. Williams will come to Ithaca in the event of his be ing able to get Minnesota to release him from his contract, which has two more years to run.
