Washington, December sth.— Hoar this morning seated a joint resolution of the Legislature of Massachusetts, opposing convict labor ou ths public works .J the United States.

Buu.r Introduced a bill (0 repeal the internal revenue laws now to force, and to abolish internal revenue. Cull m introduced a bill to recrganize the legis lative power in Utah. Bla.r introduced a joint resolution. providing for m constitutional amendment regarding alcoholic liquors.

Nkw York, December sth.— The Sun, which has been very reticent on Carlisle's t lection, says: As we understand the position of the new Speaker, he Is entirely opposed to the protective feature of the present tariff, big and little, direct and indirect. Tiacti'iaily no less than in theory*, and in common with many other questions of principle that remain in our nit cs, in tbe logical application of the doc trine ol a tariff for revenue only, all strictly politi cal questions are destitute of principle or subord inate and inferior, and are of little consequence in comparison. Carlisle i 3 an honest man. He docs not now look one way and now another. New York, December sth.— A Times Indianapolis special says : Bon. Joseph E. .McDonald, in an in* terview upon the election of Carlisle, says : ■' lam greatly pleased over the election of Carlisle. What is his 'position on the tariff question ; He is in favor of tariff for revenue and in favor of such pro tection as that tariff gives to the industries of the country. He is not in favor of the Immediate adoption of free trade, but in favor of a tariff re. form that can be made without the damaging of the country. Tariff for revenue, with incidental pro tection, I reuses it." Cullom's I tah Kill. Washington, December stb.— bill introduced by Senator Cullcm to reorganize the legislative power of the Territory of Utah provides that .il lative power be vested in a Governor and Legislative Council, composed of nine members, to be ap pointed by tiii President. Special Messages. Washington, December sth.— The President will make the Mississippi river improvements, Hennepin canal and other public works the subject of special messages to Congress. Reference to these subjects was omitted from the r. gular message, with a view of treating them more in detail in supplemental communications. Press Opinions In ltceard to the Message. Kbs V"i k, December 6th.— rime* says : The annual message of the President exhibits a calm tone and moderate temper throughout. While it contains no marks of profound statesmanship, it is a business-like document, and in the main all that the occasion calls for. The Tribune lays: It is a straightforward busi ness-like document. The digests of the Department reports, of which it la largely composed, are clear and satisfactory. The recommendations and sug gestiors as a rule are sensible and well digested. It is In no sense a great message. It is, nevertheless, well calculated to y roduce an excellent impression oi. the country. t» r-Wrf »VS : Tie message ha? that character cf plain and practical good sense which all cf Ar thui's state papers have borne. While we do not approve of all lis recommendations, and indeed dissent strongly from some of the most important of them, we cannot to highly praise the spirit of its deportment. Ti.c Sun says the third message of the President was awaited with the very general conviction be !•: reband that it would be clear in its terms, wise in its recommendations, and patriotic in its inspiring motives. So it is. 'I tie Sfar says the message is, as might have been anticipate., neither brilliant Dor startling. It re flects the continuous, easy-zoing, rather indolent character of the Ada iuistration. Political Situation at the National Capital. Washington, December sth —Thus far the Demo cratic majority in the House works harmoniously. It is plain that none of Carlisle's friends will attempt to diepu c Randall's leadership on the floor, and he told > our correspondent to day that the majority «i 1 be found acting is a unit upon all questions likely to engage the attention of Congrats this ses sion. Randall's friends seem to be reconciled to their defeat, and the champions of the Keutuckian are not disposed to boast ovt r their victory. Car lisle's moderate speech npoa taking the chair, and the private declarations of his henchmen, have In spired the Democr tie Representatives from the North and East with the hop* that there will be no radicd changes in the tariff this session. The President's message, opposing any plan at the present time for a further reduc tion of the national revenue, has had its effect upon those gentlemen who antici pated an entirely different suggestion from the Chief j Magistrate T he Democrats from those Western Si it« which have no manufactures or industries of any importance, feel that they have fulfilled the wishes 1 :" their constituents in voting for the elec tion of a revenue reform Speaker, and they are not, on the whole, particularly anxious to dig under and overturn the entire tariff system. When the Speaker announce.-! his Ways ami Means Committee the public can form a better idea of what is in store for the future regarding tariff legislation. Ten days or two weeks will probably elapse before the com mittees are made up, and very little work will be done by gross until sfter the holiday re-cess. The "House was In session tees than an hour to day, and it adj turned until to-morrow, w-ph the understanding that after the reading 4 the journal a further adjournment until Monday next should be tak n. The reoreai>'/T*.i.*Ti of the Senate cilices continues to be the prine-p -1 tooie of d.scu-*-ion among Sen ators. r day's caucus decided that there was no necessity for ta^te in tuin'ng out the present Dem ocratic officials. It is very doubtful ii George C. Gorbam will realize his cherished ambition to again | beelectid Secretary. Mahone and Riddlebergtr were both invite I to at ten. l the caucus beldyesttrday when the subject was discussed. They refused, but. not cause cither has an ir en of attempting to ovarii 1 the decision of the majority of Republican Senators r garding the organization. White the Virginia Senators would prefer the nomination of Gornam, they will not refuse to vote for the election of any good man who may be nominated for Secretary. These gentlemen are named for tho place : Ex hepreseutative McCock, rf New York ; Edward McPherson, of Pennsylvania, late Clerk ol the House of Representatives, and James R. Young, of Phila delphia, formerly Executive Cleik of the Senate, and the present Chief Clerk ol the Department ci Jus tice. McCook is not an applicant for the place, and has written his friends in the Senate that he does not desire the office. Some Senators think, how ever, that he can be persuaded to enter the race. Fanner*' Congress of the United States. LotisviLtK, December sth.— The Farmers' Con gress of the United States confined to-day at the Gait House, Sixty delegates were present, repre senting Kentucky, Teniiesse, South Carolina, Vir ginia, Missi-sippi, Colorado and Indiana. Other delesr^tes are f xpected to arrive to-night. The fti ident of the Congress, Major Thomas J. Hudson, of Lamar, Miss., who opened the Congress, ad 'r used it at some length, setting forth the demands and wants of the agriculturist, especially urging the appointment of a Comr__ii«sioner of Agriculture as a member of the President's Cabinet. Such an officer, he said, could watch our foreign relations in re spect to this interest, which must ever be the great est. He would be enabled to secure the farmers' labors a better result. There is not a farmer in all this country who understands farming as he should, and bow ignorant must be the Cabinet and national councils, who have never studied it. The prosperity cf the country depends on the progress of agri culture. Such beimr the state of affairs, alt delib erations of national bodies should tend toward its elevation. This can never be secured until th f annus are brought into a body. Let us, there fore, teach the farmers their own interest ; raise a err that will reach tbe Federal Government at Washington. We are in sore need of scientific knowledge of fanning, and such means should be secured as would put this knowledge Into easy pos session of the humblest tiller cf the soil. Wholesale Systematic Embezzlement. New York, December sth. — An audacious case of wholesale systematic 1 mbezzlement was brnuirht to tight yesterday hire. For nine months past a num ber of retail grocers on Sec. avenue have been mysteriously and unaccountably robbed. Hem Fuller, a grocer of Si 3 Second avenue, arrested a e'erk oarued Mfcror, whom he suspected, and the latter on hemp cornered admitted to being a mem ber of the A. B. C. Society, consisting of twenty five members, the President of wafeh was Christian Krooss, a milkman. The Society was formed Octo ber 2') th. Ea._h member upon being sworn in was obliged to steal 5125 each month from his employer ad rieprsit it with Kroosz, who would keep £25 "for himself an J place the rest to ths c edit of the '* Union." At the and of a year each clerk who de cide! to go Into business for himself would receive $100 .'rota each member of the Union— S2.4CO In all ID tin KtriM:i> i MOV train. I Kill tIK win m

If any of the meifbers were sick, afttr keeping up dues for a year, he was paid $*_! per day by each ether number of the l*n ion- a total of MS per day— until his re covery. Members were allowed to let their dues run for three months, but in consideration of this privilege were obliged at the|end of.three months to pay in 9900, an increase of sa on the ordinary firee months duts, by installment. It Is expected that the evidence to-day will implicate a number o other grocery clerks. Mark Twain and the Bartholin Maine. K«w York. December sth.— Mirk Twain has sent a characteristic letter to the committee which pro poses that the Bartholdi statue be altered so com memorate Adam : " What has liberty done for us Nothing in particular that I know of.* What have we done for her . Everything. We have given her a home to go to. Let her set up i monument to us if she wants to clear the thing. On the other hand, look at Adam. What have we done for Adam? Nothing What has Adam dome lor us! Every thing. With trifling alteration this present statue will answer very well for Adam. Y.

Three Children Burned to Death. scsta (Ga.,» December -Three negro chil dren were burned to death in Columbia county Sunday. Their parents went to church, ami kicked the children in the cabin. OKI KM *» *-*■*. Far Away View* of th« President's Men- Sltge. I, N. N, December ith.— The Standard says : The moat in.]*, ri.rri part -i the message in that eon! lin ing a recommendation to use heroic measure* lot the supprewion of j^' j-^aniy. The Telegraph denounces tho Presidents recom mendation to use heroic measures for tho mppiea sion of polygamy, and descries thd proposal -,s in attempt to erect a political despotism upon tho ruins ol ■ proscribed faith. The Time* thinks President Arthur's message somewhat careens, and m a tribute to the Irish vote in the language used in regard to pauper •mi grants. The press generally express dlsappojnt meat that tlie President di>L not recommend reduc tions in taiitf at this session of Congress. All, however, refer to the picture the message prcscuU ol the great prosperity ol the Unit.'d -.Cites. The Chinese Embassador anil Ihe Ton i|tiln 4|itrotton Park, December -th. Marquis Twne comments on the statement made by Parr} In the dumber of Deputies on the Slst of October thai the French Government did not believe China would declare war, nor had France any Intention of doing so ; that France was desirous of rim establishing her self hi the Red river d, I.i by gaming possession of Sontay and Bienlnh: thai when thai was achieved nobody would be able to drive her oat; that with patience, sacg bold and her forces she would be proof against everything, and that prudent policy would lead to a settlement of the Tonquln affair. Ihe Marquis observes that lb i statement produced a, painiut impresi-ion in Tonquin. If it becomes a question ol |>osscssiou of Tonquin, further i epil ations would i i useless, m it will be impossible for China to agree thereto. A Sperk of Trouble.
