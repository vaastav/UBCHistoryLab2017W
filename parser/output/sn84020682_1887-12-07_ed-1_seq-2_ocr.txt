ASHEVILLE CITIZEN. B. V. FTTRM1N, 1 JORDAN 8TONE, VBWTOR8. J. 1. CAMERON, J WED'DAY MORNING. DEC. 7, 1SS7. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. We lay before our readers to-daj the able message of the President of the United States communicated to Congress yesterday, li is devoted especially to the revenues of the government, and urges in unmis takable and clearest language not only the necessity but the urgent demand of reduction, and readjust ment. In this Mr. Cleveland is fully abreast with the sentiments and in terests of the people. His reminder that both the leading parties are committed to a reduction is felici tous. We regret that he does ,not in elude in his recommendation either a repeal or modification of the in ternal rerenue laws. The articles of taxation involved in these laws seem to overshadow the onerous, oppressive, inquisitorial and offen sive features of the methods of the system of taxation. If this cannot be repealed as we think it ought to be, it certainly should be greatly modified in'.its operation, and the rate of taxation so reduced as to fre it from its monopolistic tenden cies. How Congress can avoid heeding the counsel of the President upon the matter of tariff reduction we cannot see; and should it do so, wo believe the people, will hold the delinquent members thereof to n fearful responsibility. It is a sound, irresistible paper, and must produce a strong effrct upon Congress and the country. Speaking of editorial duty to speak f lankly and honestly to the public when called on to speak un pleasant truth?, the Charleston Sun says: "Honesty, frankness and fair play are essentialsot journalism as the hot policy in the end. Fearless tuith telling and faithful warning must prevail against demagogy and slavish tickling of the public ear People may be made unjust by the irritation resulting from unwelcome truths, and passion and prejudice may lead them to efforts to injure and punish a faithful friend; but the natural appreciation of truth will triumph alter a time and the newspaper that by its enterprise and honesty de serves public support will receive it. A newspaper should not be re garded as fhe thing of a day. It is intended to live and stay, to be per manent enduring, an institution I its community, a powerful factor in the conduct of affairs and in expres sing and moulding the character ot the people among whom and for whom it is published. It cannot afford to stain its life or to weaken its character by yielding its opinions or principles or shrinking from it duty inobeJience to temporary out bnrsts ot public feeling or lor fear of resentments or assaults."

The sun all the morning looked like a ball ot lire. At 3.-?o p.m. a dense cloud suddenly lowered upon the two towns, and five min utes later it was as dai k as night. People became frightened and busi ness was entirely suspended. Many of the superstitious thought the end had come, and began praying A number of merchants hastened home from their stores. Chickens went to roost and cows went home to be milked. In the midst of the con fii'ion a heavy snow-storm set in, and when daylight returned, fifteen minutes later, the ground was white. The same phenomenon occurred at Vv ashington Courthouse, (Jh:o. '' .o Has Faiih. I l.t.(l lw.cn tiv.nl .led nil winter with cold and pain in the chest and got no .- 0 . 1:..- ... t..A K..
