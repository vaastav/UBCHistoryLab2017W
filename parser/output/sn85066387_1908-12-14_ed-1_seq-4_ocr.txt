The board urges that it should have power-* to equalize individual assessments that appear to call for 'revision. Tlie supreme court held in 18S0 that the board had no such power and that its only function in this relation was to equalize-as between counties. The court was* divided on the ques tion, but the majority decided against the contention of the state board. As an alternative to legislative action the board now In vjcvv of the fact that the personnel of our supreme court has entirely changed since that decision was down, and in view of the further fact that modern revenue legislation, and the decisions of our courts thereon, have entirely "changed within recent years, the question arises whether it were better to submit the question again to the supreme court or submit to the people such an amendment to the constitution as will effectually put tbc. question of the power of this board beyond a doubt." The intimation savors of -contempt of court, doubtless quite unintentional,' .But The Call hesitates to believe that the law, as laid down by an augu^ tribunal, is such a merely personal matter as the board innocently appears to think. Jurisprudence is supposed to be an exa;ct science and when the factors are all known,- as in case of interpretation of a statute. Only one result should be possible: It ii>;. true that' the" v onicial exponents of this science differed among themselves "o'lUilifs '.matter by'T'a \-ote of four to three, and the scieii tific siinT;pffiJ?p f . equation xvk's- ascertained \by counting noses, but courts doiiiof like* to "be reminded of the vagrant fancy of a minority which the accident of a broken leg or a toothache or other temporan' incapacity might have converted into the fine flower of jurispru dence. But if the state board desires to try"an experiment- on the body of the court the w^ay is- open, albeit the implication carries a certain disrespect for the science of jurisprudence, which, in spite of four to three opinions, Thc.Lall hopes is undeserved. Let the board ask for a recount. The arithmetical method for. the ascer tainment of truth is wholly in accord with popular institutions. THE DISTURBANCE IN CONGRESS THE galled jade winces, but in modern practice he hesitates about making his sufferings public. That appears to be the -state ; of mind : that actuates congressmen who took it as a personal matter that the president in his message? hinted that the law limiting the. activities of secret service men had "been prompted by a sense that members might have, some personal affairs which they preferred to have kept quiet. Some bod y is lent to this con jecture by the fact that two or three members of congress were convicted of crime with the help of the secret service and this theory is reinforced by the current disturbance andlthe threats that congress is preparing to shoot back at the president for his temerity. The Call hazards a guess that the bubbling, and fizzing courage of these excited congressmen will evaporate when time comes for action, biit we imagine that the country, as a whole, would be much delighted should the promised performance go on. The insurgents would discover that Roosevelt is loaded, and after the -engagement it would be chiefly an affair of picking up. the pieces. As a form of political entertainment the affray, would be both instructive and amusing, with this difference from other combats of merit, that^the assailants would know what hit them. \u25a0 The bill in question; wliich was quietly slipped through congress as an amendment to -an appropriation measure,. Was as vicious '-a piece of legislation as was ever invented by a gang of political crooks. -It was a law " designed" to make crime safe by taking the police off the beat. The treasury department was. forbidden toJend secret service men to. other departments desiring to investigate the commission of public offenses. Now if there are any congressmen who want to defend this measure and discipline the president because he condemned it,, why then the American people would be pleased to see these congressmen come put in the open. But we fear they will do nothing of the sort. Such men.are of the slink ing; kind. 

MISSES THE BRASS TACKS PRUI- HSSOR " JOSIAH ROYGE of' Harvird, 7 who fs v native CaHiqrnian and a graduate of our state' university, '•quarrels with Bret Harte because he constructed an ideal pioneer Cali fornia at the expense of historical \truth. -Supposing, which may or may not be true, that Professor Royceis right, we fear that he .has -begun too late. The California; of Bret Harte, such as it Avas ; is fixed for all time, ;evena^ Sir Walter Scott created a land of romance out of the eccentricities of the Highland cattle thieves and reavers. It .wasJikc this; with Bret Hartc,.says the professor • They depict thc\carly CaUfornia mining camp asif it were more drless an established, institution, and portray.the miners as , if -they already po Sensed a sort of provincial consciousness... For Bret Harte the.early miner is already a definable social type— with a dialect and set characteristic^customs and niajjners— W4th a local consciousness almost such as a> peasantry or a hisjh land clan might possess. . : ; -- ... ~ PThe argument as to dialect is not, well niade. Bret Harte ably created his popular dialect of early days asother romancers have donejn like case, and all that is demanded; in this .field is that the language shall- seem true and hold its consistency. Of course; Harte 'did not .pretend that he was '' writing -history. was neces sary for his Ins Subject and^^ EDITORIAL PAGE whole, lie was neither a writer of catalogues nor a census taker. The number of Californians engaged in gainful; occupations; inter ested him not at all. But he. found in the gambler and in the prospector, -"for iiistanceV '.types that -have become fixed, and ri wefc certainly human and \u25a0 instinct > with -human sympathy. \ '\u25a0•JtVseerns absurd to deny class consciousness to such as these, and theftypc; so far as it exists anywhere, grows but of -this/sense; • It-is true that the world's a stage for such as Bret Harte. -Let us not quarrel with what he has painted on the scenery. .Suffer\ us to believe ' that once upon' a time the whole world was not engaged in selling figs or brass tacks. - V" ; ' . . l^ : . .
