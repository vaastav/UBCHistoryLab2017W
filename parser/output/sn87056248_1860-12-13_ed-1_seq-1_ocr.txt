MICHAEL ZKIINER. Plyraonth, Ang. SS, nSlkf 'i Si. Synopsis of the President' Message. Washington, Dec. 4. After ftlluding to the great commercial, agricultural, aud other material prosperi ties, of the couBtry, the President asks why is it, then, that discontent now 60 extensively prevails, and the union of the States, which is the source of all these blessings, is threatened with disti nction? The long continued and intemperate in terference of the Northern people with ihe question of 6lvery in the Southern Slates has at length produced its natural effect. The ditlerent eections of the Union are now arrayed against each other, and the time has arrived ro much dreadd by the Father of his Country, when hostile peo graphiesl parties have been formed. This does not proceed solely from the claim, on the part of Congress, or the Tfi-ruoiial Legislature, axrdtida sl.ivprv f-..m 1 Territories, nr froni the ellorts of the I Fugitive Slave Low. hut the immpdk: i 0 . .....v., w.,v , r-Pi-il i.nUs fmm tl.. i.w.0cc...f o rwi ,i.mi agitation of the slavery question through- ter of a centurr whi -h Ins ntv.Lid iri tJl ' ct murj , .M.uunas pruuticea KS vrv tllV

Many a matron throughout the Ssoutli r9tirs at night in dread of what may befal herself and children before the morning. Should this apprehension of domestic danger ex tend and intensify itself, until it shall per vade the masses of the Southern people, then disunion will become inevitable. Self-preservation is the first lavr of nature and no political union, however fraught with blessings and bene tils in all other ! respects, can long continue, if the neces eaiy consequences be to render tlie homes and firesides of nearly half the parties to it perpetually and hopelessly insecure. Sooner or later the bonds of such a Union must be severed. It is my conviction thr.t this fatal period has not yet arrived. After referring to the unceasing ao-itn- o o tion against slavery at the North for the last twesty-five years, both by the piess and the peopl, and asserting that the time of Congress is occupied with violent speeches on this never-ending subject, lie remark-: how easy would it be for the American peoplo to .etlta ih shi very question forever and restore peace and har mony to this distaactcd country, which can be done by letting the slave States alono and permitting them to man a o their own SStato atr.ms, as thev onlv are re- -jfjiioiuio uciuio viuu IUI ei.tivry eii'llUl; .1.

II alleges it ia out of the power of anv Pres- idem to accomplish but little, whit'h leads him to observe that the election of nny of our lellow citizens to the ofiice ol n en i i ded does not iu itself afford gieat cause for dissolving the Union. The lite elec tion having been held in strict conformity with tho proyUions of the Constitution, does not justify a resolution to destroy this very Constitution. Reason, justice and regard for tho Constitution, all requite that Wd should wait far some overt and dangerous act on the part of the President eltfot before resorting to such a remedy. Mr. Buchanan refers to the f.ict that the President's province is not lo make but to execute he laws. It is slleged, as one cause for immediate secession, that the Southern States uro denied equal rights with tho othr States in thn common terri tory; but by what authority are these de nied? Not by Congress, which 1ms never passed, and I believe never will pass, nny act to exciudo slavery from these terri tories, an certainly not by the "Supreme Court, which has solemnly decided that slaves are property, and like all other property, their owner. h:t3 a right to take them into thy common teriitori?s and hold them there under the protection of Iba Constitution. 1 ho nntici:.-.tiv;i th.t Con-rress mav nass law ohn.ixi.m i, f .l .i:.. ..i.... mm ' uwa icasuii mi oi .soiuuon. i ne j:u'S,t- j dent reasserts the power of Coii'iesa overt properly m the Tenitories, and thesacr.-d! rights of property are recognised by thö j Constitiiiion TI rooc-t ... of constitutional dirt) whit h has yet boon cammitted, consists iu tho acts of ditlerent Stales legislatures to defeat the execution of lli3 Fugitive Slave law. It ought to be remembered, however, that furthest, nets neither Congress or any President can justly be held responsible, having been passed in violation of the Federal Constitu tion. They are. therefore, null and void. It will be the duty of the nxt President, as it has been my own, to act with vigor in executing tho Fugitivo Slave lav, against the confirmed enactment of Stato legislslurca; We are not to presume ia advance that ho will violate his duty, which would bo at war with every princi ple of justice. Let us wait for tho overt act. The Fugitivo Slave law ha been carried into etlect in every contested easa since the commencement of tho present administration. Let us trust that tha S'.:.te Legislaturen will repeal their un constitutional and obnoxious enactment. -Unless this shall bo done without unneces sary delay, it is impossible for any human power to save the Union; nnd tho South ern Slates have a right to demand this net of justico from the Northern Statee. Should this bo refused, tho injured State, r.ftcr having fire t usod all peaceful means to ob tain redress, would be justified in revolu tionary resi&tanco lo tha Government of tho U nion. The alluged principle that as each State became a party to tho Union by tho vote of its own peiple assembled in convenlioii, so any 0119 of them nay retire from the Union in a simitar manner by the vote of such convention, which iswholy in consistent with the history as well ns the character of the Federal Constitution. a portion of Geil, i Jackson's message of reeling to j the nullifying ordinance of Äuth Carolina, and says tLis government was intended j uy us lounuersto ie perpetual, ana not to! be annulled at the pleasure of any one of the contracting parlies, i he Presidsnt then enumerates the powers conferred on Congress by the Federal Government, and that there powers may be effectual, it also possesses exclusive right to lay and ! collect ail import duties and other taxes, and has adopted effectual menn3 to re strain tho states from interfering. In order still further to securo the uninterrupted exercise of these hih pow against state interporition, it is provid ed that the consütutjon, and the laws cf the United States whh;h shall be made- in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made, which shall bo made, under the authoritv of the Uniied States, shall bo the supreme , . .
