With sentences totalling 2U0 years in prison hanging over his head and 230 troops and rural guards at his heels, Ramon Arroyito, Cuba's modern Jesse .James, is still at large.

Arroyrto took to the high roa i about three years ago and, if the Holdups, kidnappings and other unlawful acts attributed to him are well founded, he operated in every part of the island before he went into retirement after two years of hectic endeavor and with a fortune variously estimated at from $50,000 to $200, 000. But last spring, while very pro saically travelling from Matanzas to a nearby village to attend a cock fight, he was captured by two rural guards, acting as train escort, who held him first for carrying arms without a license, but loaded him with chains when they discovered he was the notorious outlaw.

His escape from the Matanzas jai\ where he was lodged last week to await trial for kidnapping, is credited to a former pal, Julio Ramirez, whom Arrovito once rescued from jail at Jaruco by holding up the warden and turnkeys singled handed in broad daylight.
