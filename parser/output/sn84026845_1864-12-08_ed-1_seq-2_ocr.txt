W?rr<> til mn??n? ? ????- '?** Ttiur.aay Morning, December 8 1 l*? I'rcfident'i fflciiage. The President's message this jear, like Its predecessors, and like most documents that emenate from Mr. Lincoln's pen, is a plain, direct, comprehensive and readable paper. For the greater part it is simply recitative in its character, giving us a great deal of outline information in a moderate amonnt of space. The aommary as to onr foreign relations speaks for itself, and we presume could not be better digested in any comment than in the text itself. We note the absence of any allusion to our difficulties with Brasil. No mention is made at all of that power. As for what is goiog on in Japan, and her "inconsistent and capricious " conduct, the country will care very little these times, and the same may be said of China. Onr foreign rela> Hons, outside of Great Brilian and France, are really a matter of little moment just no*, and only with those powers because ot threatened complioaiiona. passing to our domestic affairs, the sta. tistics of the Treasury Department are first in the President's attention. Our total actual receipts for the fiscal year ending on the first of July last, up to which time only the books of the department seem to have been balanced, were eight hundred and eighty-fonr millions, seventy six thous and, six huodred and fortygix dollars and Seventy-seven cents, while the disburse ments were upwards of eighteen millions less, say eight hundred and sixty five mil lions in round terms. Of course the great er part ot our receipts were from loans.? We borrowed from the people upward of two thirds of the amount, or over six hun dred millions, while we got from them in the shape of taxes, customs, sales of public lands, Ac., the balance, say a little over two hundred millions. In war times such figures are not and ought not to be uninteresting to the people, and we doubt not every reading citizen will give (he exhibit set forth by the Pres ident his careful attention. In view|of the large excess of our borrowed receipts over tboae otherwise obtained, we are glad to see the President, in concnrrenoe with the Secretary of the Treasury, recom mending increased taxation. In this con nection we may note the recommendation of the President to exempt a certain amonnt of the government bonds, in each bona fide holder's hands, from taxation, and also from seizure for debt. We doubt the policy of soch legislation. We believe that it would not pay, and in the end would ooly prove troublesome, expensive and mischievous. The fact that govern ment bonds now pay deoidedly leas tax tbao other securities, la M}ooara?~??? enough. Those who will not invest in them under the extraordinary inducements offered, soeh as gold interest and re duced taxation, will not be likely to avail themselves of anything fur ther in the same direction. The class of holders to whom the proposed exemption would be really desirable mast be very small indeed. All incomes of six handred dollars and under are exempt, wnich is the only bonus, we think, that the government can afford to grant. As the friend and protector of the poor man, it was the duty of tbe government to ex empt that amount of income, and as a matter of policy tbe exemption has worked well. Anything further would be practi ciog generosity at tbe expense of justice to tbe national treasury. What a vast affilr this war is J Not onlr do tbe exhibits of tha Treasury De partment show it, bat alio the few brief fig. urc, afforded as from the records of tbe Na ry aod War Department*. Think of aa armed marine of six handred sod seventy ooe Teasels, carrying (oar thousand six hund red and ten gaos, and fifty-one thousand men to use them. Many people think be """ 'he Florida and Alabama eluded capture and destruction so long, that our na?y does not amount to muoh and accom plishes very little. Bow faulty and short comlog saoh aa idea Is the facts show" When it is stated that we bave captured during ibe year three bundred and twenty, fonr vessels, and thirteen handred eioco the war -began. A Navy that !o addition to such fruitful work is per forming police duty night and day along more than three thousand miles of coast is certainly doing its part to suppress tbe rebellion. We are surprised to know that so small a part of our vast expenditure 8 ,he w,r b'g? l>M been on ncconnt of the Navy. We had supposed that the actual cost of tbe vessels alooe from March 1881 to November 1864, the dates given, Wunld have amounted to nearly or quite the two buodred and tbirty-eight millions reported by tbe Secretary of tbe Nary. Tbe Post Office Department la done great injustice in the way tbe figure, are reported in the copy of the message furnished to y* V? detected tbe error, but could oot get tbe proper correction until too I.te. The oorrect fignrea are twelve mil lion., ioor buodred and tbirty-eight thou .sod,two buodred and fifty three dollar, and seventy-eight cents, in tbe way of receipts, ?? ?g*iost twelre million., .ix hnudred and forty four thousand, seven handred and eighty ,ix dollars and twenty cent.. In the way nf expense., tbn. .bowing a balance oo tb. wrong ,icl, of boak> of upwards of two bundred thousand noo?".'h ? ,b,lldef" otbsr comm..,. npoo these figures until an other time. We m?y here, however, uke occsslon to sar what we know well of onr per,ooal knowl edgo. that the Hon. Montgomery Blair, lately *t the head of tbe department, up to bis reslgoation administered the details of tha postal service not only witb energy bat economy, and at the same time with a dis creet liberality that was Statesmanlike. The country is Indebted to nlm for the new Money Order system, for our better Inter national postal arrangement!, for the new mall car sysletn, (in rogue la the But) and Postmasters everywhere are hie obliged friends for the simplification of their for mer interminable, vexatious and useless entries. Much improvement ae posta' matter* still need, Mr. Blair took more and longer steps in the right direction than any I of bit predecessors. Mr. Stanton being behind band with hie labors, on aocount of hli recent illness the President simply states that faot ae an I apology for the lack of any report from | him so far. And this brings us to what with ua all muet ever be, while this war cootinnes, the interesting part of a Presi dential message?rii: the comments of the Executive on the general situation In I the field and the indications of onr own, public opinion ae regards the war. Mr. I Lincoln doee not attempt to conceal hie grat location over bis re election. He thinks, I of coarse, like all men who have experien I crd well at the hands of the people, well I of their verdict. But in the true spirit of bis speeches just after the election, there I le no offensive peroonal ingredient, even the remotest, In all that be remarks. On the contrary hie tone le subdued, modest and becomiog. Whatever the comments of the President upon the result* ot the late I elections may lack of conventional phraseol jogy, they are suoh as have greatly pop4 ularised him ae a writer of State papers and letters. What could be, for instance, more expresively put than this allusion to the present condition of Maryland. I ."^mPort!lnt movements have ocoorred du I ring the year, to the effect of moulding so ciety for durability in the Onion. Al I though short of complete anccess, it is I much in the right direotion, that twelve thousand citiiens In each one of the States II . f.I1,s3 ani1 Louisiana organized I local State Qovernmente with free Coo I stitutioos, and are earnestly struggling to maintain and administer them. The move, moot in the same direotion is more ex. I thou?h le" definite, in Missouri. I Kentucky and Tennessee should not be ? overlooked; but Maryland presents tbe I """P10 "r complete success: and Mary I land IS seoure to liberty and the Union for all the future The genius of rebellion will no more claim Maryland. Like ano. iber foul spirit, being driven out, it mar seek to tear her, but it will woo her no I more." We like the way tbe President, in an other place, singles out Jeff. Davis as the | leader of the rebellion, and puts a distinc tion between him and all his other co-la | borers, of all ranks and olasses. While tbe effect of such a distinction will be [galling in the extreme to Davis himself, it I will really be incendiary among not a few I of his adherents, if published in tbe rebel I papers as printed this morning. We may I call such a presentation of the case strat I egy on the part of Mr. Llocolo. The dosing paragraphs of tbe Message I I contains, in our judgment, the most char aoteristic features of Mr. Lincoln's mind land temperament, and are also cou..h~J I ,?tjla own native style. I To uos of thousands of loyal hearts the I following words from the President will be more welcome than all else in his mes |sage: I presenting the abandonment of arm I ed reistaoce to the national authority on I J, p,r' ,?f the insurgents, as the only indispenslble condition to ending tbe war on tbe part of the government, I retract nothing heretofore said as to slavery. I made a ysar ago, I .h TI ^ remain iu my present position I shall not attempt to retract or modify I the emancipation proclamation, nor shall ' r"ur" t0 7 any person who is free I ni ,K ?J ,ho proclamation or by any Lh? y k""., Congress. If tbo people Should bj Whatever mode or meaos, make "ecu"" du,7 to re enslave inch ISTm?? *?? ?.?od not must be their I instrument to perform It. I m-.nn8tali0,8 * ?'?g|e condition of peace, I !?"r. that the war will ceue ?h?n h I Government whenever it began it!" " ?n "" P*r'oftb??e "ho Thos ends the message. Onr aim bas been in these remarks to enlist the atten tion of the reader rather to tbe document Itself than to any substitute lor it of onr own. We hope all will read it carefully. It IS upon the willingness of the people to I cultivate a taste for graver reading and reflection than they have been accustomed to in times pan, that we mu,t rely for lhal enlightened courage and pertinacity of de termination that are to carry us through | this long and difficult war. Th? '? Specials" at Washington striking, ly exhibited tbeir utter ignoranoe or else their utter recklessness as to facts, when they telegraphed Monday night that Mr. I Chase's friends had conceded that his chan cesfor the Chief Justiceship were all up,and I that it had ;been arragned that Davis or somebody else was to be appointed. The ? Specials" must have felt superlatively ?illy tbe next day when Mr. Chase's n0mt. nation waa sent in, to find how wide of the mark they had fired. In sending in Mr. Chase's nomination, Mr. Lincoln did something for which the I men t!* im' 7" d0abt not' h" own juSg? ment, will alwaye applaud him.

Grant, and that he will, "before the gt I i?g down thereof." (for ??????*?? "sun," four sentences back, and 'ben take It figuratively as meaning season,) acbievo I "AS discussion has Involved three 'blogs. First: The promises assumed via: That the present season is Spring; rightfully as sumed because an apparent, therefore a conceded truth. Seoond: An Inquiry as to why Spring sbnuld appear out ot the usual order, eliciting historic parallels in tranepualtinn ot natural phenomena. These I always to subserve ona of two belligerents, land always crowning that one with vic tor!. Third: The Inevitable deduction, wblcb Is, sinoe our side is the party aided by this 8pring-in-Autumn, that onr side is I to accomplish what it proposes. If it should snow to-morrow it not be the fault nf the argnmentl Words aside, the campaign depend. on a ooniinnanoo of the present warm and dry weather. Two weeks more of It may remove these head Quarters to the Spotttwood House, or perhaps tho Ballard, in case Gen. Grant ^dse^t^fcrm^fo^l;-^,^ soocess, involves heavy Bahting nntw th standing the Rebel force In Virginia la less than one half the number thjgr, had last SPThf remaining half Is aU concentrated about Richmond. Early's fnroe* have been recalled from tho Valley, and very few are guarding the Lynchburg and Dan ville roads. A cavalry expedition under General Gregg, down the Weldon yesterday and day before, found only * few hundred in that quarter. Nor bat? they dispatched any large fbrce to Georgia? none but Hetb's Division, and that a small one, from the Petersburg front. Confront, iog us on the north bank of the James they have more than at any time sinoe Boiler effacted the lodgment here, having been lately reinforced by Kershaw's Divis ioo of Eiriy's Corps. Aad they have con structed a magnificent line of works bard up to our own, and Interior line after inte nor line is plainly visible. These facts, together with the everyday clamor of the Richmond paperB for the last inhabitant to be ready to help to man the trenches, are proof that the enemy expects a terriffic assault on thu side of the river. These a*me papera asaert that Butler and Porter are preparing a tremendous naval arma> ment to attack in conjunction with the firBt flow of water through the Dutch Gap Canal. -3? Well, the truth is, it behooves them to be in readinesa to withstand all these?and more too. I may say particularly the "more too." The 18ih and 10th Corps, which have bitberto constituted the Army of the. James, have been abolished, the wbits troops of both going to form a new corpa, to be numbered as the 24th, and to be commanded by Gen. Ord, while the color ed troops of both, with those of the Army of the Potomac, are to form the 25tb Corps, under Gen. Weitzel. The change was demanded by several considerations, of such weight that at last the separation has been decreed. Prominent amoog the reasons requiring it, is that due credit may be awarded wherever it may be earned.? In the army the division ia the unit, and let a division do well, or let it do ill, the! tact is soon known in every other division. Bat before the country the corps is the unit, and each has its own fame, while (ew have suggested to them the record of a division or a brigade, by simply seeing its number. Therefore the colorei troops have been given a corps of their own, and will have to make a name for it. And it is no unwarranted stretch of the imagination to say that the Twenty-fifth will bow for itself a niche in history along side of the already household words, the Sixth, the Fifth, the Second, the Eigh teenth, and others not lees glorious. Tbe ability and earnestness of tbe new corps commander is of itself a pledge for this. Gen. Godfrey Weitzel, althougb a young man, belog In his 29(h year, and, with the exception of Gen. CusUr, the youngest Major General In the service, is an old soldier. A lieutenant of engineers, he oommanded one-half of the company of regulars which with loaded pieces, capped and at half cock, guarded tbe presidential carriage at tbe inauguration in '61. That same night he lay, with 64 men, in a barn adjacent to the building in which was held the inauguration ball, Gen. Scott having received word that a set of Balti* more roughs were likely to make a dis turbance. Having prior to tbe war served four years under one Major Beauregard in the construction of the defences of New Orleans, when Qen. Butler sailed against that city, Lieut. Weltsel accompanied blm 18 engineer officer, and assisted in redn sing the works he bad helped to coostrnot.
