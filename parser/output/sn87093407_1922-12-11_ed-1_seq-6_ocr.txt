Trftrnnm liMl The Gospel of Reaction The easiest thinjr to sav ai><>ut the president's message is that it is characteristic of Mr. Harding. It is calm, dignified and. for the most part, colorless. His recommendation* that amendments he submitted to make passible the regulation of child laltor and the re strictions on issues of tax-exempt securities are along popular lines and will be well received. There will lie little objection to his plan of the registra tion of immigrants or for the enforcement of the prohibi tion law. His comment on foreign relations is what might have been expected, and indicate that we are still standing jmt in watchful isolation. Probably the only "kick" in the message is the recom mendation that a labor division of the interstate com merce commission be empowered to hear and decide rail road labor disputes as to wages and working conditions, and to have power to enforce its decisions. This mean* giving a governmental body the power to fix wages and that, of course, will meet with bitter opposition from organized labor. This proposal, which would set up the reactionary inter- State commerce commission as a sort of national Kansas industrial court system, will receive scant consideration in a congress practically dominated by progressives, ready to champion the cause of frve labor. While the farmer receives some passing sympathy, that's about all he does get. He is told he ought to have all the help the federal government can give him, and whatever that may be is left to the best judgment of congress. The farmer is assured, however, that the outstanding problem is better and cheaper transportation. With this the farmer will doubtless agree, altho he may want relief now instead of waiting until the president's dream comes true of a co ordination of all transportation systems from railroads down to the motor highways, with these acting as feeders to the railway#. Some farmers might, with reason, infer that the presi dent is more interested in the ultimate needs of the rail goads than the present needs of the farmers. Altogether, the message doesn't say much and doesn't mean much. It reads as if written by a president who hadn't yet quite made up his mind. ft jm will guarantee Henry K»rd nil] llvr a liundml >ear*.

He Was fool or scamp. There's no evading the alternative. The country needs a demonstration on Mr. Keller's No. 1 If federal executors of the law and federal courts can, with impunity, treat the constitution as a liar or subvert ft to the advantage of any class, it is time the country ■BMW it.

At the statewide meeting at Tacoma a few days ago, where taxation que.«v tfona were under discussion, a strong sentiment developed for a state income tax law. That is what we should have. In fact. The Star ques tions if the great bulk of all our taxes of every sort ought Aot be raised by income and inheritance taxes. An income tax is fair; it exempts the men and women of meager resources and lays the burden in increasing acale upon those best able to pay. An income tax would be efficient and economical to collect, for the state would have access to the federal re turns, and thus would be relieved of tte cost of maintain- In* expensive machinery for the purpose. By all means, the next legislature should incorporate the income tax idea into our state system.
