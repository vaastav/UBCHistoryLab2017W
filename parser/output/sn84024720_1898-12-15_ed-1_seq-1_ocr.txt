Wei j s as if all the things we like dis . agree with us, and ail the things we don't like agree with us. Dyspepsia larks in most of the good things we eat, and indigestion follows the gratification of appetite. Of course, it isn't nature's fault. Nature does the best she can,' and if a man will only help her a little bit at the right time, he may eat what he likes aud as much as he likes. Dr. Pierces Pleasant Pellets are for people who are ■:rouble.! with indigestion. Par" tlcuUrly for those in whom it manifest itseif in tbe form of constipation.

After that, use them occa sionally when you need them—when you have eaten anything that di agrees : with you.

On a recent Sunday evening an elder ly man whoso appearauce at once at tracted attention, walked into the elec j trie ii_ht plant in West Saleiu. He had | stoppe.l to inspect the plant, but was j soon engaged in relating the most re- I inarkalile narrative to which tho*e pres ent ever listened. His name was Thomas Burns, aud be is a veteran of the w«r of He was in the marine service during that war, on the Federal side; his fa her and one brother were in the marine ser-1 vice on th* Confederate side. Burns' was chief engineer on the gunboat Es sex, and his father was captain of the [opposing biat, Arkansas. During an , engagement the latter bo*t shot thd hall j w j'Ch almost tore away the skull of i Bairns. II- showed me the lines of a fpUte of silver weighing tii ounces on j the top of his head. That wound was enough to kill any ordinary man, but |j<e re-over., 1. and was afterwards thej victim of more accidents than any mor tal with whom I ever came in contact. He was also chief engineer on another boat, which run aground on a sand bar. He rushed to his engine to reverse it, when he was caught and driven through a six inch space, necessitating the amputation of a hip bone in order to straighten his crooked form. Upon ex amination it was found that all his ribs on the left side were broken, his right knee cap pushed around behind bis leg, his elbow cap knocked off and his wind ' pipe gouged out. A silver wind-pipe was substituted, througn which, by ' means of a hole in his neckandafunnel, he was given his food for seventeen months. An operation was performed ' to remove the broken ribs, during which he went into a trance aud wasprouounc- * ed dead by three physicians. He was ' dressed and put into a coffin and re mained iv that eosntttfoa fromSo'eloek ( one -v-Ung iu/fil 9 eh- _*st iuoi>. ng, J * wh-u his body *>■& prepared (ox sh ; p-| nieut.

Burns was tHKt.i from the coflb, at.d is today a welkins example e>f what a man 11 cau go through with and still survive. In prfemuing the operation to re move his ribs liis heart was transferred 1 to the right side, from which it was nev- t er replaced, and therefore it still re mains. beatiuK alnioct behind his right • shoulder. Burns is now on his way ro j Tennessee to have a dead bone removed from nis breast. The foregoing srory was beard by many citizens of West Salem. Burns carried with him clippingsfiommauy of ( the leading papers of this country, te*ti- ( I ying that what he said was true. He allowed Himself to be examined by ail ■ pre ? eut, aid his Htory seemed clearly to ' be a statement of e-imple, unchallenged « factp.—Sal-m Tim-s R-gi„ter. • Sunset r enonally Couducted Excursion, to j California Without change of Cam.

The New lork Journal fays: ( "The President would obtain more 1 Bers tor bis literary efforts if he would a course of lessons iv the art ot | Hug down" in some good newspa , i>er office. For instance, instead of the 20,000 words he unloaded upon Congress yesterday he might hive said this: "We have thrashed Spain and remem bered the Maine. lam running Porto Rico and the Philippines.
