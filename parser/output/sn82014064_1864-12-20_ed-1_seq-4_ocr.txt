NORTHWESTERN FREEOMEN’S FAIR. ISACCDBAI. ADDRESS. Ltctme ij Theodore TUton, Esq—The SUte of the Country—“Ko State Ont of the Union, So Sim In IU” Hie Great Fair for the benefit of the Freedoms, to be held In this dty during the present week, under the autplcfca of the Northwestern Freed men's Aid Association, was formally opened last evening, by Theodore Tilton, Esq., the accom- pllthcd editor*of the New York Independent, who delivered a lecture on The State of the Country. It was an able, logical, convincing effort Metropolitan Ball was well filled, the body of the building and galleries being occupied in ev ery part The band of the FTtcenth Veteran Re serve corps was present on the platform, and played several tunes in their most excellent style. The platform was occupied by prominent dozens,. clergymen and judges. ..... The meeting was colled to order at allttle before eight o’clock,"by C. M. Hawley, Esq., who briefly adverted to the condition of the country, past and present and the progress of popular sentiment as expressed socially and in the form of legislative enactments on the slavery question. He detailed the nee of slavery and IU fall, now brought about by the very means taken In hand for its preservation. Already three onto! the four million of slaves had been lifted from the position of chattels to that ol men. These people thus freed required to be educated into the ability to tee, to enjoy their freedom. For this purpose the present Foil bad been Instituted, tbe Drat that bad been held. Before Introducing tbe speaker of tbe evening he would make the following announce ments: The Great Northwestern Freedmen's Fair will open in Bryan Hall at 3 o'clock to-day (Tues day,) and it will be kept open during the week. Dinner will be served from 12 to 3 o’clock in Lower Bryan Hall, each day, commencing with to-day. In addition to the usual variety or fancy articles, the managers have procured a very largo Invoice of every and of holiday goods, which will be sold at as low a figure as can be afforded. He announced, also that Rev, J* S. C. Abbott wonld deliver to-night in Metropolitan Halk bis celebrated discourse on “General Grant and the War,” and that on Thursday evening he would deliver an address written for the occasion—tbe aTitiWgrßHTyof thp landlrtfT of the Pilgrims. At the close of each lecture appropriate tableaux wonld be presented. - Mr. Tilton was then introduced, and received with applause. He is a young man, of slight build, but with nervous power stamped In every linea ment of his features, and flashing forth In every movement, The following is an abstract of hia discourse: .. , , . . Be congratulated his hearers upon their ancient and honorable city of thirty years. He had been searching tbe city over for Its ancient ruins—the Chicago platform and those who bad placed them selves thereon. Although he did not take the gilded view of the state of tbe country, he did fake the view of good cheer. like the Vicar of Wakefield, be had a wonderful knack of hoping. War, in other countries was demoralizing; with ns It has elevated the moral tone of the people, the nation stands npon a higher plane to-day than ever. The speaker then refered to the prevailing vice ofdnmkenneseinthearmy, using the following language: “AMajor General once said to him that never was there a braver army than that of. the Ameri can Union, but that half his officers who would bravely face any encmv fighting under the southern flag, recoiled and cowered beneath that insidious enemy that lies in the bottle. I was once the spectator, not long ago, to a debate in the Sen ate Chamber of the United States. I heard two Senators spook in one hour, and both of them were drunk- One of them was from tbe State of well, never mind, it is not my business to tell you if it is not your business to know. [Lanehter.] Only 1 will say this: that when next a Western State sends a Senator to Washington/.do not choose one for whom two sidewalks are not wide enough. [Cheers.] For do you know it? The Ship of State is tossing upon a stormy sea, therefore 1 say, call back every dmnkcn man whose hands are on the helm, with this exception, 1 say. which Is individual and not general, the moral tone of the community is strong. This advance is to be witnessed in tbe Government, for Govern ment is the best thermometer we have of tbe public feeling. The Government cannot be pure when the pnblic morals are corrupt; cleanse that and all is cleansed. Just as the city Is tbc pediment of the people, bo Is the Govern ment the sediment of bolh. Now just look at the spirit of onr Government Not many years ago Paul Peyton, of Tennessee, Bald that the city of Washington was so corrupt that the man In the moon held Lis nose as he passed event. Now, as an instance of the spirit of our Government, Newman Ball said a few weeks ago, in the Surrey Chapel, that the progress of freedom bad kept pace with the progress of the war. A generous statement for him to make as an Englishman. We can see it in the struggle of freedom which followed, at first with faint and hesitating footsteps, in the wake of our ermies; but now she is the loading power, tho dictator, with war as her instrument. ,r lie spoke of the proposed amendment to the Constitution, of the Improvement in the Supreme Court; of the fact that the President of the United States, who said be wonld. if opportunity offered, return a fugitive slave, ends his official term by spring that another, not he, must be the instru ment of that return, la not this progress, he ask ed. Ilow wc stood with foreign land?, for one, he did not greatly care, lie denied that Democratic institutions were on trial. The trial is ended, and they stand crowned with victory. No European government, during peace, is as .strong and stable as the Government of the United States In the time of war. lie commended theaction of Secre tary Seward in sending back the British gold sent to this country for Confederate prisoners. lie said of Canada—if she has not a law strong enough to return the St Albans raiders, let her take a pen and write one. If the Florida was wrongly seized, let ns make reparation. l .Be said “our country right or wrong" was false doctrine and could not but be offensive to high heaven. Concerning affairs at home, be said, he believed in tbc words of Jackson: “The Union, itmnst and sball be preserved." From Lake Michigan to the GnlfofMcxlco,every inch of territory is ours, and by God's grace wc will govern It Lord Chat ham once sola ho would strip the shirt from bis back to sustain the government. We should not readers of the Chicago Timet to make that sacrifice, «ox many of them have not ashlrt to strip from their Hedldnotdoubt Disability of the country to pa* «>i e expenses of the war. He would require the government to pay ? VC *7A°emitted on the seas by British Confederate jj e PT)o v e of the case with which the debt eanffb*?* hi IJoiS dated. There was one debt thatconla JJj-j nnd that was the debtdae to those who down illustriously into death that the county might grow up illustriously into life. As an Abolitionist be advocated the abolition of tbc Electoral College. Abraham Lincoln was elected by a popular majority of 850,000- New \ ork was a close State aud Connecticut. Be had made an estimate aud found that if 70.000 votes had been distributed among all the close States, Geo. B. McClellan wonld have been onr next President. Be examined the peculiar doctrines of Mr. Vallaa dlghom, and said that the coercive power of our Constitution was based upon consent. Be saw breakers ahead in the doctrine of Stales rights. States ■were the necessary checks and ha*' ances upon the Government. The phrase “ State fcoverefraty” was a misnomer. the Constitution take* all that nonsense away. H- believed that if ten years ego we had had an; tloial currency we should not nave had the present rebellion. If Thomas Jefferson could See in the old articles of confederation the power to coerce a State, is there not the same power In the harder provis ions of the Constitution? He believed that the pestilent heresy of State’s Bights crept into the very name of our country. Be hoped that men in the course of time would forget the United States, and remember the Bepubllc. In reply to the sen timent that those who had been engaged In war could not live again in union, he said that people-quarrel and are yet thebest of friends when their quarrels arc over. Even the Journal of Comnurce % the bitterest and most violent of the opponents of the Administration, in looking at the long array of major! ties 'for Mr. Lincoln, and finding no comfort in the show of figures on their side, came out the next morning after election and said: We howto the verdict. That is to say. when a mill-stone falls upon a weasel, the gentle animal bows to the verdict.” [Laughter and applause.] It will be thus when the whole power of the Government falls upon the rattlesnake—the reptile will bow to the verdict. The marriage of the Sabine woman was given as an illustration. The speaker said the nation demanded, by a line of bayonets, to.be brought together in the marriage xf Liberty and Union. [Applause.] He wanted free speech, and the same free speech in Charleston ce in Chicago. His terms of peace were, 44 No State out of the Union, and no slave in it.” Hie position could be best Illustrated by three questions and their answers: Ist, What is It? War! Sd, Why is It? Slavery! 3d. What then? Extermination! He said if wc smite the rebellion by crushing out slavery it would soon be ended. Wc cannot crush insurrection and save slavery. One was dependent upon the other. How to end the war might, pernapg, he beat shown by an incident in the life of Alexander the Great, who—(after the late Major General McClel lan)—was prouably the greatest commander the world ever saw. He went forth to conquer in foreign countries, and thnee was called hack to put down rebellion athome. Perplexed, he asked if there were no sword shan> enongh to cut down the rebellion, was taught by an old mao who brought a leopard skin, and putting his foot on it in several places on the edge, unsuccessfully, at last put bis foot in the middle, and It stared down. So must wc put down this war so that it will stay down. Strike It at Blchroond, and it will np at Mobile; strike at Savannah, and it will np at Chat tanooga: hut strike it In Slavery, and it will stay down, like the epitaph, it would say: ** Hire In hopes of gotoe to Zion. Uf*s the landlord of toe Lion ; Ills wife resigned to God’s high will. Continues tbo same business still.” What therefore is the duty of the hour—it is that the popular verdict given at the late election bo ingrained Intotheorganlclawofthe land. The President favors it, the people demand It. Delays I arc dangerous. Write to your Congressmen and demon if that Congress shall not allow the op portunity to slip. God docs not multiply oppor tunities when tncpeople neglect chances. Jeffer son wrote the draft of a free Constitution for the State of Virginia, hut the Legislature which should have passed it neglected to meet, and Vir ginia, the mother of Presidents Is still the mother of slaves. Wc must purge the land of the vile abomination of Slavery by Constitutional amend ment, nnd it must be done now. He then told the following very apposite story, the hero of which was Wendell Phillips, the agitator: This dis tinguished orator, was riding in a railroad car, when be was addressed by a man of such rotun dity that be seemed to carry everything before him. Ibis man asked Mr. Phillips what was the object of life. * 4 To benefit the negro,” was the bland reply. “Well, then, why don’t yon go down South to do it?” 44 That is worth thinking of. I see a white cravat around your neck; pray, what is the object of your life f” 44 To save souls from hell.” 44 May I ask you whether von propose tocotheretodolt?” [lmmense applause.] What a record has gone opto the judgment book of this hellish system of slavery, which for gene ration after generation has sentnp its wailing cry for vengeance on the perpetrators of thfi fotU wrong. Seventeen thousand millions of dollars wasted from the purposes of peace. Ten thou sand families of Lancashire operatives made desti tute, a quarter of a million of. brave young men sent to the gates of death, a tax of three per cent and more to come —the canse of all this la slavery. Shall we not dig a crave wide and deep end bury it so securely that It cannot be resurrected. After to-night cornea the Fair. Having paid no money that evening they would be able to spend in the later part of this week. They would be able to spend a little at the Fair for those who share war sorrows, double our Joys, and quadruple our expenses, (laughter.) The women were the left wine of the army. There were more ways of re cruiting our army than one. There were two sol diers once in Grant's army, lying beneath their blankets looking np at the stars Ina Virginian sky. Says Jack: 44 What made you go into the army Tom ? ” 44 Wc11,” replied Tom, ,r I had no wife and Hove war.” 4 *What made you go to the war. Jack?” 44 WelL he replied, * 4 l had a wife,and I loved peace, to I went to the war.” (Laughter and applause.) He doubted not that among the fair faces be saw before him many bad contributed to swell the racks of the army in both ways. Well there was to be a Freedman's Fair, or Fair 1 for the benefit of the negro. He asked them for charity—the spirit of kindness, the offering of nlrp«- Had they always given the first he would not now ask them for the second; It was our own delinquencies in the past that had Induced and ne cessitated the call. It was good policy too to help the necto—tlis strongest man In the States, strong er than Lincoln or Grant; he put his arm around the North and around the South and crashed them together. His strength lav in his weakness, be cause it brought down Goa on his side. For years we had refused to work with the negro, and God had refused to work without him, hence God had networked with ns. We all profess to believe In the freedom, independence and equality spoken of In the Declaration of Independence, but we do not all bellcveln it; we eay to the man in the dust “ rise thou and be a man,” hut when his hluckfecowe recoil in disgust. He demanded not social equality, hut political equality; which every man boa before God and before the law. He want edtosectbls Nation look Into the face of a Negro and forget that he was black; the reformatory process of breaking down the prejudice against color most go on In the North as well as the South Tb« r 'both wanted trashing. There trcye Insults to hi inanity in the shape of placards still to he seen in the Northern cities of “Colored people nllovei In this car.” The speaker always rode In that car himself. lie wondered why the Almighty b d not lai ellod the world when he mode it “Col ored men Allowed on thi? planet.' 1 * The speaker then produced Hr. Jones' pom*' phlctonlhe Black of Illinois, and It was a disgrace to ns that those laws should ezis that a colored man could not testify against a white felon or rccclre Christian burial. If the black were inferior to the white, what then! In the family which child la it that we take most care off is U not the weakling, the cripple? Oh 1 beware lest, when Qod reach down His nand to give us a blessing, lie reach so low that Be shall miss ns who hold np our beads so high in pride. He will not forget them. He will hmig them np ont of the land of bondage; every one of those poor fellows will be received into the brotherhood of this nation. And how shau we greet them r TVc should strew roses under their feet, for they bear the blessed promise, u Inas much as ye have done it unto the least of these my brethren, ye have done it antoinc.” Eighty years ago we hang np—as did Lafayette in nls Gallic home—the bill of rights, and nndemeath It placed the Image of the white man; and we cannot rest till in the other niche we hang the hill of rights with the image of the black man beneath. Then shall be realized the song that was snog on the ad vent of the Redeemer—' 4 Peace on earth, good will towards men.” Hr. Tilton retired smldlond and oft-repeated cheers. The Band then gave forth another spirit stirring strain, and the meeting adjourned. 

ROBE AFFIDAVITS. Bribery and Corruption Charged Agalnrt Police Officer*—The Way to get Bcleaso from Arrest. Yesterday afternoon, a young man named Henry Ira Cress appeared before the Clerk of tbe Circuit Court end subscribed an affidavit, the substance of which will be found below. That affidavit was re peated before Justice Stanford, and a warrant is sued at a late hoar for the arrest of Robert Kenney, TTbOSC connfcpqq with qertam charges of bribery and corruption onr readers have not forgotten. At dark last night, Mr. Kenney had not been arrested. Amm turwtnmmnQn will doubtless be had this morn ing, we decline to comment. Mr. Cress being sworn states In substance as follows: That be was arrested on the Sth of De cember by officer Reed, taken to the Central Po lice Station, where be was searched by officer Reed, and 9750.35 cents taken from him and handed to Superintendent Turtle; that then Robt. Kenney, a detective, took charge of him, and while taking him to a cell told him he was a “ d d fool to be arrested by flats " (meaning Reed;) that he replied be had done nothing, and cared nothing about his arrest; that Kenney said on the way to the cell, that he wonld see abont getting bim and one Hathaway, who was arrested with mm, ont: that Kenney then said he was ac quainted with Hatheway: that affiant asked him if he knew Aim, to which Kenney replied that ho did not; that affiant then asked him what the charges were, and that Kenney replied “a soldier has been robbed on the train;’* that Kenney then went away, and after a while came hack and told affiant be must bo contented until he conld get the soldier ont of town; that affiant said he was not afraid of the soldier, as he . had done nothing; that Kenney then told affiant , that he wonld hare to seethe “old man" abont getting affiant and Hathaway ont, and that he wonld require some money to do It; that affiant said “go to work and get ns ont," to which Ken ney answered he must nave money; that affiant asked him If SSO wonld do; that Kenney replied that he wonld be d—d if be would work on SSO, but that he must have half of tbe money affiant had np stairs; that affiant refused to stand that earn, and Kenney then said that $373 was none too much to get both ont; that'affiant told Kenney that he had never seen Hathaway before, and mat he would only give SSO to get ont; that Kenney then pat affiant back in the cell, where he remained another day; that Kenney then talked with Hathaway.and Hath away came to affiant and tried to persuidc him to give Kenney $375; that Hathaway said that Kenney wonld pntnp a job on them and send them to jail If the money was not paid; that in the aiternoon Kenney came around to me cell and asked affiant if he was not going to pay $375 to get out, to which affiant replied he bad done nothing and wonld not stand it: that Kenney sold, “Get hack into the cell. I'll cire yon a trial and flx yon If yon don't pay.” Iliat then Kenney took Hathaway oot and talked with him, and Hathaway then told affi ant that Kenney was a detective and a “hard nut to bock against," and that if be did not pay the snm of $273 he would turn them over to the Provost Marshal, who would keep them three or four weeks whether there were any charge that conld ho ! proved or cot: that Kenney men asked affiant if | ne would pav $375, and on his refusal offered to ; take SSOO and let them go; that affiant told Kenney that he had $750 np stairs and if ho wonld leave ] him SSOO he might have the balance; mat ho j assented and said he wonld have boih ont mat af ternoon ; that Kenney, Webb and Reed men took I them before T. B. Brown, J. P., by whom they were discharged and affiant's money returned; that Kenney then asked themtogotoaphotograph j gallery and have their likenesses taken, anu that while there affiant paid him $240. ■ j Hathaway also corroborates the foregoing affi ; davit. AMUSEMENTS. “The Dead Beast."—'The meaning of that red heart which has crimsoned walls, fences and bul letins for a week past, was unfolded last night at McVicker’e theater. It is a lint-class sensation. Tbc programme styles it the intense drama. Let us rather call it the huge drama. It is a three act piece, with a“swelllngprologue to the imperial theme." Prologues are nuisances, and this is no exception to the general rule. It is a play which ■ takes the gallery by storm, and occasionally with some startling surprise carries offs victim In the pit, not to speak of emotional personages In the dress drcle.

The other characters were fairly cast Mackay as Jacques Legrand was excellent, and his action, especially at the delivery of the prisoners from the Bastile, very effective. Nagle, as the plotting, unscrupulous Abbe Latour, also made much of his character, and gave us some very good bits of acting. Myers was Myers, droll and whimsical as ever, and Mrs. Myers petite, pretty and vivacious. Mrs. Cowell, in the Countess, had the heavy, or as the programme styles It, the “In tense,” part to sustain, which was a little too much for her. She will, undoubtedly, improve it. however.

Go and sec it UnrrmT Concert. —The band of the Bth regi ment Veteran Eeservc Corps, will give a grand military concert at Smith & Nixon's new hall, on Wednesday evening, the filet upon which oc casion they will be assisted by Mrs. Battle Brown Miller, Baumbach, the pianist, and Herr Zirom, who is a whole brass bond and orchestra In him self. The programme will not bear the severe test of criticism, but it will drove both popular and at tractive. Mrs. Miller will sing an aria from Bos slni, the ballad 44 Were, where is the river, 4 ’and Gottschalk's well “Slumberon, Baby dear." with Banmbacb's excellent accompa niments. Zirom will give his unique performances of a Swiss air, with variations, and a military march, with imitations of a brass band in the dis tance. Mr. Gcyer, the leader of the band, plays “the Sounds from Home 44 and 44 Carnival or Ve nice,” while the bond do their share of the programme in the following pieces: The March from Faust: a Polonnalse, with introduction: the grand duo from Bellsario; an operatic medley; Saxonia Quickstep; closing with a medley of popular airs. We hope that the band will have an overflowing bouse and well filled pockets. They have nobly earned the grat itude of oor citizens by their generous and gratui tous attendance npon all occasions of charity. For the first three weeks they have been engaged every day in famishing music for some praise worthy object often times at their own expense. They should be handsomely rewarded therefor.

S_Mr. HENDRICKS, of Ind., prc«entcd’a petition «om lit CaUfon»J« K’ferenfifi to pre emption claims In that State, which was referred to the Committee on Public Lands. Mr. DOOLITTLE, ofWls., asked to have his resolution authorizing the President to expend ten millions of dollars for the defense of the frontier referred to the Committee on Naval Affairs. Mr. SUMNER, of Mass., suggested that it be re ferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations. Mr. DOOLITTLE, of Wls., hod no objections to such a reference. Mr. 

SUMNER said the qneation involved was al ready before Uie Committee on Foreign Relations. Mr. SHERMAN, of Ohio, said the reference to the Committee on Foreign AShirs would be the best that could be made. He hoped the Commit tee would report speedily upon the subject of the Scncral defense of the border. There was a great eal of anxiety on the subject of border defense, and be hoped It would l>e acted upon promptly. Mr. JOHNSON, of Md., said It was immaterial to what committee the resolution was referred; cither of the committees named could not consider the subject properly. If these raids were com mitted there was no doubt that under the law of nations the parties could be arrested within the limits of the United States, or pursued into the adjoining territory. lie believed that right to be settled as definitely as any other question in inter national law. It was under that provision that the excellent patriotic soldier. Gen. 3lx, Issued an order authorizing bis officers to pursue these men if they crossed th« i»ordc*, »*a» bo (Johnson) mu ' fiy the papers that the President of the United States and the Secre tary of State were better Informed, be supposed as to v\ hat would be the course of the hose Gov ernmcnf.and they bad directed Gen. Dix to res .tad that part of his late order. The country was a good deal excited by the release of the St- Albans raid ers. lie bad no doubt that tho Canadian Judge acted honestly in the matter, believing that be had no jnrhdlction. That this decision was erron eous, he, (Mr. Johnson) was satisfied from the time it was announced. He was no\v further sat isfied, because he saw the Colonial Gov ernment hod pronounced it erroneous, and bod dl cctcd tho Issue of writs for the re-arrcst of the raiders. Whether that arrest could be made was doubtful, but be, (Johnson) bad no doubt the whole power of the Colonial Government would be united to prevent tucb raids In future. Still It was, perhaps, proper lor the Senate to Like every possible precaution to prevent the repetition of snch acts, and to enable us to vindicate ourselves, cither within our own limits or across our frontiers. These raids could never be tolerated by the United States,and never should be tolerated. Mr. 

DOOLITTLE said tho piratical expedition hy land, which might bo organized oml carried oat if things were permitted to go on as they bad on the Canadian frontier, wonld Be disastrous to the lives and property of oar citizens: bat any land expeditions that coaid be organized were as nothing compared with what might bo the result, should the rebels be able to get hold of vessels on the bays around Lake Duron, pat cannon on board of them, and all the enginery of war, to de> strov our cities on the lakes, it would enable them to lay the cities of Chicago, Milwaukee, and other cities in ashes. There was no way which we could prevent their passage through the Straits of Mackinac, therefore the Senate ought to put it in the power of the President to build Coat ing batteries to defend the Straits of Mackinac and the lakes. Mr, Doolittle continued, “I hope for one that the Canadian Government and authori ties are interested !o tho determination to prevent in futnre any further hostile or piratical incur sions from those provinces Into the United States; bnt If they do not prevent them wc all know what the consequences will be—War. God grant It may be averted. 1 hope and trust that it may. 1 will labor and do air in my power consistently with the honor and integrity of the country to prevent it, and to preserve tho peace of the Government, and- to save civilization and the world from the great shock which mast follow war between the United States and Great Britain; butif the terrible necessity, through their neglect, or smothered hostility, must come, let It come. We will end tho question when It docs come by perfect free trade between the United States and Canada, and put on end to the jurisdic tion of Great Britain in any of her province of North America. 1 desire no war. On the contra ry I wonld do all that reasonably can be done to prevent it. I believe it can be prevented, but the wisest way to prevent it is to bo prepared for any contingency that may arise. I hope me resolution may be referred to the Committee on Foreign Re lations. Mr. 

SUMNER. The question before the Senate is simply in reference to the-bill. It is a question of the order of business. Now, looking at its character, itlsplaiu that it concerns primarily and essentially foreign relations. It is this circum stance thatgivea to it a peculiar interest. If it concerned merely the levy of troops, or the build ing of new forts, or a change in our commercial policy, there wonld have been little question with regard to it, nor would the Senator from Wiscon sin hare accompanied its Introduction witli re marks calling attention to the on su Albans. 1 assume it then, that it relates to our foreign relations, and therefore, ac cording to the usage, should be referred to the Committee having charge of that subject. This is all 1 have to say on the subject of reference; but the Senate will pardon me If 1 glance for one mo ment at tbo outrage to which the Senator referred. Only a few weeks ago, the village of St. Albans, in Vermont, wan disturbed by a band of murder ers, highwaymen, housebreakers, horse-thieves and robbers, coming from Canada. After break ing open the Bonk and obtaining a certain amount of spoil by the murder of a citizen, they succeed ed in making their way to Canada, where they de clared themselves to be agents of the rebel Gov ernment. Such are the main facta. Now, Mr. President, does any one suppose that these agents of the rebel Government were moved to their en terprise merely by considerations of plunder— that they risked everything merely to rob a bank or steal a horse? No such thing. Tbcir-object was much higher and more far reaching. In one word it was to embroil the Government of the United States with the Gov ernment of Great Britain. I cannot doubt that this was their object: to my mind it is as plain as day. These agents, or rather tho men behind them, who set them on, knowing the sensitiveness of onrpeople,andbow naturally they would be aroused against the foreign country in which the enterprise bad Its origin, they saw excitement, anger, and passion on onr part were inevitable. That ont of this some complication or collision might ensue; that any snen complication moat necessarily help the rebellion more than a victo ry on the field of battle. All this they saw, and acted accordingly. The whole proceeding was a trap in which to catch the Government of this country. It was hoped that in this way tho rebel lion would gain the powerful British Intervention which would help to restore its fallen fortunes. For myself, sir, I am determined not to be caught In any such trap. .There are many things which Great Britain has done since the outbreak of onr rebellion, which, to my mind are most un friendly, bnt I am unwilling that anything should be done on our side to furnish any seeming apol ogy for that foreign intervention which has been so constantly menaced, and which was foreshad owed in the most hasty and unjustifiable cession of ocean belligerency to rebel slave mongers, who bad not a single port or prize court Nobody sees the wrong we have Buttered more clearly than X do butlsee other things. .While never ceasing to claim onr Just rights and reminding this power always of duties which it has plainly neglected, I can not forget that wo are engaged at this moment in a war for the suppression of a long continued and most virulent rebellion, which has thus for tasked our best energies. To xhis work let ns now dedi cate ourselveswilhoutarousing another,through whose alliance the rebellion may be encouraged and strengthened. Let us put down the rebel lion : do this, and we shall do everything. Meanwhile 1 trust the Senate will not be moved by passion Into any hasty action on any Ox tho measures now before it, but that each will be con sidered carefully and calmly on Its merits accord ing to the custom of Ibis body. This surely is the dictate of prudence, and 1 cannot doubt that it is the dictate of patriotism. - Mr. 

SHERMAN said: The gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Sumner) had neglected to mention the capture of the steamers on Lake Erie by rebels from Canada, and the Diet that they hoist ert the rebel flig and kept U flying several hpura. The plot was sfio to seize the steamer Michigan, bat it tolled. Had they succeeded all onr lake cities could have been placed under tribute. Mr. Shennan detailed the plot at length, and pictured the consequences of its success, and the fear of its repetition. He then referred to . the Reciprocity Treaty, and said that for ten years the rnopleof the Northwest have believed themselves robbed by that treaty, tat would not have mowed in the matter had they not found ( that Canadians had been harbounng rebel ptralJS. A new feeling bad sprung up anc tho people of the borderwooldprotectanddercndthemaelvcs. Mr. Sherman regroted the rovocatlo* of Dixs order, as he believed the spirit of tire erder was tho only way to meet these marauders.

That committee to whom this bill shall be referred will make as ear ly a report as practicable npon the subject, for ■ asbaabeen Justly observed by the Senator from Ohio, there is great anxiety along the frontier. We are hourly In danger of a repetition of these raids and outrages, which have been so frequently committed npon peaceful citizens of the border. I think it is high time there should be an expres sion of opinion, and of feeling, on the part of the . Congress of the U. S., at least by way of remonstrance against these raids and outrages to which I have referred. Wc most, in order to keep peace along the bor der, show onr power. The lion must show bis teeth on this side of the border, and teach these men who have been harboring these rebel vipers In their bosoms, that even Canada with Its pre tended neutrality, cannot bo permitted to bo a place of refuge for such characters. 1 desire to say tills much on this occasion—when another oc caslonshall present Itself I shall go more extend edly Into the consideration of the subject, Mr.
