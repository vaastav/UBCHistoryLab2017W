never saw so deep a1 show as fell last week this early In the winter but the writer remembers a snow that fell on the same day of the same month 1862 during tho Civil War and < thinking an Incident that oc curred on that day would be oqn tenet to your many readers I will give a brit sketch of same It is known that Dr J EL Penile ton raised > a company in Hartford and left for the South early jn 1861 and that his company formed Com pany C of the 9th Ky Regiment of the Orphan Brigade After a hard campaign In Mississippi in the sum mer of 1862 we were ordered to Ten nessee and In the fall were camped at Murfreesbor0 Gen Morgan learn ed that there was a brigade of Fed erals camped at Huntsville Tenn and laid a plan to capture them Gen Breckenrldgo was in command at Murfreesboro so Morgan called on him for two regiments of Infant ry to go with him on the raid The 2d and 9th Ky Regiments were or dered to make the trip and on the 4th day of December 1862 atone oclock In the midst of a hard snow storm we were marched out the Lob anon pike followed by Morgans cav alry to parts unknown to us At night we camped at Beards Mill It snowed hard all night and next morning the boys were covered with snow but It was rumored that we were marching back to Kentucky and the thought of seeing our old Kentucky home overshadowed all the hardships and by sunup we were on the march again Now the dis tance from Murfreesboro to Hunts wille was 60 miles We marched all day and night and crossed the Cum berland river at three oclock on the morning of tho 6th of December One mile from the Federal damp It i was planned to take them bysur prlio so we wore moved at doubt a quick until in sight of their camp TJjey had received Howe of our com Inn acid were Inline dot battle wait Ittor us

Morgans cavalry moving for ward followed by the 2d Ky which engaged them at short range They were holding their own well when the 9th Ky was ordered forward The boys raised a yell and started at a double quick and made one fire when their line broke We ran them back to the river where they surenderedThus Thus In one hour we had won the victory and taken the whole brigade prisoners comprising 2000 men and a battery of artillery We took what we could carry of their camp equip age and burned the balance We took our prisoners across the river horaeback making three and four ride a homo at the
