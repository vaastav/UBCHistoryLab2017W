Nearly all newspa per editorsrect ive tor publication inuch mre of what i sometimes called poetry than met can Cod ritber room or readers fur. Some of this so-called poetry does n't rise to the dig nity and merit of respectable doggeral. We bare received from a love stricken corrrspon dent at a distance a batch of rhymes of pre cisely this description. To that e rreson dent we desire to gay one friendly word, and as it is intended solely for bis bent-fit. we trost be will receive it in the' same friendly spirit. - -Z"I In the first place, "Rodolph," your "poe try is not su'ied to oar column?, if, indeed, it is sailed to anybody'. We would not willingly wound yonr eeu4lHlities ; but iraib. fl:ly spoken, is aiwaye wholesome, especially to the young, and it it evident that yu at e not yet old not as old as you will be in a few years, at any rate. Ton must therefore permit ns to ay that this ia not poetrjr "Them art dear to ma ; thy lmaga bright Wy beart shall keep in its shnne, Till Gabriel's awfu trump shall sound To strike tba do- ot tf me." And we mutt further say, that if "Sallik' is as rensible a girl as the general ruu of Sal- liks are, she will think none the better of your love for bring told of it in such rhjmes Bitidea, yoa planter it on too thick by half. In all probability that heart of your?, whiwe constancy is. we will admit, all you represent it to be, will be incapable of keeping any sort of an image long before the little mimi cal affair to which you allude comes off; unless, indeed, ihere is more foundation for the belief of the Hitlerites than the peace ol the pnblic mind would eeem to demand. And as the "Doom of Time" has never, to our kjow ledge, done either Gabkirl or bin Trump an iuteniional wrong, we can't help tbiukiug tbat the strike" to which you ref-r would be cruel and uncalled-for, to say the leat or iL One more word, "Rodolph." and we fball have done. "A distinguished cateier" has said that some men are born great ; some achieve greainos, and fome have gmttnei. thrust upon them. We will say. merely for the sake of argument, tbat you were not horn great ; and further, merely for the sake of truth, tbat you have not had, and are not likely to hrve. greatn- s thrust npon you ; hence, if yoa are to become great you must achieve tbat greatness. We would advi-e you t- do so by all means. But if you at tempt to accomplish your tl jct by writing poetry, you will find in the eud tbat jou have taken the wrong road.

SiKin after ward, on the 8 b ot June, 17b7, wh n incid-ntally adverting to tbe sub j el, he said nay Gvei um-'ut for the United States (oruitd on tbe sup osed pi acticabiiiiy ol using force again -t the cons:itu(ioual pro ceedings of- the Slates, would prove as vis ionary and fallacious ha ibe Guwiomeut of C 'esrress, evident! meaning tbi then exist-in-i, Congtess ot tin; ol I Ctnf-dwation Without d -siriur to p.iriicularize, it may be safely asserted that tlie jiotver to make war against a State, U at varunce wiib lbe wbtd-sp rit and intent of tbe Constitution.' S ipposr such :i war would result iu the co i qirtu;a State, how ar we to jro.ern it uferward? Shall we bold it as a Province and ern it by despotic poivei? In the nt lure of ibiugs we could not, by pnyical foree. control tlie whr.le of tbe people aud compel ibeiu toileCt Senators and Representatives to Congiess. and. to perform all tbe other duties, depending upou thirowu vlitiou and require from the free citiz of a free State a? a consiitu-nt member T the Con federacy. But it wt p ss hed this power, would it be wise to exeicis it uuder existing circumstances? The obj-ct" would doutles be to preserve the Union. War would uot only present tbe most eff. Ctual means of de stroying it, tiut would banish all hope ot its peaceable reconstruction; bestd'-s in the fra ternal confl ct, a contest of blot d and treas ure would Ixi expected, rendering further re conciliation between the States impossible. In the meantime who can foret.dl what would be the sufferings aud privations of the people duriug its existence. But may I Le permitted sol mnly to Invoke my country men to pun-, aud deliberate before they de term ne to destr y thi-, the grandest temp e which has i ver been dedicat d to bum m freedom since the world tiegin. It hs been consecrated by tbe blood of our fathers, by the glories of the past and by lbe hopes nf tlie future. The Union has already made ut. tke mot prosperous and ere loug will if preserved render ns trie most powerful na tion on the tace of tbe earth. Iu every for eiga region of the Globe, the title ol "Amer ican Citizi n" is b Id iu tbe highest respect, aud wbeti pronouiic d in a foieign land, it ca ses tbe hearts ot our cou u try men to swell titb honest prid ; surely when we reach the brink ot tbe yawning aby-a we shall recoil wita ho-ror from the last laul p.unge. By Mich u dread catastrophe, the hopes ot th trieuds f trei-dota throughout the world would be destroyed, axtd a loug night of leaden despotism would eushioud tbe na tions. - Oar ixtmplefor more than highly years would not only be lost, but it woeIU be quo ted as a conclusive proof that maa is uufli for self g veriiuaeut. Ii is not every wrong. nay. it is uot ev ry grievou.s wrong wnw:i can justify a resort to such a fertl a4tr- lative. TbK ought to ue me last aesp raie renndy of a despairing people, alur every oibr coa.-tiiutiottitl means ot coiicilialioti bad been exhausted. We should refl -ct tbut uuder this free goveromuut there is an inces- saut ebb uud ujw iu puuiio opiniwti. me slavery quemiou, like tveiytbiug human, wtll have Us day. X ti'.m'j believe tnai u ua already reached aud pas-ed tbu culinlnaiing point, but if in the-midst of the existing ex citement, tbe Uiiiou sUali petlb, lbe ev.l may then ljco:iie irreparable. Gougress can contribute much to avoid it by propos ing and recommending to ibe Legislatures of several Slates the "remedy for existing evils, which lbe CouSi.il ntion has itself pro-vid-i for its own preservation. This has been tried aid iff. rent critical periods of our history, and always with nauent succes.-. It is to be found iu the fifth Hrticle. provi ding f r its own aineadtneut. Uuder this ar ticle atcendments have been pmposed by two-tbitds of loib houses of Cogtes, ahd have been ratiB. d by the L gujl.ttures ol tbree-fourtbs of tbe several S ates, uud have cousiqiu ntly become parts of tbe Constitu tion. To this process th-country ieiudeb ed for lbe clause prohibitiug Cungrtss from passing any laws respeotiag an establishment of relieion. of abridging the freedom ot speech or of the presa, or of the right of pe tition. Though we are also indebted for the rights which secures the people against any aouse of power by the Federal Government, such wete the apprehensions justly enieriained by tbe friends of State Riyhls at that period us to have rendered it extremely doab.lul whether tbe Constitution could have long survived without these ainendnieuts. Agaiu tbe CuiiEtituiion was hiu uued by tbe same urocess. after the election ol" President Jell' r- son bv the Ilou-e of Representatives iu Feb ruary, 1803 This am-ndmeut was rendered necessary to prevent 'be re-occurrence of tbe dangers wbicb had seriously threatened tbe existence ot the Government during tbe pen dency of tbat election, lbe action lor lis own ameudut -tit was intended to secure tb utu cable udjasim' nt of conflicticg constitut tioual aues.Uons like lbe preseut, which nugu arise between tbe Government of tbe Slates aud that of the Uuited States. This appears from contemporaneous history ia this con section. : - ; "., , I thall mereiy ca st'eotiou to a few sen tences in Mr. Madison tft isi If eelebtatd re port iu 1779, to tbe Legislature of Virginia. In this be ably and conclusively defended the resolutions of tbe preceding Legislature araiuei tbe Btricuresol several otber Sta-e Legislatures. Tbede .were mainly founded npon the protest of the Virginia Legislature aifaiust tbe Alu-n and Sedition acts, as pal pable and alarming infractions of the Con stitution. Ia poiutiug to tbe peaceful aad Coos iiutioaai remedies, and be referred to ooue others, to which the States were autho rized to resort ou such occasions, he con cludes by saying tbat tbe Legislatures of tbe States might have made direct repreoeuU- tiou to Cougress witb a view lo obtun a re scinding of the two offensive acts, or tbey miiiht have represenud to tbiir respective Seuaiors in Cmirress, their wish tbat two- thiids tiiereol would have proposed na ex planatory amendment to tbe Constitution, or two-third of laeuiselvea. n suuo naa oeen their option, might by an applicati on to Couifress, have obtained a coaveuti in for the same object. This is tbe very course wbicb 1 earnestly 'rueomuieud in crd r to obtain an explanatory amendment of lbe Constitu tion uu th subject ol slavery. This might originate witb Cougresa or the Stite Legis latures, as may be deemed moxt advisable to obtain tbe object. Tbe explanatory amend ment nvebt tK- connned to the final settie- mtsut of ibo true cousti uotiou of ta Cousii- lutiou on three special points. First An express recognition of the rights of property in staves In tbe states which uow exi't or may hereafter exist, Second The duty of protecting this right iuall common tern toru s tarougboul tbe territorial existence, and uuttl tbey s.iall be adutilted as Stales tuto tbe Uuion, with or wit bout i-lavery, as their couatituiion may 't urescnbe.' j . Third A like recognition of the right of A ibe waeur lo have his slave, wbobas escaped lrom oue Stale to auotber, restored aud de livered up to him. aud of lbe validity of tbe fugitive slave law ' enacted lor this purpose; loije.htr w.ib a declaration tbat ail Sute fiA impairing or debatlug this light are -1 mi..,t . rr.,..;..,!.... ,r.A " " wuw.t.i.i.t.M, auu -.t. wuu l sequeuily nutl and void,.... h -1 cted that this construct ion settled ! ... . . . by tbe Supreme Court of the Uuited State. and what more on gut to be required. Tbe answer. is tbat. a very large, proportion ot the people ot tbe Cuiied Staies, still contest tbe correctness l this decission and never willeeaoe from 'agitation, and admit iu be ing ia force until clearly establiBbed by the people of tbe several States in their - sover eign 'Character.
