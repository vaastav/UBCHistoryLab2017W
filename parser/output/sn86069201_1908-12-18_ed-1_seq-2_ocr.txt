us that the establish ment or Postal Savings Bank by the National Government would mani test bad faith on the part pr the Gov ernment since It publicly declares that those National Banks passing under its scrutiny are worthy ot pub j lic confidence yet In the same com munity the savings Bank would bid for the deposits Again the operation 01 a bank Is a local matter and the In terference of the Government would reveal the worst form of the Central ization of power and wurst of all it opens the way to fraud by making deposits exempt from legal process There are other objections which we propose to give later Tho World congratulates Edward II Harrtuian on Ills accurate and de tailed advance knowledge ot the Pre sidents message His coQdenco has been abundantly vindicated The President message to Congress recom mends rthe very thing which I sug gested and which Mr Harrlman was so confident that It would recommend In Mr Roosevelt opinion The rail roads of the country should bo put completely under the Interstate Com merce Commission and removed from the domain of the antitrust law It would then be lawful for Mr Morgan Mr Harriman Mr Rockefeller Mr J Hill and Mr Gould In the manlpula lion of their railroad properties to do anything that an Interstate Commerce Commission composed of political hacks permitted them to doNew York World lnd Dom Distributing gifts at this season r manifests the beauties of tho soul An attempt to make others happy re veals a ndblo trait of character whIch Is In marked contrast with the cold sordid and selfish heart which Is not moved by the joy which flows from a grateful soul on receiving a token ol remembrance The spirit of Riving If akin to that spirit with which tin world was Imbued when the windows of Heaven were openedGod descended took upon himself the flesh of man and gave living force to the expres sion lilt Is more blessed to give that to receive Tho approaching season Is Intended to celebrate the birth 01 how to give 1 the Christ who taught us by giving up tho glories of Heaven and oven his own life to make us hap py There Is then no wonder that all Christian nations take part In this celebration By common consent all nations have celebrated the birth ol their statesman and their military heroes and yet their combined effort have never done any good for man kind when compared with the Heav en born scheme ot human redemption Let us conform our lives to this spirit by sowing kind words and reepluj smiles instead of sowing angry words and reaping frowns May our lives emulate that spirit which came Iron I I the courts of Glory 1008 years ago I and shed Its beauty and llfeglvlni Ir power over the spiritual world as the great orb ot day sheds Its efTulgcn beams throughout the physical world The

Kentucky Especial attention was given to the discussion of the new school law and Its points at excellence Much wa said also with reference to the County High Schools Every county In the state Is to have at least one Hlgl School and the first one to be located In each county will be at the county seat However the County School Board Is permitted to make arrange ments with the trustees of any

are perhaps fifty pupils In Garrard County who are now ready to risk for admis sion to the High School and ln four years time there should be double this number It Is probable that the County School Board will seek to enter them Into the Lancaster High School These pupils will bring a considerable turn of money into tho town In way It board etc Besides many families will want to move Into town
