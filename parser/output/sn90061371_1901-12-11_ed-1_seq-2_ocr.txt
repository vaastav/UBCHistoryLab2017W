Will Give Ten Million Dollars to Endow a National Univer sity at Washington. GOVERNMENT TO BE THE CUSTODIAN. Tae Amount Named Would Pat the In stitution at Onee Upon a Level With Yale or Harvard In Point of Wealth, and Add Largely to the Prestige ol the National Capital. Washington, Dec. 10. The Wash ington Post to-day will say: "Presi dent Roosevelt has received a letter from Andrew Carnegie in which the latter offers to make a donation of $10,000,000 to the United States. The letter will be referred to congress by the president in a special message." Mr. Carnegie's gift is for the pur pose of establishing in Washington a university for higher education. As far as his idea has been developed, it proposes a gift after the manner of the bequest of James Smithson, the Englishman who gave $1,000,000 for the establishment and maintenance of what is now known as the Smith sonian institution. Smithson de sired the institution founded by him to be "a factor in the diffusion ot scientific knowledge." Mr. Carnegie proposes that the university which ha is to endow shall be the greatest in stitution in the world for the devel opment of higher education. He has consulted President Gilman of Johns Hopkins university; President Had ley of Yale, President Eliot of Har vard, former President White of Cor nell, and all the leading educators of the country. They heartily indorse his plans. The proposed university will not interfere in the least with the educational institutions already established, but will supplement them, for according to the present plan, its doors will be open to those who de sire to take up a post graduate course. Mr. Carnegie also wants the new university to take the lead in original research, so that the United States can eventually stand side by side with Germany, if not excel that nation in scientific development. Mr. Carnegie's plan does not pro pose a national university in the sense that an appropriation will be asked or needed. The government is simply to be the trustee of the mag nificent endowment, just as it admin isters the fund bequeathed by Smith son. It is probable that a board of regents will be appointed, as in the case of the Smithsonian institution, or it may be that the government will be represented upon the board of di rectors, which, it, is contemplated, shall consist of men of national repu tation. Mr. Carnegie has kept the proposed endowment a secret until he could definitely arrange the plan and scope of the new university. Even yet, all the details have not been arranged, so that little more than the outline of his gift can be published. It is known, however, that he does not propose to ask from congress a single foot of land upon which the univer sity buildings will be constructed. The entire expense is to be borne out. of his endowment. No site has yet been selected. It will, however, nec essarily be very large, as it is pro posed to erect a series of magnificent structures. The amount of money to lie given by Mr. Carnegie equals the sum of the present endowment fund of Harvard, and is considerably more than the invested fund of Yale. With the Catholic university, the Methodist university and the pro posed Carnegie university, Washing ton will be the educational center of the country.

MH II A Misapprehension Caused a Ron On the City Savings Bank of Omaha, Neb., Monday. 

DEPOSITORS ALL GOT THEIR MOXEY. The Rnn Started trader the Impres- alon That the Bank waa Connect ed With m Concern Which, waa Reported on Satarday to Be la Financial Dlfllealty. Omaha, Neb., Dec. 10. There was a considerable number of depositors of the City savings bank present to with draw their money when the doors of that institution opened Monday morn ing, owing to a belief that the sav ings bank was connected with the Omaha Loan, Land and Trust Co., which was reported, Saturday, to be in financial difficulty. Four tellers paid the depositors as fast they pre sented their books,but many of them, on learning that the bank had be come segregated from the trust com pany, returned and again deposited their money. The bank officials were prepared for the run, and had great piles of gold on the counters with which to pay the uneasy depositors. "The run is due solely to the wrong impression that the savings bank is connected with the Omaha Loan, Land and Trust Co.," said Vice-President Flack. "There is no connection whatever between the two companies, but as the owners and officers of the City savings bank, a short time ago, bought the savings bank department of the Omaha Loan, Land and Trust Co., and is occupying the offices for merly occupied by it, a number of persons do not yet realize that the two institutions are entirely separate and distinct. "While there is absolutely no cause for the run," continued Mr. Flack, "the City savings bank is prepared to meet any demands that may be made, and will pay promptly every deposi tor who presents his book."
