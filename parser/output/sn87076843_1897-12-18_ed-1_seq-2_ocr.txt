Whllo driving on one of tlio city streets his whip lash caught nrouml one of tho wings of tho bird whoso fluttering1 caused tho lnsh to curl around tho driver's neck. It was necessary to cut the lnsh In order to clear tho dove, which was taken home a captive. Tiik outdoor life of girls and women In recent years is beginning to show In statistics. Consumption, once thu .scourge of New Englnnd's girlhood, Is found to be decrcnslng. The Medical News says that the number of deaths of females by pulmonary diseases In Massachusetts is now less than tho deaths of males by these diseases. It required fiOO hands to make tho bridal veil of the l'rinccss Margaret of Prussia. It was composed of 500 dif ferent pieces, all the work being dono with tho needle. The several pieces, each of which required ten days for completion, were joined by tho most skillful lnec makers In a pattern which appeared to bo all the work of tho same hands. Down to as late as the middle ages, cats were comparatively scarce in Europe, and were so highly prized that any person who killed onu was obliged to pay a fine. This penalty sometimes was required to be paid In the shapo of a pile of wheat big enough to cover the slain nnimnl when it was held vertically by the tip of its tail, tho nose touching tho ground. The Interesting fact is brought out in connection with Boston's "gala week" that 2,302,394 people live within 60 miles of the state house. This is a concentration of population within equal limits which is exceeded only in the case of New York and adjacent ter ritory. Philadelphia comes next, with a CO-mile limit population of 3,'2S9,81-ls Chicago third, with' 1,783,535, and SU Xiouis fourth, with 874,480. Ah association of business men in Chicago has been formed to oppose tho department store. One of the schemes under consideration is that the small re tailers unite in forming a purchasing syndicate which will enable them to obtain their goods as favorably as tho department stores, and a syndicato plan for advertising which will give small dealers all the advantages ob tained now by the large establish ments. In the United States court at Pawneo the other day four Pawnee chiefs were gran ted divorces from their wives on the ground of gross neglect Pipe Chief testified that his wife wanted to pend all his money on fine dresses, and that she sought to ignore all of the Indian customs. The final straw was laid when she refused to attend the sun dances on the ground that she -wouldn't associate with squaws who were dirty. Mixing white Indian corn meal with flour and selling it as pure flour has become so general in tho south that the Georgia legislature has passed a bill requiring the words "mixed flour" to be branded on each package con taining a blending of wheat and tho cheaper corn flour, and show what pro portion of the contents is wheat and what is flour. Steps are also being taken towards similar protective legis lative action in South Carolina. Japan promises to become an im portant market for American bread ctuffs. Until recently, the use of wneat as an article oi met was ex tremely limited in Japan, but gradual ly increased in favor after once being introduced. Last year Japan imported nearly 32,000 bushels of wheat and tho import for this year will be much greater, the imperial government hav ing adopted wheat flour as a portion of the army and navy supplies. The action of the government is certain to bring Hour into general use in Japan. Another cause of agitation in social circles as to whether the wives of eabi--net ministers shall, while assisting Mrs. McKinley in receiving guests at the white house evening receptions, stand or sit. It is announced that Airs. McKinley will sit while receiving guests, as she is not strong enough to stand for two hours and shake hi'.ads, us the wives of other presidents have done. The cabinet ladies would now like to have some one come along and tell them whether they ought to stand or sit in their place in the line. Pnop. Galloway, chief of tho division of vegetable pathology and physiology of tho department of agriculture, is nhortly going to Uermuda to study there the Bermuda lily. Tho peoplo of tho United States pay annually 2,000,000 for Bermuda lilies, and it is thought that this amount of money may bo saved by the introduction of that plant intu this country. Prof. Galloway has been very hard at work lately and the vibit will be something of a recreation as well as one of duty. lie is one of the foremost scientists in liis line in the world. To qazk at tho inhabitants of tho moon is the latest ambition of French astronomers. Their faith in the possi bility of such a vision is pinned to tho monster telescope now in construction ior the exposition of 1000. Iteside this gigantic machine all telescopes as jot an existence will seem as mere pigmies. It is asserted that with this exposition telescope visitors to tho great fair will be enabled to distinguish the inhab Hants of the moon, if such exist, for the lenses of the enormous iiibtrumuut -will ba strong enough to enlarge tho noon to a sizo of at least 30 incites in diameter. ,XJ.i...XXX..XXXXXt,JVAAlry i

Nancy Allison McKinley, the aged mother of president McKinley pnssed away at 2:08 o'clock Sunday morning. The nation's chief executive, the son whom she had lived to see In the white house, was at her bedside for hours before the end came. The mother passed away with her hand in his, hut the end was marked by the unconsciousness thnt denotes pnrnlysls from acute old age. Tho death scene was a touching nnd impres sive one. The members of the McKin ley family, including children, grand children nnd other relatives, wero grouped about the bedside, and ns tho hours of the night wore on it wns re alized that the sufferer could not live until daylight. President McKinley was a constant attendnnt nt his mother's side, nnd vninly tried to secure some signs of recognition. Shortly nfter midnight n change was noticed in the condition of the fast sink ing pnticnt, nnd those who watched tho tlickerlng of the vital spnrk saw that the end was at hand. The deep, palsied sleep hi which she had Inin for hours grew more deathlike. Physicians and relatives could do nothing but wntch for the tlnnl flight of the spirit. The president held one withered hnnd in both his own. nnd bent low over the fnce of the dying woman. At eight minutes past two there came a sigh, nnd the breath, hardly noticeable for hours, reused. Nancy Allison McKinley waB dend. About the sacred couch, now the bier of the mother who had rounded out n long life of usefulness, were the chil dren nnd other relatives.

McKinley, his wife, Mr. Ahner McKinley, Mrs. Duncan nnd Miss Helen McKinley. children of the nged womnn whose life breath hnd been hushed forever, whose tongue hnd tnken on the eternnl palsy. The nged sister wns there, Mrs. Abigail Osborne, the only one of the Allison fnmily now living. Mrs. Bowman, of Lorain; Misses Grace and Mnbel McKinley. James Mc Kinley, Miss Duncan and Jnck Duncan, grandchildren, were all In the sad party that witnessed the last breath of the noble parent. The end came without a struggle. It wns a sleep whose signifi cance could not be mistaken. President McKinley remnined nt the bedside for nn hour or more, and wns then ptrsuad ;d to tokc some rest from his long and pninful vigil. It is n coincidence that Mrs. McKinley died at nlmost the identical hour of the day as did her husband on Thnnksgiv ing five yenrs ago. President McKinley remnined up until about 3:30 o'clock, a lit tie more than nn hour after the death, nnd then retired for a few hours sleep. During the forenoon he and his broth er spent the greater part of nn hour walking about the more secluded streets near home, securing much needed exercise nnd fresh air. The pres ident was greatly refreshed by the ex perience, although even before he seemed little the worse physically for the trying ordeal of the past days, dur ing which, except when he went to Wash ington to nttend to official duties, he kept nn almost constant vigil at the bedside of hi? mother.
