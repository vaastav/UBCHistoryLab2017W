A Call on tng Public Printer.?Senator Johnston, chairman of the Senate commltteeon agriculture, intends to Introduce a resolution calllrg upon the public printer to explain whyhe has not printed the agricultural report for t*79. It is said then? is great complalut from agriculturists that they have not receive! this report. In the IIoi-sk yesterday, after The Stir r. port eloped, debate was continued on the Senate concurrent resolution as to the elector! i count. Air. Robeson making the prinoipi Sp<'^Cll. Thk Hocse I'ostm astershtr.?a caucus of democratic Representatives was held after the i adjournment, for the purpose of ntming a suc! cessor to the late postmaster of the Hou=;e, Mr. Stewart. The names of three candidates wcv submitted, and a formal bailor, resulted in tho selection of A. W. C. Nowlln, of Carroll county, \a.. th'n present assistant po-t master, he receiving ci votes: George C. Wedderburn, of ! W ashlngton city. 32; Silas Carr. 10. The rrfpubj liran caucus last night unanimously agreed that the republican rote for postmaster or the House shall be given to ex-I\>atina-iter Sherwood. All of ttie Memeeks of the House committee on appropriations are now in the eirv, and the several sub committees are hard at work pre paring the several appropriation bills. General grant.?The bill Introduced ia the House by Gen. McCook. of N. V., yesterday to place Gen. Grant on the retired list or the army provides "that in recognition or the eminent services of U. S. <;rant, late general of the army, and ex-President of the United states the President be and he is herebv authorized to place him upon the retired list of the army- with the pay and rank of general." The bill was referred to the committee on military affairs. The Prevailing Sentiment among members of Congress Is to have a short holiday recess The talk is to adjourn over from Fridav, the j 24th of December to Monday tlie 3d ot January. The Republicans ok tuk Hou=k held a caucus last night. Mr. Hlscoek, of New York, offered a resolution that, tn view of the large and manifest!} decisive majority of the electoral votes lor the republican candidate?, there Is no danger that, any attempt will b j made to Jft aside the result of the elecilon by au Improper use of the proposed regulations, aul that therefore the republicans of the House should abstain from prolonged opposition, and content themselves with reeorduig their votes a^airst the electoral resolution. Mr. Hiseock supported the resolution in a speech. Judge Lapham, of New York, contended that It would be unwise. Improper and possibly unsife to yield without a struggle to the democratic m tjorlty in both houses the power claimed by the Senate proposition, which, in his judgment, was: alike unwarranted by the constitution, unjastllled by any present emergency, and utter# ua? less to the democrats for any good purpose. He therefore offered a resolution proposing to declare as the sense of the c uicus that th- republican minority should resist the adoption of the joint rule by ail means authorized by parliamentary law. No vote was reached upon either of these resolutions, nor upjn several otters Introduced, and finally it was agreed to postpone the iurther consideration of the whole matter un;l! thise,enlng, when it will be laid before a joint caucus of the republican R -;>fesentatlves and Senators. The Murder cf Chavsn-.u a ?Mr. Ifoyt. of Colorado, one of the citizens who were with young Jackson whea he was taken by th'?T" relsin the city. He savs the kllllnj'of CiitW naux's son by the Jackson party was with'j'U doubt wholly unprovr-ke-i. aad that tlw sa > equerr action of Agent Berry was : he on y course possible under the circumstances. Govs to tuk Quaker Citt.?The President Secretary Ramsey and Gen. Sherman left the ato r|,.('k ;tl3 mornlug for Philadel phia. Thej will return to morrow morning. Se<i;etary Thompson and the Panama Canal?A cable dispatch from Paris says that Secretary T iompson has accepted the position of e'r.aliman of the Panama canal Comoany >be subscriptl< n booKs of whchfelose today' Secittary Thompson has not accepted such a t o-tilon nor has it been tendered to hlra. All the Secretary knows in regard to the Panama \ company as regards hlmoelf is that it hsf bt-eii made known to him that the chairmanship or the American branch of the company would be tendered him. As this ten ier has not been made, or course the Secretary cannot say whether he would accept it or no^ He will wait, until the formal offer and its detail are made known to him it the Secretary sLou.d accept the American chairmanship when tendered he would do so in such a miun?-rasnotto embarrass the administration in tn? position announced by the President in lib ri essageto Congress upon the subject of inter oceanlc canal communication. cniFf M*nirn Bhak, of the Sioux delegation to Washington, was accidentally shot & crow Cirek yesterday. U[),i me visit of the Indians to t Lis City will be postponed. Tdk Credentials of Ghn. Garfield as sonator-elcct from <?hlo, are still anon? the archives of the Senate. It Is expected, though, that within a daj or two Gen. Garflald win'bv letter, request the N ice President to return the same to- him, so that he may return thTr through the governor of ohlo.to t he legislature' in thus returning the credentials tns General' will also transmit a letter dec lining the senatorial office to which he has been elected, senator Pendleton, in a conversation on the subject of the vacancy wnich will be caused by Gen Garfield's declination, said he was clearly or the opinion that the legislature could le'a'ly proceed to elect a successor to Senator Tuurtnan ten lays after It received notice of p- sldent-elect Garfield's declination. He has carefully studied the law covering the case, uad his opinion is based upon the result of a very laborious rerearcli or all tlia legal authoring bearing on the subject. Senator Uailey, of Tennessee, arrived in the city last night and was In his seat in the Senate to-day. A star reporter askod nitn what basis there exists tor the talk of electing a republican Senator from Tennessee to succeed htm .Mr. Ralley.* "There Ls nothing In it at all," replied Senator Bailey. "W'c have a majority or the legislature and are going to eiec a democrat to the senate." Texas solid.?a Star reporter to-day askei Senator coke if there was any truth in the statement oi a Texas correspondent of the NewYork Times that there was a scheme bain^ pushed by the democrats to divide Texas into four states and hold the United States Senate by thus obtaining six additional senators. Tne senator replied very emphatically that, there was "not one word of truth la any assertion of that kind." Said he: "The people of Texas are almost unanimously opposed to any di vision of the state. No man could be elected to ofii;e in any county of the state on a platform favorlu? a d<\ lsion of the state. Tne democrats are aft n favor of the continued unity of the state and in nearly every speech made by a democrat he thus proclaims himself. No sir. there win be no division of Texas."

Instead of crectlng a building, the trustees bought one already erected in Uniontown. Waen they went to the Treasury lor their money, the controller decided that it could not be ipplled to the purchase of an erected building, but only for the erec'lon of a building.

Secretary Sherman to-day sent the following letter to the Vice President and lo the Speake of the Iiou3t\ ' I Lave the honor to transmit herewith copies of the following papers perialnlug to the estimates or the Dlstri* of Columbia, and matters connected therewith, for such action as may be deemed advisable by Congress, viz.: (l.) Detailed estimates ot the expenditures of the District t f CoiUmblii for the nscal year end ing June lwith moditlcatlons suggested by the First Comptroller of the Treasury. (2.) Letter of me First Comptroller of the Treasury, recommending certain chingesin the manner ot assessmg and collecting the revenue or the District of Columbia, and calling attention to the fact that no amount has been paid to the Treasurer of the Fnlted states as required by law on account of a sinking fund for tue water bonds of the District. Also recommending thai estimates or expenditures to he made out of the water fund be included in the annual estimates hereafter to bo submitted by the Commissioners ot the District.. (3.) Letter of the superintendent or the Government Hospital ior insane, containing an estimate oi the amount that will be required to support the indigent Insane oi the District of Columbia for the tlscal year isS^. (4.) Letter or the president of the board ot trustees in relation to thy estimate for the reform school of the District for the tlscal year 1SS2. (5.) letter'of the Secretary of the Treasury, dated November 30th, i^so, returning to the Commissioners or the District of ('olumt> a. their estimates for the ilscai year i-^2, with a statement of the amount approved by him, and the fund or purpose to which each item belongs. In calling the attention ot Congress to the matter referred to in these papers l would respectfully state that, in my judgment, the system of assessing ami collecting the revenues of the Dlstilet Is not the best that couid be devised, and therefore recommend such cuauges and inodldcatlons therein as will insure greater safety and economy. I also concur in tne recommendation of i he c omptroller that the Commissioners be required to submit annually to the Secretary of the Treasury estimates or the expenditures to be made from the water fund of the District, and suggest that section 3 of the act of June 31th, 187S, providing a permanent form of government, ror the District or Columbia be amended accordingly. The act authorizing the issue of the District of Columbia water bonds requires that not less iban ttfteen thousand dollars shall bo set apart annually for their gradual redemption, but notwithstanding said requirement nothing has been paid to the Treasurer ot the United States on tnts account. Section 3, ot the act of June 11th, 1ST*, providing a permanent form of government for the District of Columbia, requires the Secretary ot the Treasury to return the estimates of the District of Columbia to the Commissioners for transmission to congress. These estimates should be allowed to take the usual course provided for those of the executive departments, and be Included in the book of estimates transmitted arnually to Congress. I have, therefore, to m-ornmend such a modification or the section referred to us will require the Secretary to transmit those estimates direct to Congress, together with such amendments or recommendation asm his judgment the public Interests may demand." general nosriTAt. niljj.

Huntley?No. the record of which develops some interesting details as to the conduct of the notorious star route service. The Huntleys were partners in securing postal contracts in the far west, and t'aey have quarreled about their accounts, s. s. Huntley gives In the ofxi^lal record sorm* cu>T ous Information as to the mauner In which the business of letting these routes and securing contracts la conducted. In regard to hl3 expenditures he testifies tha* he kept no detailed book account, but their nature lie ingenuously described as follows: "At times 1 had to pay largo amounts of money? from ItK;') to $J.ooo or $3.000?to get certain things done that will appear on the b>?ok. <>ut of the^e large amoun;3 comes all the Incidentals which represents four years' business, and the four years'business represents my collections in the departments of about $500,000. It is necessary in get ting Jh??se accounts through the :department, and It has been the custom, to be friendly, not only with the heads or the departments, but even with the clerks and messengers, and we always treated them very kindly in presenting them with some trlile, or in presenting them with a cigar, opera ticket or dinner or something of that kind. To get any thing done in.the;aepartnients it requires assistance of a great maty members of Cungre33, whom we have to treat in the same manner, and to whom I occasionally send theater tickets; and always when l ask favors l generallv send carriages for them and ask them to do certain things In the department." Then after the heads of departments, clerks and messengers. Mr. lltnitley went, oa to say, came "the press," to whom he gave dinners costing ftom *10 to $50 a head; -then, as far as the press 1n Washington la con?eroed. during the investigations, which are generally every j ear, to keep them friendly so far as I am con cerned. 1 have always bf-u very friendly toward them In the same manner, and v^ry oft^n giving them dinners costing from $10 to *y? each,' it 13 a pity Mr. Huntley was not persuaded to 01 re the names of the person?, whom h*1 so kindly flined as "the press:' but more remains. He paid the hotel bills of governors, for instance. He says:? I found our governor from Montana came on to Washington and staid at the Arlington for about a week, and 1 treated him as nice as possible and whea he went away I paid his bill, a he governor ot Wyoming territory came on and 1 treated him in the same way. Besides all ot these small presents paid to pretty nearly everybody in Washington, i guess, are included all of my hotel expenses, traveling and sleeping cars, Arc., and, altogether, 1 think it must have cost me out of money charged to me aoout $30,000. I can only arrive at about what it cost because 1 know wh*t? 1 received for the four years and I know what I have left, and subtracting from what I have left I know I must have spent for this business |j0,000, and I ought to have put In $25,000, and I only tind ito.ooo charged; that is for everybody's good will, froai the messenger la the department to & United States Senator and governor of a termory. The Washington correspondent of the N. T. throh! in dealing with Uusfexposure very .per- 1 tlnently adds: "This tale of Mr. Huntley's after all leavas one a prey to curiosity.
