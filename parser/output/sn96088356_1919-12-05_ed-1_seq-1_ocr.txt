NUMBER 48 SECOND NOTE TO CARRANZA SEVERE Mexico's Conduct in Consular qent Jenkins' Case Scored. ts request j of Consular .ied at Puebla. the lai , ...ican note to Mexico, made puhjic here, arraigns the Mex ican government's conduct In severe terms and characterizes It as a studied attempt to ensnare the American con sular agent In the Intricacies of legal proceedESli. No ultimatum was served and do. Indication was given of what the America, government's course would be if Jenkins is not Immediately re leased. The note to Mexico begins by saying that the United States declined to be drawn Into a judicial discussion of "irrelevant or unimportant matters," and says the request for' the consular agent's release is founded on "light and JuBtlce." The United States, the note says, Is "constrained to the opinion" that the Carranza arguments that the case Is being investigated and that Jenkins has not taken opportunity to be re leased on ball are "mere excuses." This government does not admit, the note says, that It Is neoessary to keep Jenkins in jail while his case is being investigated and this government "fails to discern" that the "intricacies of the Mexican penal law" have been applied with impartial effect to Jenkins. 66TH CONGRESS FACES RIG ISSOES Washington. The 66thcongress In Its first regular session was convened Monday. The business ahead of the legisla tors comprises a program rated by leaders as the most important In years, if not in the nation's history, including what are considered some of the most complicated domestic problems ever presented. The senate Is expected to begin work on the Cummins railroad bill and the house on miscellaneous business. Houflo committees will start work on the It! annual appropriation measures to bo enacted before July 1. While the railroad legislation is be fore the senate, negotiations toward disposal of the German peace treaty are expected to reach a head, but with pre tin both sides doubtful of final ' r.et on before the holidays. The record billion dollar congresses, of ordinary peace times, faded into the past when Secretary Glass, presenting the annual estimates, proposed appro priations of practically five billion dol lars for conducting the peace-time ac tivities of the government during the coming fiscal year. According to these figures it will cost more than five times as much to conduct the peace-time affairs of gov ernment as it did .in the year immedi ately preceding the world war. THE SILVER 1 WGRKS IIS WILL Last Saturday afternoon this lo cality experienced one of those, sin gular visitations of King Winter known as a silver thaw. All morn ing the weather was "saft," as the Scots say, an Oregon mist prevail ing. Suddenly the lower air turned cold and every wet object found it self abruptly encased with ice. Sunday morning the people awoke to look out upon a world transformed into clearest crystal. Every , shrub and tree was a miracle of frostwork; the slightest breeze produced a crisp rattling of icicles as the frozen twigs snapped at its passing. All through Saturday night the continued noise of cracking branches, breaking poles and snapping wires reminded one of the roar of an ap proaching tornado. Sunday morning when the sun came out and suffi ciently melted the ice so that drop ping globules merrily pelted Mother Earth, the scene was quite similar to corn popping from an old-fashioned skillet onto the kitchen floor. The electric light and telephone systems suffered. Lights went out about ten o'clock Saturday night by reason of many broken wires, and the towns of Athena and Weston were in darkness gloomy and unwelcome un til the following Sunday evening. How existence was endured at night by the pioneer residents of these two places until Edison came to their re lief with his great illuminant, ap proached the status of a mystery to the present-day populace. Some of Athena's shade trees broke down under the weight of ice, and many others lost their limbs in countless numbers. The scene was not unlike war pictures of Argonne wood after fierce artillery practice during the late unpleasantness. A big tree fell in E. C. Roger's yard on Jefferson street, Athena, and narrow ly missed a corner of his residence. It was noted that shade trees that had been topped suffered the worst, others being scarcely damaged. Five telephon poles went down at Weston and no less than 24 lines were put out of action. An ancient box-elder tree in the yard of James H. Price on Water street, having a trunk larger in diameter than a man's body, fell, split through the heart. The tremendous crash accom panying its destruction was distinct ly heard by Frank Price, residing on Normal Heights. Thoroughfares were blocked by fallen branches of trees, and Marshal Avery had to get exceedingly busy with an axe in or der to clear the way for traffic. Walla Walla's experience with the silver thaw was similar on a larger scale to that of Athena and Weston. Pendleton did not suffer, save that it found itself in the traditional posi tion of Moses "when the lights went out." A gasoline engine was com missioned by the Tribune in order to get out its Sunday morning edition.

It is the hope that the peo ple will respond generously, as the funds received will be the nucleus for future betterment of the city. A short social session followed and two pleasing musical numfbers were given by Miss Zola Keen and Mrs. Clinton in a piano duet. A "train puzzler" was presented , by the pro gram committee, the rheeting end ing with pleasing informality. At the next meeting, which will be held the fourth Tuesday in Decem ber, roll call will b answered with a short item of curjfent events.

ECHO WILL CELEBRATE IIS IRRIGATION ACHIEVEMENT tfti The Echo Commercial club has sent out an invitation reading as follows: "The City of Echo is justly proud of the achievement of its citizens in the financing and building of the Teel Irrigation District project, which means the expenditure of one million dollars in this locality and the re clamation of twenty thousand acres ! of rich land for immediate settlement j and use, and thereby adding untold wealth in population and farm prod ucts to this county and state. "Our commercial club is desirous 1 of celebrating the event of this suc ; cess by inviting all the friends of the '. project to Echo on the 10th of De cember, J919. .

Sunday night Geraldine Farrar, who' has not been at the Standard for some time, will be seen in The Devil Stone, one of Paramount's best pic tures. In selecting the star of Joan the Woman, The Woman God Forgot etc., for the leading part in The Dev il Stone, one of the best screen ver sions of the season has been the re sult. Pathe News and Lloyd comedy complete the program. For this pro duction and The Tiger Man, both of which are top line programs, the reg ular prices of admission will prevail. Tuesday night's regular program brings rollicking Taylor Holmes in It's a Bear! a stunning comedy drama in five reels, supported by an Arbuckle comedy. On Wednesday evening Dorothy Phillips, although by no means a stranger to Athena audiences, will make her first appearance at the Standard, when she will appear in the big super-special Northern pic ture, Paid in Advance, from the book by James Oliver Curwood. This is truly one of the greatest pictures ever filmed in Alaska and gives am ple scope for Miss Phillips' superla tive talent. It's a six-reel super .special which with a two-reel West erner (something new here) nets an eight reel show at 25c and 50c admis sion prices. THREE PROPOSALS A WEEK oon win oe : king at the j Girl Sobs When New York Canteen Closes -"Boys Were So Nice," She Says. New York. The Pershing club can teen here has closed. With the end, gloom was spread over the counte nances of the girls who served In the canteen. But especially gloomy was the countenance and especially mourn ful was the voice of Amelia Reeves. "What's the matter?" a reporter asked, fearinz there was a death In the family. "Nothing oh, nothing," sobbed Ame lia, "only " "Only what?" "Oh, the boys were so nice!" she answered. "Well, that oughtn't to be anything to feel so bad about," consoled the reporter. "There won't be any more of them here," said Miss Reeves, "and and so many of them proposed to me!" "This Is serious," said the reporter. "Oh, no, nothing serious; only it was such fan being proposed to to off en." Bow often?" "On an average of three e week since July V' replied the young lady, resorting to a handkerchief. In every section of Oregon the Christmas Seal sale is reported be opening with an enthusiasm and generosity that promise success. The entire state is well organized and from the tiniest community and most obscure rural school to the largest city and leading colleges the gay lit tle Christmas stickers will be offered for sale from now until December 20. For larger subscribers who do not care to use all the seals, health bonds in denominations of $5, $10, $20, $50 and $100 have been issued, each one bearing twelve coupons rep resenting the work of the Tuberculo sis Association for the twelve months of the year. Oregon's budget is $44,260. The thing that has struck a responsive chord in the hearts of loyal Oregon ians is the fact that this money is to be spent in building up the health of the State of Oregon. During the past year the expenditure of the Or egon Tuberculosis Association in cluded the salary and traveling ex penses of a field nurse, the salary and traveling expenses of one nurse who gives her entire time to follow up care of 641 discharged tubercu lous soldiers and rejected civilians; salaries and expenses of four public health nurses making demonstrations of county health public nursing; sal ary of nurse and matron at Open Air Schol; cost of food at Open Air School; cost of food at Open Air public health nursing at University of Oregon; pledged $500 to public health program in extension division of the University of Oregon; cost of supplies of Modern Health Crusade; literature, poster exhibits, bulletins, slides; relief of patients; cost of special county surveys, and legisla tive campaign's. Athena's quota is $100. The local Red Cross, under the direction of its chairman, Mrs. F. S. LeGrow, has accepted responsibility for the Seal ale for Athena, and looks with con fidence to the community for its usual generous response. W,- Sold for $300 an Acre. J. M. Swaggart writes from Baker, Oregon, giving the exact figure he received for 125 acres of land in his recent deal with J. H. Key. Milt sold 125 acres west of the county road to Mr. Key, he says, for $300 per acre, or $37,500, and also re tained the lease money. He claims the distinction of receiving more money per acre for land than anyone else in Umatilla county. He contin ues to hold 33 acres of his Lamar gulch place. : Find Curiosity Shop in Man's ! asides Boston. Discovery of u hu man "curiosity shop" was an nounced by officers of the house of correction at Deer Island. Charles W. Buzzell of Montreal, serving a sentence of one-' year for forgery, complained of indi gestion. In his stomach a doctor found parts of a dog chain two feet long, part of a safety razor blade, a suspender buckle, 179 pieces of glass, bits of hay bal ing wire, staples, nails and screws. This collection was for pur poses of suicide, not amusement or profit, according to Dr. L. C. Rockwell. Division of German Fleet Decided On. Paris. The supreme council adopt ed the British suggestion for partition of the German war fleet. Under the arrangement Great Britain will receive 70 per cent of the total tonnage, France 10 per cent, Italy 10 per cent, Japan 8 per cent and the United States 2 per cent Johannesburg Now 'Metropolis. Johannesburg, with a population of 263.274. is the largest anil must cn- mopolltan city In South Africa. The tastes of the people are varied, rang ing from the simplest requirements on the part of the natives to the most I cultivated wants. Music of some form I Is one of the means of satisfying these wants. How does It happen that Immedi ately after the war the amiable allies found It impossible to reach agree ment upon anything? CONGRESS RECEIVES PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE Budget, New Tax and Tariff Systems Included Among j Recommendation. 'FLU' SPREAD BY HANDSHAKE Dirtier the Atmosphere, the Mora Im mune One Is to Disease, Say Colonel Vaughn. St Louis, Mo. There is no indica tion of an epidemic of influenza this winter, according to speakers at the convention of the Association of Mil itary Surgeons of the United States here. One method of spreading the disease is by handshaking, it was said. Col. Victor C. Vaughn, in an address, declared the dirtier the atmosphere and the more bacteria one breathed, the more Immune he would be to dis ease. This was proved, he said, by statistics compiled during the war, which showed that the greatest death rate from disease was among men from rural districts, "The city-reared man," he asserted, "Is accustomed to breathing filthy air, while the country-bred man is not, and consequently a foul atmosphere will affect the latter sooner than the for tsr." .: As usual, those reductions of 10 to 32 per cent In food prices are all Id some other states. '' " ' ." ' "i ' a . :uiarijfj- "7 Washington. General recommenda tions on legislation to combat the cost of living, labor unrest, radicalism and a readjustment of the nation to peace time basis were the features of Presi dent Wilson's annual message to con gress delivered Tuesday. The peace treaty, the president told congress, will be discussed In a sep arate message later, as will the rail road question. For the second time only Bince the president established the practice of addressing congress in person, his message was read by the clerks. Seven Important Recommendations. The president's principal recommen dations were: Establishment of a budget system for the national finances. Reorganization of the taxatlen sys tem with simplification of the income and excess profits. Readjustment of the tariff system, if necessary, to meet changed world conditions and make the system con form with the fact that the United States Is "the greatest capitalist in the world." RpprwntHnn nnrl rnttpf fnr vataran soldiers of the world war particularly In the way of government farms proposed by Secretary Lane. Proper measures to foster the dye- stuff Industry built up during the war to keep the United States independent of foreign supply. An enlarged program for rural de velopment, in recognition of the farm ers' part in the war. Measures which "will remove the causes" of "political restlessness in our body politic." Causes of Unrest Superficial The president made his most exten sive reference to the peace treaty by saying the causes for the unrer y'are superficial rather than deeps ted" and that they "arise from or afr, Von- nected with the fUure on thenrr-ojf our government to arrfvespeedlly at a just and permanent peace permit ting return to normal conditions, from the transfusion of radical theories from seething European centers pend ing such delay, from heartless profi teering resulting from the increase of the cost of living, and lastly from the machinations of passionate and male volent agitators. "With the return to normal condi tions this unrest will rapidly disap pear." Would Curb Agitators. The president renewed his recom mendations for legislation to deal ef fectively with "those persons who by violent methods would abrogate our time-tested institutions." Several recommendations, some newals of previous ones, were made by the president to bring down the cost of living. Among them were extension of the food control law to peace times for the emergency, regulations for transportation of foods in interstate commerce, a cold storage law modeled after the law in New Jersey, a law requiring marks to show the length of time foods are kept in storage and a law to secure "competitive selling and prevent unconscionable profits," by federal license of corporations selling food in interstate commerce. m m m
