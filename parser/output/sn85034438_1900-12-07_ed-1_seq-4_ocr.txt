MERCI rail's INVASION OF KNG LAND. General ?Mercier's speech in the French Senate urging the French Government to make preparations for the Invasion of England when that event may be thought opportune, is a very curious illustration of French character. ?He gave no reasons why the preparations should be made ex? cept that it is entirely practicable, and that it -would impose upon England the necessity of keeping herself in the same state of preparedness for -war that the Continental Powers of Europe are under. This -would seem to be a strange way of proving his case, as it would put England Into such a state of preparation as would make the French invasion futile if at? tempted. The only ray of hope for the French In an invasion of England, if they ?could succeed in landing troops upon .her soil, -would ponsist in the fact that France has an immense standing army always ready ?or action, while England's military resources consist in a gallant, but an un drilled militia. If, however, France is to take such a measure as -will force Eng? land to levy an immense standing army like that of France, what would be accom? plished by landing one hundred thousand French soldiers in England? They would be destroyed before succor could reach them. Nin?*ty-six years ago Napoleon collected at Boulogne Sur Mer that splendid army of Frenchmen with which he fought the hattie of Austerlitz. with the intention of shipping them across the channel ?-hlle the English fleet was away. But ?Nelson caught the French and Spanish fleets that were to guard the crossing at Trafalgar, and destroyed them, and ?Napoleon, divert? ing his schemes of conquest from England to Austria, marched his army suddenly off to the Danube and inflicted the terrible disaster of Ulm and Austerlitz upon Aus ir?a. Merciers projects -would turn out like ?Napoleon's if he could get the. French people to seriously consider tljem. The English have crushingly defeated the French whenever they have met them in the last eight hundred years, and this has been many times, and they will defeat them again whenever the French force a conflict. The mercurial, absinthe drink? ing Frenchman cannot stand -up against the sturdy, beef-eating Englishman, and lie will ride for a fall whenever he forces an issue with the Englishman in the fu? ture The [Frenchman's incessant snarling at the Englishman is like the imitation of a tice dot; with a big ma-stift However quiet and unobtrusive lie may be, yet the lice can never forget that he is a mastiff, and that fact remains a ?standing injury to the lice. So it is -with the Frenchman. He can never forget that he has been pro? voking contest.?* -with the Englishman for eight hundred year.-*, and that he has been ignoxnlnlously trounced whtnever he has met the Englishman, and that fact rankles in his bosom. He is like the jittle fellow that unsuccessfully fought the court-house bully fourteen times and announced hi.s in? tention to light him again, saying in an fcw-r to the remon-strance that he would be beaten again. "But 111 be getting in a fair way for a settlement." This seems to be the Frenchman's philosophy, but he will never get a ?miement -except by sub? mitting to his thrashing. A SEW ???p?. We printed an Associated Press dispatch yesterday to the effect that Charles M Walter, secretary ?,f the Middle-or-the Road Populists, of Indiana, had issued a call for a conference to be held at Indian? apolis December -d. thsx being the first *"tep, he ?ay.s. in the formation of a new national party, to embrace all the reform elements. "This city," said he, "win be' the cradle of a new r.ahonal party that will embrace tbe Social Democrats, Silver Republicans and ?Reform Democrats." JW*. ?aid the other day, in commenting on the conference between Mr. William J Bryan. Mr. ?Charles A. Towne and Mr! Frederick T. Dubole. that, in our opinion '.hie conference Iras with a view to orcen xlaaj such a pajty as Secretary Walter refers to. It remains to "be seen, however, whether or not these jrentlemen will take part directly or indirectly in tne Indian? apolis conference. OBe that as it may, such a party will logically be formed, and will play a more or l?-ss conspicuous part in the politics of this country. Mr. Bryan and Mr. Towne and Mr, Dubois belong to that class of politicians, and they would- feel more'at home In an 18-karat Populist par? ty than anywhere els., for they believe in Government control of transportation lines and trusts and the extension of the princi? ple of paternalism as widely as possible. We do "not say this In harsh criticism. It is certainly no crime to be an honest Popu? list, and we always respect an honest man, no matter how far we may differ with him. We say that there ought to be a well defined Populist party In this coun? try, because ?nere Is a considerable num? ber of Populists throughout the length and breadth of the land, and they are neither at home in the Re'publican party nor In the Democratic party. They need a party of their own, and as this is a free country they ought to have it. ?But we are. unalterably opposed to any alliances-between the ?Populist party and the Democratic party, for these two par tics are, in principle, as far removed as the east is from the. west. Populism is a mild form of Socialism, and if there is anything under the' sun that Democracy Is opposed to it is Socialism. The Social? ist believes in as much law as possible; j the Democrat believes in as little law as is consistent with the protection of society and individual rights. Democrats and Populists can never meet on common ground, and all attempts to bring them into affiliation are worse than futile. That was the great mistake of the revolution of 1S96. The Democratic party put aside its own principles, adopted the princi? ples of Populism, then formed an alliance with the Populists, and the result is rup? ture and demoralization. The only salvation of the Democratic party is incomplete separation from Popu? lism and Populists. We want to see the herding process go on, and so we are glad to hear that the. ?Populists, Socialists and Silver Republicans are going to organize a new party. We want to see them get together, and we want to see them draw into their ranks all who believe in their party principles. ?Next, .-we want to see all the Democrats get together, and we want to sec all who believe in Democratic prin? ciples join that organization. As for the true Republicans, they are already togeth? er, and you can depend upon it that they will stay together. A general shaking up and sorting out in the political field is the need of the times, and there are indi? cations that it is about to 'become the or? der of the day. TO THE PRESIDENT'S CREDIT. "It strike? one,as somewhat singular," says the Boston Globe, "that the Presi? dent can devote seventeen columns to his annual message _nd yet never mention the vast laboring masses of the Union, except in the general way with which we are all familiar." For our part we think it is to the President's credit that he did not indulge in the usual-political clap-trap about the laboring man. We yield to none in respect for the honest workingman. and we want to see him do well. But we despise clap? trap and insincerity wherever they ?mani? fest themselves, and there is more of such clap-trap and insincerity in connection with the labor question than any other. Every politician who makes a stump speech goes into hysterics about the down? trodden workingman, and pretends that if he is elected he is going to do something 'to better ' theWorkjiiigman's condition. Every political organ talks the same sort of stuff, and we-have no doubt that self respecting workingmen have long since become thoroughly disgusted with it. They know just how insincere it is; they know it is for the purpose of hoodwinking the workingman and getting his vote. We say that it 15 to the credit of President McKinley that he did not deal in such buncombe fiTTiis late message to Congress. _Why should the President in his mes sage single out the laboring man and re? commend that the Government do some? thing in his behalf? Or why should he single out the farmer and recommend that the Government do something in his behalf." Or the merchant, or the banker, or the manufacturer, or any other class of citizens? The "very suggestion is at variance with the fundamental principles of this Government. Class legislation is an abomination, and ought not to be tol? erated by the people. Let the Govern? ment hold its hands off, let it open the way, and give to each and every citizen the same opportunity that each and every other citizen has to ?make a living and do business and accumulate, and the people will take care of the rest. 

HOAV NOW? Congre?ss is again in session and the Democrats have strong representation in the Senate and in the House. Mr. Bryan said, during his canvass, that if he should be elected, the first thing he would do after his inauguration would be lo cal? Congress together in extraordinary ses? sion, and that he would then recommend tbat the ' Filipinos b? given their inde? pendence and Uie promise of protection from the United States forever against foreign Invasion. It will be In order, therefore, for some representative of Mr. Bryan in Congress to offer such a resolution. Indeed, we shall not be surprised If a resolution to that effect is offered. But if so, will the Democrats in good Xalth support it? Are the conservative Democrats in Congress now ready to give the Filipinos their in? dependence, to haul down the United States flag, to bring the troops home, to give up the interest that we have in those islands, and yet pledge ourselves to ex? tend the Monroe doctrine to that remote quarter, and, without exercising any au? thority over the islanders?, give them oui moral and material support in any diffi? culties they might have "with the powers of the world? We do not believe it. Mr. Bryan's Philip? pine theory was as visionary as hhr sli? ver theory and h's trust theory and a! the other theories of which he has dreamed. ? The Philippine question is a practica] question, and it must be dealt with In a practical way. We said time and again during the campaign, and we say it now, that it is simply impossible yet for the, Government to adopt any specific and. abiding poiiey towaA tie Philippine > Islanda. We must ?soh-e the problems as we come to them one by one. In few charity balls are the expenditures beyond the receipts aipproprlated to char? ity. Chairman Hull, of the Military Com m.-'ttee, seems to be in the wrong berth. The navy only should have "Hulls.'" It was not surprising that the elevator ?fell in the Capitol at Washlnsrton yester? day. >when many of the Senators them? selves take a drop too much. The friends of a Western politician whose heart continued to perform its functions after life ?was extinct, declare that he was not a dead beat. If, by the passage of the army bill, tiie President Is clothed with t?iscretionary powcr, it will be hard to get a hat big enough to complete his outfit. Ths press d-spatches say that "the sen? sation of the ?lay In Congress Wednesday occurred when Representative Shafroth took his seat." Oi.e of tbe pages must have put a piece of mince pie in his chair. If President McKinley gets his army of lOO.OiX? men. the question is whether he will be able to defend himself against his opponents' attacks on the adminestration. It Is reported that the Boers are sur? rounded near Pretoria, and can't get out, but the British appear to be able only to "Take a little stick And stir 'em all about." It is said that Count Boni de Castellane is negotiating for a house in London, but the negotiations are likely to hang fire unless the little Frenchman can get some man of means to go on his- paper, since the Count himself has nothing ie'ft now to go on but his face. In stopping all telegrams from Smyrna ? regard to the Kentucky, our people must wait for Mie battleship's heavy guns to open up on the Sultan before hearing from there. Those papers .which have been publish? ing editoriali? on premature burial might ;et some ammunition from the big cave-in in Pennsylvania, where 51 persons were entombed. The President denies the. reports of cool? ness between himself and exJPresident Harrison. Xot even an orange Ice was placed between thorn at the dinner in the White House recently. If we all looked and thought alike, one haF.i of the world would be out of a job. A gas employe in Xew York committed ?uicide by blowing out his brains. The ?jues tlon arises why he didn't do it by blowing out the gas. Oo'm Paul Kruger walked bareheaded in the rain during a procession in Cologne the other day, ami British sympathizers declared that the old man had water on the brain. It is ?,-iid that the Constitutional Con? vention will cost Si'O.OuO. How long will :t requiro to reduce taxation in that sum? To Little Joker: No, the esteemed Orango Observer is not a yellow journal. A young woman living near Rochester, X. T., lost a diamond ring, and the other day when her father slaughtered a hog, the ring was found in the brute's stomach. Hereafter she will be careful not to cast her pearls before swine. ============ a. ; 

CURRENT TOPICS. The New York Journal of Commerce says ?that during Xovember there was more activity In projecting new cotton mills in the South and enlarging estab? lished plants than In the previous months, nnd several important additions to the South's quota of textile factories were announced. One was the mill in Xorth Carolina to produce a tine grade or" cotton damasks, utilizing ?the extensively developed water po?ver of the Roanoke Itapids, near the town of the same name. The projectors ?ire already interested in a large silk mill in the same locality. Another important mill is that announced for Charlotte, X. C.', the centre of cotton manufacturing in its State. This mill is to turn lO.OCO ?tpindle*; ami spin a line irado of yarns. November's projected spindles number 48,000, whieh, i? carried out, would mean the investment of .?!M0, Oi?. Of these spindles 21.000 (nearly one haPf) are to be added bv established mills. The Memphis Commercial-Appeal repro? duces from the report of the United States Commissioners of Education, for the fiscal year 1S9S, a table showing the relative number of pupils enrolled in .the various States of the Union. According to this report, there are about ?7,<?)?,0??) pupils in all the schools, public and pri? vate, of the United States, being 211-2 per cent, di the entire population. The Com? mercial-Appeal says that ?the table also shows that, the enrollment in tho Xorth Atlantic division of States is 3 1-2 per cent, under the general enrollment for the country in ali the schools, and about 2 1-2 per cent, under that for the common schools. It shows that not a single Xew England State, nor Xew York, Xew Jersey or Pennsylvania reaches the average en? rollment for the country. It shows that the Southern States have an enrollment exceeding the average for the country in the public schools, and that the south centr.il division of States has an enroll? ment in the public schools exceeding the rate for the entire country in both public and private schools. It ?diows that there are only two Southern States which have a lower percentage of enrollment than Massachusetts and Xew York.

The following interesting article, which is in line with some observations of ours in another coIumn> js from.the Chicago Chronicle: "It will Interest Democrats to learn that tho "Mr. "Washburn, of Boston, who has issued a call for the creation ?e?f a new po? litical party whoso main object shall be the election of Mr. Bryan to the Presi? dency, is an officer of the national organ? ization of the People's party, with which Democrats have recently beeen in affilia? tion. Mr. Washburn intends to get along without Democrats in his new party ex? cept as they may openly and without re? serve subscribe to tlie principles of his new reform party. "Probably this movement rtjsults from the recognition of the fact that one man isl'not likely to be the candidate of the Democratic party indefinitely. Mr. Bry? an's occupation as a speaker and lec? turer seems to be ?well adapted to a per? petual candidacy, and tho temper c'? the Topulists is such as to make that party a convenient instrument ?for his purposes.. He can lecture for a livelihood and run for the Presidency every four years as a di? version. '.'It is noteworthy also that Mr. Wash burn in his pronunciamento refers to Mr. Bryan as the actual founder of a new party, and as such declares him to be greater than any other party organizer that the country ever has known. Demo? crats w-ho have been voting for Mr. Bryan with the idea that he is a Democrat will find in his frank confession something to think about. If he has created a new party and given it principles and aims different from those o? the parties tha*e existed before he became a candidate it is certain that that party is not Democratic and that many things have been done in a political way of late under false colors. "With the affairs of the People's party Democrats have nothing to do. If that ex? traordinary aggregation of philosophers. reformers, financier.-- and statesmen has really concluded to stand alone the re? habilitation of the Democratic party should be greatly simpliii?e-d. i'f it shall insist upon a monopoly of Mr. Bryan's time and talents many ?Democrats who never have supported him will be gratified and all Democrats who know when they have had enough of anything will be re? lieved." This is all the more significant seeing that the Chronicle, during the late cam? paign, gave the Democratic ticket a most cordial support. But the Chronicle evi? dently numbers itself among those "who have ha?l enough of Bryan." AKT ??-M ???. The question of the annexation of West Florida?that is. all of Florida west of ?the Chattahoochee River, or about one-sixth of tihe State?to Alabama will be submitted to a popular vote of the people of the dis? trict at an early date.
