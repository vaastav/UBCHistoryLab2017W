In the City of Mex ico, menaced on all sides by rebellion and pillage, more than 25,000 persons crowded the bull ring on Sunday, ap parently as carefree as any crowds on earth. -Mexicans are not alone in this re spect. In Paris during the terror great sections of the population were as- devoted as ever to the gay life of the - times. In London during the plague, concerning which Defoe has romanced, aristocracy pursued its pleasures and the slums wallowed in their degradations as usual. Calamities rarely affect everybody, no matter what the records say. What they call war in Mexico would he in tolerable to most countries, but there it is accepted philosophically enough so long as it aoes not interrupt the bull fights. . 1 Mil. WILSON'S IKCOXr . SISTENC' ., f : 4 That was a neat little sidestep which President "Wilson exeduted when he explained to the delegation of the National American Woman's Suffrage association why he deemed it impossible and impolitic to urge their cause in a message to congress. But It is likely to rebound on his head with the force of a hundred of brick. " i He styled himself in tie presiden tial office as merely the spokesman of his party. He insisted that he was Lot at liberty to urge on congress in messages, policies which have not had the organio consideration of those for whom he is spokesman. It was not his province to "start any thing," he said, and he added: "I have to confine myself to those things which have been embodied as promises to the people at an election. This i the strict rule I set for my self." It wag only the other day, though; 1T that President ' Wilson in his annual message to congress, which he deliv ered in person,' tos&si out the sugges tion that, lie' f avored legislation which would do "sway the national party conventions of the present variety. Instead of. the delegate system that has been in vogue 'during the life of the; pr.I.'tfcat parties' as they are now lotiRiinted, he would have the nation al conventions of the future made up ct the nominees for house of repre sentatives, nominees far the vacancies In the United States Senate, the Uni ted States senators holding office, the members of the national committees, and the nominees for the presidency and the vice presidency. This is an exceedingly revolutionary polltica, suggestion, as far as national politics is cuncernea. Nor has it ever been considered or ganically, so far as it is publicly known, by the democratic party Cer tainly it was not among the promises of this party on which the last cam Paign was waged, it may not be an original idea with Mr. Wilson him self, but it has been accepted as such the country over, and will be attriht. ed to him un'ess he makes a specific ummj or explanation to the mntrTO This much is positive,' however. Ka cannot hang the idea on the demo cratic party, unless there has been a secret meeting of the nartv t wh.nt. this and perhaps other reforms have ween projected. That is not likelv Of course, most rules become not- ea Because of the exceptions taken to them. But it doesn't savor much of a consistency that is desirable in a man who holds the high office of President of the United State to announce in one breath a ruin wmm, he did not follow in an immediate Preceding .breath. He thus opens himself to the charge that he only invokes the rule when it is conven ient, . ,- 

PROMISES AND RESULTS Government officials are now en. gaged in the interesting task of figur ing out tne financial tangle in which the federal treasury finds itself as a result of democratic administration thus far. Already the reduced tariff has brought a deficit, and if this aver age la carried through the rest of the fiscal year there will be a heavy loss of revenue. , it was the contention of the democratic platform and of demo cratic candidates and leaders that any revenue loss would be more than com pensated for by a sweeping reduction , u luo 01 nving. But thus far rtP U 1. a 1 . . there has been no perceptible reduc- J" me cost or living. On the contrary, it costs more to live today than ever before. Great things were expected of th income tax, the yearly revenue from this source being estimated at $105.- vw.om. Apparently, then, what the democrats have done is to cut off de liberately the revenue derived from a general source and arrange to collect it from a special source. As the tariff reduction is proving of no benefit to the consumers who include all the people this change means simply that some 425,000 citizens out of a total of more than 90,000,000 must be unjustly taxed upon their industry and prosper ity in order to make up for the blun der of a reduced tariff which does not benefit anybody but foreign producers. It is no longer claimed by leading emocrats that the new tariff will have an appreciable effect on the cost of living. Recently even some promin ent democratic officials have denied that this ever entered into the plan of tariff revision. Yet the platform adopted at Baltimore contained these words: "The high cost of living is a serious problem in every American home. The republican party, in its platform, attempts to escape from re sponsibility for present conditions by denying that they are due to a pro- tectlv6 tariff. . W take issue with them on Bul)ject and charge that evf-PRSivo nHRPsi result. in a lnrp-o measure from the high.; tariff by the republican party. ... . . and we as sert that no substantial tellet can'be secured for: the 'people jffhti Lamport aocies' on tne-neofessaries ot life are materially, educed' . Woodrow Wil son said in1hecampaign: "Would it pay to keep up the protective system through pay envelopes so as to permit a few workers to rob the rest to en able these few workers to meet pro- tectlon's high prices?" So much for the theory. The facts are different. The democratic party is succeeding in reducing wages, but it is in no wise reducing the cost of living "to the rest" of the country. The dream of reducing the cost of living by the sim ple process of oppressing home in dustry has not borne the promised fruit, and we now begin to feel the Ill effects of the new tariff, with the cost of living higher than ever. Therefore the problem of making a satisfactory financial statement to the people is beset with serious difficul ties. A promised economy has not been effected. Enormous appropria tions are lieing asked for in all gov ernmental departments, and the ad- ministration has not even the satis faction of pointing to a lower cost of living to offset these added burdens.

TIIEJPRESIBENCY IRONMASTER SAYS THE NEW YORK SENATOR IS COUN TRY'S WISESJjyiAN Washington, Dec. 12. Carnegie vis ited the White House today to in quire after President Wilson's health. He talked at length with Secretary Tumulty' about world peace and went to the state department later to pur- sue the subject with Secretary Bryan. As he left the White Houss, Mr. Carnegie said he thought business conditions were going to be " better than ever" after the new legislation which congress has in hand, is passed. He expressed his gratification at the award of the Nobel prize to Senator Root ' "I think Senator Root is one of wisest men in America," he said. "President Roosevelt said so, Lord Morley told me he thought so, and I believe the best thing the republi can convention could do would be to nominate him for president." "If there were to be no convention don't you think he would be nomi nated at primaries " Mr. Carnegie was asked by one of his listeners. "Well," said Mr. Carnegie, "so far as I'm concerned he would be." J Mr. Carnegie came to "Washington to attend the actual meeting of the Carnegie Society " for Scientific Re search.

HOW TO USE RED CROSS SEALS Red Cross seals should, in ac- cordance with order No. 5,020 of the postoffice department, "be affixed to the reverse side of domestic mail matter,", and not on the addresa.'lde of any pack- ages that are going through the, mail. They may be placed any-, where on matter -going by ex- press. As many seals may be used on the back of a letter or package as may be desiredt Care should be exercised in sending merchandise) through the mails not .to .(place seals over strings with which the package is tied, since this seals the package against inspection and subjects it to first class postage rates. Red Cross seals may be used on the reverse side of mail matter sent to Austria, Germany, Great Britain, and most of the British colonies, r except Jndia and Aus- tralia, Guatemala, "Uruguay and Portugal refuse, to admit mail bearing non-postage ' "stamps: Certain European countries; wW return to the sender any mail bearing Red Cross seals on the address side. Red Cross seals may be used on the face of checks, on bills, on legal docu- ments and on any commercial paper. These Christmas seals are not good for postage. They will not carry any mail matter, Imt any kind of mall matter will carry them. .... 1 1 "rrJi ton - , ... i 7 FROM WORK GANG TO HEAD OF ROAD NEW PRESIDENT OF THE FRISCO HAS HAD REMARKABLE p RAILROAD CAREER St. Louis, Dec. 12. William C. Nix on, recently elected president of the St. Louis and San BVancisco railroad ("The Frisco"), is a very notable ex ample of a self-made man, for he rose from actual poverty by his own un aided efforts. Energy, persistence and courage were his equipment. He was not two years old when his father died, leav ing his mother in almost indigent cir cumstances, with two young sons to provide for. They llyed in Earlville, 111. . In the spring of 1867, William, then 9 years old, was taken into a furni ture store and set to work painting chairs. But he got more paint on his clothes than on the chairs and was discharged. His next job was dump ing shavings in a planing mill at $2 a week.: He was promoted from- time to time Mt was unable to get more than a boy's salary. .cj v- Hearing that there were opportuni ties in Nebraska, he started for that far away region in a "prairie schoon er" that happened along, earning his passage by driving the mule team At Grayton, Neb., he quit the "schoon er" and went to work for his "keep' on a small farm. The farmer, J. C. Eldridge, had difficulty in maintain ing his own family, but the boy's plight appealed to him and he could'nt turn him away. He told William, however, that he must keep a look out for another place. One day young Nixon observed a railway section gang at work near the station at Grayton. He spoke to the foreman and was told that he could have a job at $1.75 a day if he would report at Sjitton, the next station on the line. . , But how was he to get to Sutton? The foreman said, he couldn't "pass" him without he had actually begun work. Mr. Eldridge was consultel. The fare was only 90 cents, but the farm er didn't have even that amount of cash. "Tell you what, UI do," said Eld ridge finally. "We'll just drive that big hog of mine to town tomorrow and sell him." Next morning it was done, and the farmer handed William $1.25, half the proceeds. And so young Nixon got to Sutton and was put to work. "That was in December, 1879," says Nixon. "I remained with this gang for a month. We were employ ed by the Santa Fe railway. One day a newspaper came into the section house from Emporia Junction, Kan. noticed the station agent in that town was a man who had formerly lived in Earlville, my home. I wrote him' and asked for a job. "A few days later I got a telegram from Emporia offering me a job as night watchman at the Santa Fe de pot. I had just drawn my month's pay a few days before, but I had sent most of it back home to mother, and was again in trouble. I knew I could make the trip in a caboose without expense, but I did want to pay the two old ladies who cooked for us at the section house. ';t' 'Finally I broke the news to them. They thought it was dishonest; tut I assured them i would send the money back a'4 'soon -as I could c611ect"'my salary. ' p ' That night I climbed into a ca boose on a freight train and started for Emporia Junction. It was a cold night and I was exposed to the ele ments. The next morning I was very ill. I had to change cars at a small station in Kansas, and twiien ,1 got off I met a brakeman who, had been working, on the Santa Fe. He noticed that-I was ill and asked if he, could be of any assistance.,, , . . "When . I, told him I had but one dime he took he to a drug store, where he purchased medicine and then took me to a hotel. He also sum moned a doctor, paying ths bill him self. He had nursed me back to health by the next day. After a good breakfast he put me on the train which carried me to my destination. I never saw or heard of him again. He was what was then known as a roving brakeman. But I shall never forget him and I still hope that I may meet him again. "When I reached Emporia Junction I had recovered from my illness. I went to work as night watchman for $10 a month. I held this job almost a year before I could find another opening. I learned that the Santa Fe watchman at Albuquerque, N. M. had been dismissed. I 'asked for the place and got it. My salary was $G0 a month, and I was given some cler ical work in addition acting as watchman. "My first good luck came while I held this position. The cashier and two clerks at the Santa Fe station stole several thousand dollars and dis appeared, leaving me in charge of the depot. The agent was unable to find any one who could handle the cashier's job, and he ordered me to take charge temporarily. "1 was utterly unable to add a col- lumn of figures, and to hold this job I had to count upthe day's receipts, which averaged about $10,000. Instead of wrestling with a column at a time would set aside two items, total them up and then take two more un til I had added, totalled and retotal led my whole column. I worked hard to hide my ignorance, but I was dis covered. Tt was provoking to the agent, but he was unable to find a successor. Finally he was transferred to another point and I got this job. This paid me ; $250 a month, which was more money; than my whole family had ever had at any one time. "I remained in this position for more than a year and was able to save some money. P. F. Barr, one of the officials of the company, offered me the position of chief clerk at San Marclal, N. M. This paid only $150 a month but the opportunities' urere good and I accepted. I held this post ten months, when Mr. Robinson, gen eral manager of the road, made me trainmaster at Wellington, Kan. My salary did not Increase. In 1884, or one year after I held this job a year, the) haH times struck us and the San ta Fe-almost went into ,the Bands of a receiver. Every employe's salary was cut, and mine whittled from $150 to $135. "A short time later I was transfer red to Kansas City as superintendent of terminals, which paid me $160 a month. From Kansas City I went to Chillicothe, 111., as division superin tendent of the Fort Madison and Chi cago, and I thought I was buried for all time to come. Finally I was or dered to Chicago as superintendent of terminals and local agent, and a short time, later I was promoted to general agent of the freight depart ment in Chicago. "My next position was superintend ent of all lines from Chicago to Kan sas City, and then I was transferred to Galveston, becoming general su perintendent of the Texas lines. Prom this position I was elevated to vice president of the Santa Fe lines in Texas. I terminated my 17 years' service with this railroad in 1906, when I came to St. Louis to become vice president of the St. Louis and San Francisco railroad." Mr. Nixon is married and has one child. Jack. His wife formerly was Miss Hattie Pitcher of Michigan. They were married in 1891. Mr. Nixon is of medium height and heavy not fleshy, hut muscular. He is 55 years old, but appears younger. He stops FU

His friends say he will go the limit to help a friend, and the worst thing, his enemies Bay of him is that he would fight a buzz saw if it attempted to stop him.
