When Hie snow prevents the fowls from going outside, the floor of the house becomes filthy and the walls be come damp. The only remedy is to clean frequently and keep t.he floor well covered with litter. Damp walls require ventilation, and this must tin done by leaving doors and windows open, keeping the liens inside by the aid of wire. If the walls are lined with tarred paper on the inside, they will become damp, anil on a cold night will show white frosting hence, as we .stated before, the paper should be on the. outside. A stable lantern hung up in the house, and a ventilator open at the highest point will dry the walls, but the ventilator must be closed when the sun goes down. A lump of stone lime will absorb moisture, and greatly aid in keeping the house dry- Water ing pans (which allow of evaporation of water), exhalations of the fowls, and the moisture in the atmosphere, are all sources of dampness which can not well be avoided when fowls arc contrned.

Dec. 7.—Sight seers to the nunvljer of 2.000 visited Chippewa Falls for the purpose ot viewing the immense gorge of lee that has ehoked the river and given this town such prominence during the last week. The visitors came from all the (owns on the Central road between this city and Medford, and Minneapolis and St. Paul, few of whom appreciated the full significance of the iee formation in the bed of the river. Only streaks of jagged iee elinfriug to the fronts and sides of buildings mark the height to whieh the water of the river rose, for during the night the flood receded rap idly and a fall of four feet is recorded on the gauge. Near the C. L. & Co. mill 1 the town is comparatively dry within ten feet of the river"bank, although three feet of snow and ice cover that portion of the flooded district: which the street laborers have not yet reached. Scores of lalmrers have been put to work and most of the streets are in shape* for travel, and a greater portion of the store buildings were again ready for occupancy. It. is confidently le lieved by close observers of the situa tion that the river will cause no fur ther apprehension this winter, and the more hopeful predict that, the iee will go out gradually, giving tlie stream a clear course by spring. The supply of anchor ice from above the city seems inexhaustible. Tons of the slushy stuff is still pouring over the dam, but it must certainly be flowing with the current beneath the gorge, as llie ice near the city remains unchanged. Maj. Jones, U. S. A., left Chippewa Falls to-day. stating as his opinion that 1he danger of the flood is at an end. There is a great deal of good feeling in the city at the happy ter mination of affairs, and it. is the gen eral belief that the damage that has been caused property will be much smaller than was at lirst apprehended. It is impossible to get an estimate of 11K! cost of the flood, but business men generally refuse to give out any esti mate of their losses. No oue. however, has been so seriously affected that it will prevent him front remaining in business tlie same as formerly. HEl'LIHL-IO FOB THE CHIXESE. W no O at arclilen GOCMiOn. Ijendon.

The amount of work done by 1 lie advocates of free coinage is beyond computation, and the number of those who took an active part in the contest too great for enumeration. These facts, together with the difficulty of choosing between so many meritorious speeches, have compelled me to limit the quotations to the addresses made and pai»ers is sued by persons standing in an official or semi-official capacity, and to the principal speeches delivered by myself. I have added a .brief history of the campaign, including a discussion of the election returns, and the significance thereof.
