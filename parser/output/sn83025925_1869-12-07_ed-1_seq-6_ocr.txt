Trvin Our Own Correnpondent. New York, Dec. 7, 1869. The Great Clerical Hrnndal. II 1 had the opportunity of being born once again and my opinion were asked, I should wish to open my eyes upon some just such world as this, where Byrons died once a century for the purpose of having their reputations raked by Harriet Beccher Stowcs, and where gontlemanly journalists were being shot down by McFar lands to furnish the occasion for bcing'apothco eized by Ilcnry Ward Beechcrs. I should like to feel certain of waking up in the morning and nd waiting for me damp papers full of vir tuous and Indignant editorials; I should enjoy the prospect of hearing on Sunday clerical ex cuses for libertines upon one hand, and a very general clerical denunciation of the excusers on the other. I should not like to dwell in some supernal com munity whose "sense" it was not easy to shock. I fear that whatever the beatitudes of that higher state of being, I should yearn after the "natural cussedncss" of New York, and long to thrill with the sensutiou of perceiving how political newspapers can throw the small con sideration of politics to the winds when they come to face a great moral wrong ! Tho air is so full of gossip concerning tho Kichardson-MeFar-land case that I feel as though but little ought to be expected of mc. Enough to say that Mr. Beecher continues to aBsert his innocence, but Lolds himself open to a proof of his guilt. On Sunday he artfully excited his congregation to the highest pitch by reading to them s chapter in the New Testament in which express mention was made of the rela tions between man and wife, and of the only crime which might justifiably destroy those relations. Mr. Frothingham, however, with less art, but more candor and courago, explained, not excused himself, glossed over the great objectionable feature in the affair, namely, the fact that adultery only is sanctioned by tho New Testamont as a sufficient cause for divorce, and irlth the glib glamour of a pet parson who un derstands the people to whom he Is talkln" probably set himself right with the majority of Lis flock. . As for tho clertcy in general who took part against Beocherand Frothingham, the Kev. Mr. Puller represented them most strongly, and sald! he thought a libertluo was more than a murderer or that Richardson was worse than McFarland ana left It to bo inferred that his opinion of his delinquent brethren was not ex cessively high. Latter-bay NalutN. A distinguished party of Latter-Day Saints are kere, endeavoring to make converts and also to settle up some business in connection with the pacific Railroad Company. The party consists I Brlgham Young, Jr., General Burton, Com- miaruUr at the l.'tah Militia: Elilr Win-in .....l i " FJdcr Empcy. They have already visited the llormon house of worship in Brooklyn, and impohcd their hands nnd invoked tho blessing of the Mormon hem en upon several sink con verts suffering from rheumatism and consump tion. It is said that si-veral families belonging to the eongregaiiou of Plymouth Church are among the new converts, and have gone over to the Brooklyn Mormon Church, whose doc trines are soracwhatdifferent from Mr. Beechcr's. Several thousand soldiers are now encamped near Salt Lake City, not, as (ieneral Burton fakes the trouble to explain, for any agrosslvo purpose, but as a means of homo defense for their Government. Tlint Ntone Mutt. The "putrefied" hero of Onondaga has arrived. He is at Wood's Museum, and gave his first tcanve yesterday. Why was he uot bought up by the art-loving gcntlenieu who are going to erect the new Museum of Art In Central Park ? We need some such curiosities as this there. However, it has just slipped In in time to revive the waning fortunes of tho museum, which not efen Mr. Barnum's mouey-inaklng tact has hitherto made successful. Its menagerie of lions, tigers, elephants, rhinoceroses, leopards, panthers, and so forth its ornithological hall stuck as full of ostriches and reptiles ns the Poultry Show nt the Empire Skating Rink Is of cocks and hens, are com plete as far as they go, with thou sands of other curiosities; yet some how or other the new Wood's does nt draw like the old Barnum's. Apropos of Mr. Barnum, 1 wonder who wrote his new "Life." I suppose he would say that Ac did, and I hardly suppose the gentleman who is accredited with having written the first one would care about "owning tip." Whoever wrote it has proved himself an apt story-teller; but there ought to bo an inter linear translation, converting tho imaginative flights into unvarnished truth. I am glad to sec that in his concluding pages Mr. Barnum has expressed himself so piously. His religion Is the only thing about him that is not humbug, for it is so like tho genuine article in appear ance that he cannot tell the difference himself. According to bis own confession, lie has gone to church one-seventh of his time nnd cheated the public six-sevenths, leaving a very good balance in his favor. Am Baba. .Ml SIC A I, A It
