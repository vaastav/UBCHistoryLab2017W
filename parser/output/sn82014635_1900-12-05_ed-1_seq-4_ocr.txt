According to the official figures of the United States census, Wichita lacks 329 people of having a population of 25,000. The superintendent of the census or some of his authorized assistants no doubt estimate themselves as very acute. In such an assumption they wronged this city. When following the announcement in the Eagie that the enumerators had practically concluded their work and were making up their reports, a number of which had already been forwarded to Washington, people commenced to pour Into the office with the complaint that they had not been counted. Of course the reports of the enumerators covering some of the districts in which these complainants lived, having been forwarded, there was no help. A per cent of the others were registered in a supplemental way. It seems that even these names were discarded by the bureau. We do not know that it cuts much of a figure farther than the disappointment of our own people. All of Wichita is here Just the same, and Wichita has more than 25,000 peo ple, or probably upward of 26,000. In every other particular it Is the biggest and best town in the state by all odds, and Census Superintendent Merriam after an. hoar's ride about the city, or a panoramic view of It from Fairmount, or a glimpse of its business streets, or a glance at its reg istration books, would be ashamed of his report Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri. North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia, he lost 136,967. Deducting his gains, ills net loss In the aforetime solid south is 91,083. In Idaho Mr. Bryan gained 6,225 over his vote of 1898, although his plurality was reduced from 16,868 to 2,170. In the other states carried in 1896 with the aid of the Populists and Free Silver Republicans Colorado, Kansas, Montana Nevada, Utah and Washington he lost 81,524, making a net loss of 76,299 in these states. Mr. Bryan's losses In the south and In the small western and northwestern states exceed his total loss in the country In the crucial states of New York, Illinois and Indiana and in his own state of Nebraska Mr. Bryan ran behind the Democratic state tickets.- A Love Letter, The Governor's Sensible Advice. Governor Stanley suggests that the newly elected mem bers of the legislature, before going to Topeka this winter, 6hall ascertain from their respective constituencies the de-t-ires of the people, and thear wishes and opinions touching the propositions to make appropriations of the people's monies for the Pan-American exposition to be held at Buf falo, and the semi-centennial exposition contemplated fori Topeka, and in what amounts, if any. That is sensible advice coming from the governor, and a safe one for the state senators and representatives. The governor will In his message urge the abolishing of perfunctory and unnec essary offices, the cutting out of scores of legislative com mittee clerkships, and a reduction of expenses all along the lm, commencing with his own office and reaching every public institution of the state. In this he should be sec onded by every taxpayer in the state, and the way to sec ond him is to instruct members-elect of the legislature. Several hundred thousand dollars additional or extra is to be asked of the coming legislature. Where is the sense of monkeying at the spiggot with the bung-hole wide open? In demanding economy and In lopping off the small steals and stopping the little leaks, the larger appropriations should not exceed the real necessities, and these based upon sound reason. The burdens of the people come, in the first place, from saddling them with too many unnecessary of ficers, who, in turn, in addition to their own salaries, impose unexpected and unwarranted expenses. If the Republican party of Kansas would avoid hearing a howl from the peo ple, and later relegation, let its representatives in the legis lature heed and act upon the common sense advice of the qoernor. Even President McKinley, in his message of jesterday, calls attention to the fact that extravagance in the past has cost the Republican party dearly, and that in expecting a repetition of it, the opposition bases all of Its present hopes for a victory four years hence. The Fast Mail Train to be Abandoned. The Fast Mall train, which plunges across the state from the Missouri river to Newton, between midnight and da light, during hours when all decent people are asleep, and all postoffices closed, carrying no mail save Immature editions of Missouri papers, and which train on reaching Newton waits till after 12 o'clock, noon, before it pulls down to Wichita, the principal city In the interior of the blate, from whence it starts back in the afternoon as a local accommodation, it is announced, is to be abandoned, on and after the 27th of this month, the half-baked Mls soun editions to be thrown on the California Limited, hit h sails out of Kansas City some time in the night, stopping at few stations. The weakest thing of which the I resent able and astute management of the Santa Fe was rcr guiltv has been that humbug fast (?) mall, engineered a a steal through congress, by an outside combination, uhi h onlj and alone ratronlzed it, but at a cost of wearing if engines and tearing of track- for which the subsidy se- ured has been no kind of compensation. The Fast Mail -muk at the interests of but one city, Wichita, which city, and ha" been for ears the Santa Fe's most profitable patron and important station within the bounds of Kansas. Tncre wouM b some business sense in starting a fast local noommoli'ion out of Wichita at 4 or 5 o'clock a. m. for the Missouri rier, and, returning, arrive here at 8 or 9 1 ck in the evening. The most profitable tram ever op : fnted by the Santa Fe, mile for mile, was such a train. and called the Wichita and Kansas City Express. 8uch ra-n should be independent, stopping at every station and i unning on the schedule time or rate run by the local alter. noon train, which now leaves here daily. The Woman's Clubs but the Harbingers. The girls are being sent to school, the boys to work, with the result that the man will soon be going to the woman for his opinions. With the present trend in ad vantages, petticoats are bound to rule. Crowded out of all the more easy vocations, elbowed at every turn in the pro fessions, with women athe bar, on the stump, and in the pulpit, baby-spanking threatens to become a lost art With -women everywhere betting on the result of elections, coupled with the demand of a right to vote; with the con cession that one woman with her tongue, more than all the men, mads for the politics of Nebraska, and are any of I the lines of our picture overdrawn? It is cheaper now and less trouble to get a divorce than It is to get married, and just as reputable, and woman has been the tutor and prin cipal actor, as she is the active plaintiff in both cases nine times out of ten. Pink teas and auilting bees have given way to literary functions and to art soirees to which na tional tendencies are descanted upon and the work of the masters archaeologically dissected and with immeasurable ! assurance and all the complaisancy found in the shine of a full moon. Nobody will be found denying these things save the guilty section of that sex itself.

Women now vote in several western common wealths, then why not in all; and if in all, why not fill the offices and take the direction of affairs politically, as they have been endeavoring to do industrially and mentally, and not entirely without more or less indications of suc cess? It is beyond the ken or province of a man to answer. -0- McKinley Demands an Open Door for All. The cotton manufacturers of the south, who recently petitioned Secretary Hay to do his utmost to maintain the "open door" principle In China, gave expression to a desire which should be shared by every manufacturer In the coun try, whether he be an exporter or not. Manufacturers of goods suitable for export have at last begun to realize that they can compete In the markets of the world, and that the bugaboo of cheap foreign labor is an innocuous scarecrow of which they need not be afraid. Moreover, they have acted upon this realisation to such good purpose that the exports of American manufactured goods doubled during the past four years, and will reach a grand total this year exceeding $400,000,000. The American manufacturer has alone found out (what his foreign competitor has long since known) that it Is export demand which keeps factories busy and a constant supply of competent workmen at hand when the home demand Is slack. He is thus naturally interested In the development of all foreign markets, and in the main tenance of the "open door" not only in China, but in the Orient generally. The manufacturer of the non-exportable goods is af fected indirectly by the Increase of the export demand. If the exporter enjoy a prosperous foreign trade, so mucb greater are the demands which he makes upon the product of the manufacturer who produces goods solely for domestic consumption. There is every possibility that the two other great manufacturing nations Great Britain and Germany seeing the situation in the light of self-interest, will stand shoulder to shoulder with the United States in demanding an "open door" in China. The manufacturers in this coun try should have little fear of the outcome under such con ditions. Martin Engel, leader of the Red IJght dstrict of New York, says: "I'm a Democrat because I like Croker." The Democratic party is to be congratulated that that is Bngel's only reason for bemg a Democrat. It is said that Dick Croker wants Tammany cleaned out toaKause Tammany didn t ute the way he said it should that is, for Bryan A bad man is sometimes turned into a reformer through revenge. -- Manila is becoming American. Under Spanish rule, every one had to be-off the streets at 7 o'clock. Now, the curfew does not strike until midnight, and some day the city will have all night liberty. The Boers are very apt to turn the table on Lord Kitchener and whale eighteen varieties of dav light out of him. Kitchener is severe and the severe man in war has to kill to conquer. Mr. Bryan will read with great disappomtment that In his message President McKinley did not recommend that a large, sticky crown with diamond ornaments be ordered at once. Reverend Sheldon's latest book, which deals with the serv ant girl problem, 's not meeting w th success The servant girl problem is too deep for any minister to solve .

"Love and dove, and cunid and stupid, and that sort of thing?" I repudiated the insinuation with scorn. "lt is a letter," I replied. Emily dragged a chair dose to mine, and seated herself. "Read away, John ny," she said calmly. "It is arivate," said "L "It will be more interesting " "But it is to a lady," I added. "Oh. Johnny! But why didn't you tell me before? Though, of course, It Is not settled yet. You are only paying "mark ed attention,' I suppose. And I wasn't there to see the fun! Well, she's a very nice sirL I always liked Phyllis. But I never thought that by just leaving you without a sister's care for a fortnight you would be causht." I allowed Emily to continue without interruption. I considered that her curi- osity deserved punishment and the stars fought for me Etnuy tapped the pa per with her Snger and inquired: "Can I help jou" "I am very inexperienced," said I, sadly. "Then I must An ill-judged remark a want of warmth a slnsle false step, In fact, roieht " "Don't!" I exclaimed, with a shud xier. "Oh, it's lovely, Johnny, to see you like this'" said Emily, ecstatically. "How far have you sot?" "S T, Breeze, of the Isle of Wight, Latitude " "That's ridiculous," interrupted Emily. "You won't allow me any latitude?" "Don't be silly. You must not put any address or date, but start right away. She must think you very agitated, you know." "Certainly," said T. "Begin, 'My darling, darling, Phyllis " "Two darlings?" I inquired, busy with my Den. "Ye-es; two will do. You're not en gaged yet. Afterward I should recom mend three " I wrote as dictated. tSmily continued- " 'Although a thousand cruel miles of sea separate us " "But we're not a "hundred!" I ex claimed, "Please believe me to know best," said Bmily "But the msn who make the geog raphies " "Are not the men who make love. Put it down" I obediently placed myself a thousand miles away, and waited for further in structions. '"Yet, vou are never, never absent from my thoughts for a single minute,' " she continued. "Do you think a third 'never? " I in quired anxiously. "No, you should exerdse some re straint at times. You misht, however, underline them. Now go on 'Separa tion makes my life intolerable. Each moment here Is a year, each day a cen tury ' " I looked uj In some amazement. I knew things were not usually like that in the English channel. But Emily con tinued: " 'Ah, how I Ions to see you again to touch your hand to look into your eyes ' " "That's beautifully agitated. So dis connectedandandjerky," I murmur ed, scribbling vigorously. "Couldn't you put In a little touch of humor? Just .to freshen It up a bit," I asked, layingdownT3py pen. "John," said Emily, sternly, "a lover has no sense of humor." I sUrhed. I felt the character to be difficult. But I have many rimes watch ed the course of tru e love running smoothly, and I knew that Emily was right. "I am in your hands," I said, sadly Emily remained in a deep thought for a moment Then Inspiration or memory oame to her afd, "I live only forrour meeting. I am in tensely wretched here," she dictated. I looked at my surroundings. The blue water sparkled in the sunshine, a gent'e breeze crept under the awning and tempered the noonday heat I was lv ing comfortably in a deckchalr, while the yacht slipped through the water w 1th a gentle, lazy roll. But I wrote. "I am intensely wretch ed," as Emily commanded. "You have never composed any poetry, I suppose'" she inauired. I blushed. W have all been young.

And Emily, after somo'cefleetlon, decided that I was right "Even the eyes of love," 6ha said, "might-i " Well, she spoke a little unkindly on the matter. The letter filled three pages when com pleted, and was certainly a work of art. (Art I observe, is usually estranged from science and absolute accuracy ) "Now." said Emily, when her ideas at last gave out "the end is the most im portant part" "Do you recommend crosses for kisses, you know'" I Inouired. "Certainly not They are vulgar Write 'A thousand thousand kisses, my darllnjc.' " "Will they all go for a a penny?" I asked, with anxious hesitation. "Do try to be sensible," she Implored. "But will the postman deliver them"' I objected.

"She has a pet name for you, I sup pose7" "I will sirn it 'Thomas Jones.' " "What'" exclaimed Emily "She calls you that!"
