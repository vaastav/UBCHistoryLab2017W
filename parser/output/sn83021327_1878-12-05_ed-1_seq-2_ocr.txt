THE 1UESSAGK, Congress assembled Monday, aud tine morning we give our readers a telegraphic synopsis of the President's message. The President, while very wild in tone, ascribes the changed po litical results in South Carolina and in Louisiana to overriding the lately, en franchised black voters of the South. Certainly he Las not yet been informed ot results ia the fifth congressional district in Texas, where Uancock, an intense Union man, has been defeated for Congress by Wash Jones, a Confederate, and whose election is due to 15,000 black votes, driven by ex-Governor Davis, chief of Radicalism in Texas, supported by the fiercest of the Confederate last-ditchers. When he knows all this he may regret that to please his party, lie made an empty assertion. The truth Is, the negroes of South Carolina and of Louisiana have learned t have con fidence in the old slave-owners. They know, too, that Radicalism has sent .among them the grandest setof thieves that ever infested any country, and hence they are ready to follow an hon est Hampton. And now we may ex pect, as even intimated by the Presi dent, that Congress may be called upon to abridge the political rights of the negro. When lost to the Repub lican party it will become his greatest enemy. THE PRESIDENT AND THE 1ICLZ.UOZEBS. It IS quite impOSSlbl io comprehend tbt agencies employed by Radical party-leaders in fastening the convic tion on the President's mind that everywhere ia the South negroes have been denied the privilego of voting as tbey pleased. Like the canaille of New York the colored people of the ,uth are first at the polling places. For some inconceivable reason, know ing little of the results of elections and having no concepon of their effects upon legislation or public poliey, ex pecting no personal advantages end assured of the perpetuity of their own freedom, it is difficult to account for the earnest eagerness with which the ignorant mass crowds the voting places. It is, however, the ex ercise of the highest privilege of freemen and Africa is free while Africa votes. But there is bo accounting for the coarse these voters pursue. Why it has happened that the negroes voted solidly against an unwavering Unionist and for an earnest rebel for Congress in this dis trict, defeating John Hancock end co operating in this with the red Republi can, original secessionists of this dis trictwhy these incidents distin guished recent elections Mr. Hayes may be puzzled to determine. In other States, as ia South Carolina, the negroes have quarreled with the carpet baggers anajvoted for a Hampton or us a Hampton advised, and for this the whitea are condemned and all sorts of prosecutions are pending, as happens In Texas, before extraordinary Fed eral tribunals for the purpose of making it appear that violence and outrage haye been employed by whites in order to frighten negroes from polling places. Thus far it has not been made to appear in Texas that any combinations have been made to feat the beneficent purposes of Con gress or restrict the negro' freedom. Instances of individual quarrels and tights are adduced, but these distin guish quite as often the relations of ignorant whites as of whites to blacks, and there it gross wrong in gathering ia accounts of all these trifling per sonal conflicts, unless it be shown at the same time how numberless were the towns and villages and country stores where elections were held and negroes voted oltea as repeaters, and yet no violence was done or resistance c&red. There were fewer fights and quarrels oa election day in all the Bjuth, where four million white and one million negro votes were polled, than ia the fighting wards of New York city, represented by the bellicose Sunset Cox. Rat delicious partisanship collates with painstaking care each iucidect of each white and black shindy and the catalogue of enormities tuutnci a frightful aspect. Evidently, Cob Iagersoll, B!une and Cockling, with the President follow ing along modestly and gingerly t aough in their wake, are going cfT on another cras3o beneith the banner of the b'.oody shirt. The triumph of Radicalism and its protracted niaintc-n-ooe of power depend upon the sec tionalism of the cotllxt. United StaUa ccir.mLsioncr supply the msie r'.ala, and those idiotic white men, who furnish this capital for Rtdkul trades men ia f fjee and power by fighting negroes and degrading themselves and the people cf tho Sutb, are the choic est tools and agents of Eiaine, Coak-,,'.-g aad Iagerso'.l and the wcrt ene- Mies? luckksj S:ste3. rBi.'.- dozere,'' if such creatures exist as de scribed in the President's message, should be extirpated by the South. T ix. n io.nT iTVoiTxt;. The Eicon ballot-box is crmmen-Ied ia strocg terms by macy newspspcrs. B.coa lias been a benefactor of man kind frrm Noah's time. Btcon was the prcfoundtst of philosophers', and many good people believe that bacon was the real author of "Shskspeare." Very certainly he is the inventor of a device, cheep and simple, which ren ders many commonplace election frauds impossible. The mechanism of the box is very simple. Ic numbers every ballot with a detective combination, preventing "stuSng" and instantly showing spurious ballots. It has been tested by skillful export", who have sruht to eyade its t.peration, but in every pt.iut it stems to be guarded, except in that wlr.ch most needs watchfulness aud security. It cancct distinguish ccuntenanct9. The same man may vote early and often. AVe have seen wagons freight ed with voters who went from one to another polling place and voted again and again. When whitky stood up against decency and good morals, brandishing the knife and pistol, it also thrust polluted ballots into count Ices boxes. Negroes voted again and again from the rising to the setting sun. White men are distinguishable from one another, but judges of elec tions are impotent to detect black "repeaters," and in many towns and counties of Texa, since there is no re straint and no Bicon ballot-box or other means of restricting the number of ballots thrust into the boxes, elections are worse than farcical, and decent, honest people will not vote. Bacon's ballot-box prevents many frauds, but until voters of each civil district are numbered, and none are suffered to vote except at their own polling place, and until none vote who have not paid at least a poll tax, there can be little value at tached by the ciliz?n to the privilege of suffrage. It would shock one's sen sibilities when depositing his ballot in the box, and, turning away, to behold an ourang-outang neutralizing the ef fects and proper results of wise and honest voting. We have no voting apes in this country, but then we may have and the sheriff should be empowered to guard absolutely and protect relig iously the purity of the ballot-box. This invention of Mr. Bicon is a per fect safeguard against many irregulari ties and frauds, but until none vote who cannot show a tax receipt the foulest outrages and most villainous frauds will be perpetrated. Mr. Bacon will surely be paid well for bis anti-fat ballot-box in Bastrop and Wharton counties ; but the evil to be remedied cannot be obviated until each voter is restricted not only to his o:vn ward or precinct, but until he must present, when he deposits his ballot, a receipt in full for taxes. IIQl'OR I.ERISL.11 ION. ILirjier's Weelly says that the New York Court of Appeals has declared the ciyil damage act to be constitu- tlOLttL Th:o net holds both thA sol. op of liquor and the owner of the prem ises upon which liquor is sold respon sible for any violation of law in conse quence ol drunkenness caused by the liquor. It is, of course, a law passed in the interest cf temperance. It rec ognizes the right of society to regulate the sale of intoxicating liquorp, as a license law recognises it, and its direct operation is to prevent leases for liq uor shops except to those who will not abuse the privilege of sale. A news-, paper which opposes the law asserts that it violates the principles of justice and equity. The ground of such a comment is, of course, that a mau driuks at his own risk, and if he breaks the peace the law already pro vides for bis punishment. It is equal ly true that a man smokes a pipe near a powdcr-mag&zine at his own risk, but society has rights as well as the individua1, and society, to protect it self, regards gunpowder as an excep tionally dangerous property, and regu- lates its manufacture and storage as it does not those of other properties. In tho same way it argues that liquor is an agent sure to be abused, and proved by experience to be the cause of enormous taxation by the crime which it produces, and which necessitates police and prisons. It as serts, therefore, the right to regulate its dangerous iue as a beverage, and one ot the obvious ways to do this is to put a check upon its careless sale by holding the person who lets a shop for that purpose responsible for the dam age that may arise from making a man drunk. It is a case in which a society seeks to protect itself by preventing disorder, and the argument against it is an argument apainst any regulation of the liquor traffic Liquor legislation ia a matter of ex pediency, and springs from the right of society to protect itself by methods which involve no disregard of sound and conservative fundamental princi ples. Individual liberty of action mui t be defended up to the point where ex perience proves that the common liber ty requires an individual restriction. That warning of experience can be as certained only by common consent or by the voice of a legal majority. It is a maxim of the law that a man intends the natural and obvious consequences of bis acts. When he sells or fur nishes the means of selling to another man something that he knows will de Btroy the moral and conscious responsi bility of the buyer, why should he not be responsible for the result t If the buyer ought to be held responsible far drink ing what be knoars will steal his wits, certainly he ought not to escape who makes a living bv it. Tlie particular case which was appealed wis that of a son who drove his father's horse on Sunday to a "hotel" ia Orange coooty, and titers mide himsoif drunk, and drove the horse to death. Tbe father sued both landlord and trna&t to re cover the value of the horse. Jnt jary gave him a verdict, and upon the ap peal cf the landlord and tenant the Court of Appeal afHrmed the judg ment.

Bat we have retrograded in nigral and de cency and advanced in vice. The slate of src:tty is worse than fiity years sg-.; rricies arc committed and deeds of violence occur, such as were not known prior to 1S00. Death and tnurJ-r and the digging of a unllioa grivc, end destruction of nine thousaud niliiion3 of propeity in the South were by co means the chiefest results of the war. The people have been made retkleS3 aud vicious as never before, and law3, at least for the next ten years, must be adapted to this state of society and morals. We cmnot maintain armies of knavc3 in penitentiaries and especially when we know that this punishment, when ap plied to a larjc class of its citizn, is by no mean remedial. The Baltimore G-iutte say?: "Saturday was whipping-Jay in New Castle, Del., and nioe convicts, six of them black, received at the hands of the shentl from ten to twenty lashes, a large crowd, as usual, assem bled to look on, and the day was made a sort of a lecsl holiday. There seems to have be-in a feeling of disappoiat ment araoog those present, for a corre spondent says: 'rthenfl Pyle ltfid on the lashes too lightly, but it is said in his behalf that be is a new hand at the buaine.o?, and may rival his prede cessor! eventually, who could make the thong draw blood at every stroke.' There has been much denunciation of the whinpinp-post, and inhumanity and barbarity Iihs been cried against it by its opposers, but tbe fact remains that Delaware, where it is used, is freer from crime than most any Stale in the Union; spends very little money on jails and criminal prosecutions and is one of the few States entirely out of debt." The feeling dominant in the North, and to which the President lends the approval of his fame and greatness, is illustrated in this excerpt from tho New York Tribune. We cannot compre hend these things. The focus in which terrible stories of alleged Southern out rages ia concentrated is in the North and not in the South. We see and hear nothmg of these devilish deed?, and yet the North hears of them and sees them everywhere. The relations between the j-sces here is as kindly as among Americana and Germans or Irishmen. But the New York Triliune says: The South may rest assured that these objects of the war have not been and will not be abandoned. As long as the South is solid, by disloyal and dishonorable methods, in behalf of a dishonest and disloyal party, the North will be found solid also. But it may as wpII be added that the defiance of the Constitution and the disregard of its guarantees will surely be stopped, and that at no distant day. Tue World says that the law points out to the President the path in which he is to tread, but Republican wire pullers may be assured that neither from this nor from the next Congress will they get power to interfere in a State election either in Massachusetts or in the South. If there be a condi tion of civilization or of partisanship which instigates or tolerates election acts at the South which arc not insti gated or tolerated at the North, then let the South be condemned according ly. But Gen. Butler oughc to be ex amined as to whether thero is any more immorality ia elections there than in Massachusetts and New York. Only iu the latter States the police are auditioned to suppress or prevent vio lence and ballot-box stuffing, and that s the difference. TueNjw Yoik M-iil says that the words ' immoital soul," " deathless soul," " undying soul," " deathless spirit," "disembodied soul," "disem bodied rpirit," " eternal torment," "eternal suffering m conscious misery," "eternal misery," "unending misery," " unending torment," " everlasting woe," endless woe," " never-dying soul," and all their kiudred words are words that never, in a single instance, are found in the Bible. Bat from the copious manner in which these words are passed to us from the pulpit and through the press, we should, without realm?, suppose the B.blo lull of them! The word "immortal" occurs but once in the whole Bible. The negroes of the District of Co lumbia are making preparations, says the Star, to give public expression with reference to the recent political outrage to which the cobred voters of the South have been subjected. The ntgrocs and their white coadjutors in Southern Texas, says the Brenham Banner, having elected no less than five of their colored brethren to the State Legislature, and also a member of Congress, should send a protest to their brethren in the District of Colum bia, and have any mention of Texas omitted in tbe resolutions. The naturalizition of a Chinamsn in New York City excites inrich indig nation air.oog California congress men. Mr. Lultrell will present a bill in the House prohibiting, in specific terms, the naturalizition of Mongo lians. But then we would like to Know what about the African. Ten thousand Chinese voters are intolerable and not to be thought of in California when we get along marvelously with a million ballot-box stuffers..

Heart rode up to a squad of men working the road and told Gray to get out of the way, as he (Heart) was a cavalryman. Grav re plied he was as pood a man as Heart. and if he wanted anything to dis mount, at the same time taking oil his coat. As he turned facing Heart, the latter shot him dead. Smith started toward him with a hoe, when Heart fired at him also, hitting him in the ciiecK. l tie usual escape is recorded The Court of Appeals of this State has rendered a decision of some inter est to our local authorities. A was in dicted for keeping a disorderly house. The proof was that A was the owner of tbo house and rented it, knowing the unlawful purpose for which it was to be used. The court held that the defendant cnnld not be convicted, be cause the offense of keeping a disor derly house is not uade by express terms ot tbe statute to embrace the lessor or owner of the property who rents it, differing therein from the statute on gaming. Governor Hubbard has revoked bis quarantine proclamation, saying that tie is "dutished that there is no longer any danger of the introduction of yel low fever into Texas from districts now declared to lie free from the in lection." Xewx-Echo. What an Irish bulltojbe manufactured by a hinpopot nmusl Nobody ever supposed there was danger of the "introduction of the fever from districts declared to be free from the infection." The Governor is apt, iu his rosiest and oiliest speeches, to utter commonplace sentence, old as the eternal hills, with the fervor and vehemence of infinite originality but when he goes about the task of forcing his piety into print he gets things, like drinks, infinitely mixed Two men went from Dallas to Pem biua, Dakota, to identify the body of Collins, itiey bad it exhumed and photographed, and they ure now back in Texas ready to swear to the remains being those of William Collins, one of the Bass accomplices. It is well known to cettain officers that nenry unaerwooa ana l'rank Jackson are m Dakota, and that tbey were near Pem bina when Collins was killed. The United States troops at Fort Pembina, a few miles from that place, since learning who they weie, have chased them westward into a desolate region filled with trees and undergrowth. As the country affords them nothing to live upon, and it is not settled, they are bound to retrace their ste.'.s sooner or letar, when their capture is almost certain. (Jit is sad, but ala6l too tru:! A pri vate letter from Humboldt, that sweet ploce so miraculously preserved by l'rovuicnce tor its lneiiame goodness. even when wicked Memphis went down, states that the flat village has been smitten at last by the plague and three persons have died there since the "scourge" was removed from Memphis, It is not so bad that Humboldt thus suffers, but that Major Penn loses caste somewhat as a prophet. Everybody prophesied, like tue Junior, that xuem phis would be scourged, we, for its hltluness and the Manr, for its sins. but when the Major said that Han- bold t would go scot free because Hum' boldt listened to his voice as of one crying in the wilderness of the murky Obion, along whose classic banks Davy Crockett used to shoot bears it is this defeasance of the Mijor's prophecies that makes us teel bad. The United States District Attorney for the Eastern District of Texas died suddenly on Monday morning last of an attack of apoplexy ia the city of Houston, uuugc liildwia was a native of New Jersey, but was a resident of Houston for many years before the war. During the war he wrote a pant pblct entitled ''Common Sense," in which he predicted the fall of the Southern Confederacy. For this he was arrested, as well as the job printer who printed tbe book, as a traitor and put in iu in 1-loutoD. lie was after ward sent to Mexico by order of tbe military authorities. At the end of the war he returned to Houston, where he resumed the practice of law. lie was appointed to the office of district attorney by President Lincoln, and still held the position at the time of bis death. He leaves a wffe and a married daughter. The Commercial notices an evil and tells about a remedy that may be ap plied: "A short-ighted legislature, with no practical knowledge concern ing railroads or appreciation of the value of time, made a law compelling railroad trains in this State to stop at every station not less than five minutes a law that is an imposition upon both the railroads ana the traveling public but of no earthly advantage to the towns along tbe roads. The law is not generally observed, bat the railroads realizi the fact that by violating it they lay themsolves liable to annoyance and prosecution at the hands of any per son who may haye a petty spite against them lor some real or lmiginary wrong. So great has this annoyance become that it is rntnored the leading officials cf the Texas railroads will soon hold a meeting to devise means to put aa end to the inconvenience at least as far as the traveling public is concerned. We bear it stated that one proposition is to make all regular passenger trains " through trains," stopping at only the principal towns along tbe tine, and carrying all local passenger traffic on freight trains. This would be a pret ty severe remedy, but it would caase the people themselves to demand the repeal of the piesent unreasonable law. or at least a modification of it to tbe extent that trains would be required to stop at stations only a reasonable length of time to allow passengers to get on or oil in aaiety.
