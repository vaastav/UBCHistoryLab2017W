THE BURLINGTON FREE PRESS AND TIMES: THURSDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1915. IT I National Preparer" 'Main Tlisme of Hoatl . ..Jon, Submlis Definite Plan to In crease Present Standing Force of Regulars and For Four Hundred Thousand Citizen Soldiers Raised In Increments of One Hundred and Thirty-three Thousand. FOLLOWING is tho message of President Wilson delivered at a joint session of the senate and liouso at the beginning of tho Sixty-fourth congress: Gentlemen of the Congress Since 1 last hud the privilege- of addressing you on tho state of tho Union tho war of nations on the other side of tho sea, which Imd then only begun to disclose Its portentous proportions, has extend ed its threatening and sinister scopo until It has swept within its ilanie some portion of every quarter of tho globe, not excepting our own hemi sphere, has altered the whole faeo of international affairs, and now presents a prospect of reorganization nud re construction such as statesmen and peoples have never been called upon to attempt before. We have stood apart, studiously neu tral. It was our manifest duty to do so. Not only did we have no part or Interest in the policies which seem to hnvc brought the conflict on; It was necessary. If a universal catastrophe , greo of happiness and safety and Is was to be avoided, that a limit should most effectually secured against the be set to the sweep of destructive war 1 danger of maladministration, and that and that some part of the great fam- when any government shall be found ily of nations should lteep the process- inadequate or contrary to these pur es of peace alive, If only to prevent poses a majority of tho community collective economic ruin and the break-1 bath an Indubitable, inalienable and down throughout the world of the in dustries by which its populations are fed and sustained. It was manifestly the duty of tho self governed nations of this hemisphere to redress, if possi ble, tho balance of economic loss and confusion in the other, if they could do nothing more. In the day of read justment and recuperation we earnest ly hope and believe that they can be of Infinite service. In this neutrality, to which they were bidden not only by their sep nrate life and their habitual detach ment from the politics of Europe, but also by a clear perception of interna tional duty, the states of America havo become conscious of a new and moro vital community of interest and moral partnership in affairs, more clearly conscious of the many common sympa thies and interests and duties which bid them stand together. There was a time in tho early day? of our own great nation and of tho re publics fighting their way to independ once in Central and South America when the government of the United States looked upon itself as In sonic sort the guardian of the republics to the s nth of her as against any en croacht lents or efforts at political con trol from the other side of the water, felt it lis duty to play the part even without Invlratlon from them, aud 1 ( in world affairs, spiritual partners, think that we can claim that the task standing together because thinking to wns undertaken with a true and dlsln-1 gether, quick with common sympathies tercsted enthusiasm for tho freedom and common ideals. Separated, they of tlie Americas and tho unmolested , are subject to all the cross currents of self government of her independent . tho confused politics of a world of bos peoples. But It was always difficult to tile rivalries: united In spirit and pur maintaln such a role without offense pose, they cannot be disappointed of to the pride of the peoples whose free j their peaceful destiny, dom of action we sought to protect' This is pan-Americanism. It has none and without provoking serious mis- j of the spirit of empire in it It is tho conceptions of our motives, and ever embodiment, tho effectual embodiment, thoughtful man of affairs must wol of the spirit of law and independence come the altered circumstances of t tit , and liberty and mutual service, new day In whose light we now stand, A very notable body of men recently when there is no claim of guardian met in the city of Washington, at the ship or thought of wards, but Instead invitation aud as tho guests of this a full nud honorable association as ol government, whose deliberations are partners between ourselves and out likely to bo looked back to as marking neighbors in the interest of all Amer- j a memorable turning point in tho hls ica. north anil south. Our concern foi . torv of America. Thev were repre- the independence and prosperity of tin states of Central and South Amerkv ' is not altered. We retain unabated tlx j spirit that lias inspired us throughout the wholo life of our government and which was m. frankly put Into words by President Monroe. We still mean always to make a common cause ol TinHnl.nl tnili.tw.nilnncn nnrl nf nnllHnn. -v , - i",, liberty In America. But that purpost is now belter understood so far as it concerns ourselves.

But wo have at least proved thai we will not tiikp ndvnii; tage of lie In her distress and under: take to Impose upon her nn order and government of our own choosing. Lib erty Is often a ilerce nnd intractablo thing, to which no bounds can be Bet and to which no bounds of a few men's choosing ought ever to bo set. Every American who has drunk at fcne truo fountains of principle and trn flltlon must subscribe without reserva tion to tho high doctrine of tbo Vir ginia bill of rights, which In tho great days in .which our government was sot up was everywhere among us accept ed as the creed of freo men. That doc trine is, "That government Is or ought to bo Instituted for tho common bene fit, protection and security of tho peo ple, uatlou or community;" that "of nil the various modes and forms of government, that is the best which Is cuyublg tit producing the Kieutest de WILSON'S MESSAGE Photo by American Press Association. President Wilson Reading Message to Congress. Indefeasible right to reform, alter or abolish It in such manner as shall be Judged most conducive to the public weal." We have unhesitatingly ap plied that heroic principle to the case of Mexico and now hopefully await the rebirth of tho troubled republic, which had so much of which to purge Itself and so little sympathy from any outside quarter In the radical but nec essary process. Wo will aid and be friend Mexico, but we will not coerce her. and our course with regard to her ought to bo sufficient proof to all Amer ica that we seek no political suzerainty or selfish control. 

PAN-AMERICANISM HAS NONE OF EMPIRE'S SPIRIT. ' Economic Adjustments Inevitable With in the Next Generation. The moral is that tho states of Amer ica are not hostile rivals, but co-op erating friends, and that their grow ing sense of community of interest, alike in matters political and in mat ters economic, is likely to glvo them a new significance as factors in interna tional affairs and In the political his tory of tho world. It presents them as In a very deep and true sense a unit sentative spokesmen of tho several in dependent stntes of this hemisphere and were assembled to discuss the financial and commercial relations of I the republics of the two continents ! which nature aud political fortune have so intimately linked together.

Partnership and mutual udvau i BCI " l luo tcuora c. . . ments which tho world must inevitably witness 'within the nest generation, when peacs bhall have at last resumed Its healthful tasks. In tho perform ance of these tasks I bellovo tho Amer icas to bo destined to play their parts i together. I am Interested to fix your , attention on this prospect now becauso unless you tako It within your view and permit tho full significance of it to command your thought I cannot find tho right light In wllich to set forth tho particular matter that lies at tho very front of my wholo thought as I address you today. I mean national defense. No ono who really comprehends tho spirit of tho great peoplo for whom wo are appointed to speak can fall to per celvo that their passion is for peace, their genius best displayed In the prac tlco of tho arts of peace. Great democ racies aro not belligerent. They do not keek or duslro war. Their thought ut Declares That if Full Navy Program Is Carried out We Will Have a Fleet For Defense That Will Be "Fitted to Our Needs and Worthy of Our Traditions." Greatest Danger to Country Comes From Within Our Borders, of individual liberty and of the' frco labor that supports llfo and the un censored thought that quickens It. Conquest and dominion are not In our reckoning or agreeablo to our princi ples. But Just because -we demand un molested development and the undis turbed government of our own lives upon our own principles of right and liberty, we resent, from whatever quarter it may come, the aggression wo ourselves will not practice. Wo insist upou security In prosecuting our self chosen Hues of national development. Wo do more than that. Wo demand It also for others. Wo do not confine our enthusiasm for Individual liberty and frco national development to tho Inci dents aud movements of affairs which affect only ourselves. Wo feel It wher ever there is a people that tries to walk In these difficult paths of independence and right. From the first wo havo made common causo with all partisans of liberty on this sldo the sea and have deemed it as important that our neigh bors should bo free from all outsldo domination ns that wo ourselves should be; havo set America asido as a wholo for the uses of Independent nations and political freemen. Out of such thoughts grow nil our policies. We regard war merely as a means of asserting tho rights of a peo ple against aggression. And we are as fiercely Jealous of coercive or dicta torial power within our own nation ns of aggression from without. Wo will not maintain a standing army ex cept for uses which are as necessary in times of peace as in times of war, and we shall always see to it that our military peace establishment is no larger than is actually and continuous ly needed for tho uses of days In which no enemies movo against us. But wo do believe In a body of free citizens ready and sufficient to take care of themselves and of tho governments which they havo set up to servo them. In our constitutions themselves wo have commanded that "tho right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed," and our confidence has been that our safety in times of danger would He in tho rising of tho nation to take care of itself, as the farmers rose at Lexington. SUGGESTS BROAD PLAN FOR NATIONAL DEFENSE. Increase Standing Regular Force Four Hundred Thousand Citizen Soldiers. But war has never been a mere mat ter of men and guns. It is a thing of disciplined might If our citizens are ever to fight effectively upon a sudden summons, they must know how modern fighting Is done, aud what to do when the summons comes to render themselves immediately avail able and Immediately effective. And the government must be their servant In this matter, must supply them with tho training they need to take care of themselves and of it The military arm of their government, which they will not nllow to direct them, they may properly use to serve them and make their independence secure, and not their own independence merely, but the rights also of thoso with whom they have made common cause, should they also be put In Jeopardy. They must be fitted to play tho great rolo in the world, and particularly In this hemisphere, for which they are quali fied by principle nnd by chastened am bition to play. . " ,s wiin iiiese nicnis in minu uiai tno plau,s of tho department of war for Uioru adequate national defense were celved wh ch will be laid before you. which I urge you to sanction "nU put lnto ettectf "s 8,oon f, be' ca rb "ro"cr'y "'""Inlseil and d scussed -They S0CUJ tO U10 tllO eSSOlltlnl first iteps, and they seem to mo for tho I nfimnfir till Ti ri nit t 1 ' ?hoJ contemplate an lncrens-.. of tho standing force of the regular army fro,n "V'8'!0' 5-02J " ' cers and 102.0S5 enlisted men of all services to a strength of 7.K10 officers and 134,707 enlisted men, or 1-U.S13 all told, all services, rank and tile, by tho addition of fifty-two companies of coast artillery, fifteen companies of en gineers, ten regiments of infantry, four regiments of Held artillery and four aero squadrons, besides 750 officers re quired for a great variety of extra service, especially the ull Important duty of training tho citizen force of which I shall presently speak. 7!i' non commissioned officers for service In drill, recruiting nnd tho llko nnd tho necessary quota of enlisted men for the quartermaster corps, the hospital corps, tho ordnance department and other similar auxiliary services. Theso nro tho additions i.ecessnry to render tho army adequate for its present du ties, duties which it has to perform not only upon our own continental coasts aud borders and at our interior army posts, but also In tho rhlllpplnes, in tho Ilawallan Islands, nt tho isth mus nnd in Torto Itlco. By way of making tho country ready to assert some pnrt of its real power promptly and upon a larger scalo should occnslon nrlso tho plan also contemplates supplementing tho army by n force of 400,000 disciplined cltl rens, raised in Increments of 133.000 a year throughout a period of threo years. This It Is proposed to do by a process of enlistment under which tho serviceable men of tho country would be asked to bind themselves to servo with the colors for purposes of train ing for short periods throughout three years and to eomo to tho color at call at any time throughout nn additional "furlough" period of three years. This force of 100.000 men would be pro vided with personal accoutormcnts as fast ns enlisted nnd their equipment for tho field made ready to bo supplied nt any time. They would be assem bled for training nt stated Intervals at convenient places In association with sultablo units of tho regular army. Their period of annual training would not necessarily exceed two months in the year. It would depend upon tho patriotic feeling of tho younger men of tho country whether they responded to such a call to service or not. It would depend upon the patriotic spirit of tho employers of the country wheth er they made It possible for tho young er men in their employ to respond un der favorable conditions or not I for one do not doubt the patriotic devotion either of our young men or of thoso who glvo them employment those for whoso benefit nnd protection they would In fact enlist I would look forward to tho success of such an ex periment with entire confidence. At least so much by way of prepara tion for defense seems to me to be ab solutely Imperative now. We cannot do less. 

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN ' FOR GREATER NAVY. Always Looked to It as Our First and Chief Line of Defense. j Tho program which will be laid be fore you by the secretary of the navy Is similarly conceived. It involves only n shortening of tho time within which plans long matured shall be carried out, but It does make definite and ex- pliclt a program which has heretofore been only implicit, held in the mlnd9 of tho committees on naval affairs and disclosed In tho debates of tho two . houses, but nowhere formulated or for mally adopted. It seems to me very ) clear that it will be to tho advantage of tho country for tho congress to adopt a comprehensive plan for putting the navy upon n final footing of strength and efficiency nnd to press that plan ' to completion within tho next five years. Wo havo always looked to the navy of the country as our first and chief lino of defense; we have always seen it to bo our manifest course of prudence to bo strong on the seas. Year by year wo havo been creating a navy which now ranks very high in deed among tho navies of tho maritime nations. Wo should now definitely de termine how we shall complete what wo have begun and how soon. Tho program to be laid before you contemplates tho construction within five years of ten battleships, six battle cruisers, ten scout cruisers, fifty de stroyers, fifteen fleet submarines, eighty-five coast submarines, four gun boats, one hospital ship, two ammuni tion ships, two fuel oil ships and one repair ship. It is proposed that of this number we shall tho first year provide for tho construction of two battleships, two battle cruisers, three scout cruisers, , fifteen destroyers, five fleet submarines, I twenty-flvo coast submarines, two gun I boats and one hospital ship; the second year two battleships, ono scout cruiser, ten destroyers, four fleet submarines, I fifteen coast submarines, ono gunboat and one fuel oil ship; tho third year two battleships, ono battle cruiser, two scout cruisers, five destroyers, two fleet submarines and fifteen coast subma rines; tho fourth year two battleships, two battle cruisers, two scout cruisers, ten destroyers, two fleet submarines, fifteen coast submarines, ono ammuni tion ship and one fuel oil ship, and the fifth yenr two battleships, one bat tle cruiser, two scout cruisers, ten de stroyers, two fleet submarines, fifteen coast submarines, one gunboat, one am munition ship and one repair ship. Tho secretary of the navy Is asking also for the immediate addition to the personnel of tho navy of 7,500 sailors, 2,000 apprentice seamen nnd 1,500 ma rines. This increase would be suffi cient to care for the ships which are to bo completed within the fiscal year 1017 and nlso for tho number of men which must bo put in training to man the ships which will bo completed early In 191S. It is nlso necessary that tho number of midshipmen nt the Na val academy nt Annapolis should bo Increased by at least 300 in order that tho force of officers should be more rapidly added to, and authority Is ask ed to appoint, for engineering duties only, approved graduates of engineer ing colleges, nnd for service In tho avi ation corps a certain number of men taken from nlvil llfo. COUNTRY SHOULD HAVE 1 FINE MERCHANT MARINE. United States Should Be Iti Own Car rier on the Seas. If tills full program should be carried out we should havo built or building In 1021, according to the estimates of sur vival and standards of classification followed by the general bonrd of tho department, nn effective navy consist ing of 27 battleships of tho first line, 0 battle cruisers, 25 battleships of tho second line, 10 armored cruisers, 13 scout cruisers, fi first class cruisers, 3 second class cruisers, 10 third class cruisers, 10S destroyers, 18 fieet sub marines, ir.7 coast submarines, 0 mon itors, 20 gunboats, l supply ships, IS fuel ships, 4 transports, 3 tenders to torpedo vessels, 8 vessels of special types and two ammunition ships. This would bo n navy fitted to our needs and worthy of our traditions. Rut armies and instruments of war aro only part of what has to bo con sidered If wo nro to consider the su premo matter of national self sufficien cy nnd security in all Its aspects. Thero aro other great matters which will he thrust upon our atteutlon whether wo will or not. There Is, for example, n very pressing question of trado and shipping Involved In this great problem of national adequacy. It is necessary for many weighty rea sons of national offlcloncy nud devel opment that wo should havo a great merchant marine. Tho great merchant I flcot wo onco used o luaUo us rich, WARM FEET THE GREATEST COMFORT IN WINTER This store is headquarters for everything- in comfortable foot wear for men, women and children.

FLETCHER'S SHOE 10 Upper Church St., that great body of sturdy sailors who used to carry our flag into every sea, and who were tho prldo nnd often the bulwark of the nation, we havo almost driven out of existenco by inexcusable neglect and Indifference and by a hope lessly blind and provincial policy of so called economic protection. It Is high time wo repnired our mistake and resumed our commercial Independence on the seas. For It is a question of lndeiendoncc. If other nntlons go to war or seek to hamper each other's commerce our merchants, It seems, nro at their mer cy to do with as they please. Wo must use their ships and use them as they determine. We have not ships enough of our own. Wo cannot handle our own commerce on the seas. Our inde pendence is provincial, and is only on laud aud within our own borders. We nro not likely to be permitted to uso even the ships of other nations in ri valry of their own trado and aro with out means to extend our commerce even where tho doors are wide open and our goods desired. Such a situa tion is not to bo endured. It is of capi tal importance not only thnt the Unit ed Stntes should be Its own carrier on tho seas and enjoy tho economic Inde pendence which only nn adequate merchant marine would give it. but also that the American hemisphere ns a wholo should enjoy a like Independ ence and self sufficiency, If It Is not to be drawn Into the tangle of Kuro penn affairs. Without such independ ence tho wholo question of our polit ical unity nnd self determination Is very seriously clouded and complicated indeed. Moreover, we can develop no true or effective American policy without ships of our own not ships of war, but ships of peace, carrying goods and car rying much more; creating friendships and rendering lndlspeusablo services to all Interests on this side tho water. They must movo constantly back aud forth between tho Americas, They aro tho only shuttles thnt can weave the delicate fabric of sympathy, compre hension, confidence nnd mutual de pendence In which wo wish to clotho our policy of America for Americans. Tho tnsk of building up an adequnto merchant marine for America private capital must ultimately undertake nnd achieve, as it has undertaken nnd achieved every other like task among '.is In tbo past, with admirable enter prise, intelligence nnd vigor, aud It seems to me n manifest dictate of wis dom that wo should promptly remove every legal obstacle thnt may stand In the way of this much to bo desired re vival of our old Independence nnd should facilitate in every possible way the building, purchase and American registration of ships. Hut capital can not accomplish this great task of a sudden. It must embark upon It by degrees, ns tho opportunities of trado dovelop. Something must bo done at ouce, done to open routes and develop opportunities whero they are as yet undeveloped, done to open tho arteries of trnde whero tho currents havo not yet learned to run, especially between tho two American continents, where they are, singularly enough, yet to he created nud quickened, nnd It Is evi dent that only the government rn un dertake such beginnings nnd assume the Initial financial risks. When the risk has passed and private cnpltnl be gln to find Its way In sufficient nbun dauco into theso now channels tho gov ernment may withdraw. But it can not omit to begin. It should tako tho first steps, and should take them at once. Our goods must not lie piled up nt our ports and stored upon side tracks in freight cars whWi are daily needed on tho roads, must uot be left without means of transport to any for eign quarter. Wo must not await tho permission of foreign shipowners and foreign governments to send them where we will. With n view to meeting theso press ing necessities of our commerce nnd availing ourselves nt the earliest possi ble moment of the present unparalleled opportunity of linking the two Ameri cas together in bonds of mutual inter est nnd service, an opportunity which may never return again If we miss It now, proposals will be made to tho 1 present congress for tho purchase or I construction of ships to bo owned nnd directed by tho government similar to thoso made to the last congress, but modified in some essential particulars. 1 recommend theso proposals to you for your prompt acceptance with tho moro confidence because every month that has elapsed since the former pro posals were made has made the ne cessity for such nction moro and moro manifestly Imperative. That need was then foreseen. It is now acutely felt nnd everywhere realized by tlioe for whom trade Is waiting, but who can find no conveyance for their goods. I am not so much interested in the par ticulars of the program as I am In taking Immedinte advantage of the great opportunity which awaits us if we will but act In this emergency. In this matter, as in all others, a spirit of common counsel should prevail, and out of It should come nn early solu tion of this pressing problem. 

SHOULD AGREE ON POLICY i IN THE PHILIPPINES.' i Recommends Early Adoption of Meas- j ures Giving Them Fuller Justice. Thero 13 another matter which seems to mo to be very lutimutely associated with the question of national safety and preparation for defense. That Is our policy toward tho Philippines nnd tho people of Porto UIco. Our treat ment of them and their nttltudo to ward us are manifestly of tho first con sequence In the development of our duties In the world and In getting a free baud to perform those duties. Wo must bo free from every unnecessary burden or embarrassment, and thero Is no better way to be clear of em barrassment than to fulfill our prom ises and promote tho Interests of thoso dependent on us to tho utmost. Bills for the alteration and reform of tho government of tho Philippines nnd for rendering fuller political justlco to tho peoplo of Porto Itlco were submitted to tho Sixty-third congress. They will bo submitted also to you. I need not partlcului'izo their details. You nro most of you already familiar with them, nut I do recommend them to your early adoptlou with the sincere conviction that thero nro few measures you could adopt which would moro servlceably clear the way for tho great policies by which wo wish to make good, now nnd lwnys, our right to lead In enterprises of peaco and good will nud economic and political freedom. Tho plans for tho armed forces of tho natlou which I havo outlined aud STORE Burlington, Vt. J for the general policy of adequate prep aration for mobilization and defense Involve, of course, very large addition al expendlturce of money, expenditures which will considerably exceed the es timated revenues of tho government. It Is mnde my duty by law whenever tho estimates of expenditure exceed the estimates of revenue to call tha attention of the congress to the fact and suggest any means of meeting tha deficiency that It may he wise or pos sible for mo to suggest. I am ready to believe that it would be my duty to do so In any case, nnd I feel particu larly bound to speak of the matter when It nppenrs that the deficiency will nrlso directly out of the adoption by the congress of measures which I my self urgo it to adopt Allow me there fore to speak briefly of the present state of tho treasury nnd of the fiscal problems which tho next year will probably disclose. On tho SOth of Juno last thero was an available balance In the general fund of the treasury of $104,170,105.78. The total estimated receipts for the) year 1010, on tho assumption thnt tha emergency revenue measure passed by the last congress will not be extended beyond its present limit, the 31st of December, 1015, nnd Hint the present duty of 1 cent per pound on sugar will lie discontinued after the 1st of May, li'IO. will bo 8070,303.500. Tho balauca of June Inst and those estimated rev enues come therefore to a grand total of S774.535.C03.7S. The total estimated disbursements for the prcsout fiscal yenr, Including twenty-live millions for tho Panama canal, twelve millions for probable deficiency appropriations audi $50,000 for miscellaneous debt redem tlons, will be S753.S01.000, nnd the bnl mice in the general fund of the treas ury will bo reduced to $20.(54-4.605.78. The emergency revenue net If contin ued beyond Its present time limitation would produce during the half year then remaining about forty.one mil lions. The duty of 1 cent per pound on susfnr if continued would produca during the two months of the fiscal year remaining nfter the 1st of May about fifteen millions. These two sums, amounting together to fifty-six mil lions. If added to the revenues of tho second half of the fiscal year would yield the treasury at the eud of tho yenr an nvallahle balance of S7G.C44, f.05.78. Tho additional revenues required to carry out tho program of military and nnvnl preparation of which I have spoken would, ns nt present estimated, bo for the fiscal year 1017 $93,800,000. Those figures, taken with the figure!' for the present flscnl vesr which I havo already given, dlscloso our flnan clal problem for tho year 1017. As suming that the tuxes Imposed by tha emergency revenue act and tho pres eut duty on sugar aro to be discontin ued aud that the balance at the close sf tho present fiscal year will be only $20,044,003.78, thut tlL' disbursement for the Panama canal will agaiu bj about $25,000,000 aud that the addl tloual expenditures for tho army nud uuvy nro authorized by the congress, the deficit in the general fund of tht treasury on the 30th of June, 1017, will bo nearly $235,000,000. To this sum at least $50,000,000 should bo add ed to represent u sufo working balance; for tho treasury aud $12,000,000 to lu cludo tho usual deficiency estimates in 1017. uud theso additions would maka a total deficit of somo $207,000,000. If tho present tuxes should be continued
