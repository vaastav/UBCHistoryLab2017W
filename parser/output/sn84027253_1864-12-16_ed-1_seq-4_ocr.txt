Once more have the wise heads of the nation assembled in the National Capi tal to legislate ior the weal or woe of the Republic I don't know whether pro tem., S-ayerby called to order, after which, Rev. Mr. Bowman, the Chaplain, offered a fervent prayer.— After transacting some business ofjni Hor importance the Senate adjourned. In the House of Representatives a was offered up to the Throue of race the Rev. Mr. Channing, the able and eloquent Chaplain of that oodv. The President's message was not lead it will undoubtedly appear to morrow. One of the first measures of vital im portance which will come before Con gress will undoubtedly be an amend ment to the Constitution abolishing slavery. The institution which has been the bane of our political institu tions must be gotten out of the way.— This dark and damnable stain must be wiped from our national escutcheon.— The amendment was defeated last win ter—this session it will undoubtedly be adopted. It is somewhat amusing to visit the principal hotels in this city, about the Hme Congress re-assembles. It is a *ood place to study human nature. I "went the rounds" this evening and Miw nearly every one I knew in Wash ington, and many I didn't know. Our Iowa men are" all wide awake, for Hawkeyes generally keep their eyes and ears open. This evening I saw sev eral of them on the alert for news news of any description—political, financial or military. About the hardest worker I kuow of here is your old correspondent L. D. In gersoll, known to the reading public by the nome dc plume eay, of of'' Linkensale."' He works seven hours a day at the Treasury and about ten at home, giving the other seven, as he laughingly says himself, to "fun, sleeping, eating^md prayer. He is well fixed for literary labor. In very truth, I know of no one who is better situated in that way. His home is comfortable, having an air of ta ste and refinement all about it. In his parlor are several fine oil-paintings, one of them being a short-trowsered .Hews-boy. That was taken while I Was a boy, says Link. Another is a rtrait of his beautiful little daughter a gol leu-haired girl, between live and six, who has taught herself to read and write. (She writes printed letters.) But where I like to be the best is in his back parlor, which he calls his "den." Here is where he used to write his let ters for the Journal, where now he writes for the Desmoines Register, and is arranging, scissoring, studying and writing on his "History of the Iowa Troops." On the walls are several eugravings. Right above his great writing table ia a group of four—Washington, Shakspeare, Webster and Cooper. His table is all mind, in reading trom books which may have something to say bearing on mat- \i'MVUS I asked him how he was ever going to get his history done, if he had so much reading about every battle. "Well." lie said, "as soon as Fremont and Frank Blair get out of the way I have but lit tle trouble comparatively. We thrashed 'em so unmercifully after that for the most part, that even the rebel writers admit 'reverses.' Ijinkinsale is giving to this work great labor, much more than any one would be likely to suppose. But it Is all labor of iove. He is an enthusiast on Iowa 'generally, and especially on Iowa troops. He declares that Iowa has handsomer girl?- better soldiers, aler Qei. rals, liner babies, and mis'e corn to the acre, than any other hitate i i the Union. He has jast completed a biog Ebphy of the lamented Ceneral S. A. Bice, for the Iowa Annals, ture to predict will be greatly liked by the people of our State. But enough for the present. I have said so much, about your old friend be cause I wanted to do something in this my first essay, in your columns, toward repaying him for the many, very many, Kind words he has there said for so iipany Iowans, myself among the mim lier, whom he esteemed good eggs.'' You have doubtless ere this been ap ixed of the capture and escape of Capt. ohn F. Skelton, Oo. D, 17th Iowa ln _ntry. John is lucky and no mistake, this is the second time he .s been taken prisoner and made his exit from jebel clutches by means of his native sense and nimble heels. I'll bet he fcears a charmed life. He is now here— Will leave for Iowa soon. Sol ri I see by the Newton Press that my es lemed and energetic friend, John A. ,amb, P. M., has departed from the ate of single-blessedness to tjhe enjoy lent of married life. Farewell, John ill didn't think you were going to leave *s*»^®eour bachelor friends so soon. Like the lagt roge of summer 1 .Oil- Sr. 'anby had a with bis Flock mmDifficulty all the members and Senators are yet here. It is to be hoped that some of them may get lost on the way and never arrive. The country could well spare them. I understand that "Sunset" Cox and James A. McDougalare both in the city. I am quite sure the latter is, for I saw him this afternoon at Willard's Hotel, imbibing very freely from a bottle of •fcOh! be joyful." Both these two wor thies are, to use a familiar phrase, about played out," as both are invet erate Cops. Nobody is sorry for it.— There is quite a rush of population here just now. Pennsylvania Avenue is con tinually lined on both sides with pedes trians wending their way here and there. At the hour for the re-assembling of Congress to-day, the galleries of both houses were packed to overflowing.

Potomac. Look out for people who are ha­ bitually suspicious and ready to believe --that others act from bad motives. In many cases the evil they attribute to i others is only what they feel inclined to do themselves. New York was never so crowded as now. Furnished houses rent at $200 to $1,000 a month, and hotels are crowded at a day. On2 the Wing, i Nov. the 10, '64. i The dy is kast! All in ore!
