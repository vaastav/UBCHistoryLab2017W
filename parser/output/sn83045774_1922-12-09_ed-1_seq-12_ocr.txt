SATURDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1922. ffijl m President Harding's Message. President Hardinc's message to Congress is tilled to the brim with [Issues and questions that come home to all the American people. It radiates the clear vision and common * sense which have so strikingly marked his policies and programs I from the beginning of his term of office as Chief Executive. It will command the attention which is the due of big, practical purpose based upon the penetrating conclusion that "there never again will be the old order of things." Within the reasonable compass of an editorial discussion it would not be possible to go into all the matters the President so fully covers with v the clarity of a singularly straight thinker and the skill of a master of j plain expression. A few examples of j what he proposes to and urges upon j Congress will serve to show, however, the grasp this man has of the , problems that face alike the country \ . and the world. For the rest it will / richly pay every thinking American to read closely this message which The New York Herald does not hes- j Itate to say is the most telling and j the most cogent of the many very line state papers he has issued from the White House. What sound mind, for instance, can challenge the President's conclusion that if the Government is to regulate both wages and rates, railroad wage fixing should be lodged with the same authority as railroad rate making? Since the Interstate Commerce Commission alone has the power to add to or subtract from the incomes of the roads the Interstate Commerce Commission alone should be charged with the responsibility of determining how much of that income thus determined by itself should be absorbed by labor charges, which are the great bulk of railroad operating expenses. Again there may be room for argu ment as to whether men should ever he compelled to work against their will, even in the case of public service corporations; but if they are to , have their wages set for them by a Government body and if there is to be a power of enforcement of its orders by a Government body that authority should be exercised by the body charged with making both the traffic rates and th*, vage rates. In the same way President Harping gets at the very essence of railway service, railw- * economics und at the same time reasonable transportation rates when he asks Congress to do something concrete toward putting the roads into a few great systems, pooling their freight cars and otherwise obtaining the largest possible results on the lines of modern business methods on a grand scale. There is no bigger v ork ahead of the American nation j than that. The President also goes to the heart of the agricultural problem, pointing out that better rural banking credits and banking facilities are essential for the farmer and for the country. But that will not be enough. The business of the farmer and the welfare of the consumer of food products depend very largely on the means of sending tho farm products to market speedily, safely and cheaply. And hII this is comprehended in the President's program for the railway zoning system, the joining of tbo rate making power and of the wage making power in cne authority and the coordination of water and highway with rail 'P movements. The President's demand for a correction of child labor abuses by legal changes that will stand the test of V the courts is not merely the Impulse ,J' of his heart, always specially warm where children are concerned: It Is 1] the reflection of the American sentl-1 tui ment that small rh 'dren should not ; be subjected to tnrd?n?'me labor and the American demand that the means shall be found to prevent such things. ) This Is a problem the American peo|. pie are deferar. ned to have worked wj oat As for President Haapivc'a deelarajftf tion that the dry lows should be obey HI m long ae they are t be laws of the country, good citizens will agree with him that this is a proposition which cannot be contradicted in logic, or in morals. The question will i remain, however, and it is a great nationwide question, whether the iaw will be respected nevertheless, where public opinion is against it, and whether it can be enforced. The Cure for Europe. All Europe is economically sick. All Europe is so closely knit together, the various States so interdependent, each on all, that Europe is as a human entity. With one part diseased the whole body is affected, and Gtrmany, with the demoralization of her currency, with an indemnity hanging over her that benumbs the brain and paralyzes all purpose to dig out; and with internal dissensions that threaten the overthrow of government and the overthrow of law and order and threaten anarchy itself; with poverty and depression and discouragement and misery among the poor, and with the gaunt Nfigure of national bankruptcy stalking through the land? Germany is sick unto death. And with Germany in this condition there can be no return to health for the rest of Europe. The thing for Europe to do is to get Germany well so that it will have a chance to get well itself. The .allied Premiers are meeting to-day in London to discuss reparations in preparation for the proposed Brussels conference. If the discussion hinges 011 the question of the last cent that can be hammered out of Germany, as has been the attitude of the Allies from first to last, the work of the Premiers will be a flat failure. If, on the other hand, the Premiers should have the big view of the situation In all its seriousness and ; should take the stand that Europe [ must be brought back to health at any sacrifice of indemnities or anyi thine else, thev will forestall interna j tional disaster and initiate a move j that will put Europe on its feet l again. The very heart of the question that confronts the allied Premiers is this: How much can the Allies permit Germany to pay in indemnities and be certain that the amount is not so large that it will stand in the way of her rapid restoration to economic health and to national health? For Germany's restoration to health would mean the restoration to economic health of all the rest of Europe. This is the big question in the big sense that should dominate at the meeting of the Premiers, for it is the one way out for groping, distressed Europe. There is nothing in lashing a people to do the thing that-is not humanly possible for them to do. It is the cure we want, not the i lash. The lash has well nigh i wrecked all Europe. From Socialism to Tammany. In 1920 the total number of ballots cast for Cannon,. Quinn and Malone, candidates for Governor of New York State respectively of the Socialist, the Socialist Labor and the Farmer-Labor parties, was 334,727. This year Casnipy, candidate of j the Socialist, Farmer-Labor and ' Socialist Farm-Labor parties, and Crowley, candidate of the Socialist! ' Labor party, polled together 112,435. | In each election these candidates j represent with more or less enthusi- i asm and accuracy what loud voiced agitators call the social revolution | in certain of the aspects of that ! nebulous but noisy revolt. The I shrinkage of their vote from 1920 to 1922?a shrinkage in the FarmerLabor vote which eliminates that party from the list of legally recog- I nized political parties?is commonly j ascribed to the absorption of their votes into the Democratic Tammany ranks on account of the radical naI ture of the platform on which At, Smith was elected Governor. A sobering thought, even an alarming thought, is presented in this explanation of the diminution of the radical vote. Does socialism, radicalism, social revolt lead eventually to Tammany Hall? It never | has before. The Plain People'* Money. In all the rest of the world there is nothing comparable to the financial power of the rank and file of the American people. In 5,000 banking institutions of the country there is now going on a distribution of $190,000,000 of so-called Christmas I club funds. This money has been ! put by for months in small amounts j ! of,r?vl WJMklr in pnvrr itla honnaitaru1 I? ~ I Christmas shopping. But that !a not all there is to the national fund especially put by for Christmas?put by for the Christmas spending of the general public. In thousands of other hanks depositors have been keeping Christmas Items in reserve In their regular deposit accounts. Furthermore, men, women and children the country over have been tucking away In safe places both loose change and small bills for the festivities and Joys of the season. . The total of all these Christmas club funds, formal and Informal,! could scarcely count less than a j quarter of a billion of dollars; It j j might run nearer to half ? billion [ of dollars. Besides those Christmas funds there is coming due on New Year's Day f625.000.000 of war savings stamps which In the great bulk belong to the wage earners of the country. And that is not all the investment they j have in the securities of the coun- i try. They have great quantities of 11 the lower denominations of Liberty|l bonds and notd#. Nobody knows j| t . THE NE what these total in dollars, so far as concerns the wage earners and other small investors, but no responsible estimate has ever placed the amount low in the hundreds of millions; it is very high in the hundreds of millions. And even that is not all the saved wealth owned and at the command of the rank and file of the American people. In the savings banks of the United States for 1920 there were 11,437,556 accounts with deposits of more than six and a half billions of dollars. Incomplete figures for the current period Indicate that these savings banks accounts now total approximately eight billions of dollars. With the deposits that small savers carry in the savings departments of trust companies and other banks the grand total of the American people's savings accounts Is estimated to run now between ten and eleven billions of dollars. And there Is more yet. It is in the form of the small shareholdings which employees as well as general investors have acquired in great corporations like the Pennsylvania Railroad, the United States Steel Corporation and the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. Whether this is tens of millions or hundreds of millions of dollars there is no sure way of telling now, but as there are hundreds of thousands of such small investors on the stock books of merely a few of the great companies it is easy to see that with an average of only ten shares of such stock, 1,000,000 small shareholders would mean 10,000,000 shares thus distributed, which at an average value of $75 a share would be threeouarters of a billion of dollars. In all those small savings and investments, therefore, there cannot be less than thirteen billions of dollars; there may easily be more than fifteen billions of dollars?and in value form that is almost ready to cash in, for the man who needs or wants to cash in, at sight. The Free State Strikes Back. The news from Ireland is bitter stuff for those who had hoped that the Free State would be able to begin its labors in an atmosphere of peace. With an overwhelming majority of the people of the south in favor of the new Government it was believed that the insurgents might be led, either by the conciliatory policy of the State or the lack of support in the country, to lay down their arms. But the insurgents ceased to be soldiers only to become assassins. Wa a Via 11 nnf oav tViat iliov Ucaaccl. Dated Collins, for he was ready for battle when ambushed and it was give and take until the great young leader fell. But the killing of Sean H-u.es on Thursday was assassination. That it was the beginning of a concerted movement to kill, one by one, the members of the Chamber of Deputies is suggested by the Irish army authorities. The Free State's answer to the killing of Hales is grim indeed. It might have executed Rory O'Connor and Liam Melloweh for their revolt against the Government, but it has gone further than that in announcing that these insurgent leaders were banged in reprisal for the shooting of Hai.es. Reprisal is usually to be condemned as something which does not accomplish the result desired. It la a rnlllne hall that eathers blood and hatred as It goes. But for all that, what answer will appeal to the deluded followers of Dk Valeba except death and terror? They have exulted over the killing of Cow.ins, who, with Griffith, won for Ireland more freedom than O'Connell or Parnklt, ever dreamed the island could have. They have kept the country in fear of their raids. They have sworn to fight to tha last for their cause?a cause which could mean nothing hut chaos and the ultimate return of British control. They have rejected the Free State's offer of peace with amnesty. They have scorned the advice and the pleas of their people and their clergy. Ireland must and will find herself. She must cope with a sly, ruthless and fanatical enemy in her own way. And if she sometimes strikes very hard, as she struck yesterday, it must be remembered that the punishing hand is tho hand that was scorned only a few weekR ago when it was extended in friendship and mercy. Road Building on a Big Scale. I In the fiscal year 1922 there were completed in the United States 10,000 miles of highways built with Federal aid, and more than that mileage In the construction of which tho Government gave no assistance. These figures, prepared by the Bureau <11 i 

IIIMK Xll/mo Ul IIIC <W II I ICU DMinn Department of Agriculture, together with the program for future construction, give ground for the hope that In a few years the United States will have an adequate system of modern highways. The work completed between July, 1921, and June, 1922, Inclusive was sufficient in mileage to provide a highway twice around the borders of the country, with something to spare. The total length of the highways built in that period nearly equals the circumference of the earth at the equator. Most of the roads built in the fiscal year were finished before the new federal aid act became effective, on November 9, 1921. Few projects were in preparation by the States as the old ones approached completion. The act, however, gave a great Impetus to plans for State construction, and by Junff, 1922, projects embracing nearly 40,000 miles were called I 'or. There are at present under con W
