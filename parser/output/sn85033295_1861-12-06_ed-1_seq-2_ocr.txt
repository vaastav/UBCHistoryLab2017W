WATERTOWN REPUBLICAN. FRIDAY, DECEMBER 6, ISO!, i, W. LAWTON & J. T. MOAR, Editors. • The Star Spangled Banner, in triumph shall wave, O'er the landof the Free and tho homo f the Brave.” 1 Ifany one attempti to haul down the American !*,*hoot him on the spot.” —John A. JJix. President's Message. To the exclusion of other matter we present our readers with this document. It will be found all that the most ardent friends of the Union could desire. Tub Mason and Slidell Affair.— The New York Times suggests that with re gard to the seizure of Messrs. Mason and Slidell, it may be worth while to remember that in the instructions which Mr. Toombs, as the rebel Secretary of State, has given to privateers, may be found the fol lowing passage: “Neutral vessels con veying enemies’ dispatches or military persons in the service of the enemy, for feit their neutral character, and are liable to capture and condemnation.” If we had applied this general rule to the Trent, she would have been lying in one of our har bors as a prize. Mr. Colfax made a motion to confine I lason in a felon’s cell until rebels treat Col Corcoran differently. Mr. Conkling moved an inquiry concern ing Ball'. Bluff. Col. Kerrigan, of N. Y. city, a mem ber of Congress, and Col. in the army, has been aonviced of treason, and senten ced to be shot. A resolution was introduced into the Kanawha Convention to make the new State Free. Beaufort is to be occupied by 5,000 troops to prevent the secessionists taking possession. On the evening of tho 2i inst., Sec. Seward told a party which serenaded him that in ton days the country would rejoice at great news. Latest advices from Charleston state the rebels there arc greatly alarmed, soma reeemmending its surrender, and others that the city be burned, rather than fall into the hands of the Union forces. President’s Message. Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives: In the midst of unprecedented political troubles, we have cause of great gratitude to God for unusual good health and most abundant harvests. You will not be sur prised to learn th.it in die peculiar exigen cies of the times our intercouise with for eign nations has been attended with pro found solicitude—chiefly turning upon our own domestic affairs. A disloyal portion of the American peopiehave during the whole year been engaged in an attempt to divide and destroy the Union. A nation which endures factious domestic divisions, is ex posed to disrespect abroad, and one party or both, is sure, sooner or later, to invoke foreign intervention. Nations thus tempted to interfere are not always able to resist the counsels of seem ing expediency and ungenerous ambition, although measures adopted under such in fluences seldom fail to be unfortunate and injurious to those adopting them. The dis loyal citizens of the United States, who of fered the ruin of our country in reward for the aid and comfort which they have invoked, have received less patronage and encouragement than they probably expect ed; if it were just to suppose, as the insur gents have seemed to assume, that foreign nations, in this case, disregarding all moral, social and treaty obligations, would act solely and selfishly for the most speedy restoration of commerce, including especi ally the acquisition of cotton. Those na tions appear as yet nut have seen their way to their object more directly or clearly through the destruction than the preserva tion of Union. If we could dare to believe that foreign nations are actuated by no higher princi ple than this, I am quite sure a second ar gument could be made to show them that they could reach their aim more readily and easily by aiding to crush tills rebellion, than by giving encouragement to the prin cipal lever relied on, by the exciting of foreign nations to hostility against us, as already intimated, is the embarrassment of commerce. Those nations, however, not improbably saw from the first that it was the Union which made as well our for eign as our domestic commerce. They can scarcely fail to perceive that the effort for disunion produces the existing diffi culty and that one strong nation promises more durable peace, and a more extensive, valuable and reliable commerce than can the same nation broken into hostile frag ments. Ii is not mv purpose to review our dis cussions with foreign States, because what ever might be their wishes or dispositions, the integrity of our country, and the sta bility of our government 'mainly depend not upon them, but upon the loyalty, patri otism, virtue and intelligence of Ameri can people. The correspondence itself with the usual reservations is herewith ■ubmitted. I venture to hope it will appear that wo have practiced prudence and liberality to wards foreign powers, avering causes of irritation, and with firmness, maintaining our own rights and honor. Since, how ever, it is apparent that there as in every other State, foreign dangers necessarily attend domestic difficulties, I recommend that adequate and ample measures be adopted lor maintaining die public de fenses on every side, while under this genera! recommendation provision for de fending our coast line, readily occurs to the mind. Also in the same connection I ask the attention of Congress to cur great Jakes and rivers. It is believed that some fortifications and depots of arms and munitions, with harbors and navigation improvements at well selected points upon these would be 1 of great importance to the natural defence and preservation. I a-k attention to the views of the S- rotary of War. ed in his report upon lire same general subject. I deem it of importance that tbe loyal regions of i2 •st Teene-.-rd and West ern Noth Caroii .a should be connected with Kentucky, and other faithful parts of the Union, by railroad. 1 therefore rec ommend, as a railita-.y me~.su:e, ih.it Con gress provide for the oon?'i u nidi, of such | a road as speedily as possible. Kentucky will no doubt co-operate, and j though her legislature make the most ju I dicious selection of the line. The north ern terminus must connect with some ex isting Railroad, and whether tire route shall be from L xingon or Nicholasville to Cumberland gap, or from Lebenon to the Knoxville, or some still different line, can easily be determined. Kentucky and tbe General government co-operating, the road can be completed in a veiy short time, and when done it will not only be of vast present usefulness, but also an available permanent improvers nt worth its cost in all the future. Some treaties designed chiefly for the interests of commerce,and having no grave political importance, have been negotiated and will bj submitted to the Senate for their considerati n. Although we have failed to induce some of the commercial powers to adopt a desirable amelioration for the rigor of maritime war. vve have far removed all the obstacles from the way of their humane reform, except such as are merely of temporaiy and accidental occur rence. I invite your attention to the correspond ence between Her Bi ittanic Majesty’s Min ister, accredited to this Government, and the Secretary of State, relative to the deten tion of the British Ship Perthshire, in Juno last, by the United Stales Steamer Mtssa chusetts for a supposed breach of the block ade. As this detention was occasioned by an obvious misapprehension of the facts and as justice requires that we should commit no beliigeienl act, not founded on strict right, as sanctioned by public law, I recommend that an appropriation be made to satisfy the reasonable demand of the owners for her detention i I repeat the recommendation of my pred j ecessor, in his dm u-d message lo Congress in December lasi, in regard lo the dis position of the sur lus which will probably remain after satisfying the claims of American citizens against China, pursuant to the awards of the Commissioners, un der the act of the 2d of March, 1859. If, however, it should not be deemed ad visable to cany that recommendation into effect, I would suggest that authority be given for investing the principle over the surplus referred Lo in good securities, with a view to such other just claims of our citizens against Cnina as are not unlikely to arise hereafter in the course of oar ex tensive trade with that empire. By the act of the sih of August last. Congress authorized the President lo in struct the Commodores of suitable vessels to defend themselves against, and to cap ture pirates. This authority has been ex ercised in a sing’e instance. For the more effectual protection of our extensive and valuable commerce, in the Eastern seas, especially, it seems to me that it would also be advisable to author ize the commanders of sailing vessels to recapture any prizes which pirates may make of United Stales veseis and their car goes, and the consular courts, established j by law in Eastern countries, to adjudicate the cases, in the event that litis should not be objected to by the local authorities. If any good reason fxists why we should persevere in withholding our re cognition of the independence and sove reignty of Hayti and'Liberia, I am unable to discern it; unwilling, however, to in augerato a novel policy in regard to them without the approbation of Congress, I submit for your consideration, the expedi ency of an appropriation for maintaining a Charge d’Affairs at each of these States. It does not admit of doubt that important commercial advantages might he secured by favorable treaties with them. The operations of the Treasury during the period which has elapsed since your adjournment, have been conducted with signal success. The patriotism of the peo ple has placed at the disposal of the Gov ernment, the large means demanded by the public exigencies. Much of the Na tional Loan has been taken by citizens of the industrial classes, whose confidence in in tiieir country’s faith, and zeal for their country’s deliverence from its present per il, have induced them to contribute to the support of the Government the whole of their limited acquisitions. This fact imposes peculiar obligations to economy in disbursment and energy in ac tion. The revenue from all sources, in cluding loans for the financial year end ing 30th June, 1861, was §86.83590027 and the expenditures for the same period, including payments on accounts of the public dept, were §B4 578,034 34; leav ing a balance in the treasury on the Ist of July, of 62,257,065 80 for the first quar ter of the financial year, ending 30 Sep tember 1861. The receipts from *ll sources, including the balance from July Ist, were §102,- 532.5 '9 27, and the expenses 698,239,- 733 09. Leaving a balance on the Ist of October 1861 of 4,292,776,18. Estimates for the remaining three quar- i ters of the year, and for the financial year I of 1863, together with his views of the | ways and means of meeting the demands contemplated by them, will be submitted to Congress by the Secretary of the Treas- 1 ury. It is gratifying to know that the expen ses m ,de necessary by the rebellion are not beyond the resources of the loyal people, and to believe that the same patriotism which has thus far sustained the govern ment will continue to sustain it till peace and Union shall again bless the land. I respectfully lefcr to the report of the Secretary of war for information respecting the numerical strength of the army, and for recommendations having in view an in crease ot its efficiency and the well-being of the various branches of the service en trusted to his car-’. It is gratifying to know that the patriotism of the people is equal to the occasion, and tha; the number of troops tendered greatly exceeds the force which Congress author zed me to call into the field. I refer with pleasure to those portions of his report which make allusion to the creditable degree of discipline already at tained by our troops, and to the excellent sanitary condition of the army. The rec ommendation by the Secretary for an or ganization of the militia upon a uniform basis is a subject of vital importance to tha future safety of the country, and is commended to the serious attention of Congress. A largo addition to the regular army in connection with tho defection that has so considerably diminished the number ef its officers give peculiar importance to his re commendation about increasing the corps f cadets to the greatest capacity of the By mere omission resume/Congress failed to s*r- vide chaplains for the hospi tals i ccU|': :d by volunteers. This sub ject was brought to my norice and I was induced tu draw up the form of a letter, one form of which, properly addressed to each of the persons, and at the dates re spectively named and stated in the sched ule containing also fha letter, marked A. and hero with transmitted. Those Generals entered upon the duties designated, at the times respectively sta ted in the schedule, and have labored faith fully therein ever since. I thereforth rec oin. need that they be compensated at the same rate as chaplains in the army. I further suggest that general provision be made for chaplains to serve at hospitals as f well as with regiments. The report of the Secretary of the Na | vy presents, in detail, tbe operations of that branch of the service, and the activi ty ami energy which have characterized ] its administration and the results of meas i ures tv. increase its efficiency and power. Such have been the additions by con struction and purchase, that it may almost be said that a navy has been created and brought into service since our difficulties | connneno ed. Besides blockading cur ex ; tensive coast, squadrons larger than ever I before- assembled under our flag, have been j put afloat and performed d**eds, which I have increased our naval renown. I wcul i invite special attention to tlie rocoinmendation of the Secretary of the Navy for a more perfect organization of the Navy, by introducing additional grades in the service. The present organization is defective and unsatisfactory, and the suggestions submitted by the Department will, it is believed, if adopted, obviate the difficulties alluded to. promote harmony, and increase the efficiency of the Navy. There are three vacancies on the bench of the Supreme Court. Two by tbe de cease of Justices Daniels and McLean, and cue by resignation of Justice Campbell.— T have so far forborne malting nominations to nil these vacancies, for reasons which I will now state : Two of the outgoing Judges resided within States now overrun with revolt, so that, were successors appointed within the same localities, they could not serve up on the circuits and many of the most com j men there probably would not take the personal hazard of accepting to serve even here upon the Supreme Bench. I have been unwilling to throw’ all the appointments Northward, thus disabling myself from doing justice to the South on tbe return of peace. Although, I may re mark, that to transfer to the North one which has been heretofore in the South would not, with reference to territory and population, be unjust. During the long and brilliant judicial career of Judge McLean, his circuit grew into an empire altogether too large for any one Judge to give the courts therein more than a nominal attendance—rising in population from 1,470,000 in 1831. to 6,- 151,405 in 1860. Besides this the country has generally outgrown our present judicial system. If unit'd rnity was at all intended, the system requires that all the States shall be accom modated with circuit courts attended by supreme judges, when in fact, Wisconsin, Minnesota, lowa, Kansas, Florida, Texas, California and Oregon have never had any such court, nor can this be well remedied without a change of the system, because the adding.'of justices to the supreme court, enough for the accommodation of all parts of the country with circuit courts, would create a court altogether too dangerous for a judicial body of any court, and the rule of it be ono that will increase, as new states come into the union. Circuit courts are useful or they arc not useful. If useful, no State should be de nied thorn ; if not useful, no state should have them. Let them be provided for all or abolished as to all. Three modifica tions occur to me here, which I think wo’d be an improvement upon our present sys tem. Let the Supreme Court be of sufficient number in every event. Then first, let the whole country be divided into circuits of convenient size, the Supreme Judges to serve in a number of them corresponding to their number, and independent Circuit Judges provided for all the rest. Or sec ondly, the Supreme Judges be rested from Circuit duties, and Circuit Judges be pro vide! for all the circuits. Or thirdly, dispense with Circuit Courts altogether, leaving the judicial functions wholly to the district courts, and an independent Su preme Court. I respectfully recommend to the consid eration of Congress the present condition of the statute laws, with the hope that Congress will be able to find an easy rem edy for the many inconveniences and evils which constantly embarrass those engaged in the practical administration of them. Since the organization of the govern ment Congress has enacted some 5000 acts and joint resolutions, which fill more than six thousand closely printed pages, and are scattered through many volumes. Many of these acts have been drawn in haste and without sufficient caution, so that their provisions aro often obscure in themselves, or in conflict with each other, or at least so doubtful as to render it very difficult for the best informed persons to ascertain precisely what the statute law really is. It seems to me very important that tho statute jaw should be made as plain and intelligible as possible, and be reduced to as small a compass as may consist with the fullness and precision of the legislature and the perspicacity ot its languaee. These, well done, would greatly facili tate tha labors of those whose duty it is to assist in the administration of the laws, a; and would be a lasting benefit to the peo ple, by placing before them in a more ac cessible and intelligible form the laws which so deeply concern their interests and their duties. I am informed by those whose opinions I respect, that all the acts of Congress now in force, and of a permanent and gen eral nature,, might be revised acd rewrit ten so as to be embraced in one volume, or at least two volumes of ordinary and convenient s : ze, and I respectfully recom mend to Congress the subject, and if my suggestions bo approved, to devise such a plan as to their wisdom shall seem most proper for the attainment of the end pro posed. One of the unfavorable consequences of tho present insurrection is the entire sup pression, in many places, of all ordinary means of administering civil justice bv the officers, and in the form of existing law. This is the case, in whole or in part, in ' all the insurgent States, and as our armies ! advance up in and take possession of parts of these States, the practical evil becomes more enparent. There are no courts or officers to whom tho citizens of other States may apply for the enforcement of their lawful claims against citizens of the I insurgent States, and there is a vast amount of debt constituting such claims. Some have estimated it as high as $200,* 000,000 due in largo part from insurgents in open rebellion to loyal citizens, who arc even now making great sacrifice in the dis charge of their patriotic duty to support the Government. Under these circum stances I have been urgently solicited to establish, by military pi wer, Courts to ad minister summary justices in such cases. I have thus far declined to do it, not because I had any doubt that the end pro posed, the collection of debt was just and right in itself, but because 1 have been unwilling to go beyond too pressure of ne cessity in the unusual exercise of power ; but the powers of Congress I suppose arc equal to the anomalous occasion, and therefore I refer the whole matter to Con gress with tho hope that a plan may be devised for the administration of j istice in all such parts of tho insurgent States and territories as may bo under the con trol of this government, whether by a vol untary return to allegiance and order or by the power of our arms. This, however, is not to be a permanent institution, but a temporary substitute, to cease as soon as the ordinary courts can be re-established in peace. It is important that some more conven ient means should be provided, if possible, for the adjustment of claims against the Government, and especially in view of their increased number, by reason of the war. It is as much the duty of the Govern ment to render prompt justice against it self in favor of citizens, as it is to adminis ter the same between private individuals. The investigation and adjudication of all claims in their nature, belong to the Judi cial Department; besides it is apparent that the attention of Congress will be more than usually engaged for some time to come with great notional questions. It was intended by the organization of the Court of Claims mainly, to remove this branch of business from the halls of Congress, but while the Court has proved to be an effective ami valuable means of investigation, it in a great degree, fails to effect the object of its creation, for the want of power to make its judgments final. Fully aware of the delicacy, not to say the danger, of the subject, I commend to your careful consideration whether this power of making judgments final may not be properly given to the court, reserving the right of appeal on questions of law to the Supreme Court, with such other pro visions as experience may have shown to be recessary. I ask attention to the report of the Postmaster General; the following being a summary statement of ihe condition of that Department : The revenue from all sources, during the fiscal year ending 30th June, 1861, including the annual perma nent appropriation if £700. 000 f or th e transportation of free mail matter, was 89.049,296 40, being about two per cent, less than the revenue of 1860. The expenditures were 813.006,709 11, showing a decrease of more than eight per cent, as compared with those of the pre vious year, ami leaving an excess of ex penditures over the revenue for the last fiscal year of §55,462 71. The gross rev enue for the year ending June 30th, 1862, is estimated at an increase of four per cent, on that of 1861, making 88,683,000 to which should be added the earning.-of the department for carrying free matter, viz : 8700.00. making 5*9 382,000. The total expenditures for 1862 are estimated at 812.528.000. leaving an estimated defi ciency of 83 345,000 to be supplied from the Treasury in addition to lire perma nent appropriations. The present insurrection shows, I think, that the extension of this District across the Potomac river, as the time of establish ing the capital here, was eminently wise, and, consequently, the relinquishment of that portion of it which lies in the State of Virginia was unwise and dangerous. I submit the consideration and expedien i cy of regaining that part of the Disuict, | and the restoration of the Diagonal bound aries, through negotiation with State of Virginia. The report of the Secretar^ofMCT|n te• rior, with the accompaning dq|%gm hibits the condition of the several o ranch - es of the public busines pertaining to that department. The depressing influence*' jof the insurrection have been especially ! felt in the operations of the Patent and ! General Land Office. The cash receipts from the sales of public lands dnring the last year have exceeded the expenses of our land system only §200,000. The sales have been entirely suspended in the South ern States while the interruption to busi ness of the country, and the diversion of large numbers of men from labor to mili tary services, have obstructed settlements in the lew Stales and Territories of the Northwest. The receipts of the Patent Office have declined, in nine months, about §lOO,OOO rendering a large reduction of the force employed necessary to make it self-sustain ing. The demands upon the Pension Office will be largely increased by the insurrec tion. Numerous applications for pensions, based upon the casualties of the existing war, have already been made. There is rea son to believe that many who are now up on the pension roll, and in receipt of the bounty of the Government, are in the ranks of the insurgent army, or giving them aid and comfort. The Secretary of the Interior has directed the suspension of the payment of the pension of such people on proof of their disloyalty. I recommend that Con gress authorize that officer to cause the names of such persons to be stricken from the pension list. The relations of the Government with the Indian tribes have been lately disturbed by the insurrection, especially in the nor thern superintendence' and in that of New Mexico. The Indian country south of Kan sas is in possession of the insurgents from Texas and Arkansas. The agents of the L T nited States, appointed since the 4th of March, for this superintendent-}’, have been unable to reach their post while the most of those who were in office before that time have espoused the insurrectionary cause and assumed to exercise the power of agents by virtue of commissions fr.m the insurrec'iqnists. It was then stated in the public press that a portion of these Indians have been organized as a military force and are at tached to the artnv of the insurgents, al though tiie Government .es no offi id in formation upon the subject. Letteis have been written to the Commissioner of In dian Affairs by several prominent chiefs, giving assurances of their loyalty to the United States, and expressing the wish for the presence of the federal troops to protect them. It is believed that on the repossession of the country bv the federal forcer the Indians will cease all hostile demonstrations, and resume their former relations to the Goverom°nt. Agriculture, confessedly the largest in terests of the nation, has not a department or a bureau, but a clerkship only, assio-n- i ed toil in the Got ei Dmcci'. While it j iortun te that this great merest is so in dependent in its nature as not to have de manded and extm .cd more from the Gov ernment, I respect full v ask Congress' to consider whether something more cannot be given voluntarily wi‘h general advan tage. Annual reports exhibiting the con dition jot our agncaltme, commerce and manufacture, would present a fund of in torm at ion cijgrtav practical value to the country. While I make no suggestion as details, i v- " i agricultural and statistical, bureau mMit ! profitably be organized. ■ The execution of the laws for the sup j press ion <4 ihe African slave trade has i been confided to Lite Department of the | Interior, li is a eubj* cl of congratnUb a I that the ell its which have been made for the suppression of this inhuman traffic, have recently been attended with unusual success. Five vessels being fitted out for the slave trade have been seized and con demned. Two masters engaged in the trade, and one person equipping the ves sel as sucli bare been convicted and subjected to the penalty of fine and im prisonment ; and one captain, taking up a cargo of Africans on board bis vessel, has been convicted of the highest grade of offence under our laws, the punishment of whicli is death. The territories of Colorado, Dakotah and Nevada, created by the last Congress, have been organized, and civil administration has been inaugurated there under aus pices especially gratifying; when it is con sidered that the leaven of treason was found existing in some of these new coun ■ tries when the federal officers arrived there. The abundant natural resources of these territories, with' the security and protection afforded by organized govern ments, will doubtless invite to them a large immigration, when peace shall re store the business of the country to its ac customed channels. I submit the resolutions of the Legisla ture of Colorado, which evince the patri otic spirit of the people of the Territory. So far, the authority of the United Slates has been upheld in all the Territories, as it is hoped it will be in future. I com mend iheir interests of defence to the en lightened and generous care of Congress. I recommend to the favorable considera tion of Congress, the interests of the Dis trict of Columbia. The insurrection has been the cause of much suffering and sac rifice to the inhabitants, and as they have no representative in Congress, that body should not overlook their just claims upon the Government. At your last session a joint resolution was adopted, authorizing the President to take measures for facilitating a proper re presentation of the industrial interest of the United Stales, at the exhibition of industry of all nations, to be holden at London, in the year 1862. I regret to have been un able to give persona! attention to this sub ject, a subject at once so interesting in it self, and so extensively and intricately con nected with the material prosperity of the world. Through the Secretaries of Stale and Interior, a plan or system lias been devised, adn partly matured, which will be laid before pou. Under and by virtue of the act of Con gress, entitled “An act to confiscate prop eity used for insurrectionary purposes.” approved August 6;n, IGGi, legal claims of certain other persons, have become for feited, and numbers of the latter thus lib erated are dependent on the United Stales and must be provided tor in some way.— Besides this, u i- not impossible 'that some States pass for their own benefit respectively, and by the operations'of which persons of the same class wo Ibo thrown upon them for disposal. In such case 1 reccomend that Qongvess provide tor excepting such persons fiom such State, according to some mode of valuation, in lieu pro ianto of direct tuxes, or upon some other plan, to be agteed on with such Slate respectively ; that such persons on such acceptance by the Gene ral Government be at once deemed free, and that in any event .steps be taken for colonizing both classes, or the one first mentioned, U the other shall not be brought into existence, at some place or places in a climate congenial to them. It might be well to consider, too, whether the free colored people already *in the United States could not, so far as individuals may desire, be included in such colonization. To carry out the plan of colonization may involve the acquiring of territory, and also the appropiation of money beyond that to be expended in the territorial acquisition. Having precluded the acquisition of territory for nearly fifty years, the question of constitutional power to do so is no longer an open one with us. The power was first questioned by Mr. Jefferson, who, however, in the purchase of Louisiana, yielded his scruples, on the plea of great expediency. If it be said that the only legitimate object of acquir ing territory is to furnish homes for while men, this measure effects that object, for the emigration of colored men leaves ad ditional room for white men remaining or coming in. Mr. Jefferson, however, placed the im i portance of procuring Louisiana more on ; political and commeicia' grounds than on I providing room for population. On this ; whole proposition, including to appropria- I lion of money with the acquisition ofter ! ritory, does not the expediency amount | lo absolute necesity, that without which i the Government cannot be perpetual? I in considering the policy to be adopted for | suppressing the insurrection, I have been j anxious and careful that the iuevilable j conflict for this purpose shall not be de | generated into a violent and remorseless | revolutionary struggle. I have, therefore in every case thought it proper to keep the integrity of the Union prominent as the primary object of the contest on our part, leaving all questions, which are not of vital military importance, to the more deliberate action of the Legislature. In the exercise of my best discretion, I have adhered to the blockade of the ports held by the insurgents, instead of putting in force, by proclamation, the law of Con gress, enacted at the late session, for clos ing the ports; also, obeying the dictates of prudence, as well as the obligations of law, instead of transcending, I have adhered to the act of Congress to confiscate prooertv used for insurrectionary pn p. scs. If a new law upon the same subject shall be pro-; sed, its propriety wii; be dulv con sidered. The Union must be preferred, and hence all UdispensU U ii ans n: . b v employed. Wc should not be in b .ste t determine what radical and extreme meas ures which may r*.a the l.yal, as well : - the disloyal, are indispensable. The inaugural address at the beginning of the administration, and the message *o Congress, ar the late session, were "both mainly devoted to the domestic controver sy- °ut of which the insurrection and eon-, sequent war have sprung. Nothing now i occurs to add. or subtract, to or from the prinicple or general purposes stated and expressed in those documents. The last ray of hope for preserving the Union peaceably, expired at tbe assault upon Fort Sumter, and a general review of what lias occurred since, may rot be un profitable. What was painfully uncertain then is much better defined and more dis tinct now, and the progress of events is plainly in the right direction. The insur gents confidently claimed a strong support from North of Mason and Dixon’s line, and the friends of the Union were not free from apprehension on this point. This, however, was soon settled definite ly, and on the right side—south of tbe line. Nubie little Delaware led off right from the first. Maryland was made to seem agafnst tbe Unr n ; our soldiers were assaulted, bridges wore burned and rail roads torn up within her limits, and wo were many days at one time without the ability to bring a single regiment over her soil to the capital. Now her bridges and railroads are repaired and open to the gov ernment ; she already gives seven regi ments to the cause of the Union, and none to the enemy, and her people, at a regular election, have sustained the Union by a largo majority, and by a larger aggregate vote than they ever before gave any candi date or any question. Kentucky, too, for some time in doubt, is now decidedly, and I think unchange ably, ranged on the side of the Union.— Missouri is comparatively quiet, and I be lieve cannot again be overrun by the in surgents. These three States of Maryland, Kentucky and Missouri, neither of which would promise a single soldier at first, have now an aggregate of not less than 40,000 in the field for the Union, while of their citizens not more than a third in number are among tbe insurgents, and they of doubtful whereabouts and existence. After a somewhat bloody struggle of months, winter closes on the Union people of Western "\ irginia, leaving them masters of their own country. An insurgent force of about 1,500 dominating the narrow pe ninsular region constituting the counties of Accomao and Northampton, and known as the Eastern shore of Virginia, together with some contiguous parts of Maryland, have laid down their arms, and the people there have renewed their allegiance to, and accepted the protection of, the old flag.— This leaves no armed insurrection North of the Potomac or East of tbe Chesapeake. Also we have obtained a footing at each of the isolated points on the southern coast, at Hatteras, Port Royal, Tybee isl and, near Savannah, and Ship Island, and we likewise have some general accounts of popular movements in behalf of the Union |in North Carolina and Tennessee. These i things demonstrate that the cause of the Union is advancing steadily southward. Since your last adjournment, Lieut. General Scott has retired from tha head of the*army. During his long life the nation has not been unmindful of his merit, yet calling to mind how faithfully, ably, and brilliantly he has served the country from a i time far back in our history, when few of I the now living had been born, and thence i forward continually, I cannot but think ! that we are still his debtor. I submit, therefore, for your consideration what fur i ther mark of recognition is due to him and j ourselves as a grateful people. With tbe retirement of General Scott j came the executive duty of appointing in his stead a General-in-Chief of the army. It is a fortunate circumstance that neither in council nor in c mntry was there, so far as I knew, any difference of opinion the proper person to'be selected. The re- i tiring chief repeatedly expressed his opin ion in favor of Gen. McClellan for tbe po- ‘ sition, and in this the nation seemed to give an unanimous concurrence. The de signation of Gen. McClellan is, therefore, in a considerable .degree, the selection of j i the country as well as of the executive, | and lienee there is better reason to hope | there will be given him the confidence, and ! cordial support thus by fair implication | promised, and without which he cannot with so full efficiency serve the country. It has been said that one bad general is better than two good ones, and the saying is true if taken to mean no more—that an army is better directed by a single mind, though inferior, than by two superior ones at variance and cross purposes, and the same is true in all joint operations wherein those engaged can have none but a common end in view and can differ only as to the choice of means. In a storm at sea no one on board can wish the ship to sink, and yet not unfrequently all go down together be cause too many will direct and no single mind be allowed to control. It continues to develope that the insur rection is largely if not excusively, a war upon the first principles of popular govern ment—the right of the people. Conclu sive evidence of this is found in the most grave and maturely considered public doc uments, as well as in the general tone of the insurgents. In these documents, we find the abridge ment of the existing right of suffrage and the denial of the people of all to partici pate in the selection of public officers, ex cept the legislative body, advocated with labored arguments to prove that large con trol of the Government in the people, is the source of all political evil. Monarchy itself is sometimes hinted at as a possible refuge from the power of the people. In the present position, I could scarcely be justified were I to omit to raise a warn ing voice against this approach of return ing despotism. It is net needed, nor fit ting here that a general argument should be made in favor of popular institutions; but there is one point with its connections not so hackneyed as most others to wtiich I ask a brief attention. It is the effort to place capital on an equal footing with, if not above, labor in the structure of the Government. It is assumed that labor is available on ly in connection with capital, that nobody labors unless somebody else owning capi tal somehow by the use of it induces him to labor. This assumed, it is next con sidered whether it is best that capital shall hire laborers and thus induce them to work by their own consent. Having proceeded so far it is naturally concluded that all laborers are either liireff laborers or what we call slaves, and further it is assumed that whoever is once a hired la borer is fixed in that condition for life. Now there is no such relation between capital, and labor as assumed, nor is teen any such thing as a freeman being fixed for life in the condition of a hired laborer. Both of these assumptions are false and all inference from them arc groundless La bor is independent of capital. Capital is only the fruit of labor and could never have been expected if labor had not first exis ted. Labor is the superior of capital and deserves much the higher consideration.— Capital has its rights which are as w. rthy of protection as any other rights. Nor is it dented that there is and probably al ways will be a relation between labor and capital producing mutual benefits. The error is in assuming that the whole labor of community exists within that relation.— A few men own capital and that few avoid labor and with their cflpi*al hire or buy a few to labor for them. A large majority belong to neither class, neither work for others or have ethers working for them. In most of the Southern States a ma jority of the whole people of all c- lors, arc neither slaves nor masters ; while in the Northern, a large majority are neither hirers nor hired—men with families, wives, sons and daughters, work for them- M'lves. on their farms, in their houses, and in then- simps, taking the who!- 1 prtMnets to themselves, and- asking no favors of capitalists cn tin; one ■ and, nor ut hired laborers or slaves on the ether. It ;s not forgotten that a considerable number of pei its mingle tin in i-wu i.. hor with capital; that is, they labor with their own hands and also buy or hire others to labor for them, but this is only a mixed and not a distinct class. No principle state is dis turbetl by the existence of this mixed class. Again, as has already been said, there is not of necessity any such thing as the tree b red laborer being fixed iu that con dition tor lile. Many independent men, everywhere in these States, a few years back in their lives were hired laborers. The prudent penniless beggar in the world , labors for wages awhile and saves a snr j plus with which to buy tools or land for | himself, then labors on his own account, | and at length hires another new beginner to help him. This is the just, and gen erous, and prosperous system which opens the way to all, gives hope to all, and con sequent energy, progress, and improve ment of tbe condition of all. No men living arc more worthy to bo | trusted than those who toil up or on from i poverty, none less inclined to take or touch aught which they have not honestly earned Let them beware of surrendering a polit I ical power which they already possess and ; which, if surrendered, will surely be used I to close the door of advancement against j such as they, and to fix new disabilities i and burdens upon them till all of liberty shall be lost. From the first taking of our natural census to the last are seventy | years, and we find onr population at the end of tbe period eight times as great as it was at the beginning, i The increase ot those other things which : men deemed desirable lias been evengreat | er. W e thus have at one view what the popular principle applied to Government I through the machinery of the States and the Union has produced in a given time, and also, what if firmly maintained it promises for the future. There are already those among us who. if the Union be preserved, will Jive to see it contain 250.000,000. The struggle of to-day is not altogether for to-day, it is for a vast future also.— With a firm reliance on Providence, all the more firm and earnest, let us proceed in the great task which events have devolved upon us.
