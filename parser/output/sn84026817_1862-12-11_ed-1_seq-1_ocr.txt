Fellow- Cili'-'M of At Senate and IIouk of Reprtiadative* : Since your Inst annual assembling, another year of health an I hountiful hnrvetts'has passed. Ami whilo it lias not please.! the Almighty to blonus with a return of peace, we can but prees on, guided by the best r'ght he gives us 1 trusting in His own gnod time, and wise way, all will yet ha well. The correspondence touching foreign n(fairs which lias taken pi ice dnrint? ll?e lust year is herewith submitted, in virtu 1 al compliance witli a i?*f]U?at to the ?f feet, made by the IIowm <.f Represents lives near the close uf the last sus-non of Congress. If the conditions ol oilr relations wi-.h other nations it !es; gratifying t.mn it has usunlv been at form?*r periods it is certfrnly more satisfactory than a nation so unhappily distracted as we ate, rfl'ght rea*onnMv hav* apprehended. In ?!i" month of June last, thore wro some (grounds to expect that the maritime powers which, at the beginning of nor iloirffttir difiicul.ies. so unwisely and un necessarily, as we th -ik, reen,?niao 1 ttte in;uri?oii/B as n be1l-g-'rent w>>uld sinn : renege from that position, which li.'S proved only less injurious in themiolvei than to our own country. But tho mm porarv reverses whtfill yftorwsr I bcloH the national arms, and which wom ?x aggertad bv our own Oifloyal citizens^ abroad, have hitherto delayed that act ot simple justice. Tho civil w?r, which h't so radical ly changed, for the tftoiti'M. the occu pations and habits ol the American pen [ile, lias neccssurily disturbed the social ' condition, ihi 1 nfTicied very dsep'y the prosperity of tho nations with wnich we I In.tu lurried on a c imm-rce that has been steadily increasing throughout a period of half a ceotun. It has at the same tim', excited political a.nbitions and apprehensions which have produced n prof ? nii-l agitation throughout theoiv ilir.nl world. Iu this nnu?ual agitation we have forborne from taking part in any | controversy between foreign Slates, snd between parties or (aolions in Such | States. We h?v? alte.npte 1 no propa gandiem, und ?c'*now!od^ed no ruvolu tion. Hut we hav-i left to eeery nation the exclusive conduct and management of its own affairs. Our ?t uggle has he?n, nl course, contemplated by ijreign nations with reference.lesa to its own merits, tlyfh to its snpposod, and.often 'Xaggetatftjl effeots arid eonsequnnoes ' ibis Oovertimetit, even if it were just, would certainly be tinwis-. | Tho treaty with Grest Britain for the | suppression of tho slave tra le has bsen pot into operation with a good prospect of complete suboass It is an occasion of spisial plea-ura lo iickniwlo lg ? that the execution of it, ,-n the part Of her Majesty's Government, has been mark ed with a jcaluus reaped for the author ity of the U'tiiad Status. atil the rights of tli. ir moral and l"yl eilizjns. ^ I The convention with 11 mover for the ?abolition of the stadt dues has been car ried into full cffocl, under tho aot of Congress for that purpose. A 'blockade of 8,00,1 tnile3 of seacoast I tould not be established, and v:gorously enforced, in a season of (treat commer cial activity like the present, without committing oconsionol mistakes and 'n (liciinz unintentional injuries upon for si^n n?tiona and their subjects. A e vil War occuriing in a o untry wlier? foreigners reside en 1 c.irry on tri.de under treaty stipulations is netcs ?arily fiuitful of complainta of tlie viola tion of neutral ri:lr.s. All such collis ions tend lo excite misapprehensions, un i possibly produce tnu'tul reclama tions between nations which have u aom mnn interest in preserving peace and friendship. In clear cases of these kinds I have to f ir as possible heard end redressed complaints which havo been presented bv friendly powerB.? There is still, however, a lurg- and an augmenting number o( doubtful cases up on which tho government is unable to n-ireo with tho Government! whoso pro ?tflllO!. is ucuT.V.it by ,ho cljiroid'.;,.? There aro moreover, many cas's in which the United States, or their citizens, suf fer wrongs from tho navil or military authorities of foreign nations, which tho jj.nermnenls of ihose S'.i: ;s nr- not once ptepaied to redress. 1 have propose ! to some of the foreign Stales thus intercsto I . mutual conventions to ex i nitio and ad just such complaints. This proportion has been made ospouia'ly to Great Brit- 1 nin, to France, lo Spain, and to Prussia. In ench case il has ln.cn kindly rscoived but has not yet boen formally adopted. I deem it nty.duty lo rocommcnd an Appropriation in behalf of the owners of tho Norwegian bark Admiral l\ Torken fkiold, which vessel wi,? in May, 1S0I, rcvonled by the commander ol tho I lockading forcn off Charleston fiom leaving that port with cargo, notwith-' standing n similar privilege, hnd thorilv before,been granted to an English vessel. I have directed the Secretary of State to cause the pipers in the case to bo connnunicnted to the proper committees. Applications have been made (o mo by many free Americans of African de teenl to favor their emigration, with a view to such colonization m was contem plated in rrconl acls of Congron.? Other panics,at homo nnil abroad?lomb from interested motives, others upon pa ! trioiic considerations, nnd Hill others | influenced by philanthropic sen'iments have suggested similar measures; while, on the other hftnd, several of the Span ish American republics have proteste I ' against the sending such colonies to their I respective territories. Under these cir cumstances, I have declined to move nny such colony to nny State, nilhout first obrainins' 'ht? consent of i's Govern in?nf, with an ngroemnnt on iis purl to receive an I protect sue!) emigrants in all ihe lights of freemen; anJ 1 have, at the sumo lime, offered to the several Slates siluited within the tropics, or having colonies to negotiate with them, snhjoot to she advi e nnd con.i nl ? f the Senate to favor tho voluntary emigration of per ? f thnt class to their reeportive ter ritories, 6pon conditions,which ahull lie eqiHl, just, and humane. Liberia and Hayli, nre, a< yet the only ennntries 10 whi. li colonists of African descent from 'its, conld no with certainty of being received and adopted as citrons, and I ro rei to B.iy sii. b persons, conlempla-. ting joloniz iiion, do not ?e?m sn willing to emigrate to iln.se countries, a? t0 anmo others, n?r so willinit as I think their in terest 'le-nnn I.
