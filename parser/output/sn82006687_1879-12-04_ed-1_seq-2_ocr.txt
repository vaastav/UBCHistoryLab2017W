This ii,to inrlv'le iu the form of the contract here after to be issued the condition that the appointment* !%!! continue from term to term and from year In year, until revoked according to law by an official thirty day’* notice, signed by two tru* : Ire*. Heretofore, it has been the cos tum of the school trustee* to appoint the teachers annually. 1 lie authority of (he State Board to make this change m unquestionable, as the school law doe* not specify how the appointments ha'l be made but leave* the method under the control of the by-laws adop ted bv the Board. One rood tendency of this change will he to make the bux ine** of teac bin; mure of a prft**ion than it ha* heretofore been by giving greater permanency to appointment*.— We thiak the State Board of Education have acted wisely in this matter and have removed a cause of great disquie tude to teachers by making their term* of service a lifelong affair or until they thall see fit to resign, provided their good behavior shall justify it. 1 Board are unfavorable to any tinkering hv the incoming legislature with the School Lair, tlu-ir idea being, that the best way to improve it is to let it alone, and this is also the reunion of the Balti more American, organ of the Republican party in the State. Be sides, if there be defects, as we have no doubt there are, in our present scheme of | ojmh.ir education, i' it not better for the people ot thi* county to bear the ills ul the present School System than fly to others they know not of? It is | tlii • consideration which should induce, j we think, our present repre;'•nlatives i at Annapolis “to make haste slow lv‘ in re-opening -chool issues which j may have the effect, whilst mending certain defects, of marring vital fea tures of a law upon which tre mainly depend and have depended for years for general educatn n in our county. A>tnt .i:.ni or THEOnm Laws. —An Annapolis correspondent of the Baltin ore American, writing on the subject 6f the Ute arrests by Capt. Clark, of the Oyster Police Boat, Annie Mer rvnian, for violations of the oyster laws, speaking ol the news of the boats cap- ; tured, say*: ‘•'l he condition of these crews is deplorable, and shows at once the rig orous and unequal character ol our oys ter laws, ( tilers the poor men have friends to bail them out of jail, as is un like);, 'her willspend a long and drrai y w inter in prison, as our court will not 'it until April to hear criminal rases.— Of course, they are violators ol the law; j but if they had disobeyed the captain's | orders when commanded to dredge at night, a belaying-pin on the offender’*! head would verv likely have been the j ansver to the lawful objection. In the ! meantime, the captain i* generally hailed out bv theow nersofthe vessel or friends, gels another crew, works the winter through. i fined SSO in the spring, pay* it or goes to jail for sixty days, whilst the crews, alter five months’ imprison ment, will be mercifully discharged from custody by the court, probably without formality of trial. The reme dy lor this anomalous stale of affair* is suggested by thoughtful ones—make tlie vessel liable for violation* of the law, and the owners will then secure reliable and honest captains. As it now is, the captains who will dredge on the bars reserved for the tongmen have great advantage over the man who won't steal, both in getting a boat to command and a load of oysters to sell.” We much favor the remedy sugges ted by the American's correypondeut of making the vessel liable for viola tions of our oyster laws, but we favor it as an additional guard against such violations, not as a suit! it ute for-exist ing laws on (be subject. Let the Captains a?id crews be punished as they are now punished, and in addition to this, let the owner of the vessel caught dredging ia violet ion of law be made li able in a penalty sufficiently large, if not to sw amp the vessel, at least to make it to the interest of the owner to be careful in future as to w hom and for what he hires his property. TtcPrc*ldfßl*s Misuse. The annual Message of the Presi dent was communicated to Congress on Monday last. Our space not admitting of its publication entire, we have had to content oumdves with a synopsis and the one we present is that of the Bal timore Sun. The mesMge begins by congratulating Congress upon the suc cess of the financial operations of the treasury and their good effect* upon the business of the country. The resume is not materially different from the tacts j and figure* presented in the report ot the Secretary of the Treasury. “The public credit ha? beee as great ly benefited by resumption as the gen- * oral business of the country, and the [ President thinks that ail the remaining 5 per c*nt. and 6 percent. ecuiitie* of the government can be refunded in 4 per cent, bonds, thus effecting a forth-1 *k.- I#f reiECtioa of#tl.-000.000 in annoal . if.tr rest. 1 i ‘ The *ilver dollars coined under the : recent afs of Congress now amount to ! $45 ; U00,fc50, of which $32 3**1.344 still * remain in the treasury. Upon the basis • of this fact and of the current propost , lion for unify of action to effect a per , manent y*tc*m for the equality ofjgold and silver in the exchanges between . the commercial nation*, the President advises Congress to refrain from further experiment* with the coinage and to • sU’-perid the coining of stiver dollars as I now ordered by law. “He say* that “the retirement from ( circulation - of United State* notes, with the* opacity of legal-tender in private contracts is a step to be taken in our progress toward* a safe and stable cur , rency, which should be accepted as the policy and duty of the government and the interest and security of the people.” Tt e Fre odent expresses it as his “firm conviction” that the issue of legal-ten der paper money on the credit and au- Ihority ol (be government, except in extreme emergency, “i* without war - *ant in (be constitution and a violation of s und f nancial principles.” He there fore advocate* their retirement and the rigid maintenance of the sinking funds, in order to extinguish the national debt as soon a* possible, iu pur.'uit of our traditional government policy. If more revenue be needed, it can be easily ob tained by duties on tea and coffee. • file President refer* to the contin ued deliberate violation of the laws sup jri"iitg polygamy by prominent citi : zens of I tab. ami demands the strict I enforcement of these law*, which have been decided to be constitutional by the Supreme Court. “He appeals to Congress and to the people ol the country to unite in bringing general public opinion to bear iu favor of the general observance ot and respect for the law* enforcing the sancity of the suffrage throughout the whole land, and launches into a long and earnest argu ment in favor f his views about the re form of the civil service, which have several time* before been di-cuv-ed by him. The President report* tfiat con siderable and satisfactory progress has already been made in tlu*e direction*, but he thinks that much remains 'till to be done, lie distinguishes elaborately j between offices which are.simply exec utive and administrative and tho-e which are more or less political, deem ing it to be eminently proper for the President’* official advisers' to explain ! before the people the policy of an ad- ; ; ministration brought into office by the i popular vole, advocates the providing, Ini just and adequate means for examin ing candidates lor office, so that the worthiest claimant may be certain ol , getting the apjointrnent. The Presi dent’s duties in these particulars arc ob vious, but hv 1 contends that nothing ad- • equate in the premises ran be arcom- j piisbed by bim without the co-opera-) tion of Congress and the considerate ; and intelligent support of the people. The resumption of work hy the civil service commission is recommended, and an appropriation to (hat end is urged. “The foreign relation? of the gov ernment continue peaceful. The diffi ! culty with Great Britain growing out of ! the Fortune Bay (Newfoundland) out i rages is being considered by Lord Bea- I con'fields government. The /question, only temporary adjusted by the treaty of Washington, needs to be j permanently settled as a whole, and j . negotiation* to that end ar<* now mi pro gress. The message al*o touche* upon the cattle trade restrictions, upon lile- j saving measures taken by the Durum- j j tun government in connection with the i commerce of the great lakes, anti upon the Australian international shows, re commending an increased appropriation for American exhil.it*. “The hte treaty with Japan, it is ex pected, will serve a* a model for other , countries. China has expressed wil- | lingnes* to discuss the emigration que- j lion with us in a dispassionate way, and negotiations to that end are now pend ing.- I‘order raids on the Rio Grande fiontier have been checked, and our di plomatic intercourse with the United States ot Columbia is again restored.— This is regarded a* especially fortunate in view ot the prominence which has ju'l been attained by the interoceanic canal project. Our increasing trade with Mexico and South America sug gest* to the I'resident the expediency of Congress providing means" for regu lar and frequent mat! communication with those countries. “Additional legislation is claimed to be needed for the protection of (he rights ol the people in Aia-ka, and a form of ter nforial government is recommended there. The President, after comment ing upon (he operations of the army and navy duiingthe year, and showing that the Department of Justice ha been obstructed by the lack ol appropria tions, and that the business of the Su preme Court is so largely in arrears as to demand the creation ol intermediate court* and appointment of additional circuit judges considers with approval the proposition* ol the Postmaster-Gen eral in regaid to increased facilities lor dome'tic and foreign mail service. “The Indian problem is fully treated) of in the message, and fhe President recommends specifically to Congress the ‘ uggestions ol Secretary Schuizand Commissioner flaw upon this subject. He say* that, w hile the Executive is determined to protect the Indians in their territorial rights, it would be un wise to ignore the tact that organized raids like that against the Cherokee j country, which wa'broken up by Ex- j ecutive | ochimafion in la*t April, are j i liable to be repealed year after year as ! I land gets scarcer and more valuable, i and hence the expediency ot speedy change* in our Indian policy At the same time the President deprecates the proposed transfer of the Indians from the Interior to the War Department. “The President renews hi* recom ’ mendattons in favor ot enlarging the facilities of (he department of agricul • ture. He also call* the attention of | Congress to the paramount subject ol ; education and its progress, urges the completion of the Washington monu ment. and invokes a generous policy on ! the parloflbe national legislature towards ; the District of Columbia, its thorough : fare*, approaches and its school*. * 1} •
