Schwab further declared: "The more severe the present business depression is, the sooner it will be over. "If the cost of living is reduced. J the laborer can maintain his preset standard of living even though 1 his wages are less. J No Place for Loafers. "There is no place in America today for the loafer. "The laborer should receive his ' full share of the wealth he pro- ! duces. "efficient production is the only guarantee of employment and higher wages. "The government must set an ex- ; r ample in economy and thrift. "Uppermost in the minds of American citizens today is the question: 'What is the meaning of the existing slump in business and what of the future?* "The existing moment is full of difficulties and complexities. But I j want to go on record as saying that nothing could be healthier for Amer- 8 lean business than the very condi- c tion through which we are now i passing. It had to come.

J "TV result of tfcte experience through which we havo passed is that our coats have been inflated 7 and we have had la America both our business institutions and Ameri- n can individuals generally indulging S wasteful and extravagant meth- i ods.

"The great n^ed of the world to- ? day is to work hard and save. This applies not alone to the laboring % man, but to the man of means."

D. C.TUNDS BBLL DUE FOR HOUSE WITH FEW CUTS Committee Finishes Work And Hearing Expected During Week. DISTRICT SCHOOLS WELL CARED FOR ' m Three Measures Scheduled /or Precedence in Order of Business. ? The District of Columbia appropriation Kill probably will reach the floor of the House en Wednesday or Thursday of this week, according to the opinion of member* of the House Appropriations Committee. It will be the first appropriation bill to be considered. The subcommittee which has been working on the measure virtually completed it after a short night session last night and the 'committee clerk will work today In an effort to have it ready for reporting to the full committee on Tuesday. Items Cel. A number of Items were cut by ttw subcommittee and other* are expected to come under the pruning kjiif4 of the full committee. The schools however, were well taken care of. While every request was not granted. the number of Items that were depleted are comparatively Insignificant, ft was intimated by meraberi of the committee. # Under a special rule granted by the Rules Committee* the Volstead resolution repealing war-time legislation will be taken up Monday immediately after a vote on the immigration bill. Reavls Reaeliatlea. The Reavis resolution, which else was given a special rule, wfll be the next order of business. Thli resolution creates a Joint ?ongres*ioi<al committee composed of three members of the House and three ol the Senate to begin work on legislation reorganizing the department! of the government. This measure is expected to be disposed of spe? aS^Hiere pears to be little opposition. ' TV committee, it is said, will work foi :lie best part of a year before it will be able to report a bill bring* ing order out of the maze of administrative departments and tc eliminate the overlapping and duplication of work. Pateet Oflire Bill. Following action on the Reavii resolution the House will take up the request of Representative John T. Nolan, of California, for the appointment of conferees on his mcasrurc increasing the force and salaries In the Patent Office. Following the action of Representative Thomas L?. Blanton. ol Texas, in blocking a unanimous consetn request for the appointment of the conferees, Nolan obtained a rule from the Rules Committee making the request in order. The measure has been passed by both the House and Senate and the only remaining work to be done is the ironing out of difference between the two bodies caused by a nvmber of Senate amendments reducing the increases both personnel and salary authorized in the House bill. Farm Bill* Nay Delay. With these measures out of the way, it is believed the District appropriation bill will be the next on the program unless the agitation for farmer relief legislation forcea it aside. Work on the legislative, executive and judicial appropriation bill which was interrupted by the deatu of the mother of Representative William R. Wood, of Indiana, chairman of the subcommittee handling the measure, will be resumed Monday. It is improbable, however, thai this measure will reach the House until after the holiday recess.

BRANDS REPORTS OF RED TERRORS World Powers Ready for Mad Scramble in Siberia, He Says. NEW YORK. 11.?A mad scramble among world power* for industrial and commercial concessions in Russia was forecast by Washington D. Vanderlip. American mining engineer, who landed here today bearing documents involving $3,000,000,000 worth of Kamchatkan I' oil and coal lands and fisheries. Whether the United States participates in the valuable opportunI ities to be afforded by a resumption of trade relations with Russia depends entirely upon the American people, he said. To resume commercial relations would not neces, aarily entail political recognition of i the Soviet government, he explained. Great Britain and France already are taking steps to'reopen economic r intercourse with Russia. Vanderlip , declared, and Japan apparently ii s determined to retain the rich terri. torles she already has forcibly occupied along the Pacific coaat ol Siberia. Trade Resampttoa Urged. II Vanderlip said his agreement ' would not become operative until th? I American State Department had aul thorized resumption of trade relations with Russia. His agreement ' provides for sixty years. He doei t not intend to take the matter uj with the government but admitted that he expected to "do a little mis" sionary work" while in this country ti Other than stating that his concession will not be worked undei the Soviet system. Vanderlip refused 1 to discuss the details of the agreeI menls. Relative to the richness of the pe[ t role una and **U deposits, he saM 1 hi* company* would be able to furi?wisb tor tR-i Western part of tb< I United states and Canada, and that coal wag so plentiful and acceasibl* - it coftld be delivered in San Kran r cisco for $4 a ton.

He was born fifty-foui t years ago in Elkart, Ind., and gradl uated from Amherst College Shipwrecked oa Coast. ' His first intimation of the ricto [ coal and oil deposits in Kamchatka " was received tw?*nty-four yean* ag;i when he was shipwrecked on tht coast while bound for a region further North to explore for g<$1d in J the interests of a British syndicate B Various things had interfered with i his plans to exploit this region unJ til last summer, whfn he obtained t the backing of a group of Los Angeles business men. ^ Vanderlip met M. Krassin. Bol^ shevik trade representative. ' ir , Copenhagen and through him ar. ranged a conference with Premi^t s Lenin and other Russian official! , in Moscow. He was in the Soviet capital slxtj % days interviewing more than flftj Soviet representatives. includini many technical experts who former : ly held responsible positions undei 1 the old Czarist regime. Regarding conditions in Russia he predicted that Bolshevism am Communism soon would die out an<! be succeeded by a typical republican form of government. Th? present leaders will be retained however, because "they have wot the confidence and love of the peo pie," he said. Dealea Red Terrer. Reports of counter-revolutions the "Red terror" and atrocities h? characterised as propaganda, say Ing that while he was in Moscow "it was as quiet as a June day oi the banks of the Wabash." "Why, Lenine told me that the onlj way he ever learned of the varioui alleged revolutions, murders an< assassinations in Russia was by as slduously reading a certain Nevi York newspaper," Vanderlip said. Vanderlip decried what he be lieved to be the failure of the Amer lean people and government to real ise the significance of Japan's ac tivities in Siberia. "The Japanese are now holding or claiming the entire Pacific Coas' region of that country," he said "When you realize Qiat she pro duces only 2,000.000 barrels of th< 17,000,000 annual output of Asli you will understand why she is s< desperately anxious to get and keej Siberia." Telia ef Jap Work. Vanderlip said that Japanes* forces even occupied a part of th< territory covered by his concessioi but that the Russians were grad ually driving them out. Asked 11 he thought there was any possibility of serious trouble between Japan and the United States, he re? plied: "Not a chance in the world.' He declared that Japan was not U a position to fight any big power Referring again to Russian conditions. Vanderlip said: "There seem to be plenty of mcr In the United States who have never been within a thousand miles of Russia, yet they state emphatically that the Bolshevlkl are ruling Russia by a dictatorship. I have nol any use tar the Soviet form of government, but the fact is there is absolute freedom of thought and speech there?infinitely more than in America.
