TARIFF. Tt is now quite evident Hut the financial neces sities ot the government will require a modifica tion of the tariff during your present sesoiun. for the purpose of increasing the revenue. In this aspect, I desire to reiterate the recommendation contained ia my last two annual messages, in fa vor of imposing specific, instead ot ad valorem duties on ail imported articles to which these can be properly applied. From long observation and experience I am convinced lhatrpecibo duties are xteces-ary, both to protect the revenue and to se care to our manutacturing luterests thst amount of incident d encouragement which unavoidably results from a revenue tantf. As an abstract proposition it may ba admitted that ad valorem duties woald. iu theorv. be the mosljust and equal. But U tha experience of uiis aua ol all other commercial nstious has ne monstrated that such duties cannot be assessed and collected without great frauds upon the rev enue, then it it the part of wisdom to resort to speciho duties. Indeed, from the very nature of an ad valorem dnty, this must be the result. Un der it tha inevitable consequence is that foreign goods will beentered at lesu than thulrtrue value. The treasu-y will, therefore, lose the duty on the diiTerenee between the real and fictitious value, and to this extent we are defruuded. The temptations which td valorem duties, present to a dishonest importer are irreissiible llis object is to pass hit goods through the Custom House at the very lowest valuation necessary to save them from confiscation. In this he too often succeeds, in spile of the vigilance of the revenue omcers. Hence the resort to false invoices, one for the pur chaser and another for tie Custom House, and to other expedients to defraud the government. The honest importer produces his invoice to the collector, sutling the actual price at which he purchased the article abroad. 17 ot so the dishonest importer and the agent of the foreign manufacturer. And hereit may be observed that a very large proportion of the manufactures imported lrom abroad are consigned for sale to corn minion merchants who ire mere agents em ployed by the manulacturers. In such cases no actual sale has been made to hx their value. The foriegn manufacturer if he be dishonest prepares an invoice of the goods, Dot at their actual Tslue, but at the very lowest rate necessary to escape detection. In this manner the dishonest importer and the foreign manufacturer enjoy a decided advan tage over the honest merchant. They are thus enabled to undersell their .lair trader, and drive him from the market.- In fact the operation of this system has already driven from the pursuit of honorable commerce many of that class of regular and conscien tious merchants, whose character, through out the world, is the pride of our country. The remedy of these evils is to be found in spe cific duties, so far as this may be practicable. . They dispense with any inquiry at the Custom House ino the actual cost orvalue of the article, and it pays the precise amount ot duty previously fixed by law. They present no temptations to the appraisers of foreign goods, who receive but small salaries, and mitit by undervaluation in a lew cases render themselves inuepenoest. - Besidest speciCc duties best conform to the re quisition in tue Constitution that "no preference shall be given by any regulation of commerce or revenue to the ports of one btate over thuee ef another." Under our ad valorem system such preferences are to some extent inevitable, and complaints have often been made that the spirit ol this provision has been violated by a lower ap praisement of the same articles at one port than at another. An impression, straeiely eniogh, prevails to some extent that epecinc duties are necessarily protective duties. .Nothing can be more lalla cioos. Great Britain glories in free trade, and yet her whole revenue from import at the present moment is collected under a system cl specitic du ties. It is a striking fact in this connection that, in the commercial treaty of 23d January. I860, between prance and England, one of tiis articles provides that the ad valorem duties which it im poses shall be converted into specitic duties with in six months from Its date, and these are to be ascertained by making an an vers ge of the prices for six months previous to that time. The reverse of the proposition would be nearer to the truth, because a much larger amount of revenue woulu be collected by merely converting the ad valorem duties of a tariff into equivalent specihe duties. To this extent the revenue would be increased. and in the same proportion the specitic duty might be increased, fcpecifio duties would secu.e to the Amer ican manufacturer the incidental protection to which be is fairly entitled under a revenue tariff, and to this surely no pcraun would ob ject. The framers of the existing tariff have gone further, and in a liberal spirit have dis criminated in favoroj large and useful bran ches of oir manufactures, not by raising the rate of duty upon the importation of similar articles torn abroad, but what is the same in effect, by admitting articles free of duty wnich enter into the composition of their labrics. .' Under the present system it has been often remarked that this incidental protection de creases when the manufacturer needs it most, and increases when be needs it least, au J c in stitutes a sliding scale which always operates against him. The revenues of the country are subject to similar fluctuation. Instead of approach!";; a si?ady standard, as would be the case under a system of specific duties, they sink and rise with the sinking and rising prices of articles in Ibieign countries. It would not be difficult for Congress to arrange a system of specific duties which would aflord additional stability both tc revenue and onr manui'actorea, and without injory or injus tice to asy inter?st of the co.intry. This might be eccomplisbed by ascertaining the av erage vaice of any given article lor a teiies of years atjthe place of exportation, and by simply coa verting the rate of ad valorem du ty upon it which might be deemed neieeaary to a ' for ". , to tlit the to 160 the lor revenue purpnsei Into the form of a pe- c'.Sr duty. Such an arrannement could not injure the consumer, II he should par' greater amount of duty ono year, this ould be eouotei balanced by a !es?r amount ilia next, and in the end the aggregate would be tne same.
