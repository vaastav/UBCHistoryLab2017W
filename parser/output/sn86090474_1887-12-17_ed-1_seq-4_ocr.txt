The Democratic party can very well afford to go to battle next yeaf with Mr. Cleveland at its head, and his message as its armor. The contested election casG in the U. S. Senate from West Virerinia.has been decided in favor of Faulkner, and he took his seat Wednesday. The ltepublican National Com mittee in session at Washington last week, selected Chicago as the ph'ce for holding their convention next June. Is a letter recently written to Mr. If. M. Doak, of Nashville, Hon. Jas D. Porter indirectly announces his candidacy for the U. S. Senate, to succeed Harris. The .Nashville American offers a prize often dollars for the best Christ mas story not exceeding 1000 werds in length, written by a boy or girl not over sixteen years of ago. High license has reduced the num ber of saloons in Philadelphia nearly fifty per cent. This only adds new lustre to those which survive, how ever, and makes them more danger ous still. A convention of third and fourth class postmasters has been in session at Washington this week. The ob ject of the convention is to suggest suitable adjustments of postmasters salaries. Gen. Chalmers, of Mississippi, in an open letter in Sunday's Memphis Appeal asks the Republicans for an invitation to join their ranks. They greedily take all such offers and no 'mentions asked. Readers of political papers are go ing to bo treated to tariff discussion morning, noon and night all through next year. The subject will do for the big daily papers to tackle, but little country weeklies had better shell the woods for higher game. It is customary now to put white (lowers on the desks or congressmen who have been elected without fraud N. (). Picayune. It must make the Republicans green with envy to see all of the Democratic desks decorated with such emblems of purity. The New York Commercial Ad vertiser says several Congressmen will press the matter of a reduction of letter postage to one cent during the present term. The country can itand such legislation as this with out a murmer, and it is another good way to dispose of some of the surplus We are in receipt of the first num ber of the Tennessee Globe, publish edat IIartsville,by John I). Andrews It rises out of the ashes of the defunct .Sentinel, is thoroughly Democratic, and for Hon. J. H. Trousdale, of Sumner county, for Governor, it is an eight-column quorto, and starts with a good advertising patronage. . Senator Ci lum introduced his postal telegraph bill last Tuesday. It provides for ton trunk lines of tele graph wires to start with, practically covering H the larger cities of the country, and appropriates four mil lions of dollars for the purpose. The rates fixed in the bill for messages are about one-tenth of the Western Tnion ratos THE President's Message may yet prove the entering wedge in a rocast in Vf political parties High pro tective " Democrats don't iind much ,,)!)) f'ovt in the doi'iiiiH'itt, while :i ood many tariff reform Republicans are coming out in support ot Mr. Cleveland. The tw conflicting el ements have heretofore existed in both of the old parties, and managed to keep both of those organizations pretty evenly balanced astraddle of the question. Mr. Cleveland's mes sage sounds a clear and unmistak able call to arms for a tariff reform battle. Those high protective Dem ocrats who can't lollow him will soon find themselves swinging on to the tail end of the stalwart wing of the Republican party. The Lynchburg Falcon takes a lit tle item from our columns which we reprinted from the Memphis Appeal, regarding the postal telegraph, and says "the inference is that the Stand ard occupies the same position the Appeal does." The Standard mcre- y printed the item from the Appeal as an expression of that paper's opin ion, without endorsing or dissenting from it. The Falcon man draws his inferences with about as much pre cision as the Baptist preacher, who quoted in support of baptism by im mersion the text, 44 And Balaam rose up in the morning and . saddled his ass." WThen asked what bearincr that had upon tho matter, he replied: 'The inference is that he was going to take his children to the creek to have them baptised." AVe wonder where all that 44 per sonal liberty " enthusiasm which was floating around so promiscuous- y a few months ago has gone to. Here are some resolutions passed at a recent session of the Hardin Coun ty Wheel : "Whereas, Coffee is a luxury and not a necessary article of food ; and 4,Whereas, It is a matter of grave importance to Wheelers to know something of their current expenses, otc, therefore, be it 44 Resolved, That the members of the subordinate Wheels in this coun ty abstain from the use of coffee ex cept once a day, except under extra ordinary circumstances. "Resolved, That each member of the respective subordinate Wheels in this county be required to furnish to the corresponding secretary of his Wheel the total amount of his store bills for the year 1887." Mat. Richardson, the chairman of the Nashville committee on sub scriptions to the Midland Railroad, went to Memphis the first of this week to confer with Col. Patterson and Mr. Leake, the Vice President of the Midland. Following is the result of tho conference, as given by the American: 44MaJ. Richardson stated yesterday to an American representative that he had gone to see the gentlemen named to find whether the Midland Company would make any further proposition either to the people of Nashville or of Davidson County. Mr. Leake replied that this would be done under no circumstances. The Tennessee Midland . Company had laid their claims before the peoplo on two occasions, and they did not de sire to further press the matter. "During the conversation that en sued Mr. Leake suggested to Maj Richardson that his people go ahead with their subscriptions, and when they have raised $250,000, make their formal propositien to the Midland di rectors. There had been no meeting of these gentlemen, and Mr. Leake said that he would be unable to speak for them. "Maj. Richardson is very much of the opinion that if the amount of $250,000 is raised here by subscription the road will come to Nashville.' Our neighbor is very much exer cised over the political position of the Standard, and "heartily re grets" that we can't see through its old pair of moss-green spectacles. We beg our neighbor not to shed any crocodile tears over us. The Standard has been soundly Dem ocratic in the past; wo expect to make it the same in the future. Our love for the party is not in the least affected, nor have we lost any of our desire for its success. We have learn ed a few things about some Dem ocrats, however, which we didn' Know a iew years ago, ana what we have observed in the last two years has taught us something more about politics and politicians than we knew before then. The Stan dard can re main Democratic without creeping along in the old deep-worn ruts which the Era travels. We prefer t occupy nigner grouwi, where we can get a better view of what is going on around us. A good many questions may arise upon which we can not al together agree with the Km, bvt ibis is l.y Do TiK';li;s ;i te-t of the IWoiir r.icy of either puper. We have nev er ki".) mir !'egii.(,r r.ir ;l model in anything, nor have we ever waited to see how that paper would jump before shaping our course upon any question. If all this makes us a mug wump, we think we can stand it. We would rather be a mugwump than'a judgwump, anyway. Now if the Era will keep on pausing until the time comes to discuss the nom ination for governor, it will have no difficulty in discovering exactly where the Standard roosts the question is a little premature and out of season just now. The Standard is for Mr. Cleveland for a second term, and endorses his message. If our neighbor has any doubts as to the Democracy of the Standard, he had better pickle them down in brine, or they may spoil before he has an op portunity to use them to advantage. Southern Press Comment on the Presi dent's Message. Anniston Hot Blast : The document bears the impress of the good sense and conservatism that has character ized every puplic utterance of the President. Arkansas Democrat : Tho same spirit which animates tho President for tariff reduction should possess Congressmen, regardless of party. Why should we halt, or hesitate lon ger? Macon Telegraph : Tho President has clone his duty. He has put in plain words the danger which threat ens and the course of action ' which will avert it. Theresponsibility now rests with Congress of adopting the remedy proposed or providing anoth er. jacKson iews-iieraiu: it is a great message, written by a great statesman to meet a great emergen cyin the history of our country. We indorse its theory, admire its boldness, and predict that it will thrice arm the Democracy for the contest of next year. Savannah News : The plea which the President made for a reduction of the tariff is a strong one, and can hardly be without its effect upon Con gress. The financial affairs of the country should receive the attention of that body before any other impor tant question is considered. Birmingham Age : We are done with the classification of parties un der the general heads of Democrats and Republicans. The line is oblit erated, and the issue, to which an en tire presidential message is devoted, is fairly and squarely before the peo pie. vo are protectionists. You will be free traders. uaivestion ievs: The message could scarcely bo better adapted to its purpose: which is good, as far as it goes, and is aimed at what ought to bo practicable, and it must set the Democratic party right for tho next presidential election if the Democrats in Congress heartily support a meas ure of the kind indicated. Richmond Dispatch: We don'i like the President's recommendation of Mr. Hewitt's proposition to add to the free list several Virginia articles now protected. In this connection the President's declaration that the question of free trade is "absolutely irrelevant" seems to be rather un fortunate. Louisville Courier-Journal : To tho party itself the President's mes sage makes clear that in 1888 it wil be tariff reform or nothing. No words could have been spoken which will so effectually secure the harmony which so many desire as the clear, bold, emphatic declaration of party principle and party purpose coming from the President. Nashville Banner : President Cleveland's message on the tariff question is the clearest enunciation of the Democratic policy that has yet been made. Its meaning is unmis takable. The Chicago platform was left to be construed by Democrats to suit their different theories, while Mr. Cleveland proceeds to construe his message and makes a forcible ar gument to sustain his position. Birmingham Herald : As an ad ndvocate of protection and a firm be liever in its benefits the Herald must confess that it finds few grains of comfort in the President's message. That document seems to have bor rowed the most of its ideas from the Courier-Journal, and, barring rhet orical ring and piquancy of style, is about such a message as Henry Wat terson would send into Congress if he were President. Augusta Chroiiiele: While ad miring i 'resident Cleveland for the dignity ami integrity and patriotism i that characterize every sentence of i his message, we express the hope ' thtit the Democrats in Congre-s will -o pnriotically attempt to legislate a- t . Mike drover Cleveland, the candidate of the party, invincible in the next presidential election. This, in our humble opinion, can best be accomplished by reducing the reve nue hot only from Imports, but from the internal revenue system. New Orleans Times-Democrat : It must be admitted that the President presents these views forcibly and strongly. It cannot bo doubted, af ter the manner in which his views are pressed upon Congress, that the tariff will become the chief matter of egislation this winter, and that a tariff bill Of same kind or other will be passed. It will rest with Congress to frame one that will accomplish the greatest good to the country, with the least injuries t6 our industries. Atlanta Constitution : The mes sage of the President concerns itself solely with the 0iriff question, and he discusses it almost exclusively from the standpoint of Brer Bill Morrison of Illinois, who was left at home by his esteemed constituents on account of his extreme views. At the same time the President doesn't go so far as Brer Bill Morrison. He pauses in tho lesson which he gives to Congress to refer to the fact that the Democratic platform suggests protection for American Industries and American labor. Nashville American : On the question of excessive revenues col lecting more than enough to support the Government and the danger from the increasing surplus, the American agrees with the President. This we have said over and over. We also think the surplus should be reduced by taking off the tobacco tax, which the Courier-Journal has. agreed to. We think the States and not the Fed eral Government ought to have all of the tax on tobacco, spirits and malt liquors that the Federal government now gets. We are opposed to the Republican doctrine of taking this from the States and giving it to the f ederal Government, isut we are with the President that the surplus must be reduced at all hazard. New Orleans Picayune : The Pres ident's recommendation that all ar tides which are not in competition with domestic products should bo placed on the free list will meet with no objection. For the rest he refers specially to no article except wool. His argument in reference to tha article Is very closely put, but we kcannot hope that it will be received with favor in large wool-growin districts. Upon the whole, we may say that the message is an admirable State paper regarded merely as a statement of the most urgent legisla tive necessity of the hour, and that it has left the President froc to ap prove any practicable measure of compromise which may promise a sufficient reduction of revenue. Jacksonville (Fla.) Times-Uunioa : The views of the President on this all-importand subject are not bound ed by any narrow partisan or section al considerations. While they are in strict accord with the principles of true Democracy, as enunciated by the National Democratic party, they are such as must bo indorsed by every intelligent and patriotic person in every part of tho Union who is not influenced by motives of self-interest either through his connection with the industries that are benflei aries of the onerous war tariff, or through political affiliations with the party the avowed object of which is to make one class of citizens prosper ous at the expense of tho masses throughout the country. 

EDITORS' IDEAS. Scintillations from the Editorial Col umns of our Exchanges. NEVER WANTING. Cleveland Banner-News: Nash ville is never found wanting when it comes to political fights, railroad fights, or newspaper fights, as for as that matter. A J'OINTKR KOK HARMS. Humbolt Messenger : When a man voluntarily promises that H he is elected to a certain office, he will never again boa eandididate for tho same, the people are disposed to give him tne benefit of his proposition, and thereafter suffer .him to stay at home. Jsham J. Harris will re member the fact. 44 LET Ml.M WENT." liiou Democrat : Col. Cooper, of the American, has been in Washing ton, trying to get Col. Colyar, of the American, appointed to the Mexi can Mission. IfCol. Colyar should be appointed he would not be in Mexi co three weeks before lie would own ;i sii er mine, a railroad right Tay ! and tli.-:; ii Newspaper, be will irct tin It i to In' hoped appointment. CANNOT CLEANSE JAMES. Shelbyvllle s Gazette : v We under stand that Blaine is Indulging in Turkish baths in Paris. Although these wash very clean, it will , take more than a Turkish bath to rid Blaine of his political spots. 81EED THE CHANGE. Morristown Pilot : The proposed change of Inauguration day from March 4th to April 30, which every body favors, but which chronically fails of success from lack of consider ation, is to be pushed vigorously this season. Good luck to the move ment! - SPARKLES. Forked Deer Blade: Another man has blown in a gun. Total loss of man. Gun was saved. Man insur ed. Memphis Avalanche : The Supreme Court has decided that prohibition is constitutional. Inebriety is often so, too. S. O. Picayune: It It best for a young man to pay as he goes. If he has been stopping at a hotel long without baggage he must pay just a little before he goes. . N. O. Picayune : A man does not represent his state when he buys his way to Congress. He simply repie sents his own money, and . whenever his influence is wanted he can pe ap proached with money.
