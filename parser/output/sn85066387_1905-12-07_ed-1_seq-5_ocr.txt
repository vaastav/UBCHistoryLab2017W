The bill appropriating $16, 600,000 for canal work, which -was, the sub ject of discussion, will be read for amend ment and placed on Its flnal passase to morrow. The feature of the debate was the criticism indulgred in by both Repub licans and Democrats regarding ihe com pleteness of the statement of expendi tuxes and estimates supplied by the canal commission. Hepburn, in charge of the bill, made some effert to show that while detailed estimates might be made satis factory, at the same time, members of the House were not in a position to pass critical judgment on estimates on such work" prepared by expert engineers who held responsible positions and had been selected entirely because of their fitness. Bourke Cockran of New York took de cided exception to I this attitude on the part of Hepburn. To enforce his argu ment, he read the sentiment of the Presi dent In his message for economy and scrutiny of appropriations. The so-called "press agent" of the canal commission was criticized by sev eral speakers, and lack of definite infor mation as to the existence of such a po sition was shown. The place was de clared to carry a salary of $10,090 a year and some curiosity was manifested as to what were its duties. ISTHMIAX CA\AL IX SIX YEARS.j Major Gillette's Plan May Be Adopted by the Commission. -7; ', ; /'; WASHINGTON, Dec 6. — Congress probably never will be confronted with the duty of passing judgment on a plan for a sea level canal on the Isthmus of Panama. There is certain knowledge to-day that a canal plan which re ceived scant attention from the board of advisory engineers Is engrossing the attention of the Commissioners and that the President is studying it with a mind open to conviction. Official attention has been attracted by this plan because It holds out a glittering prospect of a complete canal in six years and at a cost of only about 5130.000.000, an amount smaller than the sum already authorized for canal construction. When the advisory board let it be known that a majority of its members favored a sea-level waterway, an army engineer was bold enough to say In print that to build a sea-level canal across the Isthmus of Panama . "would be the monumental engineering . mis take of the age." This statement, in the face of the opinions of. the great engineers of Europe, attracted notice because of its daring and it served another purpose, for it set the mem bers of the commission to the task. of. looking into the plan submitted by the presumptuous one. The report of the advisory board will not be made public in full for some time, but when it comes it will be found that any sug gested plan will have a strong rival already in the field. The officer who said plain . things about a sea-level canal is Major Cas 6ius E. Gillette, whom the city of Phila delphia wishes to put. in charge of its filtration works. Gillette submitted a plan for building the * Panama canal,; but little was heard of it and it was supposed it was slumbering .in canal headquarters. Now there is adequate authority for the statement that there is a sudden and sharp interest in the young officer's plan and this interest is on the part of those who will have the nnal word. 

SENATE GETS DOWN TO WORK. Several Hundred RIIIj* and Resolutions Introduced. WASHINGTON, Dec 6. — The Senate began business In earnest to-day. Several hundred bills and resolutions were Introduced and, referred to com mittees. . . There were resolutions dealing with the question of the national regulation of insurance companies, the incorpora tion of interstate railroad companies and the contribution of funds to po litical parties by national banks. Forakcr presented his railroad rate regulation bill; Gallinger his merchant marine subsidy bill;* Lodge a" bill pro- Tiding for a maximum . and minimum tariff rate schedule in the fnterest of reciprocity, and Culberson a bill mak ing it a- penal offenSe to use thermoney of Insurance companies in politics. . The nearest approach to a contro versy arose o% r er a resolution present ed by N'ewlands directing the Interstate Commerce Commission to draw a na^ tional incorporation,* act for railroads. Spooner criticized the proceeding as unworthy of the Senate. v ; Objection was made to consideration of a resolution offered by Tillman^for investigation of the subject- of national bank contributions for campaign- pur poses, and, the resolution went over for a day. * :-; 3TEW

The report of Mr. Sullivan's remarks was inadvertantly, left out of yesterday's Call. He spoke as follows: "Mr. Chairman, Mr. Mayor Phelan, gentlemen and fallow members of the Merchants' Association: I feel it quite an honor to address this body. I: do not be lieve as Chauncey Depew does, or Mr. Ford, that all speeches should, be made before people "eat. However,\ I would ap peal to my friend, Mayor < Phelan, or .Mr. John McNaught of The Call on that. ' r "I have heard the report of Mr. Par sons with much interest. You all. recall the .story of the man who, shot at" the owl. The question is, did Mr. Parsons hit the owl? Did he treat the transpor tation problem and us In a fair and legi timate way? ; . : "There are two sides to every question, I understand that. -The underground sys tem and the overhead trolley/system both have their advocates. But the election recently; showed that the underground conduit system was favored by a vast majority; in San Francisco. .«-*_. ':\u25a0\u25a0> : . . "Has Parsons -treated ' the subject '\u25a0>\u25a0. of street transportation in San* Francisco fairly -and legitimately? It^is" curious that when \ the ! poor citizens of ' ; Slitter street are working l.for. an .underground electric road,* such, a plea imfavor. of the overhead system .is \ given • to .'the ; . public' I do hot" wish to insinuate.anything.im proper in this connection, but. it seems strange to me. OVERHEAD SYSTEM IS BAD., ' "Unevennes»« -of ground, prejudice nsainnt poles,. the vote of the people (or an unclcrgrouud j aystem on Geary \u25a0treet and its Implied verdict against overhead .wires, are some, of the things that reply to the Parsons ' report : that San Francisco vrlll have .'undersrroand system" for Its center, even. If It -does have,.the n.ver)irud for Its snbnrbs. - The objections to the overhead system are the dlsflsarement of : streets by trolley 'wires and poles, constant ; danger. .to firemen from heavily charged vrires, dnnser of /nlres causing fires lit dwell ings, loss of current and : Interference with telegraph and telephone. "It" seems curious to hear; a report in praise of the overhead trolley'system only without even a reference to. the opinionof other dlstingished - engineers were fellow-members ni the London commis sion with Mr. . Parsons," and t who , were favorable to i the : underground . electric conduit. We know as a fact that the latter system was adopted by theLioridoh County Council, and further, that it;pro poses to use it on all, streets in London. The most striking thing about this -\u25a0 re port Is that while the author caits: away the cable as old rubbish \. he's insists on the use of the overhead »trolley." as -the only method of transit. The position the people are placed in by. its author re minds ons of Cramweil's Initial order to the Irish, r 'To hell or'Connacht.' ; Either was bad enough, but the witty CeltVre plied, 'You take hell,* I" will take Con nacht.' That is, our'people will stand. by the cable because they can't do anything else except to take the cheap , and nasty overhead trolley. , '' ' - REPORT I.S VALUELESS.

In this connection he says: During -the early spring: American interests encaged In the Alaskan' fisheries petitioned tin; department-. to. take steps- to prevent .the en croachment of Japanese,, fishermen-' on the sal mon 7 fisheries of Alaska. Hip the absence of a law prohibiting aliena from: fishing in Alaskan \u25a0n aters ' the department -couhl do no more ] than Investigate "the* situation.-. Instructions to this effect were accordingly Issued to the special agsnts of this department, and, through , the Trvasury . Department, "to the of fleers of ' Uie revenue cutter service. Acting •\u25a0 under \u25a0 these instructions Captain .W. H Robert?.— commanding the revenue cuiter Perry ' proceeded to - Attu " Island.

They had observed no customs regulations, were clearly trespassers and reft Saranna Bay with in twent7-four hours after tne arrival of the cutter. «. . . \u25a0.. The reports received by th« department by its special agents also show that during th» season thre?' other Japanese BChoonera entered regularly at Juaean, Alaska. This latter ex pedition did not attempt to conduct fishing op erations, but bought from American fishermen. While the extent of the operations of alien fishermen has not thus far assumed a formida ble or dangerous aspect, the situation Is never theless one which requires immediate attention. The catching,, curing and canning of salmon is 'an American Ipdustry of great promise. It J» estimated that the value of property Invests! , In this business Is $30,000,000: that th» nnmbur of employes U 25.C00 and that the value of the annual product !s J20.000.000. If the Jap ' anese are permitted to take salmon In Alaskan waters they. will not purchase from American fishermen and the sale or this commodity to Japan which In 1904 amounted to 5,451,1 M ': pounds, valued at $06, 2«, win decrease «r itil» altogether. In view of toe fact that: there are estimated to be nearly 900,000 Japanese families engaged In fishing: that Attu Island, where the Japa nese expeditions were discovered. In upward of "ninety-six miles nearer to Toklo than It fci to San Francisco, and that salted salmon Is a. favorite food among the Japanese. It Is fear*i that Japanese fishermen will swarm Into Alas kan waters In large numbers unless some pre ventive action Is Immediately taken by this Government. To that end I recommend the enactment of a law which will absolutely pro hibit allena from fishing In American water*. The administration of this law should be vested m the Secretary of Commerce and^La- bor \u25a0 who should be empowered to maae ana enforce such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry it into effect.
