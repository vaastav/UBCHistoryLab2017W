My. but that's tough on the fellows who have taken up arms to fight for world peace! Mr. Ivy clings to his original statement that there was no secrecy about his writing the "truth" of the Colorado mine strike situation. The war in European countries also depends upon the eitisen soldiery only over there they compel every citizen able to bear arms to be a soldier. . Governor Morehead's private secretary Is to become deputy attorney general, promotion or merely transfer to get in line to run for the main job later? 'Twas always thus: Those railroads least successful in attracting passenger patronage at 1 cents a mile lead in demanding a restoration of the 3-cent fares. A bulletin from the front says, "The kaiser triumphs with his substitutes.' It Is an old role of the game that a team is only as strong as Its pinch hitters. "Chicago's stray of unemployed numbers 15,000," says the Chicago Herald. But bow many of them are rsally Chicago's, or Omaha's, or any other large city's, where they congregate? The business Interests feel reassured by the peaceful tone of President Wilson's message. The president Is a scholar and a historian and knows how to read the lessons contained in the returns of the last election. What an inquisitive public would like to know is whether meters are attached to' sewer flush tanks in any other city besides Omaha. Perhaps the concerns that sell the meters may be able, to furnish the answer. The only strange thing about it is that those who want to prohibit American gun and cart ridge factories from selling their products to belligerents altogether overlooked the hostilities in Mexico, despite the notorious fact that the Mexican fighting was almost wholly carried on with American-made rttles, gunpowder and bullets. The city electrician has been ordered by the city council to refuse permits to the electric lighting company to Install heat and power service. How 1 anyone going to tell which is which? Electric current is what the lighting company supplies, and It Is up to the consumer to determine whether the current Is to be used for light, heat or power. A better solution of the problem than that order will have to be worked out. flli The new nltsltt school opened In tho basement of the laard hool, corner of Nineteenth and ilmr(j u In charge of Mr. II. p. 61.

Not "Was It Legal!" but "Was It Jost!" The dispute as to whether the dismissal without a hearing; of a public school teacher, charged with Insubordination, was or was not "legal" strikes us as a niece quibble. The real question is not, "Was the dismissal legal?" but "Was it justified and just?" If Just, It should stand; If -not, the teacher should be reinstated whether the dismissal was legal or not. On the question of Justification there Is pre sumably to be a difference of opinion, because a majority of the present members of the board, Including all who hold over, are on rec ord as upholding the dismissal. Dut they are not the final judges. The recently elected members of the board, soon to be installed, must deride this question, and the Important thing is that whatever their decision, it be ar rived at dispassionately and without prejudice, and with full knowledge of the facts. The people of Omaha do not want their School board to stick on legal technicalities; they wsnt justice done to one and all. Pan-American Solidarity. If all the countries of. North and South America are brought together in the right sort of mutual Interest alliance as a result of com plications growing out of the European war, that will be one of the few compensations to be looked for. Such an alliance, of course, must be of a purely peaceful character, resting on the principle of Pan-American solidarity, Indispensa ble to the highest good in commercial and diplomatic 'intercourse. The twenty nations of this weRtern hemisphere now protesting against encrouchments of belligerent vessels in South Amerfcan waters Is an indication of the possible achievement of this much desired goal. Out of the crucible of common grievances we ought to come ,to see what heretofore has been, for one reason and another, indistinct to many of us, that Pan-American solidarity is both natural and necessary. Of course, this relation has been Im possible chiefly because of a lack of mutual con fidences, and this lack Is now gradually disappearing. Practical Christmas Charity. As the atmosphere of the holiday season is conducive to loosening the well-springs of char ity, it is natural that appeals for assistance tor various worthy objects should be numerous at this particular time. For men and women who want to manifest the Christmas spirit by doing share toward relieving want and distress, many ways are open. They can help an estab lished charity organization, or be a "good fel low," or play "big brother" or "sister," or, at least equally good, get Into personal touch with the object of their giving. For the charitably Inclined to whom the per sonal element seems desirable, The Bee is point Ing out a most practical way by listing for our read-.rs a number of actual cases of needy fam ilies whose worthiness is vouched for by the Associated Charities, yet doing It in a manner that carefully avoids wounding the pride or sen sibilities of those who may he thus helped. Everyone who gives along this line may be sure he Is doing a good turn for really deserving un fortunates, whose appreciation will be shown by invoking blessings on their benefactors. Let Ui Keep to the Facti. , It will be much better for the Improvement required in both army and navy if public agita tion and discussion are confined strictly to the facts of actual conditions. Exaggeration one way or the other can but have an ill effect. When a great newspaper comes out with the statement that "the United States has ho army and an Inferior navy," whatever influence follows must be of the wrong sort. If ever there was a time for sober thinking and dispassionate utterance it is the present. The Bee stands for an ade quate amy and navy adequate for our own protection, but not adequate to the demands of a war footing. According to General Crosier, chief of the army ordnance, the facts are not being adhered to by those who say we are at the mercy of cir cumstances as compared with other nations. "Our field guns," declares General Croler. "are as good as any in the world." and as to other munitions, "the United States has.no need to feel .uncomfortable.'' "Ship for ship, the United States navy Is equal to, it not better than, that of Germany or any other nation," says Hear Admiral Badger. The Judgment and statement of these men should 5e entitled to consideration, certainly as much as statements from less responsible sources. Italy on the Threshold. Home's order for the army "to be ready for any aggression" is significant ol Italy's deter mination to go to war if occasion seems to re quire. Hope of avoiding the trills may not be abandoned and yet it would be remarkable if one of the leading powers, which had been a party to either the triple alliance or the triple entente, succeeded to the end In keeping out of the conflict that has enveloped all of Europe. Especially would Italy's escape be exceptional in view of the natural effect of transfer of Its af filiations from Germany and Austria to the allies, on whose side it will enlist. If at all. This order is evidently precipitated by certain Austrian advances. Italy's desire to continue at peace will not be doubted particularly in view of Its domeatlo affairs. On the other hand, the question has been raised that if Italy remained a non-participant to the end, it would be forced, regardless of the outcome, into a subordinate position among the nations of Europe. Despite such a contingency, it is disappointing that events should now have brought the Italians so periously close to the verge of war. The death of William W. Rockhlll removes an American who had achieved real skill as a diplomat, largely because of continuous service which gave him real opportunities. Death over took him at Honolulu while enroute to China to become official adviser to the president of that republic. In which capacity be would have undoubtedly earned fresh laurels. . Omaha's dollar gas case Is to go uu to the United 8ttcs supremo court on an appeal by the city. It la safe, then, to expect. the final de cision about the time the gas franchise expires, ana mere is nothing more to litigate. Active Service in War Time Graphic Sescription by E. Charles Vivian in Book Just Issued Enti tled "British Army from Within." Part XX (Conolueed from Yesterday). Marching on service la a different matter frmi inarching In the time of peace. Not only la there the strain of ever-ponftlble attack, but there Is alao, fr.r cavalry and Infantry, the weight of eervloe armament and equipment to le considered. Every man carrloa In his bandolier 150 rounds of ammunition for his rifle not a bit too much, when the rate of fire poaalbli with the modern rifle la taken Into account. But 150 round of ball cartridge I a serious matter when on haa to carry it throughout the day, and when active ervlce opens It la easy to understand why only really fit men are panned hy doctors Into the army. Ro fur as tho rank and file are concerned. It la power to en dure that makes the soldier on active service: bravery la needed. Initiative Is needed, hut staying power la needed most of all. There may be daya of solid marching without a sight of the enemy. One may form part of a flanktnz fores whose business Is to march from point to point, fighting but seldom, but always preaentlng a threat to the enemy or hie lines of communication, and th'is ever on the move, with very little tin for sleep or eating; again, one may be placed with a force which, haa to march half a day to come in contact with the enemy, and to fight the other half of the day: or yet again, it may he necessary to march an night In order to take a position or to be shot In the attempt at dawn. In time of peace and on maneuvers officers tako car that compensating time la allowed to men, so ss to give them the normal amount of rest: cn active service the officer" commanding a force epar-ee his men as much as he can and kIvck them all tli? rest possible, but has to be guided by circumstances, or to rise superior to circumstances and ranee hltnxolf and his men to undergo far tikire than normal ex ertions. War, as Carried out today, requires all thu every man has to give In the way of staying power, and now, ss In the days of the battleaxs and Iuiik bow, physical endurance is the greatest aaset a nun can have on setlvs service. T)e hard drinker lu time of peace and the man who has been looking for "soft Jobs" all the time of his peace service soon "go sick'' and become Ineffective; they may be Just ss breve as the rest, but they lack ths staying power renulaP.s to the carrying on of war. Men's Impressions of being under fire vsry so much that every account Is of Interest "My principal Im pression was that I'd like to run away, but there was nowhere to run to, so I stuck on,' and got used to It after a bit." "1 felt cold and horribly thirsty I never thought to be afraid till afterwards." "It was Inter esting till I saw the man next to ma roll over with a bullet In his head, and then I wanted to get up and go to the devils who had done that." Thus spoko three men when asked how they felt about It. My own Impression was chiefly a fear that I was going to be afraid I did not want to disgrace myself, but to be as good as the rest. One man who cams back wounded after the day of Mons described how he felt at first shooting a man and knowing that his bullet had taken effect for In the majority of cases, with a whole body of men firing, it Is difficult to tell which of the bullets tako effect This, however, was a clear case, and the man could not but know that he was responsible for the shot "I had four men with me on the rear guard," be raid, "and we were holding the end of a village atreet to let our chaps get away as far as possible before we mounted and caught up with them. We could see German Infantry coming on, masses of them, but thty couldn't tell whether the village street held five men or a couple of squadrons, so they held back a bit. At last I could see we were In danger of being out flanked, so I got my men to get mounted, and Just as they were doing so a German officer put his heal round the corner of the house at the end of the street not ten yards away from me. I raised my rifle, shut both eyes and pulled the trigger it was a point blank range, and when I opened my ryes and looked It seemed as If I'd blown half hbi face away., I felt scared at what I had done It seemed wrong to hav shot a man like that, though he and his kind drive women and children In front of their firing lines. It seemed to make such a horrible mess, somehow. I got mounted, and Just as I swung my leg over ths horse a foolhardy German Infantryman aimed a Mow at me with the butt end of his rifle I don't know where he sprung from and damaged my arm Ilka thla. If he'd had the sense he could have run me throurh with a bayonet or shot me, but I suppose he was too flurried. But that officer's face after I shot him stuck to me, and I still dream of l( and shall for some time, probably." He who told this story Is a boy of 21 or 23, and n has gone back to the front to rejoin his regiment now with three stripes on his arm. Instead of ths two that were his at the beginning of the campaign. On forced marches, ami often on normal marches as well, all the things that one considers necessities with the exception of sufficient food te keep on in condition go by the bbard. One sleeps under tho Stars, with no other covering than a coat and blanket; one lies out to sleep In pouring rain,- with rto more covering; tents are out of question, for there Is no time to pitch and strike them. One goes for day without a wash, and for days, too, without tindresain?. There were two scamps In the South African cam paign who promised each other, for some mysterious reason, that they would not take their boots off for a month, and they ran Into such a series of marches and actions thatreven If thty had not made ths con-.-pact, they would only have been able to remove their boots three times In the course of that month. The smart soldier of peace service goes unshaven, un washed, careless of all except getting enough of food and sleep at times; and when a lull comes In the operations, so that he gels a dsy or svsn an hour r two to himself, a bath ts a luxury undreamed of hy the man who can have one every morning and con sider It a mere usual thing. If In time of pesce the soldier considers a rifle carelessly, and even rssents having te carry it about with htm, he looks on It differently on service, know ing as he does that his life may depend on the quality of the weapon, and his ability to use It at almost any minute of ths day and night The confirmed "grouser" of peace time, who will make a fuss over having to put twenty rounds of blank ammunition In his bando lier to go out on a field day. will swing his thre bandoliers of ball cartridges onto his person without a word of complaint, for he knows that he may need every round. Valuee alter amasingly on service: tiie man with a box of matches, when bne has been away from the base for a few daya, is a person of Import ance, and a mere clgarslta ts worth far more than Ita weight In gold. In General Bundle's column, during the 8outli African war, half a biscuit was something to fight for, and the men who thought It such had many a time thrown away the aame sort of unpalata ble biscuits and bought breat to eat instead. An ant heap acquired a new significance, for It might be the means of saving a man's life st any time, and amonj mounted men a "fresh" horse, which might eTive Its rider some trouble st the time cf mounting, was ni longer to be avoided, 4or by Its freahnesa It showed that it had plenty of spirit snd go about It spirit that might take a man out of rifle range at a critical moment, when the alower class of mount might com) out of action without Its rider. This reversal of the circumstances of ordinary life produces lasting effect on men; no man who has undergone the realities df active service comes back to the average of life un changed. The difference In him may not be apparent at a casual glance, but It Is there, for the rest of his life. He has looked en death at close quarters, and. whatever his Intelligence may be whether he be gut. terenlpe or vanity man. ease or fool he has a clearer realisation of the ultimate values of things. One may count the army In peace time as a great training achool, out of which men come molded to a deflnlt-' pattern, and yet retaining their Individuality. Dut actle service 1 a fire through which men pass, emerging on the far aide purlflrd of Utile alius to greater or leaa extent according to the material on which th fire haa to work.

HKN80X, Neb.. Dec, t.-To the KdltoT nf The Pee: In reply to my fellow editor, J. It. Riggs of Wateiloo. let me ssy thla for ths people of Benson: Your criticism of the manner In which the Douglas County Agricultural aoelety ronducted Its snnuai meeting In Omaha, states that the country precincts have no represen tation on the hoard of dlrectora and also that the meeting was controlled by Ben son. Let us look over the list of the newly elected directors for the year of 1115 and at thn same time note their resi dence address: I ami I Henderson. South Omaha. H. Munson. Kouth Omaha. Paul Kloth. Omaha. A. E. A see. Waterloo precinct. I. A. Compton, Waterloo precinct. William Kicke, McArdle precinct. George IMerka. Jefferson precinct. John . McArdle. Klkhnrn precinct. John Blelck. t'nlon precinct. E. M. Kckman, t'nlon precinct Jamen Walsh. Benson. Charles Haffke. Renson. W. 8. Wright. Benson. Does the apove list of directors show a clfy controlled body? I think myself that the country precincts are, pretty well rep resented. Last year Benson notified the manage ment of the fair association that Its citlsens would make an effort to secure the fair for J13, and as Elkhorn came In with a delegation 150 strong It behooved i Benson to get busy. There were five tick ets In the field. Florence, South Omaha. Wateiloo, Elkhorn and Benson, alt com petitors for the location. The new board Is composed of but three Pensonltes, ten being scattered through out the county ss well as could be ex pected and as there are more farmers and exhibitors in the country than fair man sgers, the majority of the men elected should be men who understand how to mnnage a county fair, and I, for one, believe that every man on the present board Is thoroughly competent and re liable. They receive only S3 a day dur ing fair week and must pay their own expenses, to say nothing of losing much valuable time from their farm and busi ness vocations. It la true that the business men of Ben son, from a business standpoint, would like to have the county fair located at Benson. If only for one year, and It Is also nstursl to expect the different as pirants for location as well as the many candidates to suffer some disappointment at being defeated. Benson will guarantee one of the best county fairs ever held In Douglas county for the year J916. and any dobuting Thomas better come out and be shown. Agreeing with my brother editor that taxation without representation Is tyr anny, and that Benson ssks only for a fair and square deal. E. M.
