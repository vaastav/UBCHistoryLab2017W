PRESIDENT ITCHING FOR STILL ANOTHER FRAY Would Teach Solons on Capi tol Hill a Good Lesson in Few Remaining Months of Administration. Washington, D. C, Dec. 12. Presi dent Roosevelt is getting ready for ftny emergency that may arise in con nection with the congress' action in appointing a committee to report what action, if any, that body should take Jn reference to objectionable words used In the president's message of last Tuesday. When Roosevelt heard of the lower house's action yesterday af ternoon he immediately began to Cmear on the war paint. The "big stick" was hauled out of the closet and many of the knots hich have been worn smooth by fre Quent use were subjected to treatment by the executive whittling knife, so that when the weapon falls the impact svlll be palpable to a painful degress by those upon whom it descends. Teddy Itches For Fray. To tell the truth "Teddy" is actually Itching for a genuine, old-fashioned tussle with the solons on Capitol Hill, evidently on the theory that he needs R little more practice before tackling the untamed things he encounters next year in the African jungle. For let no one imagine that Roose velt intends to go voluntarily or be rhoved into an eclipse against his will , ,wtn the final quarter of the last .year of bis administration. It was by a unanimous vote that the bouse adopted the resolution, although there was no unseemly demonstration. The members seemed to be impressed with the solemnity of the proceeding, the like of which has not been wit nessed for 68 years; and on the last' occasion John Quincy AdamB, the ex president, who was rounding owt his career as a member of the house, play ed the same role that Mr. James B. Perkins did in presenting the resolu tion for the appointment of a commit tee. Possibly the stillness and order liness could be attributed in part to a ubcutlcular quiver of apprehension Jest the bogy man from the white liouso suddenly might burst into the Chamber and start a 6tampede. : Roosevelt Quick to Act. The tremulous sigh of relief follow- f ng the adoption of the Perkins reso lutions had scarcely died away when the president began to get busy. He sent for John E. Wilkie, chief of the secret service, whom he directed to prepare some data for use in the im mediate future. The chief will get to gether a mass of information pertain ing to the operation of the service, in x?rder to enable the president to dem onstrate, if possible, that there was Come . Justification for the earnest though not exactly recherche manner in which he discussed the secret ser vice matter in his message. It is evi dently the president's purpose to en deavor to show that he was proceed ing upon the. right principle in trans ferring these men to the various de partments, and that that was the only way in which irregularities could be detected to a certainty. There is no doubt that he expects to Jiand back to congress something as tot as a Mexican tamale. The pres ence of Speaker Cannon at the execu tive offices about the time Chief Wil kie was there was responsible for a report, evidently authentic, that the president has asked him to call for the purpose of discussing the contemplat ed rebuke from congress. It is signifi cant that no one in authority at the white house nor the speaker himself denied that this was the snbject of their conversation. What the' presi dent said to "Uncle Joe" must be left to the imagination for the time being, although it is intimated that he assur ed the speaker he was ready for a tight or a frolic.

TAFT'S PROBABLE CABINET WEST AND NORTHWEST DESIRE PLACES IN DIPLOMATIC SERV ICEROOT CONFERS WITH PRESIDENT-ELECT TODAY. Washington, D. C, Dec. 12. Presi dent Roosevelt and President-elect William H. Taft had an extended con ference last night at the White House. Many matters relative to the present and next administration were discuss ed, not the least important of which was a general talk regarding the Taft cabinet. The conference began after 10 o'clock, at the conclusion of a dinner at the home of Assistant Secretary of the Treasury and Mrs. Winthrop, at tended by Mr. and Mrs. Taft. Before the conference Mr. Taft announced that it would be entirely an executive ession, and that he should decline to give any details whatever, aside from the advance announcement that he should talk over many important mat ters with the president. - Expect Talk With : Root.

LONG TRIAL LIKELY Unless Keller, Alleged Murder er, Pleads Guilty, Week May Be Taken. OTHER CASES POSTPONED. Beginning with the Keller murder case, there will be sessions of the Wayne circuit court from Monday un til the second Saturday following, with the exception of Christmas day. It is probable that if Sherman Keller per sists in contesting the charge of first degree murder placed against him, the trial will require the greater part of the week. Keller has retained counel. Other important cases, which have been docketed for trial and had to be continued, will be called. The court will attempt to get the docket as nearly free from all cases as possible by the time the January term opens. Wild Ride on Ira Swisher Rides Long Distance Clinging to Pullman as Train Travels Through Storm. 50 Miles an Hour. Loraine, O., Dec. 12. Locked on the outside of a Pullman sleeper and having but a narrow edge of step on which to cling while the B. & O. flyer cut the storm at the rate of 50 miles an hour. Manager Ira Swisher, of North Bros. Stock company at the Ma jestic this week, had about as thrill ing a ride Sunday night as might be depicted in one of his shows on the stage. At least he is thankful to be in little old Loraine, well and alive, even If the white still persists in clinging to portions of his face, the region of his unusually smiling mouth, for Instance.

M'CUTCHEON TOASTMASTER CREAM OF HOOSIER TALENT IN LITERATURE REPRESENTED IN ANNUAL SESSION ABOUT BAN QUET BOARD LAST NIGHT. "What are we of Indiana going to do to honor the approaching centen nial in memory of Abraham Lincoln?" asked the Rev. J. Everist Cat hell, of this city, at Chicago, last night. He was speaking before the members of the Indiana Society of Chicago. His remarks turned the minds of his hear ers from jest and gayety to serious ness in response to the toast "A State less Citizen of the Republic." He de clared himself to be stateless, having been born in the District of Columbia, and reminded his hearers that Abra ham Lincoln, also, was stateless. The men assembled about the ban quet tables represented the cream of Hoosier talent in literature. Numbered in the gathering, also, were bankers, manufacturers - and merchants who claim Indiana as the state of their na tivity. Dr. Cathell is an ardent dis cipleof Lincoln and probably is better acquainted with the history of the martyred president than any man ia this section of the country. In response to the toast Dr. Cathell said: "All that Abraham Lincoln ever learned, for the most part, he got on and from the soil of Indiana. There he prepared himself for that leader ship which has brought his memory imperishable fame. There should be a Lincoln schoolhouse in every city, village and hamlet in Indiana. This much Indiana should do to honor his memory, and she should lead the states in the observance of his anni versary." - A Chicago dispatch says of the ban quet: - Indiana invaded Chicago last night and acquired by annexation for the nonce that portion of the city which is occupied by the Auditorium Annex. ho tel, in general, and in particular that part of the hotel which is designated as the gold ballroom. At least, annexation was declared by the 300 members of the Indiana Socie ty of Chicago, who still acknowledge allegiance to the Hoosier state, at the occasion of the fourth annual ban quet of the society. Of the good things eatable there was plenty, of the good things convivial there was nearly as much, but of good things expressible there was most, and these from George Ade, on the eve of a trip abroad: Meredith Nicholson, well-known authors; from Addison C. Harris, former ambassador to Austria, and from the Rev. J. Everist Cathell, just "from Indiana." Of things observable the chief was a handsome de luxe menue and pro gram, with drawings by Christy from the literary works of Indiana authors and novelists, the plates for which were broken when the edition of 350 was run off. It was President Joseph H. Defrees who opened the program of speaking and the feast of wit and humor and oratory and stor ytelling began with the Introduction of George Barr Mc Cutcheon as toastmaster. The novel ist met with a hearty round of ap plause, and then with sober face and mirthless mien proceeded to encourage his fellow Hoosiers to apoplectic laughter. OUT OF

REVENGE IS SOUGHT. CLAIMED BY SOME REPUBLICANS THAT TEMPERANCE WORKERS FAILED TO KEEP THEIR PLEDG ES LAST ELECTION. Those who are behind the move ment to drive the saloons out of the county are greatly alarmed over the prospects of the movement, principal ly because of the attitude taken by a large number of republicans. Every effort has been made by the county local option workers to keep politics out of the campaign against the sa loons but this now appears to be a hopeless task. "We lined up wilh the temperance people this fall and were defeated at the polls because many of the temper ance voters who promised us their support turned us down and voted the prohibition ticket. They turned us down now we will turn them down and vote wet," is what many staunch republicans throughout the county are saying. This is where politics is creeping iuto the' anti-saloon tarn paign. To these disgruntled republicans the mention of the Indiana Anti-Saloon league has about the same effect a red flag has on a bull. They say that the league promised to deliver the temperance vote if a county local op tion plank was embodied in the repub lican platform. They say the republi can party carried out its agreement but the league failed to produce the strength it claimed to have and Mar shall was elected governor. Situation in Franklin Tp. A well known young republican of Franklin township was in the city last evening. He stated that the drys would carry the township in the event of an election but that they would only have a small majority. He said many republicans would vote wet be cause of the feeling against the tem perance people. "No petition has been circulated in Franklin township asking that a coun ty local option election be held. Sev eral of the temperance people in Franklin township have attended tem perance meetings in Richmond but that is the only sign of interest dis played in the campaign so far," re marked the man referred to. He is known as a liberal. Temperance peo ple in Franklin township state that that township has always been dry and it will give a large temperance majority. III JW

Pollard, a butcher boy of Evanston, last night confessed the authorship of (he mysterious "Knights of the White Death" letters which have been re ceived by five prominent Chicagoans at intervals during the last four ninths.

Pollard said he got human bones and coffin handles and other trimmings from old graves at Calvary cemetery, where his father was sexton for twen ty years. These he attached to the letters, which in each case demanded large sums of money on pain of death. He alone, he declared was "The Knights of the White Death." He never had .breathed a word of his plot to a living soul. He Just Wants to Annoy Police. The boy claimed his only object In writing the letters was to start trouble for the police, get his name in the newspapers, and prove he had a cun ning mind something which many of his friends appear to have disputed. He had no knowledge of or enmity against the persons to whom he ad dressed the letters. Never, he said, did he receive a cent of money, or ex pect to. It was all a joke. The postoffice officials do not con sider it a joke, although they have not decided what disposition to make of the young man.
