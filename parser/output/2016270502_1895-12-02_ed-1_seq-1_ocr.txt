VOL. VIII. NO. 307 WATERBURY, CONN., MONDAY, DECEMBER 2, 1895. PRICE TWO CENTS FIRST DAY OF-' CONGRESS. THE FIFTY-FOURTH SESSION OF THE NATIONAL LEGISLATURE. The Annual Report of Secretary Ilerbert on the- Conditions and Keeds of Oui i Nary The Work of Shipbuilding Need of Armament. WAsniXGTO, Deo. 2. The first wools ot the Fifty-fourth congress, which con vened at noon today, promises nothing aij either end of the capitol in tho way of ac-1 tual legislation. The time beforo the , Christmas holidays is usually devotod tc preliminary matters, andthe work of tht Bession does not begin until after the re cess. The new congress will probably not be an exception to this rule. The stnatc .proceedings may bo enlivened by an at tempt at reorganization, but in the housc nothing can be done until tho committees ' are appointed. Speaker elect Reed says that the com mittees will not bo announced this week, with perhaps a single exception the com mittee on rules. This committee formu lates the rules which are to govern the house during its sessions, and it, is cus tomary for tho speaker to name it during the first week in order that it can imme diately begin its labors. While it is be lieved that the rules of the Fifty-first con gress, over which Mr. Reed presided, will be reported for the guidance of the pres ent house, it is understood that a few changes wlU be made, as a result of expe rience, which are designed to still furthei improve tho house machinery and the fa cilitation of public business. Mr. Keer, clerk of tho last house, called the house to order. After the roll call the election of tho officers nominated by the Republican caucus Saturday night occur red, and tho drawing of seats, which ig known as the congressional "raffle," fol lowed. This is a somewhat tedious, but an nmusing affair. The reading of the president's message Will consume " ?day, and at Its conclu sion the hot will probably adjourn un til Thursday, and on convening Thursday adjourn immediately until Monday. Those adjournments will continue probably tfn til the. committees are announced.-This is the programme, but the unexpected might ocour, as it so often does in tho house, il Borne aspiring member should introduce a sensational resolution and ask for'its im mediate consideration. t ( The Senate Organization It is not probable that the first week oi congress will witness much serious effort at legislative work in the senate. If any thing should be accomplished beyond the receipt of the president's message and oi the recess nominations and tho introduc tion of bills, the session would be an ex- ception in the history of the senate. In view of the fact that the message Will not be received funtil tomorrow, the proceedings of today consisted in the swearing in of the newly elected members who were present &nd the appointment of a committee to wait upon the presidont. The message will be read tomorrow, and the brief sessions of Wednesday and Thurs day will be devoted largely to the intro duction of bills, of which there will be several hundred. Following precedents, tho senate will adjourn on Thursday until tho following Monday. One or two brief executive ses sions for the reference of nominations are also among the probabilities for the week. If the Republicans decide upon an effort to reorganize, as is now generally conced ed, the democrats will follow with a con ference tomorrow or Wednesday, at which they probably will decide upon a course of action. It nc; appears probable that all three parties will place candidates for president pro tempore in the field, and in that event the week will be enlivened somewhat by a triangular contest for this and the other offices of tho senate. The Needs of the Navy. In his annual report to tho prosident H. A. Herbert, secretary of tho navyi compares the numerical strength of na vies oi the world. Tfto report in part is as follows: "Great Britain, as usual, is leadin both in the number and strength of ships in service and in building programme, with 274 ships in service, not including torpedo boats. She has 42 vessels now un der construction, of which ten are battle ships. It will be observed that, in accord ance with England's policy of placing her first lino of defense at the enemy's coast, no coast defense vessels are building for that country. The displacement of the first class battleship in her present pro gramme is 14, 900 tons; that of the second class, 12,350. France, with 144 effective vessels in service, exclusive of torpedo boats, has a building programme calling for an increase of 33 vessels, of which five (possibly six) are battleships and four, are armored cruisers. Russia has 18 ships building, of which 15 are armored; in 6ervicev,100. Italy has in service 71 ves sels; tho number building is: Armored, eight (six battleships), and unarmored, seven. Germany has 74 efficient ships and istbuilding four armored and four un armored. Spain is showing increased ac tivity and is building ten additional ves sels, of which one-half are armored, which will make a total effective strength of 52. The Dutch navy numbers 92 effective ves sels; the additions are to be three armor ed and four unarmored vessels. New Vessels For South America. "On this continent Argentina, Brazil and Chili have, all told, ordered abroad six armored and nine unarmored vessels. For the Asiatic powers there are now building in England; two battleships for Japan, aad a third will probably be com menced soon. "The system of gun construction adopted whon the reconstruction of the navy was undertaken remains unchanged in its general features and is considered fully equal, if not superior, to any that has since be i tried hero or abroad. Of the 539 guns from 4 inch to 18 inch cali berthus far ordered 483 are wholly or in great part completed, and 308 are afloat. "The problem of a satisfactory supply of powder for the larger guns has nbt yet reached complete solution. So far it has been found impossible to obtain a regular supply of powder for either the 12 inch or 13 inch guns whioh will give the desired muzzle velocity to the projectiles without exceeding the prescribed limit of pressure in the bore.- " Congress has heretofore failed to ap propriate any portion of the $500,000 ask ed for to arm the. auxiliary navy. Tvfo other fine ships, the St. Paul and the St Louis, have come to our auxiliary navy, and they are a8 yet without armament. The department "is exercising at present overy power vested in it by law to secure gun3 and ordnance material, but it ig much hampered by the want of epecifio authority and necessary appropriations." Iteed Elected Speaker. "Washington, Dec 2. When tho roll was called to-day for the election of a speaker 336 members of the house were in their seats. The vote was as follows : Reed, 234; Crisp, 95; Bell G; Culbertson, 1. Heed was immediately sworn in.

Elmar Keller, a naturalized American citizen, living at 719 East Sixth street, is about to bring io the attention of the state department an outrage he was subjected to by the Hun garian government.

Keller was married on Sept. 2, 1894, and went on his wedding trip to Hunga ry, his native land, which he had left sev en years ago. At Uudapesth, on jilarcn ; 16 of this year, he received a summons from the associate county julgo to appear before the military commissioners for ex amination regarding his fitness for the army. Being an American citizen, he ig nored the order. Receiving a second sum mons, he went before Judge Jelinck and showed his naturalization papers. The judge said, "If yon are an American citi zen, why didn't you stay thero?" The forco of the judge's logic did not appeal to ths young husband, who, hav ing had no previous experience in that liifo, cherished tho idea that tho United States protected its citizens abroad. De spite his protests and tho lamentations of his wife he was forced into the army and assigned to the regular K. U. K. infantry, Sixty-fifth regiment. Ruined' His Health. He is not robust, and the trials of a soldier's life told severely on him. His bride, from whom he had been merciless ly torn, had to live with relatives and seek menial employment, as the pay of a Hun garian soldier is only six kreutzers a day, about 2 cents. Keller appealed to the American minister at Budapesth. The minister promised to frtelp and then took no further interest In the oase. The bride, after several months of ceaseless endeav or, finally obtained an audience with tho minister of foreign affairs. She fell on her knees, and, amid tears, begged for her husband's release The minister did not act promptly, and it was six months after Keller was deprived of his freedom before he was discharged. He determined to lose no time getting out of his native land, to which he had taken a strong dislike. The American minister, however, delayed re turning his naturalization papers, which put him to further delay. Failing in health and. ruined financial ly he was in a sorry plight. He borrowed money to come back to the United States, but his wife still rem!'intbehind.wKo says that , any, of his countrymen who havo made the United States their adopted home are liable to be similarly treated, , o - Married In Three States.
