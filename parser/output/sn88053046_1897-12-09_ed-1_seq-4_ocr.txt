TH Vit S It.4 I •111«, rrmlde Tho tiret regular musuagnof President McKinley was sent to Congress Monday, and tbo full text of tho document will be found on other pages of tbie issue. We commend it to tho careful at tention of our readors. In a general isuso, tho message will bo found interesting, with all State papers dealing with tho condition of alTaira in this country. It will also prove pleasing in some ro •poets, and disappointing in others. Disappointment will come with iho earlier sections of tbo message. In them tbe President endorses tho tnrilT legislation of the special aeBsion—do spito ita admitted failure—and fails to give to the important question of cur rency reform tbo encouragement that tbo friends of sound money and tbe gold standard would like to seo. He does not recommend that tbe govern ment be taken out of the banking business, but as a check against tho Uraiuiug of tho Treasury cold reserve for the purpoBoa of redemption, sug gests that, "us soon as the ■hall be sufficient to meet tbo oxponses of tbe government, " notes presented for redemption and redeemed in gold, instead of being reissued, tbe case, shall bo kept apart and only reiesuod in exchange for gold. Thin would prove some sort of protection to tbe gold rosorve, bub it would be but a makeshift at best, and far from satis factorily taking the place of a thorough revision of our curroncy system, with a withdrawal of the government cotos, the coniining of the functions of tho government to tbe coining of metal money, and the relegation of paper currency issue to the banks, where it belong«. In his troatmont of the Cuban quos tion, tbe President will terribly dis appoint tbe jingoos of tbe country, but he will bo sustained hy tbe wound senti ment of tho people. He is emphatically against the unwarranted interferonco of tbia couutry with the Cuban re bellion. "1 cannot speak of forcible annexation,'' ho Bays, "for that cannot be thought of. That, by our code of morality, would be criminal aggres sion." lie oxprosBes his belief that it would be unwise for the United States to recognize tue belligerency of tbo Cuban revolutionists, and practicHily ggefita that tbe beet plan will be to quietly await developments. tbe case 1 of of Quite tho reverse, however, is the President's attitude Hawaii towards the Islands. Ho recommends annexation, without reservation. The wildest jingo could not ask that bo go further. He endorsos the annoxatiou folly with all hi9 heart, although it cannot bo urged that ho advances any but tbe oid Bterootyped arguments, which have boon refuted and proved to be absolutely worthless,timo and again. Another disquieting feature of tbe message is tho evident encouragement extended to tbe Intornucionu! Monetary Commission, which, aside from a little bit of unmeaning encouragement in France, proved to ba such failure in the attempt to secure the aid 1 of Continental Europe in bolstering the faiii.i.* ..n um» „ t «siL *\r « ? ! n u coinagD. Tno j 1 resident still hopes lor an inter- j national agreement with respect to tho cornage of gold and silver, and in ibis respect, together with bia half hearted support of the cauus of cur , . . reucy reform, gives goou ground for the apprehension felt during the political campaign of last year, that bo never was in favor of the gold standard, and that his natural inclina *■ D Ä j- , , .. , tionsneru ln tb« d.rcction of tbo silver folly. It is in thene respects that tbe message will prove n groat disappoint ment to the business interests of tbo country. Tn hin atinain. t *u , . In bis ahusion to tha eoal contro tursy, now apparently trending toward« asatiafactory sottloment, the President gives utteranco to a sentiment that will most with universal approval, when he eay.: ■■ Inierea.iona, erbi,ration represents the beet sentiment of the civilized world," Attention iu also given in the mes sage to our decaving merchant marine and to tho Hiih.Wt nt ami to the subject of reciprocal trade arrangements, now mere than ever nucessury since tbo enactment of the Dingley bill and tbe detriment it threatens to absolute foreign trade. Tbe improvement of our navy aud of const defences is also recommended. But sad and disappointing beyond mausuro is the concluding portion of the message, which treats of the Civil Sorvice. Tho President plainly recom mends making exemptions in fav veterans of tho late war, anil goes oven further in a declaration that uxemp tiona will also be made of "which be thinks our of cases iil have been im properly included in thu classified service, or those which, in his judg ment, will best promote tho public service." Outside of tbia, be will deavor to uphold and extend the system. But when tbe veteran exomptions, •nd tbe exemptions to correct improper classifications and to "promote the public service" aro through witji, it is feared there will be little left Civil Berrico Reform. Tbe I'resident has practically given notice that tho old policy of "to tbe victors belong tbe spoils" is to be restored, and that public offices aro to be hold as rewards for political services, and not to be administered for tbe benefit of the people. VVu aro of the opinion that tho sago will proroko a great deal of ment, much of which will be of a strongly objootive character. However, again call attention to its full tost, printed olsowhere, and urge nli who interested to road and judgo fur themieivos. f real trusts m'ïs I the City bankers, as n rule, nowadays I of dnn't have much to sav in praiie of the ton Democratic pHrtv. But n firm of promi nent bankers in'tho city of New York ; is inadvertently furnishing cjnvincing A® Idence of tbe fidelity with which tho to Democratic partv bus gotornnd the much fifnto of Delaware. tolu These bankers, Messrs. N. W. Harris bo™ A Go., have beon sending court circti- ««id, lars offering for sale some of the bond« this of tbiu Stute. The mere fact that n °r premium is asked on bonds which bear interest at tho low rate of il percent per annum is tbe highest sort of a testimonial to our credit and reputation ^" beyond our own borders. In their circulars Messrs. Harris A K0,1 Co. direct attention to facts which cause should be burno in mind by every Hve citizen of tbiu State. Tbe State has 9 f revonue-produciDg assets which exceed *° the bonded indebtedness by $254,702. *he Tbe dobt itself is only a fraction over oent of the assessed valuation. aDC0 Htate in the Union ühs a higher .

Referring to tbu advertisement of n I \ Now York banking firm which recently purchased the Delaware Stato refund* ! iug iottu of $215,000, bearing interflit at the rule of H per cout per annum, tbe Delawureun ubtn : 1 S credit than forty years of almost continuous Demo cratic rule in Delaware. Tbe comments of tbe Delawarean ire pertinent and significant,although some of its assumptions may be opon to question. While it may bn true, as a rule, that "city bankers nowadays don't have much to say in praise of tbe Democratic party,'' it is probably due to tbe fact that in the last national campaign the Democratic party not in accord with those principles which "city bankers, "as well as others interested in the prosperity and wel fare of tbe country, conceived to be best calculated to advance that pros purity and promote that welfare. Many "city bankers," particularly those of New York, have for yoars been allied with the Democratic party, thoroughly in sympathy with its dinal doctrine« of honest money, iocal self-government and b tari IT for revenu* ly The fact that to-day the credit of Delaware, after forty years of Dumo cratic rule, is tnoroiai and financial center of the high in tbe com One country, may be due to tbo consistency of tbe Democratic party of tbo State in tho advocacy of Bound Democratic principles. It should be borne in mind that Democrats of Delaw the tho tbo W. N. by in the last campaign tbe , in State con vention assembled, declared emphati cally iu fuvor of tho maintenance of national tbo existing standard of currency, and "against tbe free coin age of silver at any ratio." Perhaps this had a grout deal to do with pre serving tbe high credit of tbe titate in these precarious times. At any r^*», are both i^jkinent and practical, and commend them to the caroful con sideration of the Delawarean and other feei tbot these facts Democratic papers of tha State who Buem inclined to tbe suicidal policy that tbo great Democratic party of tbo country shall "bow the knee to liaal and worship after strange gods." in G a «•cretnry Once'« 1*1 Secretary of the Treasury Gage makes these recommendations m hie official report, which was sent to CoDgross yes terday : "First—I recommend that propor legislation beonnct»*d which will eetab 1 iah, separate and apart from tbe ordi nary operations of the Treasury as they roiato in re * aud expenditures, a 1 department to be designated and known ?,? t . b . 0 . 1b , b , u ? ?

The word "coin," now used to exprosa tbe obligation in thn public dobt, is an ambiguous word. It ia no doubt understood by tbe pore discrimi nating public creditor to mean gold coin, and the solemn act of Congress pledging the maintenance of silver coin upon a parity with gold coin makes it impossiblo to construe tbe word therein usod, to mean any of is of a "coin, " tbing other than gold or its full equivn lent.
