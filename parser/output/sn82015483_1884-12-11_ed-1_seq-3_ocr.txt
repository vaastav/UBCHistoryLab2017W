Taken TJp By IHedieal Students She Comes Out or Her Trance A Story That Read Uk Romance. Great Babbinston, Mass., Dec. 10. Egremont township is greatly excited over the strange report which has prevailed there for the past three days. It seems that in 1879 Miss Es telle Newman,, aged about thirty years, of an old' lnnaential ana at one time wealthy family, after a long sickness with nervous spinal complaint to- all appearances died. The funeral was held at the local Methodist church, of which she was a mem ber and the organist, and was largely attend ed. The deceased maiden was laid out with all the Anery which wealth could bestow. A widowed mother and a sister with many friends followed her to the little cemetery where she was laid beside her father, Har- rick Newman, who had died some years be fore. At the time of Kstelle's supposed death and burial a young medical student named Worth H. Wright was home from the Albany medical college. This Dr. Wright graduated in a year or two and began practising medicine, but was addicted to intemperance and one night at Newton, Ct., fell into the hands of roughs and was mur dered. It is now asserted in the report that causes the excitement that Wallace Wright, brother of the deceased, says that the night Miss Newman was buried, in company with his brother and two other medical students, he proceeded to the cemetery and exhumed Miss Newman's body, filling the grave care fully; the remains were placed in a sack with good care, conveyed to the Albany dis secting room where, to the horror and sur prise of all, the lady, with whom Dr. Wright had for years been well acquainted, was found to be alive and in a brief period came out of her trance. She was insane before the trance and so she continued. Being ten derly nursed she so far recovered that she was taken to some insane asylum of Scho harie county, New York, where she is yet alive. She frequently speaks of Dr. Wright, now deceased. In support of this story a cousin of Miss Newman to-day said a gentleman of Hinsdale of good standing stated no longer ago than Monday that the brother of tne dootor in formed him that the statement is true and that Worth Wright so informed him. The relatives of Miss Newman appear loth to in vestigate, for what reason is unknown unless it be the expense of supporting Miss Newman in her insane condition, they hardly being able at this time to assume so great a respon sibility. The informant further states that unless her relatives take action soon the au thorities will be applied to for permission to open the grave, which will partially, and if the body is tound entirely, settle tne question whether Miss Newman is alive or not. Veatla of a Philanthropist. Cimcinkati, Deo. 10. Reuben B. Spring er, a well known philanthropist and one of the most distinguished citizens of this city, died to-day. His death was unexpected as he seemed to have gained a new lease of life since the long illness he underwent last win ter. Mr. Springer was a native of Frank fort, Ky. . During his youth he was a boat man on the Ohio, but leaving this employ ment he went into the commission business on Front street, the firm being Springer, Kilgore 6t Taylor. In 1830 he married Miss Kilgore. In 1840 he withdrew from busir i. Since then he has attended to many details necessary to be looked after in his railroad and bank interests. He used to say he would rather wear out than rust out. A brother of Mr. Springer succeeded to his bus iness on Front street and continued until death in 1852, when the ship Arctic in which he was a passenger was wrecked on the coast of Newfoundland by the French vessel Vesta. He was a devoted supporter of the Catholic church. He was principally known, howev er, by his nnostentaiious charity which con- stantly brought comton ana nappiut to manv of the suffering poor. A friend of his remarked this afternoon that Eeuben Spring er was till this morning the Girard and Peabody of the present day. It may be truly said that the world was better and happier for his having lived in it. Mr, Springer was widely known on account or nis gin to ine Cincinnati public in the form of a music Hall, exposition building ana couege oi iuu ic to which he has contributed within the past nine years about $300,000, A Billiard Tournament. New York, Deo. 10. The billiard tourna ment agitated at the recent dinner to Jacob Schaefer has been determined and the date fixed for April 20,1885. Irving Hall has been engaged and Jacob Schaefer, William Sexton, Maurice Daly and Joseph Dion nave now deposited $250 each as entrance money. It is well nigh assured that Gamier, now in Europe, will enter. George Slosson, of Chi cago, will not come to New York to play. The fourteen inch balk line game will be played. THE NEW 

ORLEANS EXPOSITION. President Arthur To Open It By Elec tricity. Washington, Dec. 10. Commissioner General Morshead of the New Orleans world's exposition has extended to both houses of Congress an invitation to participate in the opening ceremonies of the exposition on the 16th inst. Appropriate resolutions on tne subject will be introduced to-morrow. A delegation composed of Senators Hampton and Lamar, and Representatives Money, El lis, Van Eaton and others accompanied Gen eral Morehead to the executive mansion where a conference was had with the Presi dent with a Tiew pf havipg him open the ex position by electricity from Washington on the 16th inst. The plan is to have appror priate cominittaes representing both bouses of Congress and. the foreign legations assem ble at the ejcecmtive mansion at a given bum, when, by means of proper electrical connec tions with the motive power of the exposi tion, the President may fonnally open it, fif teen hundred miles away. The idea ib en dorsed by every one interested in the exposi tion. President Arthur promised the com mittee that he would give them an answer to morrow.

The Harvard Student's Slayer. Portland, Me., Dec. 10. In the Kelley murder trial to-day the prisoner testified that he said to the men, "Yon men get out of this fort, you know you're here against orders," advanced towards the intruders, again ordered them to leave and said, "You eave;" picked hp a brick, a pistol was dis charged, his hand was blackened by the powd Smith said, "Hold on," the words were nut finished when the pistol was dis charged.

Kelley then went to the Halsey House where omitn was and stated to the people that the shooting was accidental: saw no traces of blood until Smith had left the fort. Smith walked quick and strong.

On motion of Mr. Miller, of California, the Committee on Foreign Relations, which has under consideration the Spanish treaty, was authorized to sit during the sessions of the Senate. Mr. Slater, by unanimous consent, called up the bill forfeiting the lands granted for the construction of the Oregon Central rail road of Portland. Mr. Plumb sought to en graft upon the bill a section repealing the act of March 3, 1875, authorizing actual settlers on railroad lands subsequently forfeited to locate an amount equal to their original en try elsewhere. The effect of this act, passed assumedly in the interest of soldiers, he said had been to withdraw hundreds of thousands of acres of land and to put them in the hands of speculators and the certificates thus issued were now selling in Washington at $18 an acre. Mr. Conger opposed the introduction of this important measure into a private bill. The hour of 2 o'clock having arrived the Senate resumed consideration of the bill ad mitting southern Dakota into the Union, Mr. Vest having the floor. Mr. Vest said the intimation that partisan motives influenced himself or any of his col leagues in opposing this bill was not sus tained by the history of the measure, which had been before the Senate for thir teen years. For twenty-four the. terri tories of the United States had been under the tutelage of the Republicans. The federal patronage and the prestige of success of the dominant party had influenced the political complexion of the territories. Now when for the first time in twenty-live years the country had declared in favor of the party to which he belonged he would be false to his . principles if he did not insist that for a few years Demo cratic influences should have their effect o,n this territory before its admission into the Union. It was absolute disfran chisement to the other States when a State with two senators and at least one repre sentative on the floor of the House was ad mitted without the ratifying ratio of popula tion. With thirty-eight sovereign States in the Union what was the exigency which called fer the dividing of a territory across which there was no natural dividing line and which God had made j homogeneous? There were States larger than this territory. The same grasping, ambitious politicians who passed this or a similar measure through the Senate in 1876 were behind this bill to-day. General Grant was credited with the remark when the Secre tary of Dakota was killed by a rival politic ian that Dakota gave him more trouble than all the other territories put to gether. Texas was admitted with terri tory enough to make five States. The man could not live in Texas to-day who would advocate the division of that State. Colorado, admitted in 1876 with similar soil and climate to Dakota, remained stationary in population with only one member in the lower house. Nevada had retrogaded in pop ulation. Where was the indication that Da kota would not do the same ! At 3:25 p. m. the Senate went into execu tive session, and at 4:35 adjourned. In executive session further consideration of the nomination of Hon. Hugh McCulloch as Secretary of the Treasury was postponed until Tuesday next. The nomination of Bar ton Parke to be Indian agent at Fort Peake was confirmed. Senator Riddleberger made quite a speech in opposition to Mr. McCulloch's confirmation. House. A letter was read from A. M. Scales, Governor-elect of North Carolina, an nouncing his resignation as a representative from that State. Mr. Keifer, of Ohio, called up the military accademy appropriation bill and made a brief explanation, after which the bill was read by paragraphs for amendment, and one offered by Mr. Keifer, limiting promotion to second lieutenantcies to graduates from the academy and establishes"- men of the army, was adopted. The bill was couclnaed m committee and reported to the ilouse where a ye ana . nay vote was orred on Mr. Keifer's amendment limiti-ncr appointments, and it was disagreed to- veao 80, nays 150. The bill was theM passed. Mr. Morrison, of Illinois, from the Com mittee on Ways and Means, reported the us ual resolution referring the several portions of the President's message to appropriate committees and it was adopted. Mi. Vox, of JNew xorK, from tne JNaval committee, reported a resolution inquiring of the President by what authority of law cer tain commodores in the navy were made rear admirals; adopted. Mr. Morrison, of Illinois, introduced a con current resolution for a holiday recess from December 24 to January 5; referred to the Ways and Means committee. The mter-btate commerce bill came up as the unfinished business. Mr. Reagan in re ply to an inquiry said he hoped to reach a" vote on the bill to-morrow. Mr. Turner, of New York, supported the Reagan substitute bill and opposed the ap pointment of a commission as creating use less offices. Mr. Budd, of California, gave a qualified support to the Reagan substitute, dissenting from some of its provisions. Mr. Stewart, ot Vermont, addressed tne House" in support of the committee's bill. The speaker laid beiore tne tiouse a rormai mvi tation to participate in the opening ceremo nies of the New Orleans exposition on the 16th inst.; laid on the table for future action.

GONE DOWN IN THE WHIRL. A Private Hanking; Ilouse At Syracuse does Under. -. Syracuse, N. Y., Dec. 10. The private banking house of Wilkinson & Co. assigned to-day. Rumors affecting the stability of the firm have been in circulation for some days and have had the effect to prepare the com munity for the announcement. Notwith standing tms tne closing of their doors cre ated a deep feeling of anxiety which was con tinued by the inability to ascertain the exact state of the firm's affairs. The preferences are over $98,000, of which the city of Syra cuse is credited with $21,228.63, Onandaga county $45,520.79, the American Co-opera- tiue Relief association $5,176.28, the New York State asylum for idiots and the custo dian asylum at Newark $12,704.94, the Syra cuse water company $9,952.26. The amount on deposit belonging to the city is covered by the preferences, as is also the amount due the county of Onondoga. The preferences cover all amounts due charitable institutions and all trusts. The liabilities of the firm will ag gregate from $400,000 to $500,000. This in eludes $345,000 which is due to depositors, of which amount $297,000 is on individual de posits. The assets, which consist mainly of discounted paper, amount to $74,023.80, of which $20,000 is considered worthless. It is probable that the total assets will not aggre gate over $140,000. If this be the case the depositors will stand a slim show of getting their money. Among the number of Syracuse turns interested are loos, KaufE man & Co., Stearns & Co., Hawkins & Good rich,M. Briton & Co. and Andtews Brothers. None of these deposits exceed $8,000. The embarrassment of the Wilkinsons dates back about a year and a half when bad in vestments began to trouble them. This weakness has continued and was intensified by the depression in the iron trade and the failure of iron mills some weeks "ago. The losses m stock are said to have been $60,000 and the liability on account of iron mills is o,000.
