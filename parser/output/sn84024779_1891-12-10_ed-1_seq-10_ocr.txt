Tile Columbia Daily Calendar. An old friend in a new dress, and .in article that'has come to ba one of the indespensibles of an editor's desk, comes to hand in the Columbia Daily Calendar for 18v2. The calendar is in the form of a pad containing 367 leaves, each 5$x2g inches one for each day of the year, to be removed daily, and one for the entire year. The day of the week, of the month, and of the year are given, and each slip bears a short paragraph pertain ing to cycling or some kindred sub ject. At the botton of each leaf is a blank for memoranda, every leaf being accessible at any time. The stand is an entirely new departure, being made of sheet metal finished in ivory black, and is very compact. At the close of the year the stand will be available for another pad. This is the seventh issue of this now well-known calendar, yet all the matter is fresh and new, having been carefully collated from leading publi cations and prominent writers, most of it being specially written for this purpose. It comprises notable events in cycling, opinions of physicians and clergymen, hints about road making, and numerous other topics. That Indemnity Land Matter. North Dakota's representatives at Washington are pushing the matter of the Great Northern's claims to odd sections within the indemnity, affect ing a good many farmers in this county, and will undoubtedly close the matter up before it is allowed to rest. In speaking of the matter the Grand Forks Herald, observes: The Herald suggests the propriety of the parties in interest and our citi zens generally in some way expressing their appreciations of the efforts of Senator Casey and Mr. Johnson in this direction. Such formal expres sion would doubtless be of material assistance to the delegation. As inti mated yesterday, the Herald does not apprehend that the eviction notices now being served by the railway company have any other design than to induce the farmers to interest themselves in seconding the efforts of the congressional delegation in effect ing a speedy quieting of the com pany's claim. There seems to be no occasion for denouncing either the government or the railway company.

WASHINGTON LETTER. To the Kdilor of The Wahpeton Times. WASHINGTON, Dec. 4,1891. The very spirited contest for the Speakership of the House of Repre sentatives will close with the selec tion of one of the condidates by the democratic caucus which will be held to-morrow, but it will be years before it is forgotten. There have been many things to cause it to he remember ed, not the least of which is the large number of candidates that will re main in the field up to the last—this is of itself highly creditable to the democratic party as an organization, as it shows that it is a party that does not tolerate bossism, but gives every man in its ranks an equal right to aspire to any honor within its gift. Another thing about it that will not soon be forgotten is the action of the republicans in trying by misrepre senting innocent remarks made by democrats, and in many instances by the outright manufacture of state ments to create a feeling of anta gonism between the friends of the several candidates—they succeeded but too well, in some instances. Whoever is selected for Speaker, the attempt will be made in certain quarters to make it appear that the selection makes certain the nomina tion for president next year of some one of the gentlemen who have been prominently named for that honor. That is another republican scheme. There is not the slightest thing to base such a conclusion upon, no matter which of the candidates for speaker may win. There are, to your correspondent's certain knowl edge, men in the ranks of the sup. porters of each of the candidates who favor Mr. Cleveland, Governor Hill, Governor Gray, Senator Gorman and Governor Boies, so you see what nonsense it is to say that the success of any one of the candidates for speaker will have any direct effect upon the nomination for president next year. Just as members of con gress have differed in their opinions of the best men for speaker, so will they differ when it comes to select ing a candidate for president. The National democratic convention, and not the House of Representatives, will name the presidential nominee of the party, republican busybodies to the contrary notwithstanding Representative Cooper, of Indiana, who originated the Raum investiga tion in the last Congress, says that if Mr. Harrison persists in keeping Raum at the head of the Pension of fice he will move tor another investi galion. Mr. Cooper has secured large addition to the stock of ammuni tion which the packed committee of the last^ Congress refused to allow him to use, and if Rauin does not vacate the Pension office he will see to it that the next investigation does not end with a coat of whitewash. It is stated here, but denied, that Secretary Foster's health is in a precarious condition. While deny ing that he is seriously sick, his friends admit that he is going South for several weeks' rest before he again takes up his work as Secretary of the Treasury. Mr. Harrison's friends in the re publican party have been anxiously expecting this week that often an nounced statement from Mr. Blaine that he would not be the candidate of his party, it having been stated here the other day by ex-Senator Saunders of Nebraska, whose daughter Russell Harrison's wife, that Mr. Blaine would shortly take the public into his confidence but alas, for the Harrison crowd, it seems to be only another false alarm, as Mr. Blaine says not a word, but continues to smile when visiting republicans tell him that they propose nominating him next year. is Attorney General Miller is not an admirer of the newspapers, probably because they have refused to class him as high as his own conciet tells him he should go therefore it catjsed no surprise when he tried to cast a slur upon the press, while the argu ment in the cases against the consti tutionality of the McKinley tariff law was proceeding before the Supreme Court. It came about this way. Mr. Stephen G. Clark, of New York, while arguing that the omission of the tobacco rebate clause in the bill as signed by the President invalidated the whole bill, produced a book kept in the Clerk's office showing the record of bills passed by the House, to show that the clause was omitted. In reply to the Attorney General's question, Mr. Clark said he was not advised as to whether there was any law for the keeping of the book. "If there is no such law", said the At torney General with a sneer, "the book has no more weight than a news paper publication." Commissioner Roosevelt is back. He declines to discuss the story that Mr. iVanamaker is after his scalp, further than to fay that he stands by everything he lias em said, which is equivalent to repeating his charge against the truthfulness of Mr. W. -m fflfftostCash trU* *1 Paid for oats, barley and rwr.

Some weeks ago Ed Moore pulled out of the Dickey County Leader and united with The Commonwealth force at Fargo, of which he is helping to make a superb paper, however dropped this observation with re ference to The Leader. The Dickey County Leader, formerly demo cratic, a week or two since announced that it could see no good reason for the existence of a democratic paper in that county, so it flopped. Then the board of county com missioners was republican. Since election day the board is said to be democratic, and the Leader may live long enough to And out that there is more room for a democratic paper there than fora third republican paper. —Fargo Commonwealth. Perhaps there is, Ed, but it takes a democrat to successfully run a demo cratic paper. A republican cannot do the job successfully unless there is plenty of financial inducement, in which case most any newspaper man can adjust his politics to fit the ap parent demand. There appears to be no demand in this county for either a democratic or a republican paper on account of politics alone, and as both the editors of the Leader are re publicans it is but natural that the politics of the paper should favor tliat party. The* change was not made because we either hoped or ex pected to secure any more or less of the county patronage by so doing. Very little of its patronage during the five years of its existence as a democratic paper came from a politi cal soure, and we do not expect any greater proportion from this source while we continue to fly the republi can flag. You also remember that the Leader is not the third, but the first, republican paper in Dickey County.—Dickey County Leader. It is not every day that one finds a man fig lit as hard for his political principles as does Ed Moore. And when the Democrats find a newspaper always on deck and to be depended upon and from definite business principles, having builded a prestige from which it may wield a little in fluence, it is well to take care of such paper. However, in The Leader con stituency it would now seem that a definite policy is hardly to be re warded. Perhaps that's why Ed pulled out.
