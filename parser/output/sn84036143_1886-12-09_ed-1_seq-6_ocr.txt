In fir: uncial Dial :ters,to w n - 3 muen -pa e i- allotted in an evident appeal to influence the laboring man, we cannot regard the President'- views a- *. qually sound and commendable. How can we be tr aided bv a surplus of revenues long as we -uill have a national lebt of ver one billion of dollars ? Why not apply the surplus to the payment ofthat debt ? Why not advocate a new national loan at two per cent, and buy :u all the • .itstaniing bonds at market ra:-:-. It w aid be economy and settle ourùnanct i >r a generation to come. Then we coaid proceed to reduce our duties, se lecting first those on raw products, to which we could add value by skilled Lbor. Mr. Cleveland does not -eem tu r cognize the fact that moderate reduc tions ot duties, always re-ult in in crease'! revenues owing to larger im portations. He cite- the great increase of private fortunes as an evidence that our manufacturers are accumulating wealth unduly by protection. The facts do not bear him out. We doubt if the average profit of . anufacturer- i- equal to that of other classes and investments. < >ur iarge fortunes are the product of railroad peration-, --f stock specula tions and ot our unwi-e paten: laws more than ail other cause- combined. It bu^ never been shown and never an be shown that our manufacturer; can pay the \ revailing wages and vet c< n tinue work in a tree competition with the products oi cheaper labor u the continent. Manufacturers -til need protection in this country to live, and we need nwre instead of ie^s of them. We need the increa-eof manufactures to -apply work to our laboring men and extended h >me markets to our lur.iers. We have not yet reached the -tage of development when we can be lenentted by any great increase of foreign m meree. That commerce is m w mostly carried on under foreign flags, ani the piroùt- of such commerce now go into foreign pockets and treasurie-.

OPENING OF CONGRESS. Notwithstanding the general desire to , , nave Longress adjourn, there is aivays. mace or 1rs- hopeiul looting to its re assembling. The last -essiott held eight month.; the present one will expire br limitation in less than three, and out of that mus: come the holiday vacation. There is plenty to be done of the ut most importance besides p 2 -sinÿ the ap propriation bills, ifome anal disposi tion -hould be made of the bills to for feit the unearned land grants. What ever Congress may do these cases will probably have to go to the courts for final settlement. Nearly all the roads are now complete that are making any strong claim to land grants, and the residue ought to be declared forfeited at once. Another matter should receive attention, and that is to provide at once for the -urvev of ail lands granted, so that thev mav be-ubjected to taxation. v - bâve *reat interest to see what We have great interest to see what will be done in the matter of repealing or changing the land laws. The public lands that remain are mostly in the Ter ritories that have no votes and very lit I tle representation and influence in Con gres-. Great injustice is liable tobe done to the -ettlers by general ignorance of the character of the lands remaining. The homestead law is poorly calculated to promote settlement. The pre-emption and desert land laws are more needed now than they ever were before. « dve us a law to stop any further ac quisition lands by Mormon- or other aliens.

Omitting from the Executive paper only such parts as appeared in substance to be covered by the several departmental re ports outlined in the press dispatches before or at the time received and printed, the document in all its essential completeness was givea by the Heuald to its Capital readers between the hours of 4 and 5 o'clock Monday afternoon. So considerable an undertaking within the time stated has not before been accomplished in Montana, and any attempt at the consum mation of a task so considerable would yesterday Lave proved futile but for the prompt v.o-operation and assistance of the Western Union Telegraph Company.

Sugar is an article of general consump tion. We have protected it for years to encourage home production bnt there was not so much sugar produced in this coun try in 1554 as in 1544 into 30.000 hogs heads. After such a trial of protection we think the strongest advocates must concede that it is a failure. As soon as possible to execute treaties of re ciprocity by which we could get some free trade in return, we ought to consider the matter of admitting sugar free of duty, and to save the Louisiana pro ducers we should pay them a bounty. We do not believe in giving foreign producers, as in the case of the coffee crowers of Brazil, the chance to raise the price of sugar and obtain the lion s share of the benefit. We can and therefore ought to get soma solid and compensating commercial advantages for tie reduction or removal of this sugar duty. If it reduces our revenues too much let us re-impose some duty on tea and coffee. The cholera has reafined South Ameri ca. and the prospect is that it will reap a harvest.

The Secretary of the Treasury devotes 1 more than one half of his report to the . .... . , , ' 1:äC ' ;äs,oa « •*>' aüver ',u«U<*, and the I »' *» «W? *ully * e a ' rocates e imm täte an rtoppage tj fort er coinage ot^.u i . adants the effect of stopping purchase and coinage would be a great fall in the price of silver. It would close everv ....... * silver mill and mine in the coun„ry. But the Secretary thinks, and -o do a great manv friends of a bimetalic cur rencv that this is the onlv course to .ency, tnat inis is toe imy course bring Great Britain to terms. The whole argument of the Secretary i.n^i ,i 1p .-nc-V --indard . ' theoi 7> bnt on :he necessity of inter national agreement on woie common standard of values. He apparently , , ,, . , . « r argues on the conceded jasts that bi metalisin is necessary, and that the only cuestion is one of the best means to reach that des'red end tuai ues.reu enu. It -trikes us this way: li the reason ■ ing is good that the ^secretary adopts, that the increasing volume of trade and ." ,, , , wealth require the use of both metal for money, we are on the right track already and do not need to stop or turn. The nations that are antagonizing the natural laws of trade will, ere long, be forced to accept and follow our lead, The relative value of the metals may or great and the cost of recoinage could be met out of the difference al ea-i readv accumulate'! in the treasury be tween the purchase and coin value of silver. It seems to us that it is neither right or wise for our government to tage a -tep that will confessedly close our mines and mills for a time and still fur ther reduce the value of silver for the sake of hastening England to a conclu sion in the matter. It is a mere matter of spieculation whether the trouble would come to a head in a single vear. better consider how and when he can get out, unless suicide i- hi- purpose. It Looks as if Europe were on the verge of a general war. France and Germany do not and cannot be made to agree on any common course of action on finance or anything else. England even is likelv to have other more serious questions to engage all her attention during the year. We agree with the Secretary that it is not our part to ask of England another conference, but we do think that we should at once set about making a union of all nations on thi- continent and After such a union is made we could -et a time, five or ten years hence, when all concurring powers would begin free coinage of silver. This would bring about the same re sults without disturbance and leave us master of the situation. We apprehend that the chief opposition to national legislation for the extinction of cattle disease will come from those who ' are jealous of State rights and oppose the concentration of power in the general gov ernment la the measure to be submitted to Congress from the National Cattle Growers Association, it is provided that the national authorities shall in all cases act in conjunction with the State authori ties and shall have power to schedule any State ref as ing and prohibit the exportation of cattle therefrom. This bug-bear of States rights erects its front on all occasions and refuses to recognize the fact of national unity and the greater fact that this national unity is more the result of modern <ivili..ation and the facilities of travel and transportation, than of interpretations of our constitution. . „ .

He , .... , may not ce slight. y changed irom our standard, but the variance cannot be Before a man jump- into a well he had push the matter where the way is open. lives. I: is evident enough that such a pest as this cattle disease can be kept in the country forever by the obstinacy of a single State, though all others were united in measures and efforts lor its extinction. The same principle applies in this case as in matter of health. If one State should neglect or refuse to protect against the spread ot contageo is diseases, the citizens of all other States would be exposed on transit and all the efforts of others ren dered unavailing. Oar State lines will not bar the spread of cattle disease any more than cholera. Isolation is impossible, Even the power to schedule a resisting State will not eff'ectuallv provide against . ' , * , - the danger. As a nation among whom m creasicz movement of the individual mem bers is going on. common interest and ne cessity requires concerted action to be of any avail. This is one of the matters that of necessity is national and let it so be treated in applying the remedy, —— " If in connection with the establishment of several steamship lines with South America, we would move at once to establish an American monetary union with free coinage of silver on a common basis at our present rates of va! ues. we could soon command all the commerce of South America, and that would give us the opportunity to shape and control the poEti cal destinies of those countries as well. The British colonies ox Australia, Tasma D iaand New Zealand would unite with us. India, China, and Japan would give us their commerce. We should soon either force England to adopt our monetary standard or submit to the loss of her chief he , own IN
