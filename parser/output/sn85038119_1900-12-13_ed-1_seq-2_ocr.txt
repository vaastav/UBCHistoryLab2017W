Nearly every important measure that has been selected for pas sage at this session, including the army reorganization, steamship subsidy, Nic aragua canal. Pacific cable, rivers aud harbors, public buildings and amend ments of the war tax bills, has beeu con sidered in committee. President McKinlcy's annual message to Congress was presented immediately upon the assembling of Congress at noou. It had been planned to withhold the mes sage until Tuesday, so that both houses might adjourn immediately after assem bling on Monday as a mark of respect for the late Senators Davis and Gear, but this plan wns altered after a confer ence between the President and Senator Frye. The message was presented in the usual manner and received by Senator Frye, as president pro tern, of the Sen ate, and Speaker Henderson. It was read in both houses.

U. for the abolition of the canteen. The bill provides for a fighting force of J)l5,2S0 men. The fact that botli Representa tives Grosvenor and Dick of Ohio, who are generally credited with being the mouthpieces of the administration on the floor, madespceches indorsing the Little field amendment prohibiting the sale of liquors on military reservations and at military" posts was accepted by a major ity of the Republicans of the House as a direct intimation that the President wanted the canteen abolished, and conse quently they voted almost solidly for the amendment.

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. President McKinlcy's nieosage was read at the opening session of Congress shortly after noon Monday. The annual message to the Senate and House of Bcp reseutatives is a lengthy and carefully prepared document in which the various questions of greatest interest are clearly and ably discussed and appropriate rec ommendations made as to needed legisla tion. It is introduced with some felici tations and congratulatory remarks as to the growing strength and increasing pow er for gooil of republican institutions and the larger freedom and more extended citizenship they now confer. This topic naturally is extended to include a brief statement of the great growth the coun try has made in population the past de cade as shown by the census and this congratulatory review is closed by ac knowledgment of divine care and guid ance of the nation. The Chinese Troubles. By far the most carefully elaborated part of the message deals with the Chi nese problem, which is also given the preference by priority of discussion. The entire situation is reviewed from the be ginning of the Boxer troubles to their cul mination last summer in the siege of the legations in Pekin. The President's re view of the early outbreaks ami his en tire account are written iu a clear, dis passionate, judicial manner, which makes it a history of the events to date. In this connection the President recites the dip lomatic success of this country in secur ing the assent of the powers to its cir cular proposals of 1S00, which were aim ed not only to safeguard this country's trade interests, but also to quiet Chinese apprehensions, making known the friend ly intentions of the powers as respect the integrity of the Chinese empire. Unfortunately before this was fully ac complished the Boxer insurrection be came formidable, resulting in the siege of the legations aud subsequent events, which are clearly related. The siege and relief of the legations, the President says, have "passed into undying history," As to the part American soldiers took in that relief he pays a deserved tribute to their valor and heroism. The entire loss of the defenders during the siege was sixty-five killed, 135 wounded and seven by dis ease, the latter being nil children. The American troops employed in China amounted to some 5,000, at first under the command of the late Col. Lisctim and" now under that of Gen. Chaffee. The President, while apparently convinced that the attacks upon the legations were made by imperial troops, does justice to the efforts of the southern viceroys and their energy and co-operation in rescuing hundreds of foreigners from peril. America's attitude has been unvaried and was first broadly defined by a circu lar to the powers of July 3 last, this country's policy as then defined being "to seek a solution which may bring nbout permanent safety and peace to China, preserve Chinese territorial and adminis trative entity, protect all rights guaran teed to friendly powers by trcnty and in ternational law and safeguard for the world the principle of equal and impjrtial trade with all parts of the Chinese em pire." Of course, in addition to this broad and generous view of the rights and in terests of all nations, there has since been added the question of reparation for injuries received the past slimmer and the indemnity for the expenses necessar ily incurred in connection with the relief of the legations. On this point the Pres ident says: "We forego no jot of our undoubted right to exact exemplary and deterrent punishment of the responsible authors of the criminal acts whereby we and other nations have suffered grievous injury." While the hope is expressed that a com plete settlement of all the questions involved-may he reached, it is admitted that the question of indemnity is one of "grave concern," as, measured in money alone, a sufficient recompense may be beyond the power of China to pay. The President is disposed to think, however, that due compensation may be made by increased guaranties for foreign rights and immunities and "by the opening of China to the equal commerce of all the world." Following the China Question and situ ation Uiere are brief statements in respect to the relations of the United- States to other countries of the world, which, on the whole, are satisfactory. There seems to be some friction over the treatment of Americans in Austria in regard to mili tary service, but it is stated representa tions have been made whenever the course adopted has appeared unduly oner ous. Belgium's movement to secure agree ment respecting the liquor tratllc in Af rica is referred to aud the President adds: "I would gladly see its extension by international agreement to the restric tion of Uie liquor traffic with all unciv ilized peoples, especially in the western Pacific." Measures looking to the protection of American patents abroad and of Euro pean patents in America will be discussed nt a conference at Brussels on the 11th inst., to which conference this country

Important postal agreements have been entered into with several South American countries. Our trade relatione with Brazil are not whol ly satisfactory, but an improvement is expected. In regard to most of the other South American states there are but slight, if any, difficulties, and these seem to be in a fair way of adjustment. Considerable space is given to the pleasant relations between France nnd America, as shown by the unveiling of the Lafayette statue the past summer and especially by America's participation in the Paris exposition, which wns very gratifying to both countries. The United States had the largest foreign display and our exhibits were s-hown in 101 out of 121 classes, ranking in total number next after France, nnd receiving 2,470 nwards in nil, the greatest uuinlier given to any exhibiting nation. Our relations with Germany the past year were marked by the amicable settle ment of the Samoan dispute and also by tin! completion of the remaining link in the new lines of direct telegraphic com munication with Germany. On the other hand, the President refers to our "wcll uigh extinguished German trade in meat products," aud says there is still great uncertainty as to whether this trade can be revived under the present imperial meat inspection laws. Friendly with Britain. With Great Britain our relations re main on most friendly footing, the oidy dispute of importance the past year'being that in regard to neutral rights in ship ping to Portuguese South Africa, in con sequence of the Boer war. England by agreeing to pay for said consignments settled the difficulty, though leaving the broader question of neutral rights as yet unsettled. As to the joint survey at Lynn canal of the temporary boundary between Alaska and Canada the President regards it as merely "an unsatisfactory make shift, which should not be suffered to de lay the speedy and complete establish ment of the former line to which we are entitled under the Busso-Amcrican treaty for the cession of Alaska." As to Italy, that country's demands in regard to the lynching of five Itnlians in Tallalah are pronounced just and Con gress is asked for appropriate legislation in this connection. There is a protest against lynching, the President repeating the language of his inaugural address upon this subject and inviting the attention of his country men to "this reproach npon our civiliza tion." Japan's influence in the East is dwelt upon at length and most favorably, and the ways in which she has aided and co operated with the western powers are set forth in full, the President making his remarks upon this snbjcct preliminary to comment of discriminating enforce ment of a bubonic quarantine last sum mer on the Pacific coast as against the Japanese. The Hague peace convention and the appointment of America's members of the council of administration are the sub ject of an interesting paragraph, as is also the statement of the situation as re spects the proposed Nicaragua canal and the convention between this country and Great Britain as to the Clayton-Bulwer treaty, to which the President calls the early attention of Congress. Satisfactory progress has been made toward concluding a new treaty with Spain and thy circumstances leading to the additional' purchase of a few small islands not included in the Paris treaty are narrated at length. In respect to Turkey the message says: "Our claims upon the government of the sultan for reparation -for injuries suffered by American citizens in Armenia and elsewhere give promise of early and sat isfactory settlement." The coining exposition nt Buffalo as well as the Pan-Americnn congress to be held in the City of Mexico are given prominent treatment. The President makes statements in the message as to the great expansion of our foreign trade, the gratifying surplus of revenues anil the increase in our manu factures; but these are matters of figures to be read and digested in the message itself. The Philippines and Cuba. As to the Philippines there is bnt little of interest that the President has to say beyond that already given iu his instruc tions to the civil commission, which are included iu full in the message. An elaborate statement is made in re spect to the army and navy and the rea sons for the increase required in the for mer are given. Tn 'Cuba, also, matters are, he says, sat isfactory. The constitutional convention is in session nnd further -recommendations will 1k made to Congress at the close of the deliberations of the conven tion and the inauguration of the new gov ernment on the island. The other matters treated of public lands nnd forests, increase in pensions, work of the twelfth census, etc. are mere administrative recommendations and the message closes with mention of "John Marshall day" and a recommenda tion for conservatism and economy in the management of public affairs.

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. President McKinlcy's message, of course, gives the people what they voted for. But nobody reading It would imagine that It was the expres sion of the head or a democratic gov ernment. There is not one line In It. for Instance, expressive of dissatisfac tion with the condition of the masses of the people. The man of a thousand years hence reading It would suppose that everybody here was happy, and that the President had only to suggest a few little things to make our social condition complete. The first tiling mentioned in the message Is prosperity. The last word of the message Is peace. Mr. McKin ley asks for 100,000 soldiers. He says that 00,000 men must Ihj kept iu the Philippines for an Indefinite period. He tells us that last year we were taxed seventy-nine millions in excess of Government expenditures. He rec ommends that taxes be now reduced thirty millions, indicating his purpose to speml forty-nine millions more than last year, or at least to have the money handy. lie devotes a passage to warning us solemnly against national extrava gance. He demands the passage of the ship subsidy bill, which will pay as a bonus to one steamship company alone that owned by the Standard Oil Trust more than two millions annually of Government money. lie has negotiated a treaty giving Spain an extra hundred thousand dollars for small islands that we forgot to take lefor. Mr. McKinley asks for further legis lationIf any can be devised to put us more thoroughly on a gold basis. He says not one word to contradict Hanna's statement: "There are no trusts." In a feeble, perfunctory way, like a bad boy saying his prayers, he remarks that "combinations, if injuri ous," might be "restrained." The Filipinos are to be made good Americans almost as good as we are. The savage tribes are to be treated by Mr. McKinley benevolently and In pa ternal fashion, as we have treated our Indians. Mr. McKinley asks for a cable to Manila via Hawaii. But he says no word of Government owner ship of that cable. He praises the work of the postotlice, but says noth ing nbout a parcels post system, which would delight the people, and help every business man. He says nothing of a system of postal savings banks, whichwould give security to the depos its of the poor, give to the masses of the people the money now paid to a few Government bond owners and In terfere with the plans of a few bank ers. It Is not a bad message. It provides for the views and needs of the well-to-do. You are living under a govern ment, not exactly a republic, since Its main concern is the welfare of the few. It Is a sort of cross between a monarchy and a financial oligarchy. It Is Just as much a republic as Eng land is an autocracy England Is not an autocracy. But you voted for this sort of government, fellow cltizsns. Chicago American. A Dangerous Innovation. In the eighth section of the first arti cle of the Constitution it is provided that Congress shall have power to raise nnd support armies, but no appropria tion of money to that use shall be for & longer term than two years. It Is jvident that the Intent of the framers Df the Constitution was to put a curb n militarism by clothing Cqngress with authority to establish the army and by imposing1 a limit upon Congress Itself In making appropriations for troops. The proposition to transfer these powers to the President Is a most dangerous Innovation. It constitutes not only a departure from the spirit of :he Constitution, but It Is positively un republican. Philadelphia Ledger. Menace to the Republic. Mr. McKlnley's phrase that "the re public is safe"- cannot efface the fact that conditions are looming up in this oonntry that resemble those which sig nalized the interregnum of Rome's transmission from a republic to the do minion of the Caesars. This menace wiU grow. The elements In control of Mr. McKinIey"s party, in the fatuons belief that their late success at the polls means an indorsement of their "dangerous policies, seem bent on posh ing these policies to the point where free government, except in name, will be extinguished. Kansas City Times. Kven the Bepnbl'cans Gas. If the Industry can flourish without a subsidy and we believe It can there is obviously no more reason for Con gress subsidizing ships than for subsi dizing locomotive or bridge works. The arguments formerly employed in favor of the shipping subsidy bill are ren dered obsolete by present conditions. Owners of obsolete ships, tilled with obsolete machinery, may need a sub sidy to let them out whole, but the en terprising builders of new and modern craft can get along very well without It. Minneapolis Tribune (Bep.). Cost of Red Tope. Some months ago a government pen sioner died In Ireland. His widow sent In a bill for funeral expenses amount ing to $S2.t!7. The Government auditor found some flaw in the bill, declined to "O. K." It and ordered an examination. The red tape and incidental expenses of the investigation cost something like $2,000, but the widow's bill has finally been thrown out. The government Is out more than $1,900 in the matter, but, then, there must be something to keep the clerks busy. Savannah News. Can Eest Be Bone Now. A trust asking for tariff protection and then forcing up the price of Its products on the people of this country, whose government gave the protection, is an object that is very offensive to those who are thus oppressed. When the people see how tills state of affairs can be ended it will lie done, and Mr. Hewitt is wise beyond his fellow mil lionaires In seelug that it can best be done if the scales fall from the eyes of the rich before another French revolu tion is provoked. LTtlca Observer. Unpleasantness in HairalL With even Hawaii "going back" on him "and her native voters sending as delegate to Congress a man counted as one of the stanchest adherents of the Liluokalanl regime, the excellent Mr. McKinley must begin to feel that his election day doll is "stuffed with saw dust." Obviously, dangerous Ideas of local self-government aud indepen dence are coining ground in what were ic known u tht Sandwich laluda, Tossibly the Filipino Junta has been employing agents In Hawaii. And to think how easily trouble might have been avoided had a system of restrict ed suffrage been established there! Boston Globe. Th- President' Opportunity. Senator Hale of Maine, with the ex perience of years to guide him, utters a prompt cry of warning to UIs party to "go slow" in the use of power con ferred on It In the recent elections. There Is one man, and one man only, who can really stem the tide of which Senator Hale is tn fear. That is the President. His pen is his sexptcr and If he dares to use it in veto of reckless-" expenditure Its sway will be. absolute. We do not venture to assume that he will do so. There will come an early test of the power of the conservative Bepublicans to restrain the greed of those who will assail the public treas ury. It Is the ship subsidy bill. If that can be blocked there will be some hope of moderation for the next ses sion. New York Times. The President's Impulse. The President's first Impulses are possibly of the best. They were In the matter of Porto Bico tariff legislation to which we have alluded. But noble and generous Impulses are of small value unless they are accompanied by a resolute tenacity of purpose. When the firm tread of Mr. Hanna Is heard outside the President's door noble im pulses take flight to give place to Mr Hanna's notions of what party exi gencies require. Rochester Herald. Haa a Bijt Job on Han I. The fact of the matter is that the administration realizes that a difficult task is ahead of It in the Philippines, for which more soldiers will lie needed than it dares avow. If, then, some scheme can be railroaded through Con gress which will permit of a great ar my obtained under falsojiretcnses all will be well. This is IngeBhjOibut scarcely practicable. The American people cannot be fooled all the time. Boston Traveler. A Preposterous Attempt.

Bisr Outlays in Prospect. Senator Burrows, of Michigan, names as the three prominent measures to be acted on by Congress the army bill, the ship subsidy bill and tl; Nicaragua Canal bill.
