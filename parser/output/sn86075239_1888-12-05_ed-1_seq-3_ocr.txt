THE MESSAGE. PRESIDENT CLEVELAND REAFFIRMS HIS TARIFF POLICY. Rivalry for the Speakership of the Next Congress - Snurrilous Attaeks on President Cleve land. WAssHIINoGox, Dec. 4. -The president's message is largely devoted to the ques tion of tariff reform. He reaffirms his fi delity to that policy and makes a strong final appeal for the free admission of raw material. He says there can be no compromise in a cause which is the peo ple's. He says the public land should not be given to monopolies nor allowed to fall into the hands of foreign non-resi dents. He refers to the pension laws and recommends that they be revised in the Interest of meritorious claimants. The president also refers to the finan cial condition of the country, the growth of the postal service and the army and navy. The Supposed Fiend. NEw Yonx, Dec. 4.-Dr. Twomblety, who was suspected of being connected in some way with the Whitechapel murders in London, arrived in this city yesterday from Harre. The police have him unider supervision. Australia Wants Wheat. OnucAGo, Dec. 4.-A flurry occurred on the board of trade today, on receipt of advice from SanFrancisco, saying inquiry was being made there for wheat for Aus tralia, on account of the almost total failure of the crop in the southern part of that country. Some weeks ago the com mercial papers reported damage to Aus tralian wheat, but this is the first intima tion of the decrease. -Throwing Mud. NEW Yoxa, Dec. 4.-A New York paper, which has been very cordial in its support of the president, has created a sensation by publishing in detail all of the vile stories that had been circulated about him during the last year or two stories that no republican paper has dis graced itself by printing, even in the heat of the campaign; That a journal which pretended to be friendly to the president should print the scandals after the elec tion was over seems inexplicable, and its conduct has been severely criticised. But now it appears that the article was in type for more than a week before it was published and .it is alleged was read in proof by Col. Lamont. Fire in Helena. 

HELENA, Dec. 4.-A fire has partly destroyed Jurgens & Price's 'store and warehouse, a shed and a dwelling house. The loss is about $10,000. The fire is supposed to have been incendiary. The fire alarm was defective. The Speakership. WAs1sNGSOsN, Dec. 4.-There are now in the field three open candidates for, speaker of the house, McKinley of Ohio, Cannon of Illinois and Reed of Maine. It is only within a day or two that Reed and McKinley have acknowledge dthem selves candidates. Now they are in the hands of their friends, which is equiva lent to an admission that they will make a fight. The friends of the other candi dates say that Reed is handicapped by the fact that he comes from the east. It was well enough, they say, to give him a complimentary caucus nomination when the republicans were in the minority, but they do not think the republican party can give the speakership to Maine under existing political conditions. The contest between these candidates promises to be a lively one. There are several dark horses in the field ready to join and make a race if the leaders are crowded off. Brighter Days in Florlda. JAcKSONVILLE, Dec. 4.-There were no eases today and but one death, that of Pilton Carken. The fumigation brigade, 75 strong, in ten divisions, started out this morning and by 6 o'clock p. m. 93 houses had been disinfected. The ques tion of allowing refugees to return will be debated by the city council to morrow, ,A Theatre lmbarnassed. 0q4 o,`Dec. 8-Thomas Baker, the proprietor ofBaker's-theatre, an elegant place of amusement opened a couple of weeks ago, has assigned, The liabilities are $8l0,000. The assets are the same. The failure is due to bills incurred in building the theatre. They were heavier than the Bakers could pay, and their friends whom they depended on for financial backing failed to come to time. The house will be kept open. WoOl in Steady Demand. Naw YoaRf, Dec. 4-Bradstreets says: A well sustained demand for wool is re ported from all the markets, with prices very firm. While many of the larger manufacturers bought enough materials several weeks ago to last them through the greater part of the coming season, others held off, and are now compelled to invest, Meanwhile, wool has risen sharply, while woolen fabrics show no corresponding advance, This, leaves smaller concerns in an embarrassed posi tion, The prevailing opinion is that spring goods are bound to sell higher, but the advance is established, and man ufacturers who take materials at present quotations have no great margie to work on. The mills as a rule are fully em Ployed, with dimsnleed stocks of wool to draw from hereafter, Cherltmen Springer Makes Some Remarks o 5hee Dakota Admisla n Bill. WastegncoyN, Dec, 8. -Chairman Springer said in reference to the bill to divide Dakota: "I see a demand is made in several quarters for the passage of the senate bill in the house. This can scarce ly be done as that bill provides for the ad missionilf sidth Dateta under that name se4d ivides the territory on a different line from that provided in the constitu tien adopted. If the senate bill should be enacted it would result in making it necessary to adopt a new constitution and a new state could not come in for some time. I hear that a new constitutional convention is to be held this year. if that is done it is barely possible that a remedy can be found in time." This is Springer's first admission that the division bill may pass the house at this session. Prospects of a Big Convention.

WALLA.C, Washington, HEAVY CATTLE CASE. RUSSELL B. HARRISON AND OTHER PEOPLE OF NOTE INTERESTED. The North ointana Cattle Case Noaw Refore tihe Coart HSrr Ex cites Some Atten tion. The Farmers Loan and Trust company sues to foreclose a mortgage given to it as trustee for bond holders of the North Montana Cattle company for alleged breaches of the terms of the mortgage. The bonds issued by the cattle company are $750,000 in amount and are held by the Farmers' Loan and Trust company of New York. The breaches alleged are failure to keep defendants herd up to 22,000 head as agreed and failure to pay interest on the bonds, and the sale of cat tle to diminish the number. The defend ants demurred to the complaint on the ground that the suit was prematurely brought, claiming that no suit to foreclose could be brought until 12 months after the interest was due and that no default was made until January, 1888. The court overruled this demurrer and the case went to trial yesterday. The plaintiff called two witneses and intro duced record evidence. The defendant moved for a non suit on the grounds that no breach was proved, the herd hav ing been reduced by severity of the win ters in 1886-8 and not by sale. The de fendants stand on the demurrer and mo tion for non-suit. The court has taken the case under advisement. Among the people interested in the North Montana Cattle company are Rus sell B. Harrison, son of the president elect; W. H. H. Miller, General Harrison's law partner; J. C.Johnson, lawyer, Wash ington; John S. Blain and J. K. McCan non. The two last named lawyers were formerly assistant attorney generals of the United States. The company was formed in June, 1886 and issued the bonds in question to take up the indebt edness of the Montana Cattle company to whose business it succeeded. Chums sero & McCutcheon and E. W. Toole are counsel for the Farmers' Loan and Trust company; Carpenter, Buck & Hunt for North Montana Cattle company. Judge Chumasero, Messrs. E. W. Toole, Hunt and Buck are all here. Judge Bach gave a decree today for the full amount of the mortgage, namely $750,000 and interest. A
