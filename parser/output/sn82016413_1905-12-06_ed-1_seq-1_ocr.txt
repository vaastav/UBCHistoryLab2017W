ADDED IMPETUS TO AMERICANISM NOBLES TO LEAD HON. P. C. JONES, President Rooecv eft's messago to ConsrcJd urging beneflU-for Hawaii, briefly oiitllnoil In the cnblo dispatches, it loilny the talk ot tho city. Hon. I'. C. Jonoj, expressing his opinion, had tho following to say to a Bulletin reporter this morning: "I lll.o the Idea of seventy-live per icnt of tho revenuo now derived from Hawaii by tho Federal goernment be ing expended hero for fortifications and other needol Improvements, but 1 was in hope that more would be done for us. I believe It is the President's bur' gcMon that this 75 per cent bo set nslde for a period of, say, twenty jcars. We ought to have fortlfkatlons here loug before twenty years. Ha waii oughtt o bo thoroughly fortlllcd long before that tlmo. Still, with the want news of tho message to hand, we taniiot Judge altogether what the Pres ident's Ideas aie In this respect. Per haps It is his idea to hasten tho fort ifications and hac the revenue devoted to other improvements for the rest of the period. "If wo are ready for war we ore more likely to have peace. "Kortllkatlons are needed Immed iately, not only for Hawaii's benefit, but for the benefit of the nation. Fort Ifkattons are a necessity. "Why, suppose wo wero Involved In war with Japan or China say. Where would wo be? Not that China Is in any condition to go to war, but twenty years Is a long time and China could do a great deal toward being prepared for war In that time and In the event ot trouble the wholo country, the Cali fornia coast and Alaska, would suffer. "The President's message should be a. great inducement to the better class o. labor. I don't object to tho Chlneso - I think he's as good as anybody else, bin. If we are going to Americanize Ha waii we can't do it with Chinese. SHU, pending Americanization, it would bo a great help to us to have a certain number of Chinese brought here for n limited period to work on tho planta tions. It would relieve the Riigar plant er. "I hopo vo will bo ablo to get those Portugueso immigrants. The Portu guese havo proved themselves good and faithful laborers. The second gen eration aro making good citizens. "I think Governor Carter should bo given great credit for tho manner In which he has brought to tho Presi dent's attention tho needs of Hawaii. "Hawaii Is doing well. This Is a sea son of good news for our Islands. We havo much to be thankful for." W. Pfotcnhouur, of II. Hockfcld i. CO, Klllll. "The President's recommendations should please Hawaii very much. It is but fair that this Territory should receive benefit from tho internal lev ..line and customs. It Is only right that Hawaii should get a portion of tu money taken In." Tho Ilov. W. D. Westcrvolt said: "The President's Idea, It carried out. will prove an Immense help to Hawaii. The whole country will be bonclltud. In Hawaii all will feel tho bencllt. "The Hawaiian Hoard of Missions will profit by tho money turned from the Federal treasury by the seventy Ave per cent ot rcvenuo allowed Ha waii for fortifications and Unproto ments. It will mean more monoy fot tho churches and schools. Tho Amen denization thoughts aro splendid. "I like this Idea ot bringing in the Russians from Los Angeles. I bavt heard much ot tho work tho Molokao t.ave done In California, making value less lauds ot value." Said A. P. Judd: "Tho fulfillment of the recommendations contained In tho President's message means an American commonwealth hero In tho broadest sense. All who havo the horn purpose all who are tied to Hawaii by the pafct and by the present nnd bj the future must read with great Joy the program mapped out." Senator McCandlcss said: "I am .well pleased that tho Presi dent Is taking such an Interest In Ha wall, but we deserve many things we have never bad. With the assistance of the President and Congress we will get all that Is planned, I hope. Now w must get Congress to believe as tin President does." fl MHPtb Wf&fS?mwLnmr. nt." nJr''"""1" r -rrjirai v-i-ji !..- rtv.iMiiiui mti u? mHm&dsww& iSB Wami MUMmmmmve ininjitiiim Wh sii jfjitMj)enjamiii5(5 nAKtnsoArvYiiK GrrrcCiillrtArMii n WWMtHfMMIj.
