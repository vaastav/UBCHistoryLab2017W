Consideration of the changes proposed in the Df-partment of Education by the Charter Ite riaioa Commission suggests grave doubts of , their wisdom. It must t>« admitted that the operation of the educational provisions of the present charter during the last three years has been far from satisfactory. There has been friction amounting a; times to turmoil, and until recently discontent has prevailed in all parts of the city. The strongest advocates of local ad ministration hr borough boards are aware that the results have been unfortunate In various ways, though they may not believe that this is the direct fault of the arrangement. There is a lark of *y*t«n in th* direction of school affairs, l«oth on the material and the educational side, with home practical if not theoretical conflict of authority, and consequent confusion and dupli i anon of effort. There is no uniform course of study, and no adequate means of regulating such divergences as may be appropriate to widely different circumstances. All this, we think, must b<? acknowledged, but It does not necessarily follow that th« present m heme should be radically and abruptly transformed. The Commission makes a plausible— we should say a perroasive— argument in sup port of the change* which it recommend*. We certainly Intend no disparagement by the for mer adjective. But the Commission of able and experienced men that framed the charter was quit*- as thoroughly convinced of the excel lence of the education plan which It had devised, an<l felt equal confidence concerning various other feature* of it* work which have quickly fallen Into disrepute. A striking example of misplaced faith is seen In the history of the Beard of Public Improvements, from which «'iiraordlnary benefits were expected, but which has really served no useful purpose whatsoever, and :«. now marker! for destruction by the re risors. It it- possible that the new plan of school administration which they propose would Justify their mast sanguine hopes, and If any one contends that it would probably do so we •van not quarrel with him. The point we de eire to emphasize is that whereas some pro visions of the charter have been thoroughly tflscrwlited-the police administration, for in stance-end public opinion Is pretty well agreed •s to the next experiment which on the whole It i* wise to make, that i* not the fact in regard to the Department of Education. A chief cause of this uncertainty has already been •ttffswted. ControrerEles arising in part out of personal Irritation and in part out of political and lej;al .implications have hitherto prevented a fair trial of the existing arrange ment Its intrinsic defects may consequently be Ims sertctis than they appear to be. and at least tHe chances best adapted to cur* them have not been decisively Indicated. In connection with this It is pertinent to observe that the presi des* of tsve B««rd of Education, who strongly opponed the. Dmrl* bill aad still condemns some of Its provision*, which In fact have been ig nored, now says tbat he should deplore a repeal of those other provisions, includicg the special tax allotment, which liave bwn carried into effect, and which after long strife and labor are *t least working smoothly and hare produced a general state of witlsfactlon. There is much force in the contention that the ?y««r%m should be left undisturbed as to its main features for a reasonable time In order that it may indisputa bly prore or disprove the claims which hare been made for it. The Tribune opposed the Paris biD because it was vague, confused and in part presumptively unconstitutional, or, if valid in all respects, exceedingly extravagant; but we are now inclined to think that It is expe dient to permit a fair trial of those provisions of the act which bare become operative In any case, we cannot approve the suggestion of the revisers that the salaries of teachers should be made up of two parts, one fixed and the other rarving aecordinr to the cost of living in vari ous' sections of the city. Such a derice would almost Inevitably cause serious mischief. THE niHWT 

REPORT. The report of the Secretary of the Treasury, which was transmitted to Congress yesterday, is confined almost entirely to a review of the work of the Departmeut for the fiscal year ending June 30. Last year, as was inevitable under the circumstances. Mr. C.tge devoted a large amount of space to recommendations re garding revision of the curreacy and banking laws. That revision w.is accomplished in the law of last March, but. ns Mr. oage himself has heretofore pointed out. it was faulty in one or two vital points which may sir IMS elements s€ danger under nn administration not in sym pathy with the spirit of the law. In his present report the Secretary fails to bring out these potßta, and confines himself to ¦ general suggestion that reinforcenrrnt of the monetary laws may l*> found necessary, espe .ially for the purpose of protecting the gold reserve by making mandatory under all circum stances the provisions for preserving the parity between gold and silver. He also hints at such revision of the law ns will make the National bank circulation more elastic and responsive to me varying demands of business, but offers no definite recommendation. It may be best, as Mr. Gage intimates, not to press these questions too strenuously at the present short sesßion of Congress, when so many other matters of great importance are clamoring for attention. They snould not be lost sight of, however, for. though a leaky roof may not be a matt* "T of immediate concern In fair weather, when the rain does come, as it will some time, damage is sure to lesult. A§ to the beneficial workings of the new law he ie explicit. The refunding operations of the Treasury hare resulted in the exchange of $H52,053,450 of 3, 4 and 5 per cent bonds for the new 2 per cents, with a net saving to the Gov ernment estimated by the Secretary at over $8,000,000. For the present refunding opera tions have been suspended, but as tbere are still outstanding some $487/»00,000 of the old bonds which are entitled to the privilege the Department will, the Secretary says, resume the process should the interest of the Govern ment and the general conditions of finance make euch a course desirable. The operations of the new law as to National banks have re sulted in the establishment of SB3 new banks, of which 249 have a capital of less than $50,000, thus giving the benefit of National banks to many communities which have heretofore been unable to maintain them. The total increase in National bank circulation under the new law has been f77.587.088. With the figures of foreign commerce and balance of trade which Mr. Gage gives, the public Is already familiar. They serve, however, once more to call atten tion to the marvellous industrial growth of the luited States. The total exports for the year were valued at $1 .394.438.082, of which f1 .870,763,571 were of domestic production, and nearly one-tliird consisted of manufactured ar ticles. The imports for the year were only $54P,&41.1W, an increase, to be sure, but largely made up of articles classed as "manufacturers' materials." The exports form the high water mark of American commerce, and were more widely dißtribu t ed than ever before. Mr. Gage recommends a reduction in the revenues, as his estimates of receipts and ex penditures for the fiscal year 1901 show an apparent surplus of $80,000,000. while those for 19<»2 point to a surplus of over $2fi.000,000. These figures, of course, are largely guesswork, and may not be borne out; but the variation is more than likely to be In favor of a larger sur plus under existing laws, for the completed figures for 1900 reveal an actual surplus of $79,527,080 18, as against an estimated surplus in last year's report of only $40,«00,000. On the whole, a study of the Treasury operations for 1900 can only be a source of gratification to every American cltiren. FOR A yiCARAGVA 

CAXAL. The Isthmian Canal Commission speaks in its report with no uncertain sound. It unanimous ly and unequivocally declares in favor of the Nicaragua route, and it recommends the con struction there of a canal 35 feet deep, 150 feet wide at the bottom and with a double system of locks large enough to accommodate the largest existing steamships. The cost of such a canal it estimates at $200,540,000, and the time of construction at ten years. A nar rower canal, with single locks, would cost only $163,913,000. These figures may seem to some surprisingly large. Professor Haupt some time ago named $125,000,000 as the maximum cost That, however, was for a smaller and less com modious canal than that contemplated by the Commission. The best judgment will doubtless approve the view of the Commission— namely, that the canal should be made large enough to accommodate the largest ships and should have double locks, so that navigation will not be Impeded whenever a lock has to be closed for repairs or renewal. There should be no half way work. If the canal is to be built it should be a first class canal. Th* reasons given by the Commission for preferring the Nicaragua to the Panama route are worthy of attention. In the first place, the Nicaragua route is probably no more costly than the Panama. It would cost, It is true, about *5S.00(..000 more to MM the Nicaragua Canal than to complete the Panama Canal. But then there are the rights and the property of the Panama company. That company has shown no disposition to cell them out entirely to the United States, and if it should do so It would probably demand a sum that would make the total cost at Panama at least as great as at Nicaragua. On That ooint. then, the Nicaragua route is at least as desirable as that at Panama. In the second place. while the Panama Canal would be the shorter and its time of transit less than thai at Nicaragua, there Is a still greater difference in time and distance in favor of Nicaragua on the whole route between San Francisco on the one hand and New-Orleans. New- York and Liverpool on the other. On this point there is therefore an advantage on the side of the Nicaragua, route. In the third and last place, the Fnlted State* would have a free hand at Nicaragua, but would not nt Panama! All old concessions on the former route have been abolished, and the goTemmenu of N!ca NEW-YORK DAILY THtBTIKK' WEI^TSSDAY. DECEMBER 5. 1900. ragua and Costa Rica are ready aad anxious to «rmnt de uovo tc the United State* an ample concession for the cnnaL But at Panama the Government of Colombia makes no such offer and can make none. It Is bound by its concession to the Panama company, which has yet some years to run. At ranama, there fore, the United States would have either to b-iy ont the old company at an exorbitant price or- which would be more probable, since the company dceu not seem inclined to sell-to become a business partner of that company and share with it the control of the canal. Well does the Commission eny it "considers such an arrangement inadmissible." It is alto gether out of the question. The I'nited States, if it builds the canal, must be the sole pro prietor of the canal. Wherefore on this tbird and most important point the difference in favor of Nicaragua is simply incommensurable. General Abbot, the most earnest and capable champion of the Panama route, has recently declared thnt if we ar»» to have the best possible cnnal w must make it at Panama, for "Nature "hns so decreed and it Is idle to contest the "decision." This f'omm«ssion does contest, not ¦ de:isi^n of Nature, but the pretension that Nature ha* made such a decree. We are in clined to think its contest will prove effective ani triumphant. The integrity and impartial ity of the Commissioners are above all ques tion, and their expert knowledge- of the sub ject in hand is not to be challenged. Their re port will, we believe, be received with sincere satisfaction by the great majority of the Na tion, and will he- commended to the favorable enrsideratinn of those who have In hand the direction of the Nation's public business. The report ought to settle completely and perma nently all questions as to the site and practica bility of the canal. There remains only the question of diplomatic rights and proprieties, and It should not be difficult to settle that promptly in full accord at once with the honor nnd with the material welfare of the United States. A SHUFFLE WITH VICE. Police Captain Titus has, exploded another Tammany fiction. The disreputable characters in his precinct are moving away as speedily as the San Francisco criminals took flight when they discoTered that the Vigilance Com mittee was in earnest. A mere word of warn ing is now enough to make the vicious persons who have been haunting the tenement houses pack their trunks and move out. Not one makes protest or stops to assert rights or shows the slightest disposition to thwart the desires of the police. A few in humble spirit nsk a little extension of time to settle their affairs before going Into exile, but with perfect unanimity they confess to the ease with which they can be disposed of by an earnest official The instant and complete success of Captain Titus In driving them out shows that they could have been driven out long ago. and that the excuses of York. Devery and their subordi nates were thoroughly insincere. All their talk about difficulties of securing proofs, about dangers of accused persons beginning damage suits which could not be successfully defended, merely meant that they did uot want to exer cise their authority, but preferred to see the children of the tenement houses corrupted bj the Immorality flourishing at their doors. And It was Mr. York himself who In a sudden and temporary spasm of Independence a few days ago announced that rice flourished only be cause it was protected, and was protected only because it paid for protection. The exodns from Captain Titus's precinct shows in another way also the dishonesty of Tammany's movement for reform. The re form Is merely a case of shuffle. The vicious are driven out of the precinct on which public attention hns been chiefly concentrated, but they settle across the border in another precinct undisturbed. They flock to Coney Island and its environs In numbers to arouse the Indig nation of respectable families there. What are the other police captains doing while Captain Titus is cleaning house? Is President York concerned only for the decency of the particu lar neighborhood where he is trying to bring his own children up to lead virtuous and Chris tian lives and of the precinct where trouble some missionaries hare forced him to acknowl edge the existence of police protected rice? Does he care nothing about the daughters of his fellow citizens of Bay Rldire and other sec tions of the city outside the limits of the spectacular hounecleaning? If the law can be enforced In one part of the city It can be in others, and Tammany will convince nobody that it has any purpose except to block the movement for genuinely better conditions by its ! raids and expulsions in particular districts. 

MORE LOOTIXO 19 CEIVA. The seizure of the instruments In the fnoioim Ptking Observatory by European officers must be regarded aa looting of the most wanton and offensive etottttar. It is looting simply for the sake of injury and spoliation. For the seizure of arsenals and arms there might be some excuse. It would deprive the Chinese of the power of offence. The seizure of food sup- I'li. s might be justified on the ground of the needs of the invading armies. The seizure of gold and silver found in native treasuries might he defended, for such treasure could be reckoned as part of the indemnity which it is agreed China must pay to the nations she has injured. But no such plea can be put forward In the case of this present looting. Those ancient astronomical instruments are not needed by the foreigners, they are of no military use to China, and they cannot bo reckoned as part of the in demnity. In seizing them the European officer! are robbing China of something which will not enrich them and which will leave China poor indeed. Such vandalism ha., ever been regarded with peculiar detestation Bonaparte's plundering of other European cities in order to enrich his own capital wirh works of arts had the quasi excuse that it did greatly enrich Paris and that it buMght the world's treasures together where they could be more readily seen and studied Yet it has always been thought an iniquitous act. The burning of the Capitol at Washington in the War of ISI2 might have been defended as an act of war, and as the destruction of an enemy's machinery of government and belliger ency. But it has. on the contrary, been de plored and denounced as unwarrantable and in defensible. This plundering of the Peking Ob servatory has not even such excuses, and it will ju>tiv expose its perpetrators to greater blame. Nor will the penalty he merely sentimental. It will be Intensely practical and concrete. For this is precisely the tort of thing which will moM certainly embitter the Chinese mind agsjasl all aliens ami make immeasuranly harder the final task of settlement and concilia tion. It would be interesting to know what cynical J< -«ter. In his moment of most mordant bitter ness, con.eived the one excuse that Is put for ward for this looting. That excuse is that ns the Chine*. Court is not likely to return to Peking snob beautiful lnntniments muat not be left exposed to Injury In a dty which i» no longer the capital-that la to say. the allies de sire the Court to return, and insist that it shall dr> bo but at the same time act upon the theory thnt it will not do so, and do all in their power to deter It from doing so by making the pity unattractive and uaflt for itg occupancy jiora over, they seek to establish the lovely variant of the law of meum et tnuio that if your neighbor hai a bit of property which you think be la not likely to take good care of yon are privileged to seize it and rob him of it! Really. China and the world might have been spared tbat adding of Insult to injury. If looting there must be, let It at least hare toe negative tirtue of the common pirate's frankness. THE 

ISSUE BETWEEN CHILI AXD PERU. The present controversy between the two chief western States of South America is over the fuliilmeut of the Treaty of Ancon. by which peace was restored between them after the last war, in ISB4. That treaty provided that the two Peruvian provinces of Tacna and Arica should be held and administered by ChiU for ten years, at the end of which period the in haiiitants of the provinces should decide by pop ular vote whether they should be restored to Peru or should remain Chilian, and finally the Stato to which they were thus awarded should pay to the other a solatium of $10,000,000 in Chilian silver. Now, this treaty was ratified on Mnrch 28, 18S4. The ten years of Chilian possession of the provinces therefore terminated qsj March 28, IS&4, and a plebiscitum should then have been taken to- determine the subse quent status of the provinces. But though more than six years have elapsed sine? fh»n i o plebiscitum has been taken and none is yet provided for. Hence acrimonious dispute and menace of war. As early as ISO 2 Peru sought to arrauge with Chili in advance for the prompt holding of an election at the end of the ten years, but Chill evaded positive action. It was not, indeed, until 1808 that ChiU would enter into practical negotiations upon the subject. On April 18 of that year, more than four years later than the date prescribed by the Treaty of Ancon, a protocol was signed by the diplomatic repre sentatives of the two countries, providing for tho submission of various questions to arbitra tion. These questions involved the qualifica tions of those who should take part in the plebiscitum and the secrecy or publicity of the voting. The protocol likewise stipulated that the plebiscitim should be taken under the di rection of three Commissioners, one of whom should be a Peruvian, one a Chilian and one a Spaniard appointed by the Queen Regent of Spain, who was also to be the arbitrator of the questions named. Agreement was also made concerning the time and manner of payment of the $10,000,000. With the signing of this protocol a final set tlement seemed to be in sight. But It was not so. It was necessary for the protocol to be ratified by the legislatures of the two nations. The Peruvian Congress did ratify it promptly. So did the Chilian Senate. But the Chilian Chamber of Deputies rejected it and has per sisted in its rejection of it down to the present time. No satisfactory reason appears to have been given for Chili's non-compliance with the terms .of the treaty, now more than six years overdue. Indeed, the sole reason we have heard advanced is the extraordinary one that popular sentiment in the two provinces Is still too favorable to Peru. That, being interpreted, means that Chili will not consent to a ple biscitum until she is assured it will be In* her favor. Such a pretext for delay is, of course, worse than none at ai< since It not only post pones the fulfilment of the Treaty of Ancon. but alms directly to nullify and to repudiate both the letter and the essential spirit of that in strument. An ominous sequel to this story is now pro vided. At the Ibero-Atneriean conference of Spanish speaking States at Madrid all the South American States which were represented, ex cept Chill, voted In favor of a general arbitra tion system for the settlement of boundary and other disputes. Chill alone opposed the scheme, and especially opposed Its application to terri torial or boundary disputes. And now. since the adoption of the scheme over her head. Chili proposes to adopt, for the first time In the West ern Hemisphere, the Prussian military system and to make every man a soldier. These things, as we have said, are unquestionably ominous. Tet It would be injudicious to regard them as making war certain. The fact that the Chilian Administration and Senate both agreed to the protocol shows that there is an important ele ment In that country In favor of a peaceful and equitable settlement. It Would be pleasant to believe that the contrary conduct of the Cham ber of Deputies was merely a bit of obstreper otjs factionalism, not representative of national sentiment and not likely to be permanently ef fective. Nations so far advanced In civilization an« 3 science as Germany and France should have no need of old Chinese astronomical Instruments. Columbia University has followed the example of Tale and offered free tuition to five Filipinos. It Is to be hoped that enough colleges may do this to give a fair opportunity for a considerable proportion of th" brightest of the Filipino youth to be Americanized, and at the same time to testify to the people of the Islands our good will. Heretofore Cuban patriots have been enforced to seek their ends by other means than Par liamentary discussion, but the Constitutional Convention now in session there gives them a fine oratorical opportunity, and they are mak ing the most of it. Not all their discourse Is of wisdom — as may be generally said about political and other convocations — but wisdom may com* out of it. and at least the pattern of an organic law, with the merit that its proportions were shaped by themselves, without any outside prompting or assistance. Such a task Justifies a good deal of talking, particularly among lo quacious tropical people, but there may be more of It than even the importance of the occasion calls for. The Austrian Emperor seems to find this as busy a season as his German brother. The Democrats in CongTe3s apparently do not know what they want or why they want it. The Republicans will have to be their own political conscience, for It is evident that no opposition will worthily perform that aseful office. Game seekers on Colonel J. J. Astor's estate at Rhinebeck have been so reckless that the owner Is obliged to take measures to bar them out. One of the house servants narrowly es caped grave Injury from a gunshot fired close to the mansion by one of those blunderers who handle firearms as if no human beings had ever been hurt by carelessness. Effective action Is called for to keep such people In check. The Grand Jury advisee the filtering of the water supply. Might it not be wia* to filter Tammany Hall first? Authentlc reports from Berlin show that marked card gamblers are on the run. The local authorities have chased a number of sharpers out of the German capital, and have »ent the guiltiest of the rogues to well harred cells. It Is plain enough that some thlugs ate dene better In Prussia than In Crokerville. Hero In New-York professional gamblers whose cards are marked with the tiger's paw are allowed to plunder th* foolish aa they like, &nd they rap idly rise to the high places in Tammany. They become district leaders. New-Orlepns Is waking up to the fact that the best way to avoid negro crimes Is to avoid educating negro boj» to be criminal* by con fining them for trinsng aellnqtuencies In Idleness among hardened convicts. Much dissatisfaction is expressed in Ohio and elsewhere because Mr». Van Lie*\ who delib erately threw acid In th« face or a young woman who had aroused her Jealousy, la not to re ceive suitable punishment. Ker victim was hor ribly disfigured and passed weeks of suffering before her death, but the guilty woman has only been sentenced to ten years* Imprisonment. Such mistaken leniency will tend to encourage this cruel and cowardly method of murder.

TALK OF THE DAT. Writing from Dresden. Germany, under date of November 11. a young American says: ... "I notice McKlnley has been re-elected with a still larger majority than In laM Th« Ger mans do not think much about it. Most of the Ger man papers admit that It is perhaps for the best in terest of both countries. In regard to the- people generally, they are apt to talk exceedingly against McKlnley. Had Bryan been elected, on the other hand, they would have been against him Just as well. I do not doubt at all that great excitement prevailed during election In the United States, but such stories as are circulated here are really ridiculous. For Instance, it Is said that In New-York City alone over six thousand people were killed or wounded, and In Kentucky over six hundred were shot at one place; that McKlnley had been elected as chairman of the Street Cleaners' Union, and that one member knocked his 'stovepipe' over his eyes because he was not present at the right time, and more of this sort of stuff.

As the college ex panded the stools multiplied, and to-day no less than sixty four-legged, painless instruments of discipline are in more or less constant use in a room devoted exclusively to the punishment of those who have transgressed the rules. There is absolutely nothing to the disciplining except the order to sit on a comfortable stool for twenty minutes and 'think it over.' Any of the lads would sooner take a sound thrashing and have done with It, but the stool of repentance has proved itself an ideal punishment, and It has come to stay at Girard College."

Even the weather, which seemed to threaten ruin to the eedsrtslimsj. was made In da end to pay tribute, too. to the marvsllous woman, th* charm which her art exerts over musical natures and the hold which she ha* won upon popular ad miration and asisrtlea. A seem depressing day could scarcely be conceived. A constant, cold rah*, driven aslant by a blustering wind, held from early morning till nightfall. Under tae circum stances an audience of a thousand persons wouM have been an eloquent tribute to any artist. But Mas*. Sembrtch's audience was of the Paderewskl type, filling nearly an the chairs and boxes, with all the standing room crowded. Th* audience was slew in coming, and no wonder, and the concert 1 began twenty minutes or more let*, yet the people remained UO the streets were resumed to in sist upon repetitions, to call the artist to th» stage over and over again, and anally to call for one of her oletlis performances of Chopin's "Maidens Wish," with the singer herself at the pianoforte. Beautiful as the people's tribute to th- singer was. her tribute to the p*o»la was even more beautiful. First, she enlisted the services of Mr. Ludwig Breitner at the pianoforte, that artist, who has made a specialty of chamber music, paying his own tribute by taking the accompaniments upon himsei; and lifting them into the regions of refined art. where they slews; This Insured symmetrical beauty In th* performance. Then she presented a programme, which was as unconventional m it was Interesting, and had but the one defect, which the listeners by their conduct refused to charge against It— excessive length. Mme.

" the old English ballad "The Three Ravens" and "It was a Lover and his Las*." with which she delighted her hearers at her recital last season. With Mo zart's "Veilchen." the loveliest blossom in the artistic song of the eighteenth century, she brought this part of the programme to a close, and there after we had modern German, French.

A STRONO PAPER. From The Philadelphia Press. No President In a four year term has given Con gress mere light and leading en the great con temporaneous events and conditions with which it has to reckon than President McKinley. His fourth annual Message is a strong paper, which puts Con gress In full possession of the tacts necessary to a proper understanding of affair* at nome and abroad, and he recommends legislation enough to keep It busy for th* winter. 

SANE AND «ATISrACTO*T. From Tha Philadelphia Record Th* last Presidential Message of the century deal* with great topics in a sane and satisfactory way. ON THE CHINESE SITUATION. From The Boston Herald. The exposition of the Chinese question a* the Administration apprehends it. the account of rh* origin and development of the trouble and what has really been accomplished. Is. in a literary way. the best part of the document, well considered and well presented. The noticeable characteristics are its extreme moderation, or. we might *ay. its ex treme charity, In its judgment of the whole series of events, and Its hopefulness that the settlement will be In accordance with our Interests and rea sonable claims. ORDERLY AND GRACEFUL. From Th* Boston Advertiser. Th* literary style of th* Message Is clear, order ly and graceful. REVIEW RATHER THAN FORECAST. From The Providence Journal. The President's treatment of the colonial nat tars is more in the nature of a review than of a forecast of probable or expected legislation. 

STATESMENLXKD ADVICE. From The Ctlca Press. If Congress can bear In mind the last paragraph of the President's Message that document will have rendered an efficient service. Belter advice was never given to National lawmakers. OPTIMISTIC. From The Philadelphia Telegraph. In the main, however, It is a clear and »*!***;: tory review of the events of the last year and or the situation at home and abroad. Its general tone is extremely optimistic, the most difficult «ad com plex problems being treated as if their satisfactory solution were weii within the power tad capacity of the lawmaklns branch of the Government. 

FOREIGN COMMENT. London. Dec 4.— "Mercifully." says Tie V*& Mall Gazette." "not even the conscientious Heater has cabled the full fifteen columns of President McKlnley's Message. This was wise, since no Eng lish paper could possibly have printed It, to the necessary exclusion from its pages of arsenical beer and other things that really do stir the great heart of the people. The most interesting section. however— China— is given fully; but It cannot b* said that its length is equivalent to Its strength." "The Globe" airs the uitra-Jlngolstic opinions, of which it has almost a monopoly. Taking for its text the reference to the isthmian Canal. It de clares that Washington is "not entitled to over ride our treaty secured rights in any part of Cen tral America, except with th* con-<ent of our Gov ernment. The Hay-Pauncefote compromise goes furthest in extreme conciliation, and represents this country's very last word, ami the United States must either accept the prooosal as it stands or abide by th* ruling of the CUyton-Buiwer Treaty, however embarrassing its provision* may be to American Imperialism." Paris. Dec. 4.— The "Journal dcs Debats" says. We cannot complain of the manner In which President McKlnley expressed himself on Franco- American relations We certainly are not alone in being well treated In the Message: but we head th* list, and this flattering posit! which la (evi dently Intentional, shows that ad much cordiality and coquetry are display in Washington's country as in Lafayette's in cultivating traditions good relations. The "Journal dcs Debats." however Is displeased at the Chin*** references, and on this subject says: The Message confirms what ha* been believe! for some days past, that the United States will tail the Western world In the pre*er:t grave circumstances, when it should have been one of its principal «*»• tars of strength.
