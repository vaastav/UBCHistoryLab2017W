A fjnorum of both houcs being present, ronjniittees were appointed to wait on the President arid inform him of their readi r.ess to receive any communication he U!::ht be )!easel to make. It was un derstood that lie would not present hiü mesagc until Tuesday, when both houses a Ijourncd. A caucus of the leaders in the House had been previously held, ar ranging all the" committees. Some of the aspiring ones had brought themselves into rather bad odor by endeavoring to get themselves appointed on jpot of the prin cipal committtes. and the more modest de tcimhicd to checkmate them if possible. Developments t:iith, rare and racy," may be expected. Already quite a number ol important moves have taen made on the political chess-board and more are to fol low.
