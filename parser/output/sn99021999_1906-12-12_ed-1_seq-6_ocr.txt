ILLIKOIS RAILROAD ASSKSSUKST' The comprehensive and ardous effort now In progress In Illinois to secure asaeiutrueut of railroad on the same basis as other properly has put on record the existence of tax shirking there like that against which the peo ple In other western states are In re volt. In spite of constitutional pro visions and laws commanding equal taxation, the transportation corpora tions there, as elsewhere, have man aged go to bring things about that they contribute to the public burden at a rate far below the average of the mass of other property, a fact which the numerous revisions and amend ments of the revenue law has failed to obliterate. The showing of railroad tax shirking now before the Illinois State Board of Equalization embraces all the ear marks so familiar in Nebraska. Be tween the valuation on which the roads are assessed and the valuation based on their reports to the Interstate Com merce commission there Is a difference of f 160,000,000, which should be taxed, but la not The roads. In short, are valued for taxation at 155,000 a mile, whereas they are capitalized at $169,000 a mile, or three times as much. And the percentage of Increase in the railroad assessment the last ten years is only one-third of the Increase In other property during the same time. Every test that can be applied co incides with these indications of glar ing assessment inequity towards the body of Illinois property owners. Yet it is one of the tax adjustments which as a precedent "has figured conspicu ously all these years In railroad argu ments against every proposition made In Nebraska for equal taxation. The whole case, however, fortunately shows that the people of Illinois In their own lnt.eresUe.re bestirring them selves to correct the precedent, which Is, Indeed, the only effective way In which all the states, each for Itself, can solve this stubborn problem. to to be abandoned and broken up alto gether and the popular demand for reform on vital corporation and trans portation Issues denied for a decade come should be given exclusive ight-of-way In congress and para mount place In public attention. It Is In hand now during the few weeks this session to confirm and strengthen the notable results thereby chleved, and the president has Just Ignlfied his realization of this neces sity by omitting In his message all reference to the tariff. So completely is the country, irre- pectlve of party, In harmony with the president's judgment and significant ttltude on this subject, and so obvious Is his wisdom, that the lid may be con sidered already spiked down, so far as a tariff outbreak at this session la con- erned. Since King Edward's experience with horses at the Chicago Live Stock show he Is In position to realise the tenacity of purpose of Sir Thomas Lip-tun. Proceedings in local courts recently have added accumulated weight of evi dence in support of the proposition that letter writing is a dacgeroui habit. 

D&3IAKD FOR IRON AKD STEEL. Adjustments and undertakings In the basic Iron and steel industries cover an extraordinary future period. While practically the full capacity of the mills has long been contracted for most of the coming year, ordinarily the Bupply of raw materials, Including pig Iron, ia not engaged so early, the market be ing depended upon to supply them as required. But the trade reports record sales of scores of thousands of tons for delivery In the third and fourth quarters of 1907, the first half of the year being already provided for. The facta can be explained only on the basts of universal conviction in the business world that the existing industrial movement will continue in full swing, at least through the com ing year and into the next. Such actual commitments are not otherwise made. There la, in fact, no hesitation in entering Into obligations for ma terials for railroads and all structural operations, but on the contrary the competition among buyers and con tractors is such that the prices have rapidly advanced, and the unprece dented contract for pig Iron are being made In the face of the highest prices in many a year. The chief embarrassment under which this great group of fundamental industries is laboring is the tame that clogs the operations of the agrlcul tural and commercial community namely, Inadequacy of the transporta tlon system, causing congestion, delay ana consequently disorganization in the complicated process of assembling the raw materials and restricting the output as well as increasing coat of production. These conditions, together with the higher nrices. neceaaariiv mply a tendency to restrain Indus trial enterprise, at the same time that they demonbtrate Its immense scope and energy. In dropping the educational bill the British government shows that It will not be aa liberal as possible with that rather expensive form of Chrlstmaa lift known as peerages. Mr. Bryan saya that lq his opinion there la little likelihood of war be tween the United States and Japan For once Mr. Bryan is in line with the majority of bis fellow countrymen. In meriting the Nobel peaxe prize Mr. Roosevelt has broken another precedent, but not more violently than In passing the cash along to the men who bring about industrial peace. The announcement that Wisconsin life Insurance compaulvs have not con tributed money for the election of po lttlcal candidate Is another argument In favor of patroulzlng western con cerns. Attorney W right nas advised the Water board on other points and hat been turned down by the courts. Is the meantime he has assured himself of employment and has made work foi other attorneys which will last for at least two years. September 4, lt0S, will be awaited with little trepidation by the citltem of Omaha. The pope'a bull against tut comet welo not more impotent than tht proposal of the Water board that the Water company cease business lr 'Omaha on the date of the expiration of Its hydrant rental contract. la only maintained the continued pros perlty of the farmer means continued activity In all lines of Industry and commerce, and the promise of th wheat crop Is a most encouraging sign A waterway system that did not In clude the Missouri river would be fat from comprehensive, but the most cer tain way to convince congress of tht necessity of an appropriation for the river Is to make such use. m can b made of It at present. Even a smal' fleet of steamers would be a more po tential argument than many resolutions. k. With more than $57,000,000 depos lied In 5S4 state banks, the farmers and small traders In Nebraska are Id fairly good financial condition. When the deposit In the national banks and other fiduciary Institutions are added to this it will be found that Nebraska has really become a wealthy atate. THE LID ON TARIFF AQlTATluy. The scheme of calling a republican caucua to consider tariff revision, a pe tition for which is now being circu lated by ardent revisionist members of the house, ia chimerical and so illad viaed as to render it inconceivable that majority can be committed to it. It Is utterly preposterous to suppose that any sort of revision can be got through at the short session, which will have practically only two mouths for work. With control of all branches of the government. It took the demo cratic party twelve months to frame and enact the Wilson-Gorman act of lb94, and the McKinley tariff of 190 was the fruit of ten months' continu ous legislative effort, to the practical subordination of all other public ques tions, hlle in both cases iho buslue-ss community was held up and paraljzed pending action and for many mouths after the form of the law had been determined. Tariff revision could have been taken up at the beginning of the last suasion, or a few months earlier at an extraordinary aesblon, as the same headlong revisionists who ore now agitating the matter then urged, but the aound Judgment of the country approves President Rooaevelt'a re fusal to press for such action. Beyond ull doubt, if he had done so, the great popular movement for control of rail roads ana great corporations would have failed to achieve the results em bodied In the rate bill and other im portant measures that were carried through at the last begulon. Such a price would have been too high to pay for any recagtlug of custom house schedules that could possibly have been effected, even if no great shock had befallen national prosperity. In brief, grand strategy for public interest Imperatively required that the Roosevelt program, if it ?-i'aot THE 

COUHTER-CHECK QUARRELSOME. In cataloguing the various stage In the development of a controversy Touchstone listed "the counter-check quarrelsome" as the fifth In succes sion, leading up to "the lie circumstan tial" and "the lie direct." This seems to be the status of the case at present between the Omaha Water board and the Omaha Water company. In tht meantime the primal object of the creation of the Water board seems tc have entirely vanished. The authot of "Senate File No. 1," which was tc operate as If by magic, now come forth and admits that the law he framed and so valiantly championed four years ago. is of no avail In Oma- ha'B necessity. The plant of the Omahs Water company positively refuses tc be bought on terms dictated by the author of "Senate File No. 1." Sucb contumacious stubbornness can only be met by like proceeding. Hence the counter-check quarrelsome. In rescinding the ordinance adopted by the city council under the provlslont of "Senate File No. 1" the Omaha Water board has adopted a legislative function. Whether rightfully or not It not here to be considered. It has set for itself the task of erecting a water plant sufficient for the inhabitants ol the city of Omaha, to be in operation in 1908, at the time when the hydran! rental contract with the Omaha Water company expires. ' Certain little diffl cultles line the way along which this project must necessarily travel. To begin with, if the Omaha Water board had at present plans drawn and adopted In detail, contracts let and ma terlal purchased for the erection of the proposed water plant. It would not be able to have It in operation by 1908 as is proposed. It is manifestly physical Impossibility. No contractoi under present conditions would assume the task. But the Water board hat only tentative plans suggestions thai have been, made by engineers and oth ers as to what may be done. The com mittee promises to proceed with such expedition as it may, but no time it fixed for its report. . - Another apparent obstacle will be the funds for the purchase of the watei plant. Six years ago $3,000,000 ir bonds were authorized by the citlzent of Omaha for (the purchase of the water plant. These bonds are not available for the erection of a plant Therefore, before the Water board can proceed far In Its present campaign It will be necessary to secure permission from the citizens to issue bonds fot the construction of Its proposed pump ing and distributing system. Having secured this permission the board will be called upon to sell these bonds With the litigation so Involved and ex tensive as exists It can easily be ap prehended that bond buyers will be chary of purchasing securities sc wrapped up In lawsuits. The contention, as It now stands, it based on the refusal of the Water com pany to segregate its Omaha and South Omaha systems and to sell to the city that part alone which lies within the 11 ii. Its of Omaha proper. Unless well- matured plans miscarry, before 1901? Omaha and South Omaha will be one municipality. Then the objection now raised against the purchase will have vanished, and the committee on plant and specifications will have to extend the scope of Its system to Include that portion which now it so strenuously objects to considering. It is easy tc read between the lines of the manifesto published by the Water board and see a gigantic bluff. The expressed opinion of European observers that war between the United States and Japan Is inevitable proves that these observers have failed to learn American methods and are some what mistaken as to those of the orient. The city council proposes to enact at ordinance that shall specify exactly the quality of gas to be furnished for light ing and heating purposes. This will be of more real service than a futile attempt to regulate the price. Since the new break In the Colo- rado river levee the Southern Pacific railway may conclude that a Salton sea is really better than a Salton desert. Nature has a way of reclaim ing its own.

At the urgent request of Representative Henry E. Ralney of the Twentieth Illlnol district. Attorney General Moody ha agreed to grant him a hearing at which the department of Justice will be called upon to secure Indictments under section 4 nr the Sherman anti-trust law against the officer of what Mr. Ralney Is pleased to call the Watch trust. The Illinois con gressman gained some prominence at the list session of congress by a more or les sensational attack upon the method of this o-ealled trust. He declared that American watches were sold abroad 0 pr cnt cheaper than at home and named a denier in New York City whom he said wa buying Waltham and Klgln watchea In Kurope, reimporting them and selling them In this country below the prices of other dealers and at a profit to himself. All corporation and companies are for bidden by section 4 of the Sherman anti trust law from entering into contract with citizen of any foreign nation by which the trade between the United States and other nations 1 hindered. Penalties ara provided for violation of this section, which, curiously enough, has never been tested in the courts. Representative Ralney claims to have positive proof of Its violation by officer of the so-called Watch trust nnd he appear confident of the gov ernment's ability to obtain indictments If he can Induce the attorney general to pur sue the matter, The White Man's Burden.

The Idea of holding the higher court Immune from criticism 1 not merely tra ditional obedience to the more orl ess common-doctrine of the court themselves that they should be Immune; It grows largely out of the Innate desire of the people to have confidence In their tribunals of Justice. When a thoughful and patriotic citizen believes that a court ha shown itself Incompetent or corrupt he has a double resentment that which arise from what he believes to have been a specific miscarriage of Justice and that which he feel because he must have less confidence j In court in general unwlxely and harmfully attacked; some- ! time they are permhu-d to make decree without dissent when intelligent criticism would be wholesome.
