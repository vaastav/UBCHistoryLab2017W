OUR NAVAL STRENGTH.- In his latest message President Taft refers to the great mistake which was made by the last congress in provid ing for but one battleship, and the need to make up for the action by making appropriations for three as this ession, believing that It is necessary tf our navy 1s to be maintained as an insurance of peace. Our navy, through the extra efforts made by foreign Bow ers, is threatened with becoming fourth In classification unless the plan of at least two battleships a year Is carried out. It was only five years ago that we ranked next to the British navy, but we have slipped from that posi tion through our inactivity and through the activity of Germany, and are but - lightly ahead of France, which Is steadily Improving her position. Great strides are being made by the British and German empires because of a feeling of distructfulness of each other and it Is a pace In navy build ing unprecedented. The British em pire through the dependencies will roll ' up a big addition to the fleet, Canada at present anticipating the gift of three dreadnoughts while India con templates about the same, Australia and others giving one or, more. Be cause of our position as a world power our possessions which need protection and the responsibilities which we as sume. It is necessary to have a suffi cient navy to back our stand and up hold our Influence. It certainly can not be done by decreasing our naval strength, dropping back from a first to a second class power and ranking fourth Instead of third. 

ENCOURAGING NEW BUSINESS. It Is always an inspiration to wit ness the encouraging of new business and in no Instance is this being done on a larger scale than by the rail roads throughout the west. There the broad expanse of fertile land awaits cultivation. It is well split up by rail roads, but it needs the presence and attention of the farmers. This has long been the aim of J. J. Hill of the Great Northern, but he and his road are not alone In the extensive work. Of the total of 249,992 miles of road operated In 1910 in this country, ex clusive of Alaska and the inland pos sessions, 191,448 miles or 76.6 per cent, were operated by companies making organised efforts to Increase the num bar of farmers or promote agricultural education. Of the total land area of the country 89.2 per cent, is in coun ties penetrated by railroads doing this work. This is, of course, a process of development, primarily for the rail roads but also for the nation. It is the business of handling the product of the farms, which the encouragement will result in, that the railroads are after. It is a proper ambition and its worth is recognized by the roads of the east, where manufacturing instead of farming is being encouraged. De partments are maintained for the ben efit of the business seeking a location, and a locality seeking a business and Norwich knows the value of such ser vices. AH parties Interested are the gainers by the laudable method of in creasing business. OWE CENT POSTAGE. ' Senator Penrose of Pennsylvania is getting much favorable support for his Mil in behalf of one cent postage v. hich he has Introduced at this session of congress. It is a matter which has vefived agitation for a number of -ai s and is bound to be adopted soon or later as the business of the post develops and expands. An or 'ration has been pushing such "or a long time on the ground nc cent Is sufficient for the cost " Ticrting first class mall, and it , the basis of the cost to the ont that the charge to the pub :de. With the post office ' making much better re ; Its operations and even riirnlus, the one cent plan ' mall is being strongly ;n oi portune time. . : .: 'is post is a big business .vhi'ih promises to make large io the government from its 'r:!.

With the present rate on : - ss matter providing a surplus t minions on that class. It Is but 'icing ca- of the cost for the other classes anf the cutting ef it in two will require further adjustments or leave a large deficit each year.. With the continuance the improvements which the department haa been show insthe way is heiVif paved for the one cant latter rate. 

COTTON AND COTTON FACTORIES What is to become of the J cotton lactones o this country is an 'inter esting question which faces those in terested in the industrial problems, especially when consideration Is given to the fact that Leader Underwood of the democratic forces says, "we .are going to revise the tariff from agate to zinc" which from a democratic standpoint must mean a revision down ward, at least', whether it reaches free trade or not. This country is the greatest pro ducer of cotton in the world supply ing seventy per cent, of the total amount of raw cotton for mill con sumption. About two-thirds of this production of the United Startes is ex ported to European countries, from which we In turn import a large amount of cotton manufacturers, most ly of the higher grades. We rank third among the world's greatt Import ers of cotton goods, though raising the raw material which Is sent.auroad to be bought back again. As exporters of cotton? goods we are making steady progress, but are far behind certain industrial countries of Europe which continue to find this country a rich market Cotton mills here are todav showing a decline in profits, even though prospwity is being enjoyed throughout the country. Higher wages are being flemanded in the face of the threatened tariff re vision, .a condition which is likely to further open this country to the fac tories of Europe and the cheap labor employed there. It would be a much better thing to encourage the factories of this country to greater business in stead of handing it over to Europe. . . r THE LIBERTY BELL. Great value Is attached to the ob taining of the Liberty bell for' each and every patriotic demonstration throughout the country. It Is consid ered necessary to canupjete all the de tails and naturally it would provide an object of much interest wherever displayed, particularly to the children. California is making al determined ef fort to obtain it for fine Panama ex position at San Francisco in 1915 for which petitions aggregating two miles in length have been sent to Phila delphia. Had this occurred a few years ago there would not have been the least hesitancy for it was considered an honor to be called upon for Its use, but in its trips about the country it has been subjected to the necessary jar and strain of handling itt and the crack which has Invalidated it for so long appeared to be widening. The de. cision therefore that It was not to be subjectQd to any more rides about the country was arrived at because of the risk involved, the desire being to keep the bell Intact as long as possible. Cal ifornia hopes to overcome this and is doing its best to uphold her claim that so long as other expositions have had it, they ought not to be deprived and that the people of the Pacific coast should have a chance to get a look at it. Philadelphia indicates that she will continue to say no, politely but firmly, and it can be readily understood that it is better td have the bell at Phila delphla intact than in pieces. EDITORIAL NOTES. It is safe to plan on Woodrow Wil son being inaugurated March 4,. pomp, weather and all. From all reports there seems to be reason in the democratic cry of swat the office seekers. Happy thought for today: The best nerve tonic of the season .is early Christmas shopping. The moving pictures, which please the storekeepers most, are the busy buyers and the early ones. The bookmen seem to have about the same control in New England that the gunmen did in New York. When Gov. Blease of South Caro lina speaks it sounds like an echo from the recent election campaign. Now that peace has been signed in the Sickles family and the war relics saved, there is hope for Turkey and Greece. If wouldn't be surprising if the weather was bothering Santa Claus. It's hard to tell which conveyance to make ready. A woman in New Jersey who broke two ribs and an arm trying to kiss a bashful boy will have time to repent at her leisure. If you miss anything' nowadays it is well to be cautious. Perhaps it Is being used to match up your Christ mas present by. The book agents quickly demonstrate that they know where the people are who have the money and that they know how to get it. Bulgaria has won a great victory at the sacrifice of the leading business and prbfesslonal men. War is all Gen eral Sherman said it was. With the Cape Cod canal five-eighths done. New England coasting trade can begin to anticipate the overcoming of a mighty dangerous route. The postal card circulation has been diminished nearly one-half by the pic ture post card, but that doesn't please the letter carriers and postal clerks any. While the fad of showing one's teeth when photographed is said to have spru.ng up in Washington. It was sup, posed that was confined strictly to Oy ster Bay. Changes have been made in many of the New Haven road officials. As they have been promotions It can have no reference to the many wrecks of the recent past. When the democrats face the fact that $43,000,000 has been realized by the farmers of the south and west on beet sugar they will do some thing ing over slashing the sugar schedule. A one man shellfish commission Is being strongly urged instead of three on the board. and yet in the matter of highways, where one man has made a big success, three are now being ad vocated. That the New Haven Times-Leader has been obliged to add materially to its mechanical equipment in order to keep up with its steady growth is one of the Incontrovertible facts that New Haveners not only appreciate its good service, but can expect it to continue. Norwich is trying to get the Con necticut company to use its streets for better transportation. In Bridge port they are endeavoring to stop the company from getting any . more streets. Why not make the efforts where they will be most appreciated? THE MAN WHO
