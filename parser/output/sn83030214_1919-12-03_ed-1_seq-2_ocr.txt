would not like a split with him on such nn important party question, and since hIso the executive departments are clamoring for more money that the present seale of taxation will bring int? the Treasury. The Republicans pointed out that in the same breath the President makes ?ti argument in favor of reducing the high taxes on excess profits and in? comes and urges that the present scale be continued for another year. The President in discussing the un? rest that prevails in the country favored restrictions on extremists, but said that there should be neither un? due curtailing of personal liberties nor leniency toward crime or incitera of crime. He advised Congress not to be too drastic, but to seek rather to re? move the causes of unrest. The delivery of the message to Con? gress was rather perfunctory, lie* clerks reading i*. in the House and Senate chambers. In the House there was scattered applause from the Democratic side from time to time, and about thirty seconds of sustained applause at the end. In the Senate the rule against applause was observed. It was in vivid contrast with the mes? sages which the President has read in person to joint galleries of the two nouses, which are always characterized by packed galleries and vigorous dem? onstrations of approval. Bouses Ilomocratic Criticism More space was devoted to a dis? cussion of the labor situation than anything else, but there were no spe cific recommendations, unless the in? sisten*?' that tlie labor sections of tin peace treaty should be approved is counted as one. This was one of the few portions of the message which aroused any oppo? sition on the Democratic side. Senator Thomas of Colorado, who voted against ratification of the treaty because it contained these very sections, ex? pressed surprise that the President mid taken this position, while Senator King of Utah could not approve the idea of an international tribune pass? ing on American labor questions. On two questions, the treatment of returned soldiers and the protect on of the American chemical and dye in dustries, the message quoted para graphs from the President's last mes? sage to Congress. In addition to these the message renews, without quota? tions, ti*.?* recommendations previi u made with regard to extension of the food control legislation, for a national cold storage act, and for an act. com? pelling prices to be marked on articles shipped in interstate commerce.

WASHINGTON, Pre. t.?Following is 1 the text of the President's message to i Congress: TO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: I sincerelv regret that 1 cannot he i ' present at the opening of this sea i sion of the Congress. I am thus prc | vented from presenting in as direct 1 a way as 1 could wish the many ques ? tions that are pressing for solution ? nt this time. Happily, I have the advantage of the advice of the heads of the several executive departments, ? who have kept in close touch with affairs in their detail and whose thoughtful recommendations I ear? nestly second, In tl e matter of the railroads and the readjustment of their affairs growing oat of Federal control, 1 shall take the liberty at a latfer day of ad? dressing you. I hope that Cor ess will bring to a conclusion at t is session legisla? tion looking to the establishment of a budget system. That there should be one single authority responsible for the making of all appropriations and that appropriations should bo made not independently of each other, hut with reference to one single com? prehensive plan of expenditure prop? erly related to the nation's income, there can be no doubt. I believe the burden of preparing ?he budget must, in the nature of the I rase, if the work is to bo properly ' ?lone ami responsibility concentrnted i instead of divided, rest upon the l'.x I cutivc. The budget so prepared should he submitted to and approved or amended by a single committee of each, house of Congress and no single appropriation should he made by the Congress except such as may have been included in the budget prepared by the Executive or added by the particular committee of Congress charged with tin' budget legislation. Another and not less'important aspect of the problem is the ascer? tainment of the economy and ef-' liciency with which the moneys ap? propriated are on pended. Under ex isting law the only audit is for the purpose of ascertaining whether ex? penditures have been lawfully made within the appropriai ions. No one is authorized or equipped to ascertain whether the money has been spent, wisely, economically and effectively. The auditors should he highly trained officials with permanent tenure in the Treasury Department, free of obligations to or motives of consid? eration for this or any subsequent administr?t ion, and authorized and empowered to examine into and make report upon the methods employed and the results obtained by the executive departments of the gov? ernment. Their reports should he mnde to the Congress and to the Secretary of the Treasury. Reduce Income and Profits Taxes If They Destroy Business Activity I trust that the Congress will give its immediate consideration to the problem of future Taxation. Simpli? fication of the income and profits taxes has become an immediate ne? cessity. These taxes performed in? dispensable service during the war. They must, however, be simplified, not only to save the taxpayer in? convenience and expense, but in order that his liability may he made certain and definite. With reference to the details of the revenue law, the Secret iry ? f the Treasury and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue will lay before you for your consideration certain amendments necessary or desirable in connection with tac administra? tion of Ara law.recommendatioi ?which have my approval ata! support. It is of the utmost importance that in deal ng with this matter tire present law should not lie disturbed so far as regards taxes for the calendai yea: U'310, payable in the calendar year 1021. The Congress might well con? sider whether the h gher ra' cs of In - Income and profits taxes can in peace times be effectively productive of revenue, and whether they may not, on the contrary, he destructivo of business activity and productive of waste and inefficiency. There is a point at which in pence times high rates of income and prolits taxes discourage energy, re? move the incentive to new enter prise, encourage extravagant expendi? tures and procKicc industrial stagna? tion, with consequent unemployment and other attendant evils. Th" problem is not an easy one, A n dai ? i tal change has taken place with reference to the position of At?ctica in the war!.!'-, affairs.

Tariff Legislation Should Protect Chemical and Dyestuffs Industries In the matter of tariff legislation, I heg to call your attention to the statements contained in my last message urging legislation with ref? erence to th?.- establishment of the chemical and dyestuffs industry in America : "Among the industries to which special consideration should be given is that of th? mai ufacture of dye stuffs and related chemicals. Our complete dependence upon German ippl ? before t he war made the in? terruption of trade a cause of ex? ceptional economic disturbance. "The close relation between the r: m ifacture of dyestuffs, o-, the one hand, and of expl a \ and poi: on ous ?rases on t he . reover, has given : he indust i ?. ,.:, exce pt ional sir-::ificance and valui . Although the Ui it? ,1 States wall i" la i! y and unhesit: ! i rly join : n t he gram of intei nat h nal .1 isarma ment, it will, in v. rt '? A ss, he a policj o'* obvious : . dence to make certain of t ire su - Ar I mn ntei .....a. of nr.nrv si ron i: and well equ ppc I chei ?cal ? ants The Ger? man chemical industry, with which we will he brought into competitive war, may well be again a thor oughly knit monopoly, capable of ex ercising a competition of a peculiarly insidious and dangerous kind. During the war the farmer per? formed a vital and willing service to the nation. By materially increasing the production of his land, he sup? plied Amorica and the Allies with '.ho increased amounts of food necessary to keep their immense armies in the field. He indispensably helped to win the war. Hut there is now scarcely loas need of increasing the production in food and the neces? saries <>f life. I ask the Congress to consider means of encouraging effort alonp these lines. The importance o? doing everything possible to pro? mote production along economic lines, to improve marketing and to make rural lif?> more attractive and healthful is obvious. I would urge approval of the plans already pro? posed to the Congress by the Secre? tary of Agriculture to secure the essential facts required for the proper si tidy of this question, through the proposed enlarged pro grams for faim management studies and crop estimates. 1 would urge also the continuance of Federal participation in the build? ing of good roads, under the terms of existing law and under the direc? tion of present agencies; the need of further action on the part of the states and the Federal government to preserve and develop our forest resources, especially through the practice of liet ter for? estry methods on privai" holdings and the extension of the publicly owned forests; better support for country schools and the mor.- definite direction of their course,-, of study along lines related to rural problems, and fuller provision for sanitation m rural districts and the building tip of Heeded hospital and medical facilities in these localities. Per? haps the way might he cleared for many of these desirable reforms by a fresh, comprehensivo survey made of rural conditions by a conference composed ?>f representatives of the farmers and of the agricultural licen? cies responsible for leadership. Curb Unrest by Granting Power to Punish Profiteers and Radicals 1 would call your attention to the widespread condition of political restlessness in our body politic. The causes of this unrest, while various and complicated, are superficial rather than deep-seated. Broadly, they arise from or are connected with the failure on the part of our government to arrive speedily at a just, and permanent peace, permitting return to normal conditions; from the transfusion of radical theories, from seething European centers pending such delay, from heartless profiteering, resulting in the increase of the cost of living, and lastly from the machinations of passionate and malevolent agitators. With the return to normal condi? tions this unrest will rapidly disap? pear. In tin' mean time It does much evil. It Beems to me that In dealing with this situation Congress should not he impatient or drastic, but should seek. rather, to remove the causes. It should endeavor to bring our country hack speedily to a peace basis, with ameliorated living conditions under the minimum of restrictions upon personal liberty that is consistent with our reconstruction problems. And it should arm the federal gov? ernment w'h power to deal in its criminal courts with those persons who by violent method would abro? gate our time-tested institutions. With the free expression of opinion and with the advocacy of orderly political change, however fundamen tal, there must be no interfi i nee, but toward passion and malevolence tending * i incite crime and insurrec? tion under guise of political evolutioi there should be no leniency. Legislation to this end has een recommended by the Attorney Gen eral and should be enacted. In this direction I would call your atti ntion my recommendations on Vug 8, pointing out legislative measures As I pointed out it. my last mes sage, pul : city can accomplish a greal deal in this campaign. The aims of the government taust he clearly which would be effective in conti ill ing an?! bringing- down the pre ent high co ? of living, which contrib ti so largely to this unrest. On only of I hese ri com.ndation ? has the Congress acted, If the govern ent's campaign is to be effect ive, it ; . noce a ry that the other steps sug? gest, d should be acted on at one -. I renew and strongly urge the ne ci ty of the extension of the pres? ent food control act as to the pe? riod of ' me in *?*? h ich 11 s hall rema it: . opt rat ion, The Atl orney Geni ral has submitted a bill providing Ar an extension of this act for n period of six months. As it now stands-, it is limited in operation to the period of the war ami becomes inoperative upon the formal proclamation of peace. It is imperative that it should be extended at once. Tin* Depart? ment of ,lust tee has built up exten? sive machinery for the purpose ot enforcing its provisions, all of which must be abandoned upon the con? clusion of peace unless the provi? sions of this act are extended. During this period the Congress will have an opportunity to mak. 'at perman? at pro\ ; sions an? regulations with regard to all goods d? -''tie.i for interstate commerce an? lo i xclude them from interstate ship ?* if tin- requirements of the iuv? are ta * complied with. Some sue!

There cai be no doubt of either the neces; ' or tit?' legitimacy of such measures brought to the attention of the con suming public, civic organization! and state officials, who are in a pot i to lend their assistanc? t?i ou; efforts, You have mad?* availabli at. Is with which to carry on thi campaign, but there is no provisioi in the law authorizing their expend? turc for tin* purpose of making th ? blic tally informed about th.- effort of the government. Specific t a; mendation has been made by th Attorney General in this regard. I would strongly urge upon you it immediate adoption, as it constitute one of the preliminary steps to thi campo gn. i also renew my recommondatio tint th?' Congress pass a law regu lating cold storage as it is regulatei for example, by the laws of the Stat of New Jersey, which limit the tim during which goods may bo kip' t storage, prescribe the method of dis posing of them if kept beyond th permitted period, and require tha goods released from storage shall i till cases bear the date of their n cetpt. It would materially add to th serviceability of the law, for tl* purpose we now have in view, if were also prescribed that all good released from storage for interstal hipment hi uld have plainly marke ui ': each package the selling * arket price at which they went in! ' rage. By this means the pu chaser would always be ahk? to leai what profits stood between him ar the producers or the wholesa dealer. I would also renew my recommct dation that all goods destined for ii terstate commerce should in evei case, where their form of packa* makes ?( possible, be plainly mark? ? th the price at which they !i?:'?. tl 1 ands of the producer. We should formulate a law requi ing a Federal license of all corpor ??ju* **v-*-**r4 .I*? fr?6vtW?Hta www?-a and embodying in the license, or the conditions under which it is to be issued, specific regulations designed to secure competitive selling and pre? vent, unconceivable profits in the method of marke: ing. Such a law would afford a welcome opportunity to effect other much-needed reforms in the business of interstate ship? ments and in the methods of cor? porations which are encaged in it; but for the moment 1 confine my recommendations to the object im? mediately in hand, which is to lower the cost, of living. Labor and Capita! No one who has observed the march of events in the last year can fail to note the absolute need of a definite program to bring about an improve? ment m the conditions of labor. There can be no settled conditions leading to incensed production and a reduction m the cost of living if labor and capital ar ? to he antago? nists instead of partners. Sound thinking and an hauest de? sire to serve the interests of the whole nation, us distinguished from ' he inter?s'.; of a class, ; ust he applied to the solution of this great and pressing problem. The failure of other nal ions to consider thi n m a vigorous way has produce i bitterness and jealousies and antag? onisms, t he food of rad ica Ii ;m.

I called a confi-r cnce to meet in Washington on De? cember I. to consider thee problems in all I heir h road aspee' s, wit ti the idea of bringing about a better un derstanding between these two in? terests. The great unrest throughout the world, out of which has emerged a demand for an immediate consider? ation of the difficulties between cap? ital and labor, bids us put our own house in order. Frankly, there can be no permanent and lusting settl - merits between capital and labor which do not recognize the funda? mental concepts for which labor has been struggling through the years. The whole world gave its n-fy ?ti .?r and indorsement to these funda? mental purposes in the league of nat ions. Th" statesmen gathered at Ver? sailles recognized the fact that world stability could not be had by revert? ing to industry standards and condi tions against which the average work man of the world had revolted It is, therefore, the task of the tates men of 'his new day of chai ;?? readjustment to recognize world can ditions and to seek to bring about, t hrough legislat ion, cond I ion will mean the ending of agi oi . antagonisms between capital and laboi. t hat will hop? fully lead I building up of a comrade hip which wilI ????-ai' not only ii greater coi tentment among the mi of men but also bring ah it a urea i or production and a grea er pro : to business it elf.
