O'ROURKE OBJECTS, IS PLACED UNDER ARREST Relative of Brewer, Gaining Possession of License, Seeks to Move Bar Business, As a result of bitter controversy be tween brewers and the hotel keeper over possession of the liquor license of the Hotel Tremont, 11-15 Jimaie street, .Henry J. O'Rourke. proprietor of the hotel, was arrested this afternoon on a. .tv arrant charging him with violation of the liquor law. , , O'Hourke'B arrest was not altogether unexpected, for during' the forenoon. Louts Bosquette, a, relative of Christo pher A. La Croix of the brewery agen cy of "La Croix & Anderson, had sent a letter to the county commissioners that promised speedy developments. Boscru-ette is the nominal holder of the license, though O'Jtourke claims , that he is the owner of the license in fact. Today Bosquette notified the county commissioners that he had sus . pended business ait the Tremont bar, and that he planned to remove his business ' as soon as he. could secure ratification for the transfer of the li cense. . ' O'Rourke claims to have been double crossed, and he is prepared to fight for the retention of the ' license in his place. With the arrest of O'Rourke it be came known that ojection had been made by representatives of the clergy, -to Mayor Wilson against the manner . of conducting - the hotel, ,aud that Mayor "Wilson communicated $hese o-b- j -Jectione to La. Croix ftAniereen, until "very recently the holders of the license, for 0Rourke's hotel. -O'Rourke claims 4 here -have been no women in the hotel .lor a month. . - " O'Rourke lost control of the license some time ago. when he negotiated a loan of $1,500 from tne brewery agents to finance some other business enters prises. Recently Bosquete. a relative of La Croix, took over the license. O'Rourke claims La Croix & Ander. ..son agreed that the license might re main in the, Tremont so long, as- he bought beer through Vhem. On " the other hand, it is said that ..Mayor Wilson , objected to O'Rourke's ' being allowed to run the place, ' and this, the reports say, is the reason for 1 the placing of the license, yesterday in the name of Bosquette. ' Yesterday O'Rourke was notified by ' the brewery agents that he must va cate. He refused. . He ' added that as he was really the owner of the license as well as the property he would ob ject to any attempt to transfer the license. t , . Affairs were sadly complicated this forenoon when the county commis sioners: received from Bosquette a let ter notifying them he had closed his place in. the Tremont. The appear ance of Liquor Agent John Brown at the Tremont came shortly thereafter, and O'Rourke and his bartender, George Stafford, - were arrested for conducting the business without a li cense, taken to police headquarters, and released on bail of $100 and $25, respectively. O'Rourke claims to have kept faith with the administration. He is ready to continue to run the place as a sta hotel which is said to be a proposition acceptable to the ministers. But the unexpected action of LaCroix &. An derson and Bosquette threw his plans away. , O'Rourke claims that the adminis tration has made a muddle of the whole affair. LaCroix & Anderson had promised the mayor to put O'Rourke out, it is said, if they were given their license. In fact. Mayor Wilson is quoted as having threatened to remon strate against the renewal of the li cense ' if O'Rourke wasn't ousted. ORourke was amazed yesterday, when he was told that the promise had been made that he was to be put out, for he says that he himself is the owner and lessee of the hotel and he adds that if any attempt is made to trans fer the license he will remonstrate against the transfer. The case of O'Rourke will be called In the City court tomorrow. ALLEGED ENTICER . OF PISTOL VICTIM IS HELOFOR TRIAL - Waterbury, Conn., W. 2.

After the report is presented to the council it is, to be presented to the voters for their con sideration at a regular or special elec tion. The adoption of the commission form of : government would mean the -adop tion of.- the so-called) short ballots The. mayor, also advocated that :th building-, commissioners and . . building inspector rooel -.with-the common cour-- Ml ana formulate a--fe-uildihg code. . ' i He (scolded the toara of education for not moving, with more rapidity: in-the erection, of the new high schools and other. school buildings and said the ef ficiency of the board would be in creased if it would consider and adopt the recommendation, of Dr. Van Sickle, wno recently investigated the Bridge port school system. - The mayor believes the park com missioners - should Installs more play grounds "with a competent iand proper supervisor in charge and that the com missioners' be given a "reasonable and commensurate" appropriation.

He also ad vised an ordinance prohibiting any ve hicle standing in the center of the city for a longer time than fifteen or twen ty minutes.

"The mayor advocated the establish ment, of public markets, one on the East Side and one on the West Side of the Peq.uonnock river. ' He suggested that the aldermanie committee. on lamps take up the mat ter with merchants in the center of the city for" the establishment ' of 'a "White Way." He thinks - the mer chants would be willing to pay part of the lighting cost aid the present arc lights might be discontinued and the cost of these lights appropriated to the general - cost of maintenance of the White Way."

"If rates continue to decline or even remain, on the. present-lev-el," Mr. El liott says, "and if expenses continue to be . increased by; higher wages and eost of- materials and by ths Introduction of different " appliances and facilities more rapidly than the rajlroads.. can obtain money, then there Is but one result for some of theroads-T-that is, bankruptcy.

The solemn dulet which attended th President's reading was broken by general applause when he read his views on the Mexican situation in th words, "There can be no certain pros pect of peace in America until Gener al Huerta has surrendered his usurped authority in Mexico."

Washington, Dec. 2 President Wil son read his flrat annual mear to Congress today at a Joint session of both branches at 1 o'clock in the House chamber. The message, amonsr the briefest of documents of its kind from any President and some 3,CM0 words long, required less than 30 minutes for reading, though it treat ed upon a variety of subjects. The Mexican situation President Wilson dismissed with brief comment, reiterating the sentiments he ex pressed in a special address to Con gress on the same subject some" urnt ago and expressing the belief that th Huerta government slowly was crum bling and that the United States prob ably would not be obliged to alter its policy of waiting.

' For details of the provern- , business the President referred Con gress to the annual renorts of his cabinet officers. The message opened with this com ment on the Mexican situation: "There is but one . cloud upon our horison. That has shown itself n the south of us and hangs over Mexi co. There can be no certain pros pect of peace in America until Gen eral Huerta has surrendered his usurped authority in Mexico; until tS is understood on all hands, intfee. that such pretended governments will not be countenanced or dealt with by the government of the United States. We are the "friends of constitutional government in America: we arc more than Its friends, we are Its cham pions because in no other way can our neighbors, to whom we wouil wlsh in every way to make proof. our friendship, work out their own development in peace, ia. liberty." The President observed that the power and prestige of the Huerta goT-( eminent was rapidly crumbling and j adiied: v. . We shall not, I believe, be obi!gdf to alter our policy of watchfol watt-! ing." ; Mr. Wilson presented s suggestion that legislation be promptly enactf ,1 providing for primary elections ' throughout the country, at which thai voters of the cevpral parties "may' choose their nominees for the pros!-" deney without the intervention, nominating conventions."
