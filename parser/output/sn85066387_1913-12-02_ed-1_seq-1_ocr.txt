WATER BILL FOES LED BY WORKS WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 2.—Sen ator Wcrke today led the opposition to the Hetch Hetchy bill in tlie sen ate, speaking against the measure that provides a water supply for San Francisco. Works declared San Francisco had no right under California laws to appropriate flood waters for use in the adjacent cities. He said an ex amination of the water appropria tions would show San Francisco has no right to all the 400.000.000 gallons of water reserved to its use under the terms of the bllL He asserted the bill did not repre sent the wishes of all the people of San Francisco. He was frequently interrupted by Senator Thomas and other democrats who favor the bill. Protests against the bill were pre sented by Senator Root from Alden Simpson on behalf of three-fourths of the members of the Sierra rlub of San Francisco and from the Institute of Arts and Sciences of Columbia uni versity of New York. FOURTEEN PAGES—SAJS FRANCISCO, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 2, 1913 Captain and 2 Mates Charged With Negligence When 4 Men Lost [ ° ■ With officers, mombera of the crew and passengers present, the ottloiai j trial of Captain R J. Paulsen, Ktrst Ofßcer Ravens and Second Officer Mathieson of the steamship President, charged with negligence in the loss of one passenger and three sailors Wednesday night, began today before Halted States Inspectors Dolan and Guthrie. In all the testimony the bravery of ! Fourth Officer Shane and his suhordl ; nates, who went to the rescue of the drowning passenger, becomes more : and more apparent. Testimony differed on minor details, but practically all the witnesses agreed that the men manned the boat I knowing that they were courting death and without being ordered to perform the task. 

SENSATION AI, TESTIMONY "The only persons I noticed giving any orders on the President were the bartender and the night watchman." This testimony was given this morning by W. W. Sweet, a passen ger. Sweet's testimony substantiated the previous' story told by passengers re garding the inefficiency of the crew. None of th« officers of the President, he said, ordered an yone to man the boats or went to the boats themselves. He also said that a mob of passengers surrounded the fourth mate, pleading that something be done, and that he (Sweet) timed the casting loose of the two boats, which operation, he said, was very slow. F. G. Palmer, a sailor, denied that there were no plugs in the boat he was in, and testified that the plugs were lashed to the boats to secure their safety. The doors of passen gers' cabins, he said, had been lashed shut, but several passengers had cut the lashings. The hearing was ended with a re cess at noon and will be resumed at 2 o'clock this afternoon on the fifth floor of the custom house. According to Third Officer McCarthy, he had received no orders to get Into the boat, but was only prevented from doing so by the presence of storm nets which were lashed around the decks. NO 

ORDERS GIVEN Jacob Gunderson, one of the men rescued from the sea when the first boat capsized, testified that the boat was lowered to the water's edge on a perfectly even keel and did not cap size until after It had reached the water. Gunderson said that no orders were given, although he remembered that he had heard the fourth mate say: "Come on, fellows! Let's get Into the boat." Gunderson said that he had called out several times to "lower away" after getting into the boat. He also testified that life preservers were thrown in great numbers by the passengers, many of them landing on him. The flrst stories related by the pas sengers when they landed here on tlie President are being contradicted In all major details by the members of the crew.. '• • - * The propeller was not started while the passenger and sailors were'strug' gling lnithe water, according'to Fred Cockburn, of 12-54.Filbert street.. - *' • •I-t also developed In the ■ hearing that cries for help, could be' - h'eard even after the men were lost to-°sight..

REGRETS SHE USED ROOM FOR SUICIDE A woman Riving' the name of Esther | Ellsworth who yesterday rented a room in the Aloha apartments, 2793 Mission street, was found dead in her room at noon today from gas asphyx iation. The woman left a pathetic note to the coroner and another to the land lady, in which she apologized for tak ing her life in the room. The letter to the coroner was as follows: "I am sick and out of work. I am discouraged and so unhappy. lam all alone and have no friends or rela tives. None will suffer for what I shall do. I have always tried to do what was right, and this can not be very far from wrong. I am leaving the name of a mere acquaintance. Send him word. No one is responsible for this. I simply have no courage or strength to fight fate any longer. My only wish is that my body be cremated and that this be kept as quiet as pos sible." At the bottom of the letter appeared the name of F. Fisher, 58 Sutter street. The dead woman was neatly dressed and refined looking. 11 Are Drowned in A Texas Cloudburst! FORT WORTH. Tex..

President Wilson's Message at a Glance 

HUERTA MUST GO—There can be no certain prospect of peace in America until General Huerta has surrendered his usurped authority in Mexico; until it is understood in all lands, indeed, that such pretended government will not be countenanced by the government of the United States. General Huerta has forfeited the respect and moral support even of those who . were at one time willing to see him succeed. CURRENCY REFORM AND FARMERS—I need not say how earnestly I hope for the early enactment of the currency bill into law. The pending currency bill does the farmers a great service. DIRECT PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION—I urge the prompt enactment of legislation which will provide for primary elections throughout the country, at which the voters of the several par ties may choose their nominees for the presidency without the intervention of nominating conventions. 

TRUST LEGISLATION—I think it will be easily agreed that we should let the Sherman anti-trust law stand, unaltered, as it is, with its debatable ground about it, but we should as much as possible reduce the area of that debatable ground by further and more explicit legislation. RURAL CREDIT REFORM—The congress recently authorized the creation of a special commission to study the currency systems of rural credit which have been put into operation in Europe, and this commission is already prepared to report. PHILIPPINE INDEPENDENCE—In regard to the Philippines, we must hold steadily in view their ultimate independence, and we must move toward the time of that independence as steadily as the way can be cleared and the foundations thoroughly and permanently laid. OUTLOOK FOR ALASKA—The people of Alaska should be given the full territorial form of government, and Alaska, as a store house, should be unlocked. One key to it is a system of rail ways. These the government should itself build and administer. PROTECTION FOR WORKMEN—Our bureau of mines ought to be equipped and empowered to render more effective service in improving the condition of mine labor. We owe it in mere justice to the railway employes of the country to provide for them a fair and effective employers' liability act. Rebels Capture Tuxpam; Hold English Oil Fields BULLETIN MEXICO CITY, Dec. 2—The Tarahumare Indians* .heretofore friendly to the federals, have, gone on the warpath and joined the rebels.
