President, Trustee. jmsion, jiasa., uocemDer I, 1917, Probably In no week alnce tha ifnlted States entered the war did events of i such prime Importance to the financial 1 markets move 'so swiftly ss In the week just closed. Beginning on Monday with the reconvening of Congress new de velopments crowded one another and left the stock market In a state of con fusion. Tet for all this It waa orderly, though constantly contracting from the viewpoint of business and becoming more and more unimportant aa to' price movements. News which naturally would have made for a more cheerful feeling was overshadowed and little Im pression was made by factors which un der ordinary circumstances would have affected the market. Tha result was a series of alow, dragging sessions, void not only of public Interest, but of pro fessional as well, with the trend down ward where purely local influences were not at work. Of first Importance waa the construc tive nature of the recommendations of tha Interstate Commerce commission. Not less Important waa tha fact that the President himself 'assumed leadership of the constructive policy toward the rail roads, it has long bean evident that a broad view was the only solution of the problem. Tha railroad managers them selves confessed this In Uralr hearings before tha interstate Commerce ' Com mission relative to Increased freight rates. Many intricate questions remain to be settled before tha carriers will be gin to feel tha relief, but what is most Important Just now is the fact that the commission and the administration have officially recognised that the carriers are breaking down under the strain and that something more than a mere advance In freight rates Is necessary to bring them up to the highest standard ot efficiency. Qoesttoa Became Too Btsr. The whole Question has been too big for digestion In the market "Except for one favorable spurt, speculative Wall Street watched each new development with special Interest, Aa a matter of fact, the whole problem Is etlll in too In definite a stage to reflect judgment one way or the other. Congress has been asked to decide which of two alterna tives it thinks will best meet tbe prob lem, and either one ot them appears fa vorable from tha standpoint ot the stockholders. But what tha financial district Is ask ing Itself Is. Will Congress recognize the necessity of Immediate action? What will tho measure look like when it posses both houses of Congress? What will Congress say Is a fair return on the outstanding stocks and bonds of the rail roads? What will be the extent of the financial ' relief? It Is this last Question that is worry' Ing the railroads mora than anything else. They .will be confronted next year with the necessity of refinancing a great volume. of maturing obligations. It is probable that many of the strong roads could find refinancing means In soma manner, but what ot roads like the New Ilaven, Erie, AcT It would be hard Just now to sell any kind of a railroad note. not to speak or long term bonds. Hardly leas weighty la the question of purchasing new equipment It la ac knowledged that the carriers are much In need of further rolling stock to meet the heavily Increased volume of freight which is being moved toward tho sea board, and with Increasing operative costs already eating heavily Into their net revenues, the possibility of satisfy Ing then needs under present conditions is remote, to say the least. Though pleasing In general terms to the financial district. President Wilson'ji message to Congress has added to tin uncertainty tn one respect His clear cut definition or the war alms of this coun try, however, was widely approved, for It cleared op any doubt there may have been as to the possibility of an early peace, wnai maae ror uncertainty was the President's words on price flxInK. This haa been further Increased by re ports irom wasnington that the Federal Trade Commission considers Its Investi gation Into the steel and Conner situ atlon has been totally disregarded, and tnai me investigation should ho made the oasis or new schedules.

Whether It Is the purpos of the Gov ernment to use this basis to fix flew schedules for steel and copper prices at the conference In Washington this week Is a matter of conjecture But the fact ts, however, the situation Is hanclnc heavily over tho market ns well aa over the trade, and there ta bound to be more or less uncertainty In this respect cither until new scneauics are announced or It has been officially stated that present schedules stand. It Is no secret either that steps will be taken In other direc tions In price fixing during the cresent session. This waaIn effect what Presi dent Wilson advocated In his message. There was ,much rood ror thought In Secretary McAdoo's annual report In connection with the stabilization of In vestments. How closely related the rail road problem Is with this proposition may be gleaned from the fact the sav ings banks nnd Insurance companies are among tho largest holders of railroad eecurltle In the country. Some of tho securities held by savings banks and Insurance companies havo depreciated to proportions where It might bo said their nssets are endangered. Legal protection of the dividends on such securities un doubtedly would dovmuch to relieve this situation. No doubt the continuation of low rates on Government borrowings would prevent further depreciation of such securities, ss Mr. McAdoo points out, but Important Interests find It hard to see Just how much more money can be raised at 4 per cent ' Both Issues of Liberty bonds are now selling on the Stock Exchange under par, and admittedly it would be a dif ficult, task to sell another large block.! ot them to the public at par so long ast they can be purchased cheaper In the open market, it will be necessary, accord ing to the latest estimate, to raise some thing like 18,500,000,000 for the prose cution of the war In the remaining months ot the current fiscal year. Part of this will be forthcoming from thk sale ot war savings stamps and certifi cates', part from certificates of Indebted ness, but at least $5,000,000,000 must come from the sale of long term bonds. If it Is possible to float this many mora bonds at 4 per cent. It would make nearly 19,000,000,000 outstanding of this particular series. War News Has Little EfCeot.
