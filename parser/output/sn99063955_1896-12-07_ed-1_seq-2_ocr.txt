I " . J" 5& Daily Capital Journal. BY HOPBR BROTHKR9. MONDAY, DEC. 7, 1890. THE SILVER REPUBLICANS. Our extreme sound money republi can friends must not get excited too much, and attempt to kick all the former "free silver Republicans" out of the party. They may .be needed fnrtwinninir future victories. It was the spirit of conciliation In the June campaign and throughout the fall con test that laid the sure foundations of the victory that was accomplished on November 3d. Thcstateof Washing ton furnishes a striking contrast in the disastrous consequence or the opposite policy. There is no reason why nil the men in Oregon who mie been loyal icpublicans in the past may not be true members! of lh.it pirty In the future. -Salem States man Doc. 0. PREPARED Activity at the Navy-Yard. Warships Being Prepared for Pos sible Trouble With Spain. ICEO We arc In receipt of many letters from Silver Republicans from all parts or the state asking what shall be their future party alignment in the legisla ture and state politics? That depends -not on whether the McKlnley Gold standard Republicans are willing to take them into the party, but on the actual work done for economy and promised reforms In the coming legislature and by the present Republican state administra tion. The lower house in 1893, where a majority were against goldbug corpor ation ring-rule, spent $3,500 for cler ical expense of CO members, while the ring-ruled senate under Simon, Mc Ginn, etal,, spent 813,000 for clerks, etc.. for 30 members. Silver Republicans are Republicans from principle' and because bimetal lism and protection to American in dustries have been cardinal principles of the Republican party. But a flnau ical system for the Wall street gold trust and a tariff for the other trusts, syndicates and combinations they re pudiate. By thoir leaders in state affairs and in the legislature the sil ver Republicans have shown that they stand for reform, for retrench ment, and economy; that they are op posed to ring rule, centralization of political power at Portland and for pure primaries and honest elections. They will act with Republicans to secure these ends, but they will not refuse to act with any man who will help to secure these ends. Sliver Republicans fought the bat tles of the people in the last legisla ture, In the primaries last spring and at the polls In November and have no apologies tooffer for standing bysthelr principles. What of the future? We believe they will make the same record with others of the same views in the com ing legislature that they made two years ago. "Wo believe their numbers will be larger and they will accom plish more. The course of D. P. Thompson and the members of the state board of equalization in lopping off nil useless expenditures is signifl- of their porpose to light the to a finish in Oregon. The course of Secretary of State Kin caid in compelling nil Institutions, and commission .and departments, to have thoirjprlntlng and other per quisites paid for out of their own ap propriations' as far as possible, will work a great reform in the enormous expenditures of the state printing and binding. And so in all lines of expense by the state. Silver Repub licans will be found true to their principles. In the coming session of the legisla ture silver Republicans will bo found voting for an organization of both houses in the interest of economy and reform." Falling to get such an organization they will still battle as individuals for such legislation as will bo in tho true interest of the people. Philadelphia, Doc. 0. League Island navy-yard Is a scene of unusual bustle and activity. All the monitors that have been moored' In the back channel are In the best condition, and ready at a few days' notice to go into active service. The stores for all or them are at the island, and they need only to be st iclccd to go to sea. There is a great deal of secrecy as to what is being done with the dynamite cruiser Vesuvius. Orders have been given that she must be in readiness to leave in live days. All her stores are ready for her. Every particle of her machinery has been oiled, and the men on board of her have been told to "keep their mouths shut.'' One or her oitlcers says chat if she has the opportunity she will surprise the world in the way of maritime warfare. The Puritan, likewise, is being ar ranged so that she will be ready to s:ill when orders come. Every effort is being made to put the Brooklyn in the "best possible shape to go Into active service, and it is known that orders ofth is kind come from the secretary of the. navy. 'What! does all this mean?" was asked of an olllcial whose relations with the navy department is sucli as to give good effect to his opinion. '1 will tell you plainly," he replied, "that we believe there Is going to be trouble with Spain It won't last long, of course, but every order issued in the past live months has indicated such a condition. There has never b.eu in the history of League island such a supply of stores as is now there. It includes, among other things, ma terial that Is seldom thought of in time of peace." Open Filibustering. Jacksonville, Fla., Dec. 0. The Cuban delegate here has received a re quest from General Maceo for a large supply of arms and ammunition and medicines to be senthim immediately. The Dauntless and the Three Friends will leave for Cuba at once with the supplies. "So attempt has been made at secrecy, and the United States marshal has been informed that the Three Friends will carry a cargo of munitions of war to Cuba. Mr. Bans, the owner, goes to "Wash ington at once toinfonn the attorney- general that he has contracted to land a cargo on the coast or Cuba, and will demand that his vessel be es corted there by a Uulted States war ship, He Insists that under the rul ing of the supreme court of the United States In the Ilorsa case the carrying of arms on the unarmed vessel is not a violation of the law. The Dauntless will take on her cargo of arms at Gallillc. The Commodore will leave for Cuba with arms. Col onel Nunez, of the Cuban junta, is now in Jacksonville, directing the movements of the expedition. Wm. F. Beak, who has been con nected with the bank of Ladd & Bush of Salem for many years, left Sunday night for England, where he will join his father,iChas. Beak, at one time a resident of this city. After visiting at the parental home for a time, Mr. Beak intends to go to Cape Colony, South Africa. cant boodle forces wm nfl fcrd I nirarj Against Fees.

Who have frequent .fits of melancholy with- ggfll out any apparent & causer uut mere W is a cause. It is t6 be found by the in telligent physician in some derangement of the complicated and delicate feminine organs of generation. The woman who half understands herself, feels that she cannot always be complaining; she can not always have the doctor in the house. The young girl suffers, bodily and men tally, in silence. The trouble usually comes so jgradually it is attributed to some outside cause. There is undue weariness, nexpected pain, unreason able tears and fits of temper. All these symptoms are simply protests of the silent, long-suffering nerves. The trouble shows in dark circles below the eyes, a downward curve of the mouth, a sallow, brownish-yellow neck. Unregarded, the trouble grows. A few years of tortured invalidism, probably insanity, before merciful death comes. Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription is the fruit of years of study. It is the product of an investigating mind united with a generous nature. When an intelligent person gives years of study to a subject there must be some good result. The "Favorite Prescription" is a compound of extracts of herbs that makes n strengthening, soothing medicine. It acts directly upon the distinctly feminine organs. It stops drains from liniug membranes by healing diseased parts, thereby curing also the inflammation that is always present, "I wi in a critical condition. Often I was in despair. I experienced a great improvement by taking one bottle of Dr. i'lerce'a Favorite Pre scription. I have taken six bottles, and I am sure that It will not only cure ulceration but alt diseases of females." Yours truly, NeapoUvyirBinU.' Broke Through the Trocha. Said to Be on His Way to Meet Gomez. .TACKBONVILLEjFlll.,DeC. 7. A Citl-i zen speclcal from Key Wost says; A Spanish olllcer who passed through on the Olivette tonight re ports that General Maceo.with a band of 000 men, succeeded In breaking through the trocha, and will meet General Gomez in Havana province. Maceo left General Rio Rivera In charge of his forces in PlnardelRio province. Maceo goes to get tho as sistance of Gomez to help the Insur gent army in Pihar del Rio. From passengers on the Oil vctte.de- tails of the successful raid of tho in surgents on Guanabaca.across the bay from Havana, were received. The raid took place on Tuesday night, and the Spanish outposts near Havana and Marino have been attacked nightly since. The greatest excitement still exists In Havana, and in the suburbs of the city. In Tuesday's raid, the In surgents captured a large number of pack mules and a dozen horses, and a large quantity of munitions of war. About 45 houses were burned. The commander has been severely repri manded for his feeble resistance. Hundreds of families are leaving Guanabaca for Havana. Has Not Lsft Cuba. Cincinnati, Dec. ". A.commercial Tribune special from Jacksonville, Fla., says: A telegram from Havana was pub lished here today that Maceo had lied from Cuba to the United States to avoid a conflict with Weylcr. M. Hyau, the leading member of the Cuban circle here, said tonight. "I have heard from Maceo direct within the past day or two, and know that Maceo Is all right. A captain on his staff was here yesterday, direct from Maceo's camp. He stated to me that Maceo could hold the hills for eight months or longer against Wey lcr, and all his army. He has his cattle well hid and provided for, has farms and vegetable gardens, and, above all, faithful and honest soldiery. He has a good supply of arms and am munition, and is generally in good condition to hold his own against Weyler. I am in a position to know that Maceo does not intend leaving Cuba yet awhile. When he goes it will be In a coffin. Maceo will never desert his country, ne is watching Weyler, and ere long the latter lind that Maceo is yet in Cuba." Critical Time For Spain. New York, Dec. 7.

Mr. Bryan and the ireat loyal and true Anieit- can party of which he is the ackowl ledgcd leader, take defeat, as become loyal Americans who love their coun try and Its grand institutions. While we do" not agree with the policy set forth by the Republicans in their national platform to bring about permanent relief, we are willing to give them a hearty support In the ap plication of any plan which they think will bring about prosperity to the discouraged rank and tile or our debt ridden and distressed workers. Let us be on hand to assist the incoming administration to apply their panacea for our grievous finan cial ills and still maintain their mon ometallic or gold standard system. While we greatly doubt their ability to bring about the prosperity which they -have promised so freely, we will not put a straw in their way, for it is due to them that they have a fair op portunity; then should they fall they will be called in 1900 to stand out of the way of the adyanclng hosts of reformers augmented fiom the ranks of those who voted to give them an other chance to bring about their promised prosperity. No administration ever has had a more difficult task before it; none will ever be watched more closely, more held to a stricter account, not only by those who do not agree with their platform, but by very many 'who voted with them believing In their fair promises and especially in their prog nostications of dire calamities if McKinley was defeated.

Most of the wheat In storage is in small quantities Intense anxiety is felt by all classes concerning whr.t President Clevel and and well scattered among the farmers. may say in his message about Cuba andsubsequent action by the Ameri can congress. In olllcial circles this! anxiety, though suppressed, is even keener than it Is In unofficial quar ters. Most of the Spanish concerva tives perceive that many people in Spain are inclined to believe that if President ,; Cleveland's language is sufficiently conciliatory to pave the way for an understanding between Spain and the United -States for an honorable settlement, implying no in fringement of Spanish sovereignty in Cuba, such an impression probably will bo made on the public mind and the court itself as may induce Queen Christiana to change tho present war and repressiye policy in Cuba for a more liberal one. The government will allow no dem onstration when the news from tho United States arrives, and the au thorities are instructed to act ener getically.
