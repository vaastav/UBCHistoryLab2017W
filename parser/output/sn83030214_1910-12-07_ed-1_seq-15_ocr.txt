Dec 6. — President Taft's ' message read to both houses of Con- j gress --day is as follows: : To the Senate and House of Representa tives: During the la.=t year the foreign relations , rf th« United State? have continued upon a J basis of friendship and good understanding. J Arbitration. : Th» r*ar has been notable as -witnessing j th«» pa.cif.~ settlement of two Important j <• Vernal conirovt rsies before the Per- j T»-!*n«_t Court of The Hasnie- ; The arbitration of the Bakeries dispute he- J tw*»n ttoe United States and Great Britain, j which has been the source of nearly con- j tirjuou?. diplomatic correspondence since the ] Fisheries Convention of

As Secretary of State Mr. Root had given j close rtudy to the, intricate facts bearing j «m the controversy, and by diplomatic cor- j respondent* had helped to frame the issues, j Al the solicitation of the Secretary of State j «nd myself. Mr. Root, though bur -d by liis duties as Senator from New York, i undertook the preparation of the case as j leaning counsel, with the condition 1m- j voscd by himself that in view of his posi- ; tion as Senator he should not receive any compensation. The tribunal constituted a- The Hague by the governments of the United States and Venezuela has completed its deliberations, s-d has rendered an award in the case of the Orinoco Steamship Company against Venezuela. The award may be regarded as satisfactory since it has. pursuant to the contentions of the United States, recog nized a number of important principles making: for a judicial attitude in the deter mining of international disputes. International Prize Court. T-n ciew of grave doubts which had been r»!«p«J as to the constitutionality of the JTaz-ue Convention Tor the establishment of an international prize court, now before lire Senate for ratification, because of that provision of the convention which provides that there may be an appeal to the pro posed court from the decisions of national limits, this government proposed in an identic circular note addressed to those pr-wprs who had taken part in the London Maritime Conference. That the powers placatory to the convention, if confronted tritn such difficulty, might insert a reser vation to the effect that appeals to the JnteTnatir>nal prize court in respect to de cisions of its national tribunals should take the form of a dirert claim for compensa tion: that the proceedings thereupon to be Taken should V in the form, of a trial de novo, and that Judgment of the court F^CJifl consist -of compensation for the illegal capture, irrespective of the decision cf the national court whose judgment had thus b«»n internationally involved. As the result of an Informal discussion it was de rMed to provide such procedure by means *■■' p separate protocol which should be ratified at the same time as the prize court ,-onvertion itself. Accordingly, the. government of the Neth erlands, at xJie request of this government, rropc?-?'! under <ia?e. of Kay 24. 1310. to •n « pmmi signatory t<< the Hasru'.: Con rmtion. th« negotiation «f a supplemental protocol embodying stipulations providing for this alternative procedure. It is grati fying to observe that this additional pro tocol is beinpr signed without objection by the powers signatory to the original con- T«ention. and that there is every reason to believe that the ir. •'-•■*• ati'T.a; nrize court ■*•:'] he soon e^tabiislied. Th» identic circular note also reposed that tb« international prize roun when uKabliFbed should be, endowed with the functions of an Arbitral Court of Justice dbdef and puWtiant to the recommendation «.dopt«*J by the la_«=t Haaruc Conference. Tlw replies received from the various pom-era to this proposal inspire the hope that this also may be accomplished within i h« reasonably near future.

A preliminary diplomatic $to-J)irtf( efy|gjg||gg| 2Mb WfiL agreement has been reached regarding the ration of pecuniary claims which each government has against the other. This agreement, with the schedules of claims arnexed. will, as soon as the schedules are arranged, be submitted to the Senate for approval. An agreement between the United States and Great Britain with regard to the lo cation of the international boundary line between the United States and Canada in P&ssamaquo«ldy Bay and to the. middle Of Grand Mahan Channel was reached in a Treaty concluded May 21. 1910, which has been ratified by both governments and proclaimed, thus making unnecessary the arbitration provided for in the previous treaty of April 11, 1908. The convention concluded January 11, 1303, between the United States and Great Britain providing for the settlement of in ternational differences between the United States and Canada, including the appor tionment between the two countries of cer tain of the boundary waters and the ap pioßCsneHt of commissioners to adjust cer tain other questions has been ratified by both governments end proclaimed. The work of the International Fisheries Commission appointed in 1908, under the treaty of April 11, 1908, between Great Britain and the United States, has resulted in the formulation and recommendation of uniform regulations governing the fisheries of the boundary waters of Canada and the United States for the purpose of protecting and increasing the supply of food fish in such waters. In completion of this work, the regulations asreed upon require Con gressional legislation to make them effec tive and for their enforcement in fulfill ment of the treaty stipulations. Portugal. Tti October last the monarchy in Portu gal was overthrown, a provisional repub lic was proclaimed, and there was set up a de facto government which was prompt ly recognized by the government of the United States for purposes of ordinary in tercourse pending 1 formal recognition by this and other powers of the governmental entity to be duly established by the na tional sovereignty. Liberia. A disturbance among- the native tribes of Liberia in a portion of the republic dur ing the early part of this year resulted in the sending, under the Treaty of ISC of an American vessel of war to the dis- ' affected district, and the Liberian authori ties, assisted by the good offices of the American naval officers, were able to re store order. The negotiations which have been undertaken for the amelioration of the conditions found in Liberia by the American Commission, whose report I transmitted to Congress on March 25 last, are being brought to conclusion, and ii is thought that within a short time practical measures of relief may be put into effect through th»» good offices of this govern ment and the cordial co-operation of other governments Interest - in Liberia's wel fare. THE 

NEAR EAST. Turkey. { To return the visit of the special em ii.is.sy sent to announce the a cession of his majesty Mehemet V. Emperor of the Ottomans. I Bent to Constantinople a 1 * 3 : cial ambassador, who, in addition to this mission of ceremony, was charged with the duty of expressing to the Ottoman government the value attached by the government of the United States to in creased and more important relation? be tween the countries and the desire of the United States to contribute to the larger economic and commercial development due to the new regime in Turkey. The rapid development now beginning in that ancient empire and the marked prog ress and creased commercial importance of Bulgaria. Rumania and Servia make, it particularly opportune that the possibili ties of American commerce in the Near East should receive due attention. • Montenegro. I The National Skoupchtina having ex pressed its will that the principality of Montenegro be raised to the rank of king ■ dom, the Prince of Monti negro on August j ■'. last assumed the title of King of Monte ' negro. It gave me pleasure to accord to the new kingdom th«- reojrnition Of the 1 United States. THE FAR EAST. The centre of int-rr:' :n Far Eastern affairs during the last year has again been China. It is gratifying to .•.••■ thai the negoti ations for a loan to the Chinese government for the construction of th» trunk railway lines from Hankow southward to Canton land westward through the Yangtse Valley. I kno«n as The Ilukuang loan were conclud jed by 'he representatives of the various i financial groups in May last, and the re ' suits approved by their respective govern ments. The agreement, already initiated by the Chinese government, is no* await ing formal ratification. The basis of the settlement of the terms of this loan was one of exact equality between America. Great Britain, France and Germany in re spect to financing the loan and supplying materials for the propose.} railways and j their future bran- The application of the principle underly ' ing the. policy of the United States in re i gard to the Hukuang loan-viz., that of the internationalization of Hi" foreign interest In fucli of the railways of China a- many i be. financed iv foreign countries--, was eug i gested on a broader scale by the Secretary : of State in a proposal for internationaliza 1 tion ai d commercial neutralization of all the railways of Manchuria. White the principle which lea to the proposal of this government was generally admitted by the powers to whom it was, addressed, the gov ernments of Russia and Japan apprehended practical difficulties in the execution of ' , larger plan which prevented their ready adherence. The question of constructing ♦he Chinchow-Aigun Railway by means of an international loan to China is, however. | m:\V-VORK, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 7. 1910. still the subject, of friendly discussion by the Interested parties. American Capital in China. The policy of this government in these mattery has been directed by a desire to make the use of American capital in the development of China an instrument in the promotion, of China's welfare and material prosperity without prejudice to her legiti mate rights as an independent political power. This policy has recently found further exemplification in the assistance Riven by this government to the negotiations be tweea CTiina and a group of American bankers for a loan of $50,000, to be employed chiefly in currency reform. The confusion which has from ancient times existed in the monetary usages of the Chi nese has been one of the principal obstacles !o commercial intercourse with that people. The United States in its treaty of 1903 with China obtained a pledge from the lat ter to introduce a uniform national coinage, ami the following year, at the request of China, this government sent to Peking a member of the International Exchange Commisssion. to discuss with the Chinese government the best methods of introducing the reform. In 1908 China sent a com missioner to the United States to consult with American financiers as to the possi bility of securing a large loan with which to inaugurate the new currency system, but the, death of their majesties the Empress Dowager and the Emperor of China Inter rupted the negotiations, which wen- not re sumed until a few months ago, when this government was asked to communicate to the bankers concerned the request of China for a loan of $50,000,000 for the purpose under review. A preliminary agreement between the American group and China has been made covering the loan. For the success of this loan and the con templated reforms, which are of the great est importance to the commercial interests of the United States and the civilized world at large, it is realized that an expert will be necessary , and this government has re ceived assurances from China that such an adviser, who shall be an American, will be engaged. It Is a matter of interest to Americans to note Cue success which is attending the efforts of < 'hica to establish gradually a system of representative government. The provincial assemblies were opened in < (c tober, iyo9. and in October of the present year a consultative body, the nucleus of the future national parliament, held its first session at Peking. Russia, Japan and Corea. The year has further been marked by two important international agreements relating to Far Eastern affairs. In the Russo-Jap anese agreement relating to Manchuria, : July 4, 1970. this government was gratified to note an assurance of continued peaceful conditions in that region and the reaffirmation of the policies with respect to C"hina to which the United States, together with all other interested powers, are alike solemnly committed. The treaty annexing Corea to the Empire of Japan, promulgated A igust -h 191'?. marks the final step in a process of control of the ancient empire by her powerful or that has been in progress for sev eral years past. In communicating the fact of annexation the Japanese government gavM to the government of the United States assurances of the full protection of the rights of American citizens in Corea under the changed conditions. Friendly visits ot many distinguis ed persons from the Far East have been made during the year. Chief among these were their imperial highnesses Princes Tsai tao and Tsai-Hsun of China, and his rm perial highness Prince Higashi Fushinii and Prince Tokusrawa. President of the House of Peers of Japan. The Secretary of War has recently visited Japan and China in connection with his tour to the Philippines. and a larz<- delegation of American busi ness men are at present travelling In China.. This exchange of friendly visits has had the nanny effect of even further strength ening our friendly international relations. 

LATIN AMERICA. During the past year several of our Southern sister republics celebrated the one hundredth anniversary of their inde pendence. In honor of these events, special embassies were Pent from this country to Argentina. Chile and Mexico, where the gracious reception and splendid hospitality extended them manifested the cordial re lations and friendship existing between these countries and the United States, re lations which I am happy to believe have never before been upon so high a plane and bo solid a basis as at present. The Congressional corr: mission appointed under a concurrent resolution to attend the festivities celebrating the centennial anni versary of Mexican independence, together with a special ambassador, were received with . the highest honors and with the greatest cordiality, and returned with the report of tlv bounteous hospitality and warm reception of President Diaz and the Mexican people, which left no doubt of the desire of the immediately neighboring republic to continue the mutually bene ficial and intimate relations which I feel sure the two governments will ever cherish. At the fourth Pan-American Conference, which met in Buenos Ayres during July and August last, after seven weeks of harmonious deliberation, three conventions were signed providing- for regulation of trademarks, patents and copyrights, which when ratified by the different govern ments, will go far toward furnishing to American authors, patentees and owners of trademarks the protection needed in localities where heretofore it has been f-ithfr larking or Inadequate, Further, a convention for the arbitration of pecuniary claims was signed and a number of im portant- resolutions passed. The conven tions will in due course be transmitted to the Senate. -and the report of the delega tion of the L'mted States will be com municated to th- Congress for its informa tion. The special cordiality between rep resentative men from ail parts of America which was shown at this conference can not fai! to react upon and draw still closer the relations between the countries which took part in it. The. International Bureau of American Republics Is doing a broad and useful work for Pan-American commerce an<! comity. Its duties were much enlarged by th« International Conference of American States at Buenos Ayres, and Its name was Bhortenpd to the more practical and ex pressive term of Pan- American .Union. J-o catfrd now in Its new building, which was specially dedicated April "6 nt this year to the development of friendship, trade an.i peace among tlip American nations, it has improved instrumentalities to serve the twenty-two republics of this hemisphere. Boundary Disputes. I am glad to say that the action of the United States in its desire to remove im minent danger of war between Peru and Ecuador growing out of a boundary dis pute, with the co-operation of Brazil and the Argentine Republic as joint mediators with this government, has already resulted successfully in preventing war. The gov ernment of Chili, while not one of the mediators, lent effective aid in furtherance of a preliminary agreement likely to lead on to an amicable settlement, and It is not doubted that th<» pood offlrps of thp mediat ing powers and th»» ronciliatory co-opera tion of the governments directly interested will finally lead to a removal of thi? peren nial cause of friction between Ecuador and Peru. The inestimable, value of rordial co operation between the sister republics of America for the maintenance of peare in this hemisphere has never been more clear ly shown than in this mediation, by which three American povernments have given to this hemisphere the honor of first invoking the most farreachin*? provisions of The Hac'Je Convention for the pacific settlement of international disputes. Them has been signed by the representa tives of the United States and Mexico a protocol submitting to the "United States- Mexk-an Boundary r-ommission (whose membership for The purp°se of this case is to be increased by the addition of a citizen of Canada) the question of sovereignty over tiie Cnamizal Tract, which lies within the present physical boundaries of the city of El Paso, Tex. The determination of this question will remove a source of no little annoyance to the two governments. The Hondufan Debt. The republic of Honduras has for many years been burdened -with a heavy bonded d«bt held in Europe, the interest on which long- ago fell in arrears. Finally conditions were such that it became imperative to re fund the debt and place the finances of the republic upon a sound basis. Last year a group of American bankers undertook to do this and to advance funds for railway and other improvements contributing directly to the country's prosperity and commerce — an arrangement which has long been desired by this government. Negotiations to this end have been under way for more than a j'ear and it is now confidently believed that a short time will suffice to conclude an ar rangement which will be satisfactory to the foreign creditors, eminently advan tageous to Honduras and highly creditable to the judgment and foresight of the Hon duranean government. This is much to be desired, since, as recognized by the Wash ington conventions, a strong Honduras would tend immensely to the progress and prosperity of Central America. The Flight of Zelaya. During thf; last year the republic of Nicaragua has been the scene of inter necine struggle. General Ztlaya. for seven teen years the absolute ruler of Nicaragua, was throughout his career the disturber of Central America and opposed every plan for the promotion of peace and friendly re lations between the five republics. When the people of Nicaragua were rinally driven into rebellion by his lawless exactions, he violated the laws of war by the unwar ranted execution of two American citizens who had regularly enlisted in the ranks of the revolutionists. This and other offences made ft the duty of the American gov ernment to take measures -with a view to ultimate reparation and for the safeguard ing of its interests. This involved the breaking off of all diplomatic relations with the Zelaya government for the reasons laid down in a communication from the Secre tary of State, which also notified the con tending factions in Nicaragua that this government would hold each to strict ac countability for outrages on the rights of American citizens. American forces were sent to both coasts of Nicaragua to be in readiness should occasion arise to protect Americans and their interests, and re mained there until the war was over and pi_-ace had returned to that unfortunate country. These events, together with Zelaya'F continued enactions, brought him so clearly to the bar of public opinion that he was forced to resign and to take refuge abroad. In th« above-mentioned communication of the Secretary of State to the Charge d'Affaires of the Zelaya government the opinion was expressed that the revolution represented the wishes of the majority of the Nicaragnan people. This has now been proved beyond doubt by the fact that since the complete overthrow of the Mad riz government and the occupation of the capital by the forces of the revolution all factions have united to maintain public order, and as a result of discussion with an agent of this government, sent to Man agua at the request of the provisional gov ernment, comprehensive plans are being made for the future we-lfare of Nicaragua, including the rehabilitation of public credit. The moderation and conciliatory spirit shown by the various factions give ground for the confident hop© that Nicar agua will soon take its rightful place among the law-abiding ami progressive countries of the worid. It gratifies me exceedingly to announce that the Argentine republic some months ago placed with American manu facturers a contract for the construction of two battleships and certain additional naval equipment. The extent of this work and its importance to the Argentine Re public- make the placing of th<s bid an ear nest of friendly feeling toward the United i States. 

TARIFF NEGOTIATIONS. The new tariff law, in Section 2. respect ing the maximum and minimum tariffs of the United Spates, which provisions came into effect on. April 1, 1510, imposed upon the President the responsibility of deter mining' prior to that date whether or not any undue discrimination existed against the United States and its products in any country of the world with which we sus tained commercial relations. In the ease of several countries instances <f apparent undue discrimination against 1 American commerce were found to exist. i These discriminations were removed by ne-' j ration. Prior to April 1, 1310, when the I maximum tariff was to come into operation : ■with respect to importations from all those countries in whose favor no proclamation plying the minimum tariff should be is- ■ sued by the President, 134 such proclama tions were issued. This series of proclama | tion.- embraced th» entire commercial world, ami hence the minimum tariff of the United SatttfS has been given universal applica tion, thus testifying to the satisfactory character of our trad« relations with for- I eign countries. Marked advantage." to th» commerce of the United States were obtained through these tariff settlements. Foreign nations are fully cognizant of the fact that under Section - of th" tariff act the- President is recuired, whenever he Is HatiKfied that the treatment accorded by them to the prod ucts of the United States is not .such as to entitle them to the benefits of the mini mum tariff of the United States, to with draw those benefits by proclamation giving ninety days' notice, after which the maxi mum tariff will apply to their dutiable products entering the United .states, in us general operation this section of the tariff law has thus far proved a guaranty of continued commercial peace, although there are, however, unfortunately instances v her- foreign governments deal arbitrarily v. it!: American interests within their juris diction in a manner injurious and inequita ble. Relations with Canada. Th» policy of broader and closer trade relations with the Dominion of Canada which was initiated in the. adjustment of th« maximum and minimum provisions of the tariff act of August. I'JO9. has proved mutually beneficial. It justifies further ef forts for the readjustment of the commer- cial relations of the two countries so that their commerce may follow the channels natural to contiguous countries and be com mensurate with the steady expansion of trade and Industry on both sides of the boundary line. The reciprocation on the pa.rt of the Dominion government «f the sentiment which was expressed by this gov ernment was followed in October by the suggestion that it would be glad to have the negotiations, which had been tempor arily suspended during the summer, re sumed. In accordance with this sugges tion the Secretary of State, by my direc tion, dispatched two representatives of the Department of State as special commission ers to Ottawa to confer with representatives of the Dominion government. They were authorized to take such steps for formulat ing a reciprocal trade agreement as might be necessary and to receive and consider any propositions which the Dominion gov ernment might care to submit. Pursuant to the instructions l??ued con ferences were held by these commissioners with officials of the Dominion government at Ottawa in the early part of November. The negotiations were conducted on both Fidea in a spirit of mutual accommodation. The discussion of the common commercial interests of the two countries had for i'rf object a satisfactory basis for a trade ar rangement which offers the prospect of a freer interchange for the products of the United States and of Canada. The con ferences were adjourned to be resumed in Washington In January, when it is hoped that the, aspiration of both governments for a mutually advantageous measure of reciprocity will be realized. 

DEPARTMENT OF STATE. The Foreign Service, etc. All these tariff negotiations, s-o vital to our commerce and industry, and the duly of jealously guarding the equitable and just treatment of our products, capital and industry abroad, devolve upon the Depart ment of State. The Argentine battleship contract?, like the subsequent Important one for Argentine rail-way equipment, and those for Cuban government vessels, were secured for our manufacturers largely through tiie good of fices of the Department of State. The efforts of that department to secure for citizens of the United States equai op portunities in the markets of the world and to expand American commerce have been most successful. The volume of busi ness obtained in new fields of competition and upon new lines Is already very gTeat, and Congress is urged to continue to sup port the Department of State in its en deavors for further trade expansion. Our foreign trade merits the best support of the government and the most earnest endeavor of our manufacturers and mer chants, who. if they do not already in all cases need a foreign market, are certain soon to become dependent on it. Therefore, now is the time to secure a strong position in thi.-: field. I cannot leave this subject without em phasizing the necessity of such legislation as will make possible and convenient the establishment of American banks and branches of American banks in foreign countries. Only by such means can our foreign trade be favorably financed, neces sary credits be arranged, and proper avail be made of commercial opportunities in for eign countries, and most especially in I.*tin America. The Merchant Marine. r Another instrumentality indispensable to the unhampered and natural development j of American commerce is merchant marine. All maritime and commercial nations rec ognize the importance of this factor. The j greatest commercial nations, our competi [ tors, jealously foster their merchant ma rine. Perhaps nowhere is the need for rapid and direct mail, passenger and freight com munication auite so urgent as between the United States and Latin America. We can secure in no other quarter of the world such immediate benefits in friendship and J commerce as would flow from the estab lishment of direct lines of communication with the countries of Latin America ade quate to meet the requirements of a rapid ly increasing appreciation of the reciprocal dependence of the countries of the Western Hemisphere upon one another" products, sympathies and assistance. I alluded to this most important subject in my last annual message; it has often been before you. and I need not recapitulate the reasons for its recommendation. Unless prompt action be taken the completion of the Panama Canal will find this the only great commercial nation unable to avail in international maritime business of this great contribution to the means of the world's commercial intercourse. Quite aside from the commercial aspect, unless we create a merchant marine where can we find the seafaring population neces sary as a natural naval reserve, and where could we find. In case of war, the trans ports and subsidiary vessels without which a naval fleet is arms without a body? For many reasons I cannot too strongly .urge upon the Congress the passage of a measure by mall subsidy or other subvention ade- j quate to guarantee the establishment and rapid development of an American mer chant marine, the restoration of the Ameri- \ can flatr to its ancient place upon the seas. Of course such aid ought only to be given under conditions of publicity of each beneficiary's business* and accounts which would show that the aid received was needed to maintain the trade and was properly used for that purpose. Rights of Aliens. With our Increasing international inter course it becomes incumbent upon me to j repeat more emphatically than ever the rec ommendation which I made in my Inaugu ral address that Congress shall at once give to the courts of th« United States ! jurisdiction to punish as a crime the viola- j STATEMEXT OP ESTIMATES OF APPROPRIATION'S FOR THE FISCAL TEARS im: AND 1011.

ISS3. and the executive orders of Juno 27. 19O»5. and of November 36. !!*». Civil Service Application. The excellent results which hay» at tended the partial application of Civil Ser vice principles to the diplomatic and con sular service are an earnest of the benefit to be wrought by a wider and more per manent extension of these principles to both branches of the foreism service. The marked improvement in th» consular ser vice during- the four years since the prin ciples of the Civil Service act -were applied to that service in a limited way. and the good results already noticeable from a similar application of Civil Service prin ciples to the diplomatic service- a. year ago, convince me that the enactment into law of the general principles of the exist ing executive regulations could not fail to effect further improvement of both branches of the foreign service, offer-in? as it -would by its assurance of perma nency of tenure and promotion on merit an inducement for the entry of capable young- men into the service and an Incentive to those already in to put forth their best efforts to attain and maintain that degree- of efficiency which the inter ests of our International relations and commerce demand. Ownership of Embassies. During many years past appeals have been made from time to time to Corgress In favor of government ownership of em bassy and legation premises abroad. The arguments In favor of such ownership have been many and oft repeated, and are well known to the Congress. The acquisi tion by the government of suitable resi dences and offices for its diplomatic ofl 1 era. especially in the capitals of the Latin-American states and of Europe, 13 60 important and necessary to an improved diplomatic service that I have no hesita tion in urging- upon the Congress the pas sage of some measure similar to that fa vorably reported by the House Committee on Foreign Affairs on February 14. 1910 (Report No. 438). that would authorize the gradual and annual acquisition of prem ises for diplomatic use. The work of the diplomatic service Is de void of partisanship; Its importance, should appeal to every American citizen and should receive the generous consideration '■ of the Congress. 

TREASURY DEPARTMENT. Estimates for Next Year's Expenses. Every effort has been made by each de partment chief to reduce the estimated cost of his department for the ensuing fiscal year ending June 30, 1312. I say thi.- In order that Congress may understand that these estimates thus made present the smallest sum which will maintain the de partments, bureaus and offices of the gov ernment and meet its other obligations under existing law. and that a cut of these estimates would result in embarrads ing the executive branch of the govern ment in the performance of its duties. This remark does not apply to the river and. barber estimates, except to those for ex penses of maintenance and the meeting of obligations under authorized contracts, nor . - • apply to the public building bill nor to the navy building programme. Of course, as to these Congress could with hold any part or all of the estimates for them without interfering with the dis charge of the ordinary obligations of the \ Kjovermnaajt or the performance of the | functions of its departments, bureaus and I offices. The final estimates for the year ending June 30, 1912, as they have been sent to the Treasury, on November 2> of this year, for the ordinary expenses of the government, including those for public buildings, rivers and harbors and the navy building pro gramme, amount to 434,013 12. This is ££,K4.587 36 less than the appropriations for the fiscal year ending June 30. 1911. It 13 Jlfi,BS3.i;j3 44 less than the total estimates, including supplemental estimates submit ted to Congress by the Treasury for the year 1011. and Is $5,574,659 39 less than the original estimates submitted by the Treas ury for 1911. These figures do not include the appropri ations for the Panama Canal, the policy in respect to which ought to be and hi to spend as much each year as can ba eco nomically and effecuvely expended in ord<*r to complete the canal as promptly as pos sible, and, therefore. Urn "rdinary motive for cutting down the expense of th^ eov ernment does not apply to appropriations for this purpose. It will be noted that t -* !.;?timatps for the Panama Canal for the ensuing year are more than $5^,000,000, an incn-a.~e of JJO.OfIO.OOO over the amount ap propriated for this year— a difference .1 >* to th* Caet that the estimates for 1912 in clude something over $19,000. <"»« fee the forti fication of the ''anal. Against estimated expenditures of J630, 494,013 13 the Treasury has estimated re ceipts for next year of $Gso.oo<\oo<>, making a probable surplus of ordinary receipts over ordinary expenditures of about $50,000. 000, or, taking into account the estimates for the Panama Canal, which are $56,920. 547 63. and which will ultimately be paid in bonds, it will leave a deficit for the next year of about $7,000,900. if Congress shall conclude to fortify the canal. The cost el the fortifications is about $i:>.»>ilrt.3"o. Should there be no appropriations this year far fortifications, then there would ■>», even in cluding the Panama Canal appropriation, a surplus of about $12,000,000. according to the Treasury estimates. A table showing- in detail th<* estimates and the comparisons referred to follows: Monetary System. t The Treasury Department is one of the original departments of the government.

Thw. ar<s six auditors and an— assistant auditors for th# nine de partments, and tinder th*» preset system th« only function whlcrh the auditor of » department exercises is to determine, on accounts presented by diataandn^ odcer*. that the object of the expenditure ww within the law and the appropriation marl* by Concref-s for the pcrpos« on Its face. and that the calculations in the account* are correct.

A careful plan i» betes devised and will te presented to Con gress with th*» recommendation that &+ force of auditors and employes nad«r them be greatly reduced, thereby effecting sub stantial economy. But tats economy wtl* be small compared with tiie larger economy that can be effected by consolidation an« ■• change of methods. The pcsslb£itl«« la thi» regard have been shown In the reduction of expenses and the Importance of methods and efficiency la the oSco of the auditor for the Foatofflce Department, who, without In the slightest degree impairin« th* com prehensiveness and efficiency of Me war*. has cut down. th« expenses of his eat** I $120,000 a year. Improvement in Collections- # Again. In the collection of th» rev-rnoes. especially the c_stom3 revenues, a a— great improvement has been effected, and further improvements are contemplated. By the detection of frauds in weighing sugar up^ar-i of 53.400.000 has h«en recovered from the be_eaciarie3 of th© frantJ. and art entirely new system free from the possibili ties of such abuse has been devised. The department has perfected the method of collecting duties at the Port of New York so as to save the government upward of $10,000,000 cr $11,000,000. and I M same spirit of change and reform has been tn . fused into the other customs office* of the ' country. ! The methods used at many ■!■■ «t% 1 archaic There would seem to be no rea ! son at all why the Surveyor of the Port. ] who really acts for the Collector. sho_M ! not be a subordinate of the Collector at a less salary and directly under his cc__-ot. and there is but little reason for the exist ence of the Naval Officer, who Is a kind of local auditor. His work is mainly an. examination of accounts, which is conduct i ed again in "Washington and which results I In no greater security to the government. The Naval Officers in the various ports ar* Presidential appointees, many of them j Irawing good salaries, and those office* I should be abolished or. with reduced fore*, made part of the central auditing system • There are entirely too many customs d:* 1 tricts and too many customs collector*. ! These distrlcta should be consolidated and the collectors in charge of them, who dra* good salaries, many of them out of propor tion to the collections made, should >* abolished or treated aa mere branch offices. in accordance with the plan of the Treas ury Department, which win be present*^ for the consideration of Congress. As an illustration, the cost of collecting $1 of revenue at typical srraJl ports like, the Port of York. Me., was $50 04. At the Port of Annapolis it cost $303 41 to collect Jt of revenue: at Natchez. $52 76; at Alexandria. Va., .5122 43. Violation of Customs Laws. It is not essential to the preventing of smuggling that custom^ districts should be increased In number. The violation of th customs laws can be quite as easily pre vented, and much more economically, by the revenue cutter service and by the us* of the special agent travelling force of the Treasury Department. A reurganUatian of the special customs agents has beea per fected with a view to retaining only those who have special knowledge of the eastern.'' law:*. regulations and usual methods of evasion, and with this improvement then* will be no danger to the government from the recommended consolidation antl aboli tion of customs districts. An investigation of the appraising sys tem now In vogue in New York City haa shown underappraisement and a sac- of the Interests of the government, which fs tn the course of being remedied by reorganiza tion and the employment of competent ex perts. Prosecutions have been Instituted growing out of th* frauds there - vorea. and ar - now awaiting hearing la the fed eral courts. Very great Improvements have been dad* in respect to the mints and assay oSlces. Diminished appropriations have been asked far those whose continuance is unneces sary, and this year's estimate of expenses is $326,i»«> less than two years ago. Ther* is an opportunity for further savia? la th* abolition of several mint 3 and assay office* that have now become unnecessary. LHirtng the last year one hundred unnecessary em ployes have been dropped from the Phila delphia Mint, ilodera machinery has been Installed there, more and better work has been done, and the appropriations ha-e been consequently diminished. In the Bureau of Engraving and Prtatfeai great economies have beer, effected. Use less divisions have b**en abolished, with th* result of saving
