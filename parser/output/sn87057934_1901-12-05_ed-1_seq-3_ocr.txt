A strange story, with cooling and refreshing features, is told by a Vinal Haven citizen, a man whose "word is as good as his bond." On the morning of July 13, he arose early and at about 4 o'clock he went into his field to mow. The grass was wet with dew and the air was crisp and cool, but not cold enough for the forming of ice or frost. He had mowed but a few minutes when he thought it beBt to whet the scythe and to his surprise found it covered by a thin coat of ice for about afoot from the end where the scythe is fastened on the snath. He rubbed off the ice with his hand and resumed work. After mowing for ten or fiften minutes he found the snath again coated. He remov ed the ice and proceeded with his work and the third time the ice ap peared. He can in no way account for this, unless it was caused by the rapid motion of the scythe as it swung through the cool morning air, causing rapid evaporation.â Kennebec (Me.) Journal.
