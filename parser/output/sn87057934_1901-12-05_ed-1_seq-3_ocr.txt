But Christ said: Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of heaven." These comforting words convey the blessed assurauce that this, their beloved daughter, dying as she had lived, in the faith of a blessed im mortality, is today rejoicing among the angels in "That heavenly man sion, that house not made with hands," where she awaits their glad reunion. Minnie was a bright and loving girl, just budding into young womanhood, a favorite among her young associates and loved by all. The funeral services were conducted by her pastor, the Rev. Father Failenschmid, from Saint Boniface church who, in well chosen words, described the char acter of the deceased and depicted in eloquent terms the home to which she was borne on angel wings and accompanied by heaven ly anthems of rejoicing.

A strange story, with cooling and refreshing features, is told by a Vinal Haven citizen, a man whose "word is as good as his bond." On the morning of July 13, he arose early and at about 4 o'clock he went into his field to mow. The grass was wet with dew and the air was crisp and cool, but not cold enough for the forming of ice or frost. He had mowed but a few minutes when he thought it beBt to whet the scythe and to his surprise found it covered by a thin coat of ice for about afoot from the end where the scythe is fastened on the snath. He rubbed off the ice with his hand and resumed work. After mowing for ten or fiften minutes he found the snath again coated. He remov ed the ice and proceeded with his work and the third time the ice ap peared. He can in no way account for this, unless it was caused by the rapid motion of the scythe as it swung through the cool morning air, causing rapid evaporation.— Kennebec (Me.) Journal.

BUILD NEW TRUNK LINE. Clark and Walsh Connected With Im portant Railway Deal. Denver, Dec. 2.—The Post says: Senator William A. Clark of Montana and Thomas F. Walsh of Colorado have, it is rumored, joined issues in railroad construction and will build practically a new transcontinental railroad. The Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific is said to be in with Sen ator Clark and Mr. Walsh. The new' transcontinental line would give Sen ator Clark an outlet for his Los An geles and Salt Lake City road, which has been left without one through the absorption of the two Colorado moun tain lines by George Gould. The Rock Island would get a new and short route to California. tf I President Roosevelt in his message pays a generous tribute to President MeKinley, then, turns to the subject of anarchy, denouncing its doctrines and preachers. Great combinations of capital, he declares, have come to stay and the present problem is one of regulation. Publicity regarding their operations is necessary to intel ligent control.
