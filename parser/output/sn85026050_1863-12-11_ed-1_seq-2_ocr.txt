The news from East Tennessee is of the most invigorating character, and infinitely more inj porta nt than would have been a victory almost anywhere else. Long.itrect'a forces made a si multaneous attack on Burnside's Works on the 39th ult, and were repulsed at all points with great loss estimated as high aa 300 killed and 700 wounded, while the Union loss waa but 29 In killed and wounded. Longstrcet then raised the seige, and is in full retreat, hotly pursued by our cavalry. Thus, East Tennessee is ours, we trust forever. Our possession of it makes the military subjugation of all that section of country only a question of time. For this vie tory, we are indebted in the main to Oen. Burs aide, who alone planned tha defence of Knox- illo. 

UNITED STATES 5-20 BONDS. The following extract from the Philadelphia North American contains sound views of a sub ject of national importance, and should be spread beforo the people throughout the land, as well calculated to encourage them in the pres ent, aud inspire the in with confidence in the future; and as it is also admirably adapted to promote the object of the advertisement given in another column, to which wa invite th at tention of readers: PROFITABLE INVESTMENTS. "Though money temporarily scarce, capital continue abundant: and the reoent tumble in tbe lock market has brought capitalists to a realizing sense of the rinreliable character of many of the securities dealt in. Jt la greatly to ttie cretm oi me uoveroment that ila loana, ol all tne securities aany aealt In on the market, have maintained their int,-giity of price better than al most anything else. Its Five-Twenty year aiz percent, loan, tiie Interest of which it promptly paid in gold, haa been subscribed to, al) through the pleasure in the mou sy market, at an average of more than two mtilionaper day. Aud what ia not the least gratifying fact in con nection with the dally large aubscriptlona to this popa lar loan, acarcely any of it ia returned to the market for sale. It ia taken for investment, sod il held with unfal tering confidence in lta reliability. And why should it notber It is seen that the (Jovernment now, after two years of the most gigantic war that the world has ever known, experiences no dilhVulty in commanding the nec essary muana to prosecute it, or in paying regularly the Interest In gold as It falls due. If thia can be done while the war ia being waged, who can tnticinate any dilBcnlty in readily accomplishing it when the war snail oe endear v n.n oeiter investment then, for cap! tal than the -Five-Twenty" Government loanf But if any doubt, let him refer to the statistics furnished by the ceuiui tames ui iu variona nations oi me world. Tlx facts which they present will prove of the most satisfac tory mode of dispelling the numberleas gloomy annrehen. aiona which are being continually conjured up by those who are disposed to exagerate the extent of the calamity occasioned by our rebellion. A reference to the state of mostof the prosperous nationa of the old world clearly disproves luch a position, and shows that the klgheat eonumons oi naiiot si advancement nave not oeen mate rially taunted by tit extended wars in which those na tions have been Immemorially engaged, and that a heavy national indebtedness haa not proved an unmitigated evil. . "for Instance, Great Britain, France and the Nether lands will undoubtedly be conceded to represent the high est prosperity that has bt.en attained by any of the Eu ropean nation. And yet no nationa have been called up on to endure Sereer or more prolonged wars.domestle and foreign, than they. The etlect has been, unquestionably, to incuran enormous national Indebtedness; but neither their wars nor their Indebtedness have had the effect to destroy their elasticity, nor to check the progress of their general prosperity, rne result would have been dilfer ent, probibly, il these nations had been falling into de cay, instead of being, aa they really were, in a state of development; ana mints respect inelr care resembles our own with enormous advantages in our favor. These na tions, while undergoing the trials of war, were oppressed by the evils of an Immense exodus ef i heir people, caused by the density of their populanion, the Impossibility to rrovide occupation for them, the low price of labor, and the scarcity of territory. Compaied with our own coun try, they possessed slight room forfuture developement; they were nettled in every part, and no vast territory lay Invitingly open to encourage enterprise sad settlement. Their great problem baa ever been what to do with their nrplos population, whioh, la its turn, haa sought new fields for adventure and self-support in countries like our own, where an illimitable territory waits to be developed, and where localculable resources Invite Industry sad en ergy. The encouragement to be derived from these facts and comparisons of circumstances is very great, and to the mind of any dispassionate reaaoner is conclusive that the course of this great country la onward and upward, sad that ita credit will live unimpaired to the sod." The Noble County Conspirators. The motion fur a new trial of the Noble coun ty conspirators was overruled by Judge Leavitt. The culprit Hacer waa fined $1,000 and costs, and stand committed until paid. Fen en aud Coy le were fined $500 each and cosla. The coses of these Noble county Copperheads noma prove a warning to all who are disposed to violate the acts of Congress, in conspiring to res isr, ny lorce tne warrants ana order issued hy competent authority, in connection with the .measures of the Government in carrying on the war ia which the Union is en&aged. In the Noble county cases the majesty of the law hfls been vindicated, aud Judge .Leavitt in pro nouncing sentence excluded the possibility of an error or suspicion of vindicliveneia mi the part - r . i. e . ti . i i ii.i i r ui iue uuvenimeiiu vaienuea ail me lenien cy consistent with duty to the public, and ex pressed a hope that th salutary object of the law will be answered without visiting upon the convicted extreme penalty.
