6 OPENING DAY OF THE SESSION OF CONGRESS. Very Little Will Probably be Done To- Day, However. The Lodge Immigration Bill to Come Up in the Senate. Special Orders That Will Try for New Dates, and Bills That Will Con tend for Right of Way—Senate Re publicans Will Caucus To-Morrow —Revolution in Uruguay Ended— Rioting Miners at Scranton—Sen ator Faulkner Will Not Retire. WASHINGTON, Dec. C—lt is not likely that anything- will be dune in either house of Congress to-morrow ex cept to exchange congratulations or condolences as the case may be, over the result of the election and to listen to the President's message. When the last session closed the House immigra tion bill had, and now ha.s, the right of way in the Senate. It is the unfinished business and will be called up at the expiration of the morning hour, - o'clock. Although known as the House bill on the calen dar as reported to the Sestate by Mr. Lodge, it is a materially different meas ure, all of the House provisions having been stricken out except the enacting clause and a new bill substituted. This bill will be called up on Tuesday by Senators Lodge and Chandler, who de sire to push it to a vote as quickly as possible. An effort will be marie to secure n.<v dates- for the consideration of special orders that were not reached during last session. These measures are: Sen ate bill to prevent the deaoec ration of the American Bag*! House bill to amend the Act to prevent the extermination of fur-bearing animals of Alaska; House bill to reduce the cases in which the penalty of death may be inflicted, and Senate Joint resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution pro viding for the election of Senators 1 y popular Vote. An important bill over which there has developed a bitter fight is the De troit bridge bill for a bridge across the Detroit River. It was postponed at the last session until the first Monday in December. In addition to the postponed bills there are several measures that will contend with each other for right ;>f way. Prominent among them are the bills to refund the Pacific railroad debt, to admit the Territories of New M \ o and Arizona and Mr. Davis' resolution relative to the enforcement of the Mon roe doctrine. in the House of Representatives the death of ex-Speaker Crisp will be an nounced by one of his former col leagues, and after the reading of ths President's message the House will ad journ in his honor. 

THERE ARE OTHERS. This Time the Referee Was Attacked, and a Free Fight Followed. MILWAUKEE, Dec. G.—Nettled by a rank decision given by a man nam v Cameron of Chicago who re-fereed a prize fight at Hall's Corner, ten miles south of this city last night, a crowd ot -I'D Milwaukee and Chicago sports en gaged in a free fight, in which several were BO badly injured that they will not be about for a weak. The fight was between Harry Fails of this city and Teddy Murphy of Chicago, and was for a purse of $300. It was to be a twenty-five round match. Fails had the best of the fight, which had pro ceedtod as far as the eleventh round. In this round Murphy made- a swing at Fails and according to Cameron, the referee, fouled him. Cameron at once awarded the light to Fails. The crowd bowled indignantly at the decision and some one jumped over the ropes and attacked the referee. It was only a moment before the whole crowd was in a free fight, and many of the contestants were knocked out. The stakeholder escaped to a carriage and was on the way to the city when some of th. crowd Stopped the carriage, shoved revolvers into the faces of the occu pants and told them that they wanted Cameron. When they learned that Cameron was not in the rig tin y allow d it to proceed. The money will be paid to Fails. REVOLUTION IN URUGUAY.

He is on His Road Home With the Horses Bought at Lexington. CHICAGO, Dec. o—John W. Mack ey, the California horseman, registered at the Wellington to-day. He is on his way from Lexington to the Rancho del Paso, near Sacramento, with the string of thirty-four thoroughbred horses which he purchased at the com bination sale held at Lexington, last week. Among them were the stallion Ornament, for which he paid $26,000, and Candlemas, the brother of St. Blaise, which cost $15,000. The string altogether represent over $100,000. They were conveyed in a special train of six Burton cars. Mr. Mac key with a party of friends traveled in a special car. In each of the cars conveying the horses was an attendant. The train left at 5:50 over the Burlington and will travel over the Central and Union Pacific roads. Mr. Markov said the Lexington sale was a good one, the prices obtained being bet ter than at any sale for a long time. He was of the opinion it presaged an advance in the prices of thoroughbred horses. He believed the business outlook was decidedly promising and that a steady improvement was to lie expected from now on. He said the result of the election exemplified the truth of the stat. meat made by John Stuart Mill, the English economist, that "the Amer ican people had the unfortunate habit of going off at times on some wild finan cial heresy, but had the good fortune to get right at the critical moment." CHOPPED DOWN TOLLGATES. State and County Authorities Give No Protection to the Owners. HARRODBBUIiG (Ky.). Dec. 6.—A mob of between forty and sixty men aimed with shotguns and axes rode through Mercer last night and chopped down six toll gates. The gate keepers were warned not to repair the gates or collect any more toll under penalty of being burned out. The mob passed through tiiis city at 2 o'clock this morn ing en route from Macksville for Har rodsburg and they destroyed every gate in the line of march. At Salt River, one mile from here, Dave Barnett, a gate keeper, was made to chop down his own gate and he was told to notify the turn pike directors that if the gate was re paired and money collected the raiders would not only burn the toll house but the private property of the board of directors. These gentlemen have or dered the gates repaired and toll w ill be collected by an armed guard if neces sary. The same warning was given at some of the other gates. Over three hundred toll gates have been burned or chopped down since the turnpike war began in Washington County three months ago and as yet only five arrests have been made. No I convictions resulted from these. The gates destroyed represent 1,500 miles of turnpike and valued at $4,000,000 and the State and county authorities have furnished no protection whatever.

Says He Should Scrupulously Obey His Country's Law Prohibiting Any One Holding Office From Accepting Gifts. He Thanks the English People for Their Generous Proposal and Ap preciation—Great Britain Wins Her Contention in the Egyptian Matter —Heavy Gales Prevailing in Brit tany—The Powerful the Fastest Ship in the English Navy. LONDON, Dec. (>.—Hon. Thomas F. Bayard, the American Embassador, has written a letter to the "Daily Tele graph" anent that journal's proposal to take up a public subscription for the purpose of purchasing him a national Christmas gift as a token of esteem of the English people. The letter, which is dated December t»th, says in part: "Early this morning I telegraphed you not to proceed further with your kind and generous proposal for a tes timonial to me from the people of this country in token of their appreciation of my efforts to establish between the two great English speaking nations harmony and good will." Mr. Bayard then proceeds to say that he was touched and gratified by the proposal and the "Telegraph's" gener ous eulogy of him, but after reflection he decided that he should scrupulously obey the spirit of his country's law, which inhibits anyone holding an office of trust or profit under the American Government from accepting "without the consent of Congress any present from any King. Prince or Government." He further says: "While I live I shall not cease to thank the people of these islands for th" whole-hearted, unstinted welcome I have received at their hands and tiie warm hospitalities that have been showered on me and mine." The "Telegraph" in a leader will to morrow announce the withdrawal of its proposition. It says there is no need to inquire as to the good will of the English nation toward Mr. Bayard. 

BAYARD'S DECLINATION. Information Received at Washington of His Action. WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.—lnformation has been received here that Embassador Bayard has declined with many thanks the proposed testimonial which the London "Daily Telegraph" suggested should be raised by popular subscription in England as a mark of appreciation of his efforts to preserve good will between the two countries. Mr. Bayard takes the ground that his position as an Em basador would prevent his accepting any gift of the kind proposed. This is in accord with the views which the State Department held of Mr. Bayard's probable action in the matter. THE CRUISER POWERFUL. She is the Fastest Ship at Present in the English Navy. NEW YORK, Dec-, 6.—A special cable dispatch to the "Herald" from London says: The British cruiser Powerful, which quite recently completed her steam trials, is at the present nkiment the fastest ship in the royal navy, and has thus far fully justified the addi tion of water tube boilers in vessels of large displacement. The engines of the Powerful, as also those of the Ter rible, were designed to produce 25,000 hone-power. In her final trip, which was carried out on November l!7th, her engines de veloped an average of 25,886 horse power for the requisite period of four hours. For one-third of the duration of her trial the Powerful exceeded 26, --000 bone-power. The wind was strong and the sea rough, the result being that the speed attained was only 21.8 knots, but it was estimated that in tolerably smooth water the ship would have steamed at a speed of fully 22.50 knots. The ship wa.s fully down to her load lire- during the trials and drew twenty eight feet aft. 

DEATH OF MRS. MATTHEWS. She Expires Suddenly From a Hem orrhage of the Stomach. INDIANAPOLIS, Dec. o.—Mrs. Mat thews, wife of Governor Matthews, was seized with a fatal hemorrhage of the stomach to-night. She had been in disposed for a couple of days, but was feeling so much better this evening that She w as up and about, and she and the Governor were alone in the library about 8:30 o'clock, when she started to walk across the room and fell to the floor, with the blood rushing from her mouth and nostrils. The Governor carried her to a couch and the family physician, Dr. R. French Store, was called at once. He saw the fatal nature of the trouble, and telegrams were sent to their two daughters, Mrs. Cortes B. Wing of Greensburg and Miss Helen Matthews, now attending the Cincinnati Conserva tory of Music. A consultation of physi cians was called, but tluy found that Mrs. Matthews had but a few hours to live. Mrs. Matthews was a daughter of Governor Whiteotnb, and they have been married nearly thirty years. Tie Governor's only son, Seymour Matthews, died at Atlanta a year ago. THE REPORT DENIED. ilissionaries Have Formulated No Complaint Against Turkey. NEW Y< >XX. Dec. 6.—A special ca ble to the ' Herald" from Constantino ple says: The news that the American missionaries have formulated a com plaint against the Imperial Government is devoid of foundation. The United States, desiring a maintenance of ami cable relations and with the. object of dissipating all doubts has Officially de nied the report in question. Dr. Kimball's assertion that the na tional flag had been torn down in the Ilask-u Quarter of Constantinople— a stat meat which aroused a great dem onstration of indignation—is not ap proved. Such a charge was made, but after most minute inquiries the missionaries on the spot denied it. Heavy Gale in Brittany. PARIS, Dec. 6. —A heavy gale is pre vailing in Brittany, and the reports re ceived show that severe losses have been sustained by the fishermen along the coast.

All the smaller windows of the edifice were smashed in by the firemen in efforts to quench the blaze. Hugo Koehring and George Bloom, janitors, narrowly escaped suffocation, and the immense pipe organ of the church was critically near destruction from the slow eating flames. Much of the damage to the building was caused by water. The conditions forced aban donment of church services to-day. The flames got their start*in the basement of the structure, directly below the church parlors in the rear of the build ing. JUVENILE HIGH ROLLERS.

J., from which place they came. Wilson and Milligan were first seen here during the race meeting at Ben nings during Thanksgiving week. Dur ing the present week their expensive manner of living came under the obser vation of the detectives.

They Have Badly Affected Commercial Interests. The Crippled Condition of Railroads Paralyzes the Lumber Trade. Coastwise and Foreign Trade Have Also Suffered Greatly—Stocks of Business Houses Running Low and Holiday Goods Blockaded So That Merchants Will Lose Heavily —Beef and ilutton Have Risen—A Stage-Driver Arrested for Robbing the Mails—Two Important Cases Decided. SEATTLE (Wash.), Deo. (j—The floods and storms which have been pre vailing in the Pacific Northwest for the past month have had a very dis astrous effect upon commercial indus tries in this section. Owing to the crippled condition of the railroads the lumber business, which is the principal industry in Washington, is practically paralyzed. The coastwise and foreign trade have suffered greatly, but noth ing in comparison with the interstate and Eastern business, and, what is worse, relief does not appear to be near at hand. At no time within the month could consignments over either of the trans continental lines be forwarded with any certainty of safe delivery. Washouts on both systems have extended from the toast through Washington and Washington and Montana to the snow blockaded prairies of the Dakotas. The depressing effect of this state of affairs has been far reaching, for in the lum ber business of this State alone there are directly and indirectly about !!'», --000 men engaged. In nearly all of the big busings houses, wholesale and retail, of this city the general stocks are running Low and many special shipments of holiday goods are blocked on the through lines between the coast and St. Paul, with the result that merchants will lose heavily unless traffic is soon resumed. Owing to the blockade, prices of beef and mutton have risen and will con tinue to rise until the railroads are in condition to handle through freights. Western Washington obtains these products from' the broad prairies east of the Cascades, and the transporta tion of livestock from that section hither has been attended by even greater perils and vexatious delays than that of dead freight. Stock raisers have, by reason of the unusual fall of snow on the other side, been forced to feed their cattle this winter, and this has also contributed towards the general advance in prices. The involved railroads are making he roic efforts to get control of their prop erty again, but they are not receiving much encouragement by any prospects for better weather, as the rainfall con tinues with aggravating regularity. Reports from the Cascades are to the effect that nearly all the mountain streams are as high as they were three weeks ago, and the large rivers empty ing into Puget Sound are rising and in some cases have spread beyond their banks. RECLAMATION CASE. County Treasurer Ordered to Pay Warrants Presented. MODESTO, Dec. 6.—The reclamation district case has been decided by the Su perior Court of Stanislaus County de claring the claims of the reclaimers le gal, and that the County Treasurer should recognize and pay them. About a year ago many reclamation districts were formed throughout thr State. Men having swamp and over flowed land could, by expending a cer tain amount of work to reclaim it, pre sent claims to the Board of Supervisors with proof of labor and receive pay from the county for work, the land to remain the property of the reclaimer. Claims were presented in this county nearly a year ago to County Treasurer W. A. Downer, but he did not consider the demands legal and refused to cash the warrants. A test case was begun under the title of J. M. Canty et al. vs. W. A. Downer, Treasurer of Stanislaus County. The suit involved many thousands of dol lars in this county alone and Boards of Supervisors of other counties withheld action pending a decision in this case. Now Superior Judge W. O. Miner de clares the claims legal and authorizes the Treasurer to pay the warrants. LOMPOC WHARF CASE. It Has at Last Been Decided, in Favor of the Plaintiff. SANTA BARBARA. Dec. (>.—The Lompoc wharf case, that has been in litigation for years, has been decided by Judge Cope of the Superior Court. The court rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff, M. M. Mehrin, for (9,145, interest and costs of suit. Plaintiff is the assignee of the Cali fornia Steamship Company, whose property, consisting of a wharf and warehouse at Lompoc, was sold under an execution by Constable J. N. Saun ders. Thomas Ambrose, the purchaser and co-defendant with Saunders, made payment with a check on the Donohue- Kelly Bank of San Francisco, upon which a certificate of purchase was duly issued. When the check was pre ented for payment the bank refused to cash it for the reason that Ambrose had stopped payment. STAGE DRIVER ARRESTED. He Claimed He Had Been Held Up by a Hail Robber. SANTA BARBARA, Dec. 6.— Frank Miller, the sixteen-year-old driver of the Lompoc mail stage, was to-day ar rested on the charge of robbing the United States mails. Miller reported to the Lompoc authorities yesterday that he had been held up near Stuart Postofßce on Friday night by a lone highwayman who rifled the mail sacks. Deputy Sheriff Foxson organized a posse and departed for Stuart last night. A telephone dispatch from Lompoc to night announced Miller's arrest, but gave no particulars beyond stating that Sheriff Hicks was on his way to Santa Barbara with the prisoner.

AMBITIOUS TO SHINE. Mrs. Herman Oelrich Will Entertain in New York. CHICAGO, Dec. li.-A special to a morning paper from New York says: Mr. and Mrs. Herman Oelricha will to night give a notable entertainment—a dinner vaudeville. This is taken as»an indication, after having since her mar riage several years ago been content to play an inconspicuous part in society, that Mrs. Oelrichs is now ambitious to shine as a leader. The Oelrichs have expended more than $200,000 upon alterations and dec orations on their leased house at the northwest corner of Fifth avenue and Fifty-seventh street, which is believed to mean that Mrs. Oelrichs means to muks her home the scene of as much gaiety a.s possible this winter. It was Occupied formerly by Mrs. Phartn- Stevenfl and her daughter, Mrs. Paget, and Shares the four corners of Fifth avenue in that neighborhood of multi millionaires with the splendid C. P. Huntington and Cornelius Vanderbilt establishments directly opposite and the pretty house which is to be the future home of Mr. and Mrs. Harry Payne Whitney, noe Vanderbilt. on the other corner. The fact her sister, Miss Vir ginia Fair, is one of the half dozen greatest heiresses in town, as well as a bright, pretty and attractive girl, should assist Mrs. Oelrichs in carrying out her put pose. A REJECTED SUITOR. He Shoots the Girl and Then Kills Himself. MONTREAL Dec. <>.—John Howell, the rejected suitor of Miss Annie Sims, returned from New Haven, Conn., yes- V : lay. and this morning called at th • Sims residence. The family left the couple together and in a short time the report of firearms was heard. Upon rushing into the room Mis* Sims was found sitting unconscious in a chair, having been shot twice in the head. She will probably die. Ho\v<-!l lay dead at her feet, having shot him s-Jf with the revolver. Howell was -~ years old, a molder of steady habits. Miss Sims is 22 years old. SHARKEY RECEIVES CALLERS. TELLS HIS FEfIALE FRIENDS HOW HE WAS FOULED. Prominent Cyclers State That His Present Condition night Arise From Overtraining, SAX FRANCISCO, Dec. 6.—Tom Sharkey, the pugilist, received many callers ot both sexes in his sick cham ber to-day and spent much of his time explaining to them how Fitzsimmons fouled him in order to avoid certain defeat. Although Sharkey lost many friends through the foul fight he put up with the Australian, his gameness is unquestioned and his admirers hope that with experience and training he will yet become a top-notcher among the heavy weights. A number of prom inent cyclists who inspected Sharkey'j injuries to-day state that his present condition might be brought about by overtraining or varicose veins, and that the complaint from which he is suffer ing is by no means uncommon among track riders. Nobody questions the mariner's gameness. but all condemn his foul tactics and agree that while he may be an adept at wielding holystones on a Wet deck he knows next to noth ing about handling boxing gloves. At the '*Chutes" this afternoon Fitz simmons and his trainers illustrated the Sharkey knock-out blows twice to a crowd of 10.000 people, who cheered him wildly. The Olympic Club of this city, which is probably the only organization that will be favored with boxing permits in future, has offered a purse of $10,000 for a ten-round contest between Corbett and Fitzsimmons. The former has re plied stating that he will consider noth ing less than $15,000, with a suitable al lowance for training expenses. Martin Julian. Fitzsimmons' manager, has heard nothing from the Olympic offi cials, but will make no further moves in the way of match making until the Sharkey contest is arbitrated by the courts. Fitzsimmons. when apprised ot the offer made by- the Olympic Club, expressed his willingness to accept any proposition calculated to bring about a meeting with Corbett, but resolutely ad hered to his preference for a finish fight and suggested that "Pompadour Jim" do business with Dan Stuart first. As a direct result of the Fitzsimmons- Sharkey fiasco. Tommy Ryan of Syra cuse, who was matched to fight George Green (Young Corbett) twenty rounds in this city during the month of January next, has declined to take his chances with the San Francisco sporting element and thus what promised to be one of the most scientific contests arranged has apparently fallen through. Spurgeon is one of the men who live Cn. The publishers of his writings have just received an order for 1,000,000. copies of his sermons. Over 100,000,009 in all have been published and the de mand is as large and as steady as at any time since it began, forty years ago. l"IT mineral drug* and go to u-irm a pure herb remedy.
