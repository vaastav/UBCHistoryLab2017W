" 1 THE SENTINEIj'S TRLPIK SHEET. The Sentinel, in "'this number, takes a peculiar pleasure in present ing for the perusal of over 20,000 readers, a triple sheet, 96 column ksue, of what is the largest pa per, AND THE LARGEST EDITION, ever issued in the State of North Carolina, with one possible excep tion. , , . If this be a" triumph in Southern journalism, the good v people of Winston must share the greater portion of the credit, for to their generous patronage is due the suc cessful issuance ot this mammoth journal. We have striven, most assiduous ly, to give an accurate review of our industrial and mercantile inter ests. We doubt not but what we have overlooked some, and failed to mentioii others with sufficient em phasis, but in 'N an arduous though pleasurable undertaking of such magnitude as this has proven to be, we think we may be pardoned for suchslights and ellipses which may occur. Suffice it to say the review we herein give is certainly a most grati fying one to us, and we know will be to every citizen ot our prosper ous community. Look upon whatever hand we may, carefully, weigh the hopes for future success in every department ot trade or manufacture, and the Twin-City must impress the be holder as having a future before her with the most flattering possibili ties. With a population already num bering fully TEN 

THOUSAND SOuls, It will, in 1S90, be the largest city in North Carolina, and - with more money invested in manufacturing machinery than any other town in the State, it will be the richest. Without the aid of any great amount of railroad facilities that cluster around many other neigh boring towns, it has, by dint ot pure ly indefatigable energy and enter prise and a superior natural advan tage as to location, become, in an inconceivably short period of years, built up, "far from the mad ding crowd, as it were, into a veritable little metropolis, taking on all the signs of prosperity and im portance that characterize the larger cities. With the railroad facilities which the future promises us so lavishly, what may we not expect of our growing community ? If it has become the city it is, with only one bit of a road of only twenty-nine miles, what will be its dimensions and importance after other roads have been kuilt a greater number of miles in length ? To the man of means and with plenty of the right kind of push, be he from the North, the West or from our own State, the Twin-City opens wide its arms and invites him to come among us. A cordial wel come awaits him, and a hearty co operation will be accorded every effort he may exert to build up any entci prise which may "help the com mon weal. Many are the industrial openings here awaiting capital and enter prise. It thispaper should fall into the hands of men who may desire to invest their money here, and who riiay wish information about the place, The Sentinel will take pleasure in affording all the points obtainable. Hon. James W. Reid was the first North Carolina representative to arrive in Washington at the open ing of Congress. By the way, we acknowled from him the receipt of some tobacco seed of the Catboni variety. This variety, in Cuba, is said to grow to the height of four teen feet. It was successfully grown in Virginia the past year. The stalks measured ten feet, leaf of good size and flavor equal to the best imported cigar. If this tobacco can he raised in Virginia certainly North Carolina can raise it, and any enterprising" farmer wishing to make the experiment will be fur nished with seed by calling at The Sentinel office. It is so seldom that a Raleigh paper steps out of its way to give space to any item that would indi cate that Winston . is prosperous and growing, that The Sentinel reproduces the following from the Raleigh Recorder with considerable satisfaction : . v - Winston does not get as many newspaper puffs as som e of our other towns, but no town in this State surpasses " her in enterprise and prosperity.' With more than thirty large to bacco factories and five tobacco warehouses, she may well point with pride to this branch of her -trade. Educationally, in her system of pumic scnoois, sne is ttDreast t any town m the State. We have noted . several times the efficiency of theteachars in this Graded School, and have described the handsome school build ing. This school was never more popular, nor in a more prosperous condition.. , , : , The Sentinel has been able to hear but-Jittle relative to ; the late Prohibition Convention at Greens boro. , One fact seems, however, to have become; prominent, and that is, that there ii hardly any likelihood of; a . th i rd - party being organized . The -organ of the Prohibitionists, the Spirlt'of the' Age, is opposed to this movement," as likewise is the TH E North Carolina Presbyterian and other leading . State papers. The people of Wadesboro assembled and also "deprecated the idea of forming a third party, and unani mously declared that if such were the purpose of the Greensboro Convention they would take no in terest in the matter." ' . : If Winston and Salem were literally one corporation, and had one postoffice" instead of two, as is M present the case, the consolidated community might be able to prevail upon Congress to appropriate a snug little sum for the erection of a suitable postofnee building. In ad dition to this, if the two places were consolidated we would have the ad vantages derived by the use of the immediate . delivery stamp, and all the sooner would our population reach that point which would en title us to the delivery system, by which our letters could be brought to our doors by postmen, a postal luxury enjoyed by Raleigh and Wil mington. " The Sentinel offers its congrat ulations to Mr. R . B. Gllnn upon his appointment to the Solicitorship tor this district, recently made va cant by the death of Mr. Joseph Dobson. Mr. Glenn is an able and successful lawyer and will make a good officer. THE 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. We regret that the crowded con dition of The Sentinel's columns in this issue precludes the possibili ty of laying the President's Message before our readers. However, the following from the New York World contains a succinct synopsis of the Message and from its peru sal, the reader will obtain an accu rate idea of all the salient points, and at the same time, obviate wad ing through an immense mass of verbiage. The document entire would fill sixteen columns of The Sentinel, in the type we use. The World says : President Cleveland's Message it of unusual length. But the space is occupies is not wasted. It is seldom that a document has issued from the. Executive so full of information and instruction for the people. It is free from verbiage, is written in a plain, business-like manner, treats of a large number of subjects and is positive and outspoken in the ex pression of opinion on the impor tant issues of the hour. Nearly four columns are devoted to our dealings and .concerns with foreign nations, and the design of the President is evident!' fo let the people know the exact position of their Government on all such ques tions. This portion of the Message, which follows a brief and feeling allusion to the .death of the Vice President, contains some interest ing points. The President admin isters a rebuke to Austria for reject ing Mr. Keiley for reasons which could not be acquiesced in with self-respect or without injustice to a large class of our citizens and the abandonment of a vital principle in our Government, and intimates that the position will remain unfilled. The treaties which figured in the last hours of President Arthur's Administration meet with no favor. The President is emphatically op posed to a Nicaragua ship canal, preferring the Tehuantepec ship railway as a means of connecting the two oceans. The treatment of home subjects is, of course, the chief feature of the Message, The financial condition of the Government is good. The revenues foi the fiscal year 1885 were $24,829,163 less than for 1884, but they still gave $63,464,771 sur plus to the Treasury. The estimated receipts for the current fiscal year are $315,000 and expenditures $245, 000,000, at the close of the fiscal year 18S6. A Democratic Administration wants.no large and increasing Treas . ury surplus, extorted from the peo ple by unnecessary taxation. Hence the President insists that the taxes must be reduced, but he says truly, "The question of Free Trade is not involved, nor is there now any oc casion for the general discussion of the wisdom or expediency of a pro tective system." Industries and in terests which have been encourag ed by protective bws must not be injured or destioyed, and in any changes that may be made Ameri can labor, which is-the capital of our workingmen, must be protect ed. The President further recom mends that the reductions made shall apply to revenue derived Jfrom taxes on the imported ' necessaries of life, so as to lesson the cost of living to every family in the land. On the subject of the silver coin age the President speaks -fully .and emphatically. He points out in an exhaustive argument, the financial disaster that would result from the driving out of gold" by silver coin, and most emphatically recommends the suspension ot the compulsory coinage of silver dollars directed by the law of 1878. ." Every month," says the President, " $2,000,000 of gold in the public Treasury are paid Jout for 2,000,000 of silver dollars to be added to the idle mass already accumulated." - An argument in a paragraph. y'-': -'--; i; - - The President is fully in accqrd with the excellent recommendations of the Secretary of the Navy, and believes that if they are heeded we shall have an American Navy at last. The subject of Polygamy is taken up with earnest feeling, and the President urges a law to prevent the importation of Mormons into the' country. N' f Civil-Service Reform is briefly treated but vigorously upheld, al though it is evident that the Presi dent recognizes the importance of 

WESTER N SENTINEL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 17, 1885 enforcing .the rules with as much fairness and as little irritation s possible. Every other subject, of interest alluded to by the President is treated with equal frankness, and there is a gratifying absence ot the customary desire to shirk the re sponsibility of a positive opinion. The Message is a safe, clear, con servative paper, and upon the whole is an able State document. 

OLDHAM PUBLISHING HOUSE. Begs Leave to Speak Briefly of its ; Own Business' Growth. : We trust we may be. pardoned, in this review of, the material interests of Winston-Salem, for alluding in brief, to the business growth of the Oldham Publishing House. In April, 1883, the present man ager took charge of The Sentinel and the publishing business there with connected. From a circula tion ot barely 400 copies, this paper has grown until it has attained a circulation, close on to 3,000 copies, per week, having quadrupled its original edition within the first year after change of management. In the near future a semi-weekly.-edi-tion will be issued, appearing-- on Monday's and Thursday's. . Beside The Sentinel, The Southern Guardsman is publish ed and has received a very flatter ing "support from among the bid soldiers, and Guard members of this and ether Southern States. We have the contract for pub lishing the University Monthly, the organ of the Literary Societies of the State University, and are at present negotiating for other work of a sim ilar character. A specialty is being made of. magazine and catalogue printing, and the patronage of schools and colleges is solicited, be lieving that satisfactory and eco nomical. terms can be offered. The job printing business of this concern is larger than that of any other house-in the city, there being nearly twenty employees at present on the pay roll. Though a large local business is conducted, a still larger number of mail orders are tilled, the house during the past year having shipped work to many portions of North Carolina and to such extreme points as Boston and Waltham in Massachusetts, "Balti more, Washington and Texas. The engraving department has gradually increased in patronage. Lit is prepared to do all manner of engraving and respectfully offers its services to those in need of this class of work. - The composing and press rooms are -as thoroughly equipped as are those of any publishing hou-.e in the State. The former is on the third floor ot The Sentinel Building, is lighted by a spacious sky light. From this floor to the press-room in the basement an elevator is tun, and an additional convenience in the shape of speaking tubes is used. A No. 2 Campbell Power Press prints The Sentinel, and Gordon and Universal Presses do the job workt A steam or gas engine com mensurate with the needs of the house, will be put in shortly. The Job Department is supplied with a large number ot new and popular faces ot type, expensive inks, the best of job stock, and together with the artistic taste of practical work-" men, plain and ornamental printing can be turned out, that will afford entire satisfaction, both as to price and finish. A word in conclusion as to the personnel of the establishment : Mr. Geo. H. Rights, is City Edi tor and general foreman of the ty pographical department. He is assisted by Mr. Robt. E. Carmichael. Will X. Coley, and a number of other compositors. Mr. L. N. Keith, is foreman of the Job Department. ,. Mr. W. P.. Clarke is special re porter. Mi. J. L. C. Bird, is advertising solicitor and collector. Charlie Parrish is job pressman, and George Pinkston, (colored) is power pressman. . . The Sentinel has too extended' a list of special correspondents and contributors to admit of enumera ting here, but we will subjoin a few. Mr. John L.Beard is paragrapher. Mr. C. Ridgely Waller, is Wash ington City correspondent. Mr. Waller Erickford, is New York correspondent. Mr. Remly Sidelinger, is Boston, correspondent. Mrs. Sallie J. Battey, is fashion editor. This lidy conducts one of the leading fashion periodicals of New York. A 

MODERN MANUFAC ; TORY. The Establishment of Fo gle Bros. the firm are contractors, builders and manufac- ' "; TURERS. ' . . -J Few; names are more familiar to Winstonians and Salemites , than that of Fogle. The co-partners, in the firm of Fogre Bros." are r great grandchildren of a gentleman who settled in this vicinity as long ago as 1762, and theij father, Mr. Au gustus Fogle, is still living in Sa lem.' " .-'-,"! '--. ' " ;. ..-: '.. :: He was a carpenter by trade and his sons learned their trade; with him, each entering upon his - ap prenticeship when lads of scarcely more than fifteen years of ; age, and each has made, the business, , in one form or another, his life work. . The firm of Fogle Bros, was formed in 1871 previous to that time each had worked as journey man carpenter. . Upon the forma tion of their co-partnership the Messrs. Fogle engaged in the plan ing mill business and the manufact ure of sash, doors and blinds, and at about this time they also began tak ing building , contracts. ; They, a short ti me later, built T. L.Vaoghn's old factory the one now occupied by Lbckett, Vaughn & Co., the first factory of its kind built here " The original factory of . Fogle Bros, was a frame structure which. still adjoins their new ancl commo dious factory, built in 1S83. This is a model and a modern concern, and even if we wrote of it simply as it deserves, we are afraid we should be accused of indulging in extrava gant praise. The building is -of brick, of plain architecture, and is 60x120 feet, two floors. The ma chine room is upon the first floor, and is a splendid .working apart ment. The north-east corner of the room partitioned off for office purposes, and this partition is so nearly all glass that from the office ah almost unobstructed view is had of the entire-working floor. In this factory and busily at work, is ma chinery of all kinds designed for the manufacture of sash, doors, blinds, moulding, etc., as well as for the dressing of lumber, and as three planers are in place, the work- ! ing capacity' of the entire factory may be judged from that fact. Close by the factory is a well stocked lumber yard, but its busi ness as well as that of the factory Itself, is mainly to supply the needs of the Messrs. Fogfe in the -building operations and to meet the de mands of the retail trade. As contractors and builders the Messrs. Fogle have done some nota ble work here. It would require too much space in which to enume rate all the buildings of large and small consequence they have put up in- Winston-Salem, but we may, with perfect propriety, mention a few of the leading contracts they have filled . They built the Orinoco Warehouse, Bailey Bro.'s factory, Bynum & Cotten's factory, B. F. Hanes factory, H. H. Reynold' factory, W. W. Wood & Co's fac tory, Dr. J. F. Shaffner's factory and others, most or all of whom we have mentioned in this review of our business interests. They also built the residences of John W. Fries and ot M. M. Williamson, the latter the costliest residence in the Twin-Qity. They are now also build ing the first iron front block ever erected in Winston it is owned by Buxton & Shelton, and occupies tire site upon Main street where stood the buildings that were destroyed by fire last summer. As a matter of course, this mention of contracts filled by the firm might be added to to an almost indefinite extent. To illustrate, last year the firm averaged one finished contract to every six week's time. This year their con tracts for new buildings aggregate between thirty and forty. This large quantity of work ne cessitates the employment of a large force both in and out of the factory. During September and October of this year Fogle Bros, employed 100 workmen, but their average force numbers between 60 and 75. In and out of the factory the services of the most skilled workmen are re quired, and in the shops they work under the most favorable auspiees. lhe factory is heated by steam, is especially well lighted and well ven tilated, and it has an extremely business-like appearance. The co-partners each give per sonal attention to the busiuess, Mr. G A. Fogle surpervising the out-of-door work, while Mr. C. H.. Fogle manages the factory, the yard and the office. Like their brother manufacturers in all lines of trade here, they are young men, and they are working out their own salvation so far as regards business matters. "THE RED ELEPHANT." H. H. Reynolds is Proprie tor of the Factory Bear ing this Name. IT IS A MAGNIFICENT FACTORY, TOO, HAVING ANNUAL CAPAC ITY OF ONE MILLION- LBS. In our "industrial notes" upon the first pae of this issue of The Senti nel, the " intelligent com positor " made a mistake (since cor rected) that ought to have been allowed to go into print. The item said (before correction) that the King of Siam was a .partner hi a Winston factory. Now we all know that the King of Siam has a weakness for elephants, and so the supposition .naturally would have been that he was interested with H. H. Reynolds in his new and big "Red Elephant" factory. Friend Reynolds says that he, the elephants and the jaybird constitute the firm, and so we made the correction still, we - presume there will , be a "lingering doubt" in the minds of all who intimately know Mr. R. But, jocularity aside, the new fac tory, now being completed, by Mr. Reynolds is one of the notable ones of town, and a few words of com ment concerning it will not be out of place in this review. The factory is located, on the Salem extension of Liberty street, and it has this advantage : ?that in hauling leaf from the warehouses and in carrying manufactured to bacco from the factory to the depot, it is "down hill " all the way. The factory itself is a very substantially built brick structure, 53x130 feet, five floors in height, while its capac ity is placed at one million pounds per .year really: a small estimate, we should think, comparing it with others here. The construction of the building was begun in Septem ber last, and about the 1st of Janu ary, 1 886, work will begin in it. The front of this large factory is ornately decorated. Two huge red elephants are V represented they being typical of-the leading brand of plug tobacco that Mr. Reynolds makes and-they look true to the life (except .is regards color). The whole thing is a happy conceit ot the" proprietor of the factory, and certainly gives it a distinguishing appearance. ' v- ; This same - " Red Elephant " to bacco is known. throughout all the States which derive - supplies of chew'.ng tobacco from Vinston. It has made its way by reason ot its own merit, and a more toothsome, better flavored or better shewing grade of tobacco never has left this market-r-at least that is what its many friends have said these many, years. . '. . -: This " Red Elephant " brand is worked in a variety of styles that is, of course, a mere matter of fancy and Mr. Reynolds holds himself in readiness to meet the wishes of patrons in that respect, at the same time assuring them that, whatever the style or sign, " Red Elephant '! is the same.' Another brand is " Honeycomb ' ; still another is ," Peabody," and these, like J( Red Elephant," are standard goods, made from the best procurable leaf." Mr. Reynolds is also a manufac turer of granulated smoking tobac co. " Top of the Morning " is good enough for anybody to snike, and "Jay Bird," in its grade, flies rapid ly enough to distance competitors. "Mr. Reynolds expects to handle between one half million and three quarters of a million of pounds of tobacco during the coming year, and his trade for iS8; certainly would indicate these figures to be, a low estimate. Though the young est (in point of years) among our manufacturers, he haa been familiar with the tobacco interest from child hood is- posted relative to plant ing, growing, picking and curing of leaf, anc so he goes upon the market as his own buyer, while his experience as a manufacturer enable him to personally supervise his own factory. Four years ago he began manufacturing upon his own ac count tor two or three years be fore he had been managing a fac tory for other parties. The factory he has recently been working was relatively small next year he will be at the head of one of the best in town he will . be working 300 hands, and the " Red Elephants " on . the factory front will smile complacently as they contemplate the hundreds of cases of manufac tured tobacco that leave the ship ping room of the establishment. S. E. ALIiEN. His Trade Interests in Winston REPRESENT LARGE YEARLY TRANS ACTIONS AND ARE A VOUCHER AS TO HIS BUSINESS STANDING. Ten years ago Capt. S. E. Allen, who is a native of Wake county, this State, located in Winston and estab lished a hardware house, his place f business being the same as the one now occupied at the corner ot Third and Main streets. Subsequently his cousin, D. E. Allen, was a partner with him for. a couple of years, and since the dissolution 01 that co-part hership, one year ago, Capt. Allen has been alone. He now conducts tw.o distinct branches of business two stores, in fact one devoted to hard ware and kindred lines of trade the other to crockery, glass and lampware and the thousand and one things that come within the province ot those lines. This crockery department was established only two years ago, but it is as thoroughly complete as anything 01 the kind can be. To better convey an impression of Capt. Allen s business we will at tempt a brief description of the prem ises occupied ; that is, a description so far as it relates to the various floors of the store and their uses. The first floors constitute the sales rooms proper. In one are shown shelf and builders hardware, cutlery and the many articles that appertain to the hardware trade. In the other are displayed all manner of goods per taining to crockery. England, France, America and other countries are represented. A - visitor to the house sees a beautiful display of ser viceable and ornamental goods. In addition to those articles that the housewife finds in every-day demand are. Bohemian. Crystal, Majolica and other wares, and inquiry deter mines this tact : that nearly all 01 the goods in this department are import ed. So far as that is concerned, Capt. Allen purchases nine-tenths . of his stock from manufacturers, and the result is that he is enabled to make prices for both the wholesale and re tail trade of all this section. " As the Sentinel reporter visited the various departments of the house he jotted upon his note book this rough outline of facts : That the sec ond floor of the double building was as fully stocked as the rooms below. Here we saw stoves by the score ; there were sash, doors and blind?, carriage wood work, and other material, while upen the third floor was tin ware, wood and willow ware, and a variety of duplicate stock. Capt. Allen persuaded us to' try the elevator in lieu of walking down stairs. . The old quotation of "de acensus in Avemt" came to our mind, but our Latin editor being out of town, we will translate liberally, and say : "The descent being easy" we accepted his invitation and made the trip in safety. Reaching - the basement we saw glass, paints, oils, turpentines, nails, horse shoes and a variety of ar ticles that may properly be ' called heavy stock. This "heavy stock" is supplemented by a large line of rod and bar iron and steel, which fill a room upon Third street, adjoining the hardware store proper. - Another feature of Capt. Allen's trade is agticultural implements and machinery. He is agent for the Cham pion Mower and Reaper, the Bickford & Huffraan.Grain Drill, the Thomas Harrow, the Farmers' Friend Plow, and other leading implements and machinery manufacturers in the coun tryj and : these , implements and ma chinery he can conscientiously recom mend because they are meritorious they have stood the test of time. : He is also ' agent for the- Great Western Powder , Company, v manufacturers J of sporting and blasting powders, and of the Hercules Powder Company, one ef whose specialties is dynamite, and Capt Allen-has a magazine on the out skirts of, town where these powders are stored. In this connection . we may also say that he makes quite a specialty of sporting material of all kinds. . He offers some decided bargains in guns, and his prices are worth investigating. ; : Capt. Allen gives his business his personal attention, and he and his five clerks usually find their time thorough ly employed. These clerks are Ii. A. Stone, Oliver Wood, James Shepperd, C. S. Johnson and Miss Bettie Harris the latter being employed in the crockery department. A considerable jobbing business is done by the house, but no commercial travelers are employed The mer chants of the country who find Wins ston their base of supplies buy of Al len because he gives them prices Ihat cannot be duplicated by other cities. Capt. Allen has not always been a hardware merchant. When a boy of eighteen years of age he entered the employ of the Raleigh and Gaston railroad as time clerk. Alter suDse quent service with the North Carolina railroad as private secretary, he be came its general ticket agent, and from that position he was advanced to the Sst of general passenger agent of the ichmond and Danville road, which position he resigned in 1873, and since then he has been a Winstonian jand a prominent merchant of the 1 win City. ' Capt. Allen is thoroughly in earnest in whatever he undertakes he has built up a large trade by the pursuit of liberal, progressive business methods, and the Sentinel is glad of of the opportunity to thus refer to h jm and his trade in this review of Winston-Salem.
