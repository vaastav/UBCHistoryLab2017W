Castro's Iinle in Tenezuela Has Probably Ended. Mob Destroyed His Property and That of Henchmen. BOXFIRE OX FLAZA Of Castro's Statues and Pictures While Crowds Cheer. Buildings Looted 'o Attempt Made to Check Rioters. Caracas, Monday, Dec. 14, via Willem tad, Dec. 16. The people of Caracas arose today against President Castro. An infuriated mob, unhindered by the police, swept through the city wrecking the property of his henchmen, his clos est friends. The people rounded up all statues and pictures of President Cas tro from the clubs and other semi-public buildings and burned them with re joicing on the Plaza Bolivar. Castro's rule in Venezuela is probably ended. In spite of Holland's "warlike demon strations on the coast there have beeci no demonstrations against the Nether lands; they have all been directed against President Castro and Acting President Gomez. Caracas, Venezuela, Tuesday. Dec. 15, via Willestad. Dec. 16. The Venezuelan! capital yesterday witnessed an outbreak! rf f?i5frr!aT- fnllnu.-iTie' thp warlike artivi - ties of the Dutch warships along the coast, that made it necessary by night fall to declare martial law in order to put an end to the rioting and pillaging. There were several attacks on private property on the part of the mob before the authorities got the situation in hand and several of the agitators were arrested. There was no actual conflict between the people and the police. The pillaging was confined to the properties of Venezuelans, notably Senors Rivas and Thielen. Foreigners were unmolested. Early today the city is quiet and business is taking its normal course. Further dangerous demonstrations are anticipated. No official act deposing Castro from the presidency of Venezue la has yet been taken but such a step Js expected any moment. An enormous crowd of the inhabitants of the capital, swelled by people from the outlying country, gathered in the streets soon after daybreak. The people began marching up and down the main thor oughfares and it was easy to see that their ill temper would soon result In vio lence. The police stood by and made no attempt whatever to restrain the mob. The first building to be attacked and looted, was that of the lottery monopo ly. The offices of the state enterprise that has enriched itself at the expense of the people, were ransacked and pil laged. Furniture was broken and thrown into the streets and thousands of lottery tickets were destroyed. Th crowd then moved to the printing office of El Constitucional. the organ of Pres ident Castro of which G. Rivas is edi tor, and pillaged it completely. A steam laundry belonging to Senor Rivas was wrecked. The crowd then turned its attention to several drug stores belonging to Kenor Thielen. a son-in-law of General Tello Mendoza, and turned them inside out. General Mendoza was at one time minister of finance and public credit un der Castro. He was also the president's private secretary of several years and has been regarded as one of his etaunchest supporters. He is universal ly hated by the enemies- of Castro, and his unpopularity and his close connec tion with the president accounted for the anger of the ponulace against the property of his son-in-law. The statues and pictures of President Castro were made into a huge bonfire on the Plaza Bolivar. The crowd cheer ed as the flames completed the destruc tion of these effigies of the dictator. Numerous inscriptions setting forth the virtues of Castro and extolling his pow ers next attracted the mob and every inscription bearing Castro's name was hacked out and erased. Some of these legends were carved on the public build ings of the city. It was after 1 o'clock by the time the crowd had gotten far in its depreda tions. It lacked leadership and paused in default of other fields for Its destruc tive energies. It was then that a de tachment of troops was called out for duty on the city streets, and Acting President Gomez issued a manifesto prohibiting further manifestations. These measures had the desired effect for the mob quieted down and then dis persed. The attack yesterday on the offices of El Constitucional when the crowd was curbed by a detachment of soldiers who flred into the demonstrants, re sulted in fatalities. A criminal action has been begun against Editor Rivas and other employes of the paper, in which they are charged with responsi bility for these deaths. It is declared that Rivas and his men fired first on the people, making use of revolvers. El Constitucional has suspended publica tion and Caracas is practically without a newspaper. The funeral of Mariano Rojas, one of the men killed in the fighting of yester day has been fixed for tomorrow. A vast crowd will turn out and further disorders and rioting are expected. I

Says Conditions Should Be Changed to Permit Tariff Reduction. Washington. Dec. 16.- Disagreeing with (he published views of Andrew Carnegie with regard to the steel schedule of the tariff, Chas. M. Schwab, former president of the Cnited States Steel corporation, gave valuable testimony before the house ways and means committee at the tariff hearing. While he practically admitted that the conditions which existed nine years ago would have permitted a re duction in the steel schedule at that time, he said that the cost of every item entering into the manufacture of steel rails had increased to such an extent that conditions should be changed to permit of tariff reduction. 1 J" "ve wierewm no ue h. 4t -fV 0 ?, VL ln "VV pmted states. Mr. Schwab I " ".Bessemer steel will be of no use. The same is true of structural steel as well as rails. They will all be made by the open hearth process of manu facture. Costlv changes in the con struction in the plant will be necessary to make the improvement in the method of manufacture." Mr. Schwab also declared that with in ten years the "open hearth" pro cess would be superseded by the elec tric system of manufacture which was being developed In Germany. These conditions in the process of manufacture increase the quality of the steel he continued but they also slightly increase the cost of produc tion. Mr. Schwab said he was not in favor of any change in the tariff on steel and steel products. "A moderate change would not make a material difference," he said but a radical change might do con siderable harm. He admitted that the tariff could be taken off iron ore without affecting the value of the Messaba ore of this country. Mr. Schwab stated that the Bethlehem Steel company of which he is president imports all of its iron ore ifom uuba. 

HARRIMAN DECISION. It Will Not Make Much Difference to the Commission. Chicago. Dec. 16. Franklin K. Lant, the interstate commerce commission. an interview here regarding the decision of the United States supreme court in the Harriman case limiting the authority of the commission to compel answers to certain questions, said that In his opinion the decision would not result in any great limitation of the powers of the commis sion. He saw in the decision, however, a Bliu"e nigunicHi lor governmental con trol over the capitalization of railway companies In order to protect the people's money invested in railroads against the possibilities of manipulation. "It is of considerable moment to the railroad world." said Commissioner Lane, "whether a railroad can invest in the stocks of other railroad companies. The matter we were investigating was the use to which Harriman put the money which he raiFed by the sale of bonds of the Cnlon Pacific railroad. It was shown that he raised $100,000,000, which went largely nuu puicuu(! oi mocKs or otner rail roads, thereby imperilling the Union Pa cific property. ir me recent panic had been a more serious one. similar to that of 1S93, for in stance, and the stock which had been purchased with Union Pacific money, had fallen in the market, it might have thrown the Union Pacific into the hands of a receiver, or at least might have made necessary a large increase In freight rates in orner 10 meet me interest on tne bonded debt of the road. "The point which the supreme court makes Is that this investigation did not deal directly with the question of rates which could be regulated by our commis sion. But if events had turned out less fortunately the financial methods of Har riman might easilv have developed a sit uation which would have made the ques tion of rates one of most immediate im portance to the L nion Pacific. MISTAKEN IDENTITY. Is Defense Made by a Man Arrested for Forgery. Chicago. December 16. Charged with forging aoout twenty checks aggre gating $10,000, Edward E. Perkins has been arrested here. Perkins until last August was em ployed as a bookkeeper in the pur chasing department of Spiegel, May, Stern & Co. The money is said to have come from the National Bank of the Repub lic, ty forging Sidney M. Spiegel's name, before and after Perkins sev ered his connection with that com pany. Perkins made no effort to escape, but turned his attention to his wife, who became hysterical when told that her husband was under arrest. He denied he had forged Spiegel's name, and said: "It is a case of mistaken identity." BETTER FOR JURORS. Judge Kavanagh Congratulates Indus trial Club on Its Work. Chicago. Dec. 16 Judge Marcus Kava naugh praises the work of the Industrial club ln procuring a suite for the use of .luries. The contrast pictured was that of the "Old days." when jurors were com pelled to go without meat, drink, or can dle, and the present when everything pos sible is done to make them comfortable. "Although, of course, the situation is changed a good deal In later times." said Judge Kavanagh, "still the jury service in this country and in almost every place in this country, until a couple of years ago, remained a survival of the old uncivilized idea. It still continues much the same in nearly every place except this city." 1R. 

LODGE SPEAKS The BrownsTille Affair Is Dis cussed at Length. Roosevelt's Stand in Matter Is Endorsed. NOT A KACE QUESTION Does Not Want Sympathy Be cause of Color. Favors Warner Bill and Not For aker's Measure. Washington, Dec. 16. The Browns ville affair was discussed in the senate today by Senator Lodge who was a member of the committee on military affairs which investigated the charges that soldiers of the Twenty-fifth regi ment "shot up" the town. Mr. Lodge remarked that he would make no reference whatever to the re port of the investigation referred to by the president in his recent message to congress. The senate galleries were filled. In opening his speech on the Browns ville affair. Senator Lodge referred to two questions to be discussed in this connection, one relating to the guilt or innocence of the soldiers and the oth er to the bill presented by Senator Foraker compelling the president to re store these soldiers to the army. "After hearing and examining all the evidence, not only that taken by the senate committee of which I was a member but that taken before the Pen rose court-martial and before the citt- i zens committee," said Mr. Lodflj, re ferring to the shooting affray in Brownsville on the night of August 13, 1906, "I have come to the clear con clusion that the shooting was done by soldiers of the Twenty-fifth infantry stationed at Fort Broim." This, he said, was also the conclusion of the citizens committee of Browns ville and of the Penrose court-martial. It was also the opinion of a decisive majority of the senate committee on military affairs. "The proposition," he said, "declar ing that 'the weight of the testimony shows that none of the soldiers of the Twenty-fifth United States infantry participated in the shooting affray,' was rejected by a vote of 11 to 2 and the proposition that, in the opinion of the committee the shooting was done by some soldiers belonging td the Twenty-fifth infantry was adopted by a vote of 8 to 4. one senator not voting. Thus it will be seen that every official body which has heard the testimony has decided - that the shooting at Brownsville on the night of the 13th of August. 1906. was the work of soldiers of the Twenty-fifth infantry." Mr. Lodge reviewed essential fea tures of the testimony in the Browns ville affair and said that the bullets found in the houses and the shells in the streets, taken together could have been used in only one rifle, and that was the Springfield new model and there were no new model Springfields in the possession of anyone except the troops of the United States. He spoke of the testimony of the soldiers as constituting "a uniform denial." Mr. Lodge declared that he was bred-up- with a profound sympathy for, and interest in, the negroes of the United States and has always tried to aid and serve them, the bill which he reported, and which passed the house of representatives representing the last attempt made to secure to them their political rights in the south. "I have encountered criticism, odium, and political attack in their behalf, which cannot be said of many of those who outside of this chamber have for one reason or another busied themselves w-ith this affair and sought to make capital out of it. I speak therefore as their friend when I say that no greater misfortune has hap pened to them in late years than this effort to make a race issue out of a case of military discipline." Self-selected champions of these soldiers in various parts of the coun try sought, he said, not for equality before the law, but for special treat mnt for the Brownsville soldiers on the ground of race . "As a friend of the negro race I deplore the agitation which had this end In view," he said, "these soldiers are entitled to the same treatment as soldiers and citizens that white men would be entitled to, nelth- more nor less." He deplored any ap peal to sympathy for criminals, which he said has become the fashion of the time. If action in this matter is to be determined by sympathy, he said, his sympathy would not go to the men who did the shooting, but to the harmless boy who was killed, to the lieutenant of police dangerously wounded and injured for life in the performance of his duty and to the women and children, cowering on the floor while bullets crashed through the thin walls of their dwellings. Brushing aside the question of sym pathy he wished exact justice so far as it could be attained. The crime of these men was made greater because they were United States soldiers em ployed for the protection of the peo ple. He favored the Warner bill which allows the president to restore the in nocent to the army whenever he is satisfied that any of them were blame less. He condemned the Foraker bill which he said attempts to force back Into the army not only innocent men but men who were guilty of a serious crime. He made an exhaustive argu ment on the unconstitutionality of the Foraker bill which obliges the presi dent to re-enlist these soldiers wheth er he thinks they ought to be re-en listed or not. Such an act would be an encroachment upon the constitu tional rights of the president. It would be. subversive of discipline in the army. . HASKELIi

THE WAR ZONE Has Shifted From Balkans to South America. Relations Between Argentine and Brazil Strained. JEALOUS OVER NAVIES Argentine Has Superior Arma ment and Is Hostile. Brazilians Excited Over Atti tude of Sister Republic. Rio Janeiro, Dec. 15. The relations existing today between Brazil and the Argentine republic are distinctly strained as a result of the Jealousy following the alleged activities of each country in the matter of increasing its naval force. The incident of the official telegram said to have been intercepted and pub lished by an ex-cabinet minister of the Argentines adds to the ill feeling which shows no signs of decreasing. Washington, notably the representation j had led tne way and Afu11. know" from Latin-America, is watching with j ledge of the plans to kill Annis deep concern the outcome of the dif- An important witness, Edwin ferences between the Argentine re- Andrews, a member of the Bayside public and Brazil, whose relations.

Only meager information regarding this late incident which seems to have stirred the feeling in Brazil to a high pitch has reached Washington and this is confined to that of an unoffi cial character. It is said that the dis patch referred to passed over the Argentine lines on its way to Santiago, and after being intercepted was hand ed to a man who, being unable to de cipher it, deliberately composed one entirely different in character and con taining a statement of hostile inten tions against Argentina. This alleged fabrication was read before the Argen tine congress in secret session to sup port the vote for armaments. The Brazilian government, when the fact of the "false text came to its knowl edge, sent to Argentina and published in the Brazilian papers the false dis-. patch and the one actually sent, to prove that the dispatch intercepted showed friendliness and not hostility to Argentine. In order to do this, the Brazilian government found it neces sary to publish the key of its secret correspondence with its legation in Santiago. It is said that although this proof was submitted on the 14th of November, no acknowledgment of the mistake has been made by Argen tina to Brazil. Threats made ln the Argentine press over the signature or Dr. Zaballos, tne former minister or foreign affairs, have also- rankled the Brazilians. These were to the effect that Argentina wouid avail herself of her present naval superiority to impose on Brazil tne equivalence of tnelr two Heels and ask for a reduction of the Brazilian ships at present under construction, the latter government now having un der way the building of several large vessels in England. In this matter Brazil's attitude has been one of de fiance, she declaring she would never submit to have her armament voted according to another government's wishes.

Judge Notifies Lawyers Trial Must Proceed Quickly. STATE'S CASE BEGUN. Try to Prove Thornton Was In stigator of Crime. Defense Plans Demonstration in Court To Fire Pistol. Flushing, L. I., Dec. 16. The theory of the state's case outlined to day to the jury in the trial of Thorn ton J. Hains, charged with being a principal with his brother, Captain Hains, in the killing of William E. Annis, is that the defendant was the master mind and leader of an expedi tion to the Bayside Tacht club to en compass the death of Annis. AH through the presentation of the state's case Special Prosecutor White de clared he would show that Thornton I shooting. The police state that John Tonnlng, a Swedish boatman, who knocked the pistol from Captain Hains' hands, and is wanted as a witness by the prosecu tion, can not be found. The direct testimony of the state's witnesses is expected to take only a little time, but the cross-examination will very likely occupy three or four days. As has been outlined, Hains' counsel will endeavor to show that the defendant's drawing of his revolver was an act of defense and not of of fense. The central figure in today's case was the appearance of the state's chief witness, Mrs. William E. Annis, who saw her husband's life taken. The recital of her story on the witness stand, is likely to be the strongest card in- the state's case. Thornton Hains has seemingly no ap prehensions of the outcome of the trial. He said this morning that he had no doubt that the jury would acquit him, and declared that his story on the wit ness stand would not only free him, but would open the doors for his broth er's release. General Peter C. Hains sat with the defendant during the trial and frequently during the case father and son conferred on some point in evi dence. Justice Crane has made it clear to counsel that the taking of testimony must move with the same expedition as the examination of talesmen. The jury will not be locked up during the trial, or at least until all the evidence has been submitted. Reports that the prosecution has tam pered with one of the witnesses ior tne defense have met with prompt denial by the state's attorney. Counsel for Hains said today that it might be necessary to discharge the automatic revolver with blank cart ridges in the court room to demon strate by the rapidity with which the shots are flred that it would have been impossible for the eyewitnesses to prevent Captain Hains from firing more than one shot. The witnesses allege that had not Thornton Hains interfered they -would probably have saved Annis' life. Coun sel said that the automatic revolver fires six shots in less than two seconds. Justice Crane, when court opened, excluded all the witnesses of the tragedy from the court room. On a motion of District Attorney Darrin, Justice Crane said he would not permit Mrs Hains, mother of the defendant, to sit beside her son during the trial. The order does not exclude Mrs. Hains from the court room. Special Prosecutor White outlined the case for the state and stated what -.Hiorin would be submitted. He de clared that seven months before the murder the publisher of the magazine. Recreation, had received letters from Thornton Hains expressing deep seat ed animosity toward employes of the magazine and toward Annis, who was in charge of the advertising depart- Mr. White said also that Hains Otrain TV rfltP to the Dublisher of Re creation two months before the mur der, expressing animus againsi abihs. After describing the location of the Bayside Yacht club and recounting the preparations of Annis for an after noon's pleasure on the water, Mr. white detailed the arrival of Thornton J. Hains and his brother and himself to the Bayside Yacht ciud. On the way to the yachf club land ing the carriage passed a stage, but Thornton directed the hackman to drop back behind it again. Thornton then said to Captain Hains: "We've got him now." ... . , . Throughout Mr. White's story of the tragedy he put Thornton Hains in the position of aiding his brother In the search for Annis and protecting Cap tain Hains while he shot his enemy, afterward expressing approval of the act and avowing his part in it. Justice Crane has been noted that Juror Hardin's father died today. The juror has not been informed. Justice Crane will make tne announcement oi what will be done in the matter at the end of the morning session. Edwin H. Andrews, a broker and member of the Bayside Yacht club. testified to the shooting of Annis. His attention had been attracted by a commotion on the float and he jumped on it as Captain Hams began shooting. The defendant pointed a pistol at him and ordered him back. Annis Doai was in front or tne aocK at tne time and- Captain Hains was on the float and in a croucrfcng position near the edge of the float. Andrews said that after the shooting Thornton Hains sat on the north end of the float and Cap tain Hains was walking up and down near his- brother. Andrews said: "Thornton Hains sat on an upturned boat and he was in conversation with some one. Thornton was smoking a pipe. This was 10 or 15 minutes after the shooting. Mr. stepnens, a club member. standing near the runway, was hav- ng an argument with Thornton Hains. I heard the defendant say, "You are evidently not an American.' "Mr. Stephens saia?: 'we don t do those things in our country. We wipe them out with our fists.' It was then Halm said 'You are evidently not an American.' " ' Counsel Mclntyre had started the cross examination of Andrews, when Justice Crane said he would adjourn court zor recess, but before dolne so would like to confer with counsel at tne bench. A consultation of counsel and court followed. The subject was the death of Juror Jardin's father, word of which had been conveyed to Justice Crane a few minutes before. The Juror was called to the bench and there held an extended conversation with the justice. Afterwards it was announced that Juror Jardin's father had died in Port Jervis. N. T.. Sunday night. The Juror decided that it would not be necessary for him to attend the funeral of his father and the trial will proceed. Recess was ordered. STATE LABOR MEETING.

URGES POSTAL BANKS. Senator Carter WiU Try to Make the Bill Satisfactory. Washington, Dec. 16. Senator Car ter spoke in support of the pos tal savings bank bill. After referring to the various endorsements by political conventions and other or conizations of the neonle of the pos tal savings banks, Mr. Carter said "that while there are only 1,452 sav ings banks, there are more than 61, 000 postoflices, 40.000 of which are money order offices." He declared that postal savings banks are in operation in practically all civilized countries of the world except the United States. He proposed, he said, to offer amendments to the bill re ducing from $1,000 to $500 the amount any person may deposit in nostal banks with interest and from $200 to $100 the amount that may be deposited in any one month ana also to strike out the provision allowing any person to deposit money as trustee. These amendments, he said, would remove three objections that have been made to the bill. NOT BACKING DOWN. Select Committee of the House Will "Do Its Duty." Washington, Dec. 16. That the select committee of the house appointed to recommend action by the house in re gard to the remarks of the president in his annual message on the attitude of congress and toward the secret service is changing its attitude toward the pres ident has been denied by several mem bers of the committee. One member stated that the committee had not re lented and that "it intended to do its duty of the public and the country." He said that the recent utterances supposed to emanate from the White House charging congress with lack of courage had tended to make the com mittee more determined than ever. Chairman Perkins stated after the meeting of the committee that another meeting would be held tomorrow and said he believed the committee would agree before adjournment on Saturday for the holidays.
