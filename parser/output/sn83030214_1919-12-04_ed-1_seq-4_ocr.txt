Railroad Plans Of Mr. W?son Are Unsettled Further Action to Await Hines's Conference With Cummins and Each on Measures Now Pending Message Not a Certainty Officials Still Doubtful Whether Lines Will Be Returned on January 1 WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.?President Wilson will not begin preparation of his special message to Congress on the railroad situation until Director Gen? eral Hines has conferred with Senator Cummins and Representative Esch, chairmen of the Senate and House In? terstate Commerce committees, on the pending railroad bills, it was said to? day at the White House. It was intimated the status of legis? lation might be such that the President would not regard it as necessary to address CongTess on the subject. Lead? ers in Congress are determined to press the bills, but they have expressed doubt that their enactment could be com? pleted before the holidays. Measures Differ on Strikes Each of the measures provides for return of the roads to private opera? tion within a specified time, but they are different in other respects, par? ticularly as to the method of dealing with strikes and lock-outs, and these differences will have to be composed in conference. In view of the President's statement to Congress yesterday, that he ex? pected to treat the railroad question in a separate message, there has been speculation in official and railroad circles as to whether he intended to adhere to his previously announced plan to return the roads to private operation by January 1. It is suggested the President may await action of Congress on the pend? ing legislation. Those at the White House refuse, however, to comment. Cummins Explains Bill The Senate resumed consideration of the railroad bill to-day with Senator Cummins continuing his explanation of the measure. The government has a legal as well as a moral obligation to return the roads in as good condition as when taken over, Senator Cummins said, and it also must pay promptly money owing the roads. Senator Cummins pointed to the in? creased number of railroad employees as cne of the causes of increased cost of operation under Federal control. There were 190,537 more employees last July 1, he said, than in December, 1917, Misapprehension exists over pay in? creases given railroad employees, Sen? ator Cummins said. "While the increase in compensation has generally been thought excessive," he added, "it act? ually has been below that of employees in similar occupations, a little over 40 per cent, in fact." Governor Pardons Eight, , Saves Slayer From Chair Commutes Death Sentence of Westchester Man Who Killed Bystander Accidentally 

ALBANY, Dec. 8.?Governor Smith to-day issued pardons to eight men serving terms in the state prisons and saved the life of a ninth, George D?? nomma, of Westchester, whose death sentence was commuted to life m prisonment. Desomma, while quarreling with an? other man over a girl, shot at him and killed Frank Cunningham, a passerby. Although the Court of Appeals unani? mously affirmed his death sentence, tho Governor acted on the recommendation of the trial judge, the District Attorney and the jury, as well as hundreds of Westchester citizens. Another murderer who received his freedom was Luigi Fillipelli, who was sentenced to die in 1901 for1 the killing of Michael Carrafielfo in?New York City. His sentence was later com? muted to twenty years. Louis Kahn, of New York, who was serving ten years for robbery, will also be re? leased. His arm was crushed in a prison machine, and in exchange he re? ceives the eight years and seven months remaining on his term. Others pardoned are Harry Green berg, convicted for burglary in 1908; Peter Battiglia, robbery, in 1914; Bertha Reiss, abortion, in 1918; James Churchill, second degree murder, in 1902; John Skinner, first degree man? slaughter, in 1912, and Salvatore Vru netto, arson, in 1915. Insurance Companies Contest Only $500,000 Nearly $90,000,000 Paid in Benefits Without Protest, Says Metropolitan Head Out of $90,000,000 paid to benefi? ciaries by life insurance companies last year, only $500,000 was contested in court. This fact was brought out last night by Haley Fiske, president of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, in addressing the meeting of ? the Association of Life Insurance Counsel, at the Waldorf-Astoria. Mr. Fiske said that the face value of the policies now in force totaled $20,000,000,000. and the assets of the companies $6,000,000.000. Of this amount, ho said, $2,000,000.000 was in? vested in bonds, and $2,000,000,000 in railroad securities. He declared the insurance companies were vitally involved in the settlement of the railroad problems, and predicted that unless solution were quickly ef? fected the railroads would facr bank? ruptcy. He declared the Plumb plan was "too ridiculous" to be discussed. Dr. H. C. Wells, medical director of the Mutlal Life Insurance Company, in making a plea to the companies to aid in combating disease, declared that 70 per cent of the school children in the country were physically deficient. Snow Advises Organization Of Artillery Into Brigades 

WASHINGTON, Dec. 3,- Major Gen? eral William J. Snow, chief of field ar? tillery, recommended in his annual re nort, made public to-day, that his office be made permanent and artillery units be organized into brigades for training purposes. Maintenance of adequate fir? ing centers and instruction of officers in special schools and colleges also were recommended. Attached to the document is a report made by a special board ap? pointed by General Pershing in France, which concurred in General Snow's rec? ommendations. Taxes Will Stay Up Until June, Glass Declares Nation Faces Deficit of Nearly $4,000,000,000, Says Secretary of Treas? ury in Request for Funds Greater Economy Urged Congress Requested to Deny Appropriations in New Fields to Lower Expenses WASHINGTON, Dec. 3?No appreci? able reduction in taxes for the next fiscal year is to be thought of, Secre? tary Glass declared in his annual re? port sent to-day to Congress. Govern? ment receipts must be kept at their present figure, ho said, in order to bring government borrowing to an end. Revision of the revenue laws, so as to place a heavier burden of taxes on the normal income, was urged. Mr. Glass declared that the excess profit tax provisions of the present law should be eliminated and the revenue thus sac? rificed be made up from an increase in the taxes of the average income. The Treasury plan seek to raise more revenue from incomes above $1.000, without attempting to disturb incomes of persons whose salaries barely meet living costs, as any change in that tax would only add a burden on a class un? able to bear it. U. S. Faces Big Deficit Facing expenditures estimated at $5,629,486,359 for the year ending June 30, 1920, and $4,473,096,358 for the year ending June 30, 1921, the government must enforce rigid economy, Mr. Glass declared. He placed the deficit for the current year at $3.905,000,000, and for the year ending Juno 30, 1921, at ap? proximately V>, 005,000,000. On this basis, Mr. Glass urged Con? gress to deny "every appropriation for expenditure in new fields." lie said the same policy should obtain until the government had its sinking fund well under way and repayment of the war debt "satisfactorily begun." Mr. Glass charged that excessive government expenditures were "the most vital factors," in increasing the cost of living and argued that it was urgently necessary to keep clown public expenses for this reason as well as because of the drain on the taxpayers, j For New Revenue Laws The present revenue laws need revis? ing to meet new conditions, he said. He referred particularly to the excess profits tax laws, which he described as being "objectionable even as a war? time expedient." It would bo still more objectionable in peace time, he added. "Less harmful forms" of deriving funds for the government should be em? ployed, the Secretary said, adding that the excess profits tax had been respon? sible for much of the increase in living costs, because it had been passed on to the consumer. "It encourages wasteful expenditures, puts a premium on overcapitalization and a penalty on brains," the Secretary continued. "It discourages new ventures and new enterprises and establishes old ventures in their monopolies. In many instances it acts as a consumption tax, is added to the cost of production upon which profits are figured, determining prices. It has been, and will, so long as it remains on the statute books, con? tinue to be a material factor in the increased cost of living." In this connection Mr. Glass also urged redrafting of the revenue laws to prevent the evasion of Federal taxes through the investment of wealth in the obligations of states and municipali? ties. He said laws should bo enacted which would compel the report ing of such incomes, although they arc wholly tax exempt, and that that sum, with other income of an individual, should bo computed as the basis for assessing Fed? eral taxes on the amount derived from taxable sources. Discusses Aid for Europe Relations between conditions in Eu? rope and those in the United States were discussed also by Mr. Glass. He said that, undoubtedly, there was a very great need in Europo for financial as? sistance, but that the situation had been much exaggerated. "We must all feel deep sympathy for Europe to-day," he said, "but we must not nllow our sympathy to warp our judgment and, by exaggerating Europ? ean financial needs, make them more difficult to fill. The problem of fin? ancing Europe belongs largely to the exporter, because industries cannot he reopened without raw stocks. Govern? ment financial assistance in the past and talk of future government or bank? ing aid to finance exports have appar? ently led our industrial concerns to the erroneous expectation that their war profits, based largely on exports, will continue indefinitely without any risk on their part. To them will fall the profits of exports, and upon them will fall the consequences of failure to make the exports." The Treasury will continue its policy, in effect since the armistice, to restore private initiative and remove govern? mental control and interference with respect to the nation's foreign trade, Mr. Glass said. Only through this means, he argued, could a "healthy economic life bo gained." He added that removal of any influence by the government should provide the incen? tive for American commerce to go into the world markets and establish itself. Ratification of the peace treaty will measurably stimulate export trade, Mr. Glass declared, because operation of the pact would eliminate numerous political risks and provide a surer in? vestment busis. Closely related to any activities of the government in foreign trade is the subject of incorporated government agencies, withdrawal of which Mr. Glass strongly urged. He said their "manifest weaknesses" were proof sufficient that such arrangements were not happy ones for the government nor for the persons charged with adminis? tration of the corporations. While not saying that any of the agencies created during the emergencies of war hail been guilty of wastefulness, Mr. Glass pointed out that there was no objec? tive such as business profits to hold expenditures down. On the other hand, officers managing the agencies operate

Honors Paid Memory of Ericsson and Delamater Tho eightieth anniversay of the meeting of Cornelius H. Delamater and John Ericsson, marine engineers of Scandinavian extraction, whoso influ? ence on naval construction was pro? found, WBS observed last night at a meeting at the Engineering Societies' Building on West Thirty-ninth Street. The meeting, which commemorated also the thirtieth anniversary of the death of the two naval constructors and inventors, wa3 held under the aus? pices of the Union League Club, the New York Historical Society, the En? gineers' Club of New York, the Amer? ican-Scandinavian Foundation and ten other organizations.

Ekengren, Swedish Minister at Washington; As? semblyman Charles Begin jr., and II. F. J. Porter. Among the debts which modern ships owe Delamater and Ericsson are screw propulsion and gun turrets, the latter being used first on Ericsson's Monitor. Hospital Fund Drive Ends $814,483 Pledged and Rest of Million is Hoped For With $814,483.90 subscribed in its $1,000,000 campaign for the city's forty six non-municipal hospitals, the United Hospital Fund was officially closed last night in order not to interfere with other charity campaigns scheduled and under way. Fund leaders hope the amount needed to reach $1,000,000 will be obtained by an unofficial canvass. At a luncheon yesterday at the Law? yers' Club subscriptions of $47,406 were announced, including $1,000 each from H. H. Rogers and the Title Guar? antee and Trust Company. At the Waldorf a total of $50,007 was re? ported, including $5,000 from Mrs. Thomas F. Ryan, $2,500 from Mrs. 11. McK.

Merchants Discuss Plans for Big Art Exhibition Annual Display About Eas-i ter Time Is Proposed in Which All Association Members Will Take Part Robert G. Cooke, president of the Fifth Avenue Association, at a lun? cheon at the Biltmore yesterday for new members, said that plans to make Fifth Avenue the scene each year of a great art exhibition in which all the merchants of the thoroughfare would aid are being seriously considered. Mr. Cooke said that Fifth Avenue as a section has already been regard? ed as a great art center, and that thus far the suggestion has been to have a unified exhibition, to last one week, just before Easter, or, if necessary, later in the spring. "It has been suggested," Mr. Cooke explained, "that the fundamental basis might be a uniform color scheme of window decoration which would tie the avenue together, in connection with a window display of all the different kinds of objects, preferably those of most merit, in all the shops. This docs not necessarily mean pictures and statues, though neither should be ex? cluded. "Each shop could dlsp'ay Its most artistic goods," he contiuned, "no mat? ter what the character of the shop. The colors of our city flag?blue and yellow?might be used as a basis. In the Public Library and in some of the galleries of art there might be collec? tions of unusual interest. The hotels might make some sort of special effort. We hope this subject will be taken up for general discussion." Mr. Cooke related in detail the ac? complishments achieved by the asso? ciation prior to, during and after the war, among which, he said, were zone legislation, the ordinance restricting signs on Fifth Avenue, limitation of parades, the ordinance prohibiting peddlers, and a general betterment of traffic, which, he said, still needs im? provement. "There are two more features," he said in thip connection, "of our pro? gram that I desire to mention. One refers to the long-continued sore spot in Forty-second Street caused by the signs on the two northern corners. The time has gone by when any one influence should be allowed to impose its deteriorating will on everybody around. Every member of the asso? ciation shoulcf join in the renewed campaign to bring down those signs." Mr. Cooke presented to A. Sulka, Al? bert L. Henderson and Clarence Law prizes donated by Michael Dreicer for having obtained more new members than any other committee?sixty three. Among those who spoke were Will? iam Cappert, of "The Musical Courier"; J. G. Tarbell, Bruce Barton and Dr. Ernest M. Stires, of St. Thomas's Church, Fifty-third Street and Fifth Avenue. Mr. Tarbell urged the asso? ciation to prevent the building of "un? seemly apartment houses" on upper Fifth Avenue, saying that it would de? stroy Fifth Avenue's beauty. It was announced that the book com? mittee of the Art War Relief would use the $1,900 paid by Colonel Michael Friedsam for an autographed copy of Childe Hassam's picture, "The Avenue of the Allies," to equip a room in a school in Brussels, Belgium, The pic? ture was presented by Colonel Fried? sam to Governor Smith, and the Gor ham Company artistically inscribed the facts of the presentation on the picture. Governor Smith will hang it among the paintings in the Capitoi at Albany. Hylan's Transit Views Changing, Says Hedley Mayor Becoming Reasonable, He Thinks; Monday Was Biggest Subway Day Frank Hedley, president of the In terborough, and Job Hedges, receiver of the New York Railways Company, yesterday declared their belief that Mayor Hylan's attitude on traction matters was changing, and that the Mayor and city officials were coming around to a just and reasonable solu? tion of the transit situation. When President Hedley was asked about the offers of Hedges and Lindley M. Garrison, B. R. T. receiver, for a meeting with the Mayor and the Mayor's action in referring the matter to the Board of Estimate, he said: "The general atmosphere is clearing up. It looks better than it has foe some time past." Hedley said that if Mayor Hylarj did not take steps to ameliorate pre?. ent conditions before the opening of the Legislature, it was hopH the Leg? islature would do something fair ani equitable. Last Monday saw the largest sal? of subwa tickets in the history of th? Interhorough. Hedley said. That da 2,0G9,000 were sold.
