Panama, Cable: Over 100 men were killed or wounded at Das Obispo, fif teen niilos from here, by tho explo sion of forty tons of dynamite. The men who were killed were part of the huge force engaged lu making tho Culebra cut, at the beginning of which is the settlement of Bas Obispo. Hero was tho headquarters and the supply depot for tho operations in progress there. The rock hi the Cu lebra cut is the hardest yet encoun tered In digging the canal, and, con sequently. a greater amount of ex plosive was kept on luind there. It is supposed that familiarity had caused the workmen to be careless In handling the powder. Contractors here say the men should not have tried to make a blast with forly tons. The excavation of the Culebra cut is now going on and the dirt Is flying by rapid train loads from five dif ferent levels. Counting those made by tne Kreuch suitable for tracks there are ten levels. Terrace above ter race they rise to the view, with hills. and trees and valleys beyond them a landscape of tremendous interest and activity. There are continual explos ions of dynamite and powder blasts. Tho blast holding the record for size and results contained 27 tons ol explosives. Tho men were trying to surpast that mark. All around" air drills and steam drills are making holes in the rocks to admit tho dy namite and powder. Great cranes are hoisting their heavy loads; oc casional hill slides are filling the gul lies and covering the tracks; running streams and standing pools add. to tho variety of tho problem; engines, for various phases of the work, are puffing and snorting and doing their master's bidding. All this was going on when the disastrous blast oc curred. For a moment the thousands of la borers, foremen and engineers thought only that one section of the force had made another "shot" and pre pared to remove the debris. In a few seconds, howover the air was filled with the shrieks of shattered human beings. The field hospital staff nnd equip ment were wholly Inadequate to cope with the emergency. The doctors Im mediately on the grounds hastily passed the dead by and soucht for signs of life In those obviously hurt the worst. To those they gave first attention, while the American fore men and engineers gave hasty aid to others less dangerously wounded. Washington, Spoclal: In one of the most vitriolic messages ever transmit ted to Congress President Roosevelt Tuesday reiterated his denial that there was anything questionable about the transaction involving the purchase of the Pauamn Canal property by tho United States. Tho message is. In a sense, an am plification of the lottor sent to William D. Foulke. of Indiana, at Hot Springs, Va.. last month, and is tho product of tho Joint efforts of tho President, mem bers of his Cabinet and others who in their official capacity assisted in the consummation of the transfer of the waterway to this Government. The President adds Joseph Pulitzer, the owner and publisher of the New York World, to his Ananias Club, and announces that Attorney-General Bon aparte has under consideration the question of prosecuting him for alleged criminal libel. The President In recent years has employed some very virile language in expressing his ideas or opinions in his messages to Congress, but ho probably reached the climax in his latest mes sage. He undoubtedly was boiling with In dignation when he wrote the message, as may be Judged from tho use of the following terms: "Scurrilous and li belous In character; concocted with a view of possible blackmail; string of Infamous lies; lying and libelous edi torials; guilty of criminnl ofTense; blackening the good name of the Am erican people; vlllfier of the American people; wantonly and wickedly black ens character" and "wrongdoing of the basest and foulest kind." Most of this Rooseveltlan philippic is directed at Mr. Pulitzer, primarily on account of the recent editorial ut terances upon the canal matter and his effort to demonstrate that tho Presi dent 'was guilty of misrepresentation in statements contained in his letter to Foulke. and, secondarily, because of the World's hostile attitude toward him In tho last year or so. There was but a small attendance In the Senate and the clerk hurried through this message, the accompany ing papers and exhibits not being rend at all. Over in the House more atten tion was paid to the document. The latest development in the canal "IK

This they did without resistance and no shots came from the forts on land. Naturally the people of Curacao, who have long been clamoring for ac tivity on the part of the Dutch Gov ernment, are greatly rejoiced over this evidence that Holland has at last begun active measures against Vene zuela. The opinion is held here that the Venezuelan Government, In the ab sence of President Castro, will not go so far as to tire upon the Dutch warships, which. In view of the fact that Venezuela Is practically without a navy, hold the Venezuelan ports at their mercv.

Washington, Special: The House has unanimously passed a resolution to investigate and roport on that por tion of tho President's message re lating to appropriations and secret service men. Both Houses of Congress are en raged In consequence of that part of the message which they construed as casting a reflection on their integrity. In providing for tho maintenance of the secret servico bureau at the last preceding session. It was expressly provided that none of the men thus engaged should be transferred to any other department, by executive order or otherwise, for the performance of duty. That action was taken obvious ly with tho intention of curbing the propensity of tho President to Insti tute Investigation of alleged derelic tion on his own account, and he evi dently nccepted It as justification for reprisal. "The chief argument In favor of the provision," says the President In his offending document, "was that the congressmen did not themselves wish to be Investigated by secret service men. Very little of such Investigation has been done in the past; but It is true that the work of the secret ser vice agents was partly responsible for the indictment and conviction of senator and a congressman for land frauds in Oregon. I do not believe that It Is In the public interest to pro tect criminals in any branch of tho public service." Society Girl to Wed Jap.

The biggest difference in a party vote is shown In an increase for Bryan or 1.315.211 over the total vote cast In 1901 for Alton B. Parker, the Democratic candidate. Taft received 14.190 votes more than were polled for President Roosevelt in 1904. and Debs ran 4 5,3 OS ahead of his predecessor on tho Socialist ticket. The heaviest loss Is shown by the Populists, who, with tho same candi dates, registered S3.312 votes less this year than In 1904, whon their total was 117.135. New York. S70.070: Pennsylvania. 745.779. and Illinois. G29.932. gave Taft the greatest number of votes among the states, while as to Bryan, the ordor was New York.
