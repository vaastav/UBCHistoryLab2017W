In consequence of the competition steam ship lines are handling freight which originates as far west as Chicago, and in some instances even as far west ward as Jlinnesota points, this being carried by rail to one of the great Atlantic ports, loaded into steamships and carried via the canal to tne pa cific coast at rates lower than it could be carried directly westward to the coast from the points of origin. It may be noted in this connection, that not much now is being said regarding free tolls for American ships. Ship owner know how to make money w.lth their vessels.

It is reported that the largest co operative wheat tales agency in the world, which, according-to its organ izers, will handle 10.00'.000 bushels in its first year, bats beon formed at a, meeting of six competitive organ izations represent!? ten states. The new organisation Is known as the American wheat growers association and was formed at a meeting of trus tees of the Northwest wheat growers' association representing five states, and the trustees of five other i co operative bodies representing five oth er states. The states represented at the meeting were: Oregon Washing ton, Idaho. Montana,. Xorth Dakota, Karasas. Nebraska, Colorado, Okla homa and Texas. An organization of such magnitude should be able to fix the price at which wheat shall be, sold and must do so if it be of benefit to the pro ducer. Agriculture is the only Indus try In the world that permits the purchasers of its products to set tht price. The world must have the wheat pro duced in the above named states and will . pay for it whatever prjee lt-is compelled to pay. When the farmer shall be in a position to name the price at which, he will sell his crops, he need not bother his head abs-ut freight rates, elcvatortharges or any thing of that sort. He will charge all such expenses to the overhead and the consumers wiil pay them just as is done in every line of business except farming. ' Labor unions fix-the wages of their members. Manufacturers, merchants. oil men all name the price at which they will sel to the public and the public pays or dooa. without. There is nothing to prevent the farmer from doing; the same. That he can do so has been demonstrated by the fruit growers of California and, Florida. And their products are not a necessity in the sense that wheat is. The public may do without fruit; but ft must have bread. If congress kyonestly desire to ex- tend financial aid to the farmers it cannot do better than to supply thorn with funds sufficient to enable them to establish a remunerative prif e for the products of their labor. The farmer needs to make money rather than borrow It. He cannot do this while somebody else names the price at which he must sell, nor can he in many cases repay his loan.

When the session has ended the people probably will find themselves confronted with the usual number of bills payable. When ever there is a lowering of rates it usually is accomplished by raising the valuation, still leaving the same or an increased amount to pay. The people, themselves really are re sponsible for the taxes. They insist that certain things be done which can not be accomplished without money.

AMERICAN SOLVESJ"VMP PROBLEM Washington. D. C. Pec. 8. liaising water from one level to a higher level at the minimum. cost and greatest ef ficiency has been a problem, of the ages. Now it is said that it has been solved by an invention shortly to be tested in Washington. ' Thomas tiaskell Allen, an American by birth and a graduate of an Amer ican university, is the inventor. Mr. Allen is now a British subject and lives in Lo .do.i where he is the head of a firm of engineers, i ut if his in vention, -whic' he calls the hydrauto mat the water self-raiser proves to be til that is claimed for it, England will not be permitted to claim entire credit for him and. his accompiisn rnent. Sir Oliver Lodge has investigated the hydrautomat and prepared a long technical report in which he ranks the dawice as ont, of the greatest inven tions the world has ever known and expresses his amazement that it was not hit upon centuries ago. When the news of the marvel first reached this country, official repre sentatives inJLondon were instructed to look Into it, and upon the reports mads to Washington the bureau oi weights and measur.s proceeded to build a workii.e; model here. Mr. Allen recently conferred with government officials and will return in a short time when the tests are to be marie. Meanwhile another experimental model has been installed in a New York office-building and is said to be operating successfully. Briefly described, the hydrautomat Is a device that raises water to any desired height autor.iatically, the wa ter itself furnishing the power. Once installed it will continue to function steadily witl-ot.. interruption and withoirt any attention until it wears out. That sounds like perpetual mo tion, a problem that has never been solved althd' inventors have worked at it for centuries with so little success that whenevew one comes forward with the claim that at last he has made the great discoveiy he is looked npon as acandldate for the booby hatch. But the hydrautomat is per petual motion, it is said, in so far as it will continue to operate as long as the flow ot water continues and the machine -holds together. Moreover, it will work efficiently when the flow of water is so slight that it could rot be utilized in any other way. Also it may be constructed on a small scale adaptable to the re quirements oi. a -farmer who would use it on a small creek to raise water for irrigating purposes and to de velop power to run his machinery ana lighting plant, or it may be built on a scale sufficiently large to furnish the water supply for a large city. First r of Water for Power. Obviou-sly the first usi of water for mechanical purposes involved leading the water from a stream or other source for use at another place. One of - the' primitive devices for raising water from a stream -was the noria. which consisted of a; large up'right framework l'1-?. a wheel,- placed , so that t; flow ox; the current turned it on its axis. To the periph ery of the wheel were attached hinged buckets. which were often earthen jars tied, on the f -mo, and which v-re (partly filled as they dipped In the stream and upon being carried to the top were emptied by a tripping device in to a trough w-hicll led the water away on the higher level.. Later Archimedes c?veloped his screw, which consisted of a coil of pipe abou. a cylinder, set a consider able angljvfrom the Vertical. Tp run this a v. ter wheel or tur' ne was necessary. Theoretically water could be raised to any height la this man ner, but practically it required too much power, the gearing of wheels complicated the work, and there were other objections. - Thef hydraulic ram was more efficient and more practical and the principle has been widely ap plied. Still another automatic machine li the windmill, "but ""It 'is complicated and more or less unwieldy. However, the great objection to- it Is that.it operates only when -tne wind blows, and the wi.id has a way of being con trary. It bloweth not only where it listeth, as the Bible says, but when. every day, and that this mechanism would - servs - to pump water to the highest stories i lew York skyscrap ers quickly and cheaply, t Present pumps are expensive and must be run by coal or gasoline and help must, be employed to operate them. A hy drautomat would keep a - continuous stream cf water passi- . from the ground to the highest story. There are of course millirnof acres of land in many parts of- the world which could be made productive if properly irrigated. As a rule water can be made available if it can be raised very slightly.

Mr. Allen's invention, it is claimed, meets and overcomes the objections to all these devices. The hydrautomat is described as tention to the important part that which the power of water and air al ter nt work by shocjt or- impetus as in national expenditures. The president pointed out that this is not a normal part of the government's functions. After expressing . concern at the startling increase ofstate, county and municipal indebtedness the president said: "I am fearful lest this condi tion may be. in part attributable to the expenditures made by the govern ment pursuant to Its federal aid laws, as many of these laws - require stat contributions aa a prerequisite to the extension 'of the federal aid." In telling congress tuaf""these ex traneous activities have flowed from laws enacted pursuant to popular de mand." the Chicago' New says the president is moro courteous than ac curate. He. might have said that in some of these cases skillful campaign ing by well-oiganised minorities con trived to confront congress with clever imitations of popular demands tha were accepted as genuine by the Impressionable-' lawmakers. Thus the policy of projecting federal aid into purely state or local affairs has been tarried to extraordinary lengths and is still being pressed in novel direc tions. The News continues as follows- If the patient taxpayer should take the trouble to reflect that federal aid brings him nothing except what he pays for, since his contributions to the cost ot governmental activities flow to Washington as readily as they flow Into local public treasuries, he w-ouf be less ready to think he is be stowing benefit at no cost to himself thru federal aid. This aid. which stimulates the lesser governments in to new tax-raising adventures, oper ates directly to raise all taxes. Offers of money from a distance that have to be accepted everywhere on the terms laid down if each section of the country is to get its share of fed eral aid are extraordinarily effective in winning increases in state and local taxation. Manifestly those who mis take federal aid for a benign system of getting something for nothing are badiy deceived. . - 1 the caue tt the water ram. It itopn not require thef machinery necessary to operate the - Archimedtan screw. Once Installed it requires no attention to keep it working smoothly. In other words, the initial cost of building and installing the device- is the only ex pense involved." . ot Turbine in Any Sense. The hydrautomat is not a turbine In any sense. However, when water has been raised by. it to a desired height, the water may be permitted to fall and operate a turbine or sim ilar mechanism, thus developing pow rer which can be utilized as desired to run machinery airectly or to be con verted with electric energy. But it is not intended to do the work of a tur bine. Great waterfalls such as Nia gara or Zambesi exert tremendous power which may be utilized to oper ate turbines and develop great sources of energy. The hydrautomat develops energy from streams which now slow ly and the power of which hereTofore has not been utilised. . Simplicity, is its first characteristic. The principle Involved is that of water flowing thru a pipe into a metal cyl inder. Now as the water enters the cylinder H, naturally forces out the air, which escapes thru a pipe open ing from the top and- leading to an other cylinder, which is filled with water. As the air enters the second cylinder ti-s Wa.ter which it, contains is forced out thru a pipe to a third cylinder placed at a higher level. Thus the pressure of the water flowing intoi the first cylinder Is utilized to force the water from the level of the second to the third. The actio:, is purely au tomatic the compressed air acting as a piston Technical detailsare givn as to the actual operation' of the hydranto mat that are of Interest chiefly to the scientifically inclined. To thaaverage person, the interesting points are that once it is started ,it will run auto matically for years, thac it works with little or no strain ock the pipes, and that It Is fool proof. It is Interesting to know what the inventor himself thinks of his device. Mr. Allen says that a hydrautomat' measuring two feet in diameter -and fifteen feet in height will pump some thing like 70,000 gallons of water THE
