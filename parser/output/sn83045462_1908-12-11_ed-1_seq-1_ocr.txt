FIRST SITE TO BE TAKEN Representatives of Companies Say the Building Can Be Completed Within Ninety Days. "A site having hern selected and having hoen approved by the Commissioners. no p..wer further remains in them to question that site," was -the declaration of Justice Barnard in the District Supreme Court this morning in deciding the controversy over the location of the Soutli Washington railway station. The contention of District Commissioner Morrow that his colleagues had given their assent to the location of the substation of the Philadelphia. Baltimore and Washington Railroad Company at 14th and Water streets, and were bound thereby. and that they were unjustified in attempting a revocation in selecting another site near 7ih street and Maryland avenue southwest was sustained. The court dismissed the petition for a mandatory injunction tiled by ilio District Commissioners. The petition, although filed in the name of the Commissioners, bore only the signatures of H. B. F. Macfarland and llenry D. West. Attorneys McKenney & Flannery. representing the railroad company, stated today that the company is ready and willing to go ahead with the erection of the substation under the plans heretofore subinitied to the Commissioners, or any reasonable modifications, as soon as the Commissioners will approve and issue a permit. They said the building could be completed in ninety days. Location the Only Question. After a long review- of the bill of complaint and the answer of the Philadelphia, viutiimmv and Washington Railroad Com pany. Justice Barnard, in a "written opinion. says: "The whole question in controversy in this case seems to be the place for building the substation required under the act of February -8, lt*Kt; and perhaps some confusion has arisen by reason of the presentation of plans for the building at the same tirre that the question of site was presented for approval. "The place for the building of this substation was a matter of legislation by Congress, and the act might have precribed the exact location, but instead of doing that, it provided that the location should be north of the Long bridge, and the exact spot was to be determined bv the defendant in the first instance, for it was to be a convenient location: and after ii was selected or suggested by the defendant, it was to be approved by the ?"ommissioners. Such, I think, is the fair construction of that provision of the statute, with respect to the location of this substation. "Congress having determined that it was to be located north of the Long bridge, it would hardly seem to be within tee intention of the act that it could be placed so far east, or northeast, as 41% sireet or 7tn street: and it is conceded that the suggested location at 14th and Water street* is the most convenient place that can be properly described as nortii of the Long bridge. "The bill herein is not filed by the municipality known as the District of Columbia. but is filed by the Commissioners. ?ho are the executive officers of that municipality. They are purely creatures of statute, as well as the defendant, and neither can have rights or powers that are not expressly granted or cannot he fairly implied from or incident to the powers which are expressly granted. "The power of locating the substation in the first instance was vested in Concress, as tiie legislative body for tiiis District. It could prescribe not only the place but the conditions on which the r ght to build the substation should depend; and the only duty or power that was vested in the Commissioners was i that the site, within the limitations of ' tlte act. was to be approved by them. They could not waive the provision of the statute requiring the location to be north of the Long bridge. Neither was power given to them as Commissioners t'? bring the defendant into court because of the failure of the defendant to select a convenient location; but a failure in this regard would have to he considered by Congress, which retained the right to alter, amend or repeal the act at any time. Dispute as to Approval. "The point is made in argument by counsel for the complainants that the Commissioners never did approve the site for this substation, because, it is claimed, tne plans submitted embraced certain portions of the public grounds being part or Potomac Park, which was not under their control; and that they only approved so far as related to the ground i mbraced in the right of way of the defendant. "It appears, however, that the Commisci.tr.OPo on.iart.ioL- ,-? *..,1 ,li.l nrrvt LA I o uwu< ? *.*? *,'.1. <ui>] II1IJ k, ' Jar as the Secretary of War had the authority to convey the same, jurisdiction over a portion of Potomac Park, which did embrace t ie whole site on which it was proposed to erect the substation, and a considerable portion besid--s; and while there may be some question as to the power of tiie Secretary of War to transfer jurisdiction as to the care of tins part of the park to the Commissioners, it docs rot seem to me that that question is material. The title to that portion of the park still remains in the I'nited States, but its care was. or was attempted to be. ^iven to tlie pistrict Commissioners at their request, and it does not seem to nie that they can. on their own motion, raise the question of authority for tills transfer; but even if the contention of counsel for the complainants in this respect is correct, that such transfer was made without any authority and has no validity in law, still it apjiears in the record, beyond question, as shown by the indorsements on tiie plans and the correspondence, and especially by ti e Tetter of July ,'i. lints addiessed to the rontisel of tiie defendant, that the site for the erection of tills substation was approved by tiie Commissioners. "Bv this letter of July :t. IPoS. the Commissioners undertake to revoke their approval; and certainly if tiie site had nevei been approved there would be nothing to revoke; and their action in that respect forecloses any claim on their pari that tlie site had not been approved. "Not only did they undertake to revok< the approval by said letter of July ;: l'.MNi. but they undertook, by that lettei and action, to point out another site whirl t te railroad company dium select at at rarli day for tin it approval. No Power of Revocation. "Having approved the site tirst selected have they any author.ty or power of re vocation, or is tlielr power and duty tin der this a<-t o' t'oneress. in relation t< fc*' ?;Uiujcd on Fourteenth i'uge.)

Bromwell Why He Demolished Structure '"MY AUTHORITY, PRESIDENT*' ' Officer in Charge of Public Buildings Acts on Mere Order of Chief Executive. The old Pennsylvania railroad station J was torn down by Col. Bromwell. superintendent ot" public buildings and grounds, on the mere order of President Roosevelt and without authority of law, according to testimony before the House appropriations committee during the preparation of the legislative appropriation bill. The hearings are now public. Representative Burleson of Texas took the lid off the pot by asking Col. Broni- J well if lie hadn't asked in the last legislative bill for a watchman for the old Pennsylvania railroad station. "I think I did." the colonel answered. "but I have not had any occasion to use it because I have torn down tlie railroad station." "What!" Jlr. Burleson exclaimed. "Torn down the railroad station? By what authority did you tear it down?" By Authority of the President. "By authority of the President of tlie United States," tlie army officer replied. Col. Bromwell, in reply to questions as ! to where lie obtained tiie money for the j purpose, explained that he had advertised for the removal of the building and for the removal of the materials, the eontractor receiving all the old material in the building. "Who directed you to do that?" Mr. Burleson inquired. "The President of the I.'nited States," ?.-r the colonel again answered. At this point Representative Eivingston of Georgia interposed a facetious interruption, asking Mr. Burleson if thut didn't ' satisfy him. "Well." Col. Bromwell interjected "it Of satisfied me." and the committee indulged IIL in a broad, collective smile. III "Was that the sole authority for the!"" destruction of the building?" Mr. Burle- ' son asked, continuing his questions. "It was," the colonel replied; "that was _ ray authority;**- Cell Admits Law Is Lacking. "Did the government own the building?" Representative Gillett of Massachusetts wanted to know. Col. Bromwell explained that the railroad had built it, IIA but when the road abandoned it the building was turned over to the government. "Do you know of any law on the Sayi statute books- that authorizes any executive officer to sell any of the property of the United States of that character?real estate?" Representative Tawney of Minnesota, chairman of the committee, Inquired. COJ "No. sir," the colonel replied frankly, adding, somewhat to the astonishment of the committee, "I called the attention of the higher authorities to that fact, and -^es' I received an order to tear the building down." No Necessity for Bemoval. Col. Bromwell admitted that the building might have been used for government storage purposes, and also said, in ' 1 reply to a question by Chairman Taw- geru ney, that he knew "of no immediate n?- the I cessity for the removal of the structure." l?as i "But if it had been used for storage it Cosl ! could have been used to good purpose has and great economy to the government," that suggested Mr. Burleson. "It would have saved the rent of some of the buildings " that we are now renting, would it not?" syst "It might and then It might not," the and colonel replied. dica "Well." Mr. Burleson said wearily, n?o, "We will let it go at that," GEN.

"How much, iiien, is a man better than sheep?" the rebuke of Christ to the liarisees, is cited in a rebuke to the altimore and Ohio Railroad Company in i opinion handed down today by Justice afford of the District Supremo Court. The decision sustains a demurrer by F.

"To continue tlie analogy," says Justice afford, "the employe, on entering into ie contract to accent benetits in full, it ; accepts them at ail, is in the position the borrower wihen agreeing to pay sury, while the employe, when aeceptg the benefits after injury, is in the isition of the borrower when actually lying the usury.

SAYS LET PEOPLE DECIDE Chairman Smith Prepares Amendment to Sims Bill. PROVIDES A SPECIAL ELECTION | ???? : Omits Reference to Qualification of Those to Cast Ballot?AntiSaloon League Letter. It tan he positively stated that the members of the House District committee are unanimously in favor of leaving the great question of prohibition In the District of Columbia to a vote of the citizens of the municipality. This information was secured today, on authority, at headquarters of the committee. The only disagreement among the members of that body is with reference to the suffrage qualification to be imposed on 1 those who are permitted to vote on the i burning question of whether the National capital shall be wet or dry. Representative Smith of Michigan, chairman of the committee, has prepared an amendment to the Sims bill for absolute prohibition in the District, or to any other bill for the same purpose which may be taken up by the committee, providing for a- referendum on the liquor question. < Text of Proposed Amendment. The proposed amendment follows: "That the question of the prohibition ' of the sale, manufacture, barter, giving I away or furnishing intoxicating liquors I liv mmnratinnc and narsons within the boundaries of the District of Columbia, as provided for in this act, is hereby referred to the male voters of the District of Columbia who are over twenty-one years of age and who have been bona lide residents of the District for six months immediately preceding the passage and approval of this act by the President, at a special election to be held for the purpose as herein provided. "That the Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia is hereby appointed and constituted, ex officio, a genera! board of election to carry into effect the provisions of this act and are authorized to tlx a. date for holding the said special election not later than thirty days after the passage and approval of this act. and give notice thereof in all of the daily newspapers of general circulation published in the District of Columbia, and to establish suitable and convenient polling places for the purpose of receiving the ballots of the voters; to appoint a hoard for each polling place, consisting of three persons, one to be known as inspector and the other two as clerks, who, before entering upon the discharge of their dutlts. shall take an oath for the faithful discharge ot' their duties: said board shall be the judges of the qualification of voters; the cierks shall each keep a poll list of the names of all persons voting and the ballots shall be received by the inspector in the presence of the board and placed in a ballot box to be kept for that purpose. Counting the Ballots. "The polls shall be kept open from 9 o'clock a.m. until 3 o'clock p.m.. and after the close thereof the board shall immediately count the ba'-lots cast and tally the same upon two sheets, one to be used by each clerk: after the ballots have been counted and tallied, the said poll lists and tally sheets shall be sealed securely in a package and kept by the Inspector in his possession, to be opened at a meeting with all of the said inspectors, in the presence of the board of Commissioners, on a day and place to be fixed by the Commissioners. not exceeding five days after the holding of said election, and when the election returns, as reported by said inspectors. shall be canvassed, the result shall be at once reported by said board of Commissioners to the President of the i nited States Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives, for further legislation, if necessary, in accordance with the will of the people." The amendment also describes the form , of ballot to be used. Qualification of Voters. Mr. Smith has purposely omitted any reference to the qualification of voters, save that of being more than twenty-one years of age, believing that in view of the conflicting opinions of members of the District committee on the subject it would be better to leave the question open to be settled by tbe full committee at a regular session, the result to be incorporated as a part of the amendment. Mr. -Smith is also very much pleased as the result of a letter received by him this morning from William H. Anderson, acting legislative superintendent of the AntiSaloon League of America, who has opened headquarters in the Bliss building. What Anti-Saloon League Wants. In his letter Mr. Anderson says in part: "The Anti-Saloon League is not asking for prohibition for the District. The league is a practical organization for securing results. It aims to go no farther and no faster than a normal public sentiment will sustain. Believing the demonstration and development of such sentiment under legislation allowing the peo; pie of the District to close saloons In their respective localities Is wiser than ; premature congressional enactment of ab1 so ute prohibition, the Anti-Saloon League, j nationally and in the District, is asking J at this time for a reasonable local option : or home rule measure." Incidentally Mr. Smith expects to inj troduce today the Commissioners' bill , sent to the Senate earlier In the week providing for an enlargement of the license zones and an increase of the license tax. This measure is regarded by a portion. at least, of the liquor interests as a prohibition measure.

Whereas, there was contained in the sundry civil appropriation bill which passed Congress at its last session and became a law a provision in reference to the employment of the secret service in the Treasury Department, and. Whereas in the message of the President of the United States to the two houses of Congress, it salt stated in reference to that provision: "It is not too much to say that this amendment has been of benefit only, and could be of benefit only, to the criminal clalses"; and it was further stated: "The chief argument in favor of the provision was that the congressmen did not themselves wish to be investigated by secret service men": and it was further stated: "But if this is not considered desirable a special exception could be made in the law. nrohibitina the use of the secret service force in investigating members of Congress. It would I* far better to do this than to do what actually was done, and strive to prevent or at least to hamper effective action again ft" criminals by the executive branch of the government." Now. therefore, be it resolved. That a committee of five members of Congress of this House be appointed by the Speaker to consider the statements contained In the message, of the President and report to the House what action. If any. should be taken In reference thereto.-RESOLUTIONS 

ADOPTED BY HOUSE. With unanimity of sentiment and dignity of demeanor, the House of Representatives today took the first step toward carying out its determination to rebuke the President of the United States for language used by hint with reference to members of Congresd in his annual message of 1908. A resolution was adopted referring thd objectionable passage in the message | concerning the secret service to a committee of five to consider and decide w'liat final action should be taken by the House. A resolution similar to that passed by the House will be adopted by the Senate early next week. It will provide for the appointment of a committee to recommend a course of action relative to the President's utterances. There was no heat, no passion, no ran cor. no individual resentment apparent in the formal proceedings that began a few minutes after the House met at noon and that were soon over. Personality, the anger of man to man. the feeling of soreness and of self seemed to merge, wholly | and absolutely, into the spirit of legislative proceedings, which, passing all anticipations. seemed stern and almost solemn.
