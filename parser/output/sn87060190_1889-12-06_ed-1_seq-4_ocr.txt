Zanzibar, Doc, C After enduring tho hardships of many years' roiidonco in Cedtral Africa and the fatigues and dangora of his journoy to tho sea, it has heen tho fata of Emin Bey to recoivo an injury which is likely to result in hia death. Tho pasha is very near-sighted and habitually wears glasses. Yester day he attempted to go about his room without them, and unconsciously walked out of a window, falling somo distance to tho ground. Ho was immediately picked up and conveyed into tho house, where it was found that ho had sustained a fracture of the skull, which all of the doctors at Bagamoyo, except Stanley's own physi cian pronounces fatal. Stanloy's doctor shares tho opinion of his colleagues that Emin is in a very critical condition but expresses hope that ho may bo able to save his life. As it is tho pasha cannot under tho most favorable circumstances bo removed from Bagamoyo for at least ten days. A later dispatch from Zanzibar says that Emin misjudged tho height of a balcony parapet, ovor-Silancod himself and fell a distance of twenty feet. "When found his right oyo was closed nnd blood was issuing from his ears. His body is terribly bruised. Hon. Captnln Wissmann Met Stanley. Berlin, Dec. C. Capt.

Wissmann en tertained the party at luncheon, and tho captain of tho Spoerber formally wel comed Stanley. Then Emin, on behalf of tho Emperor of Germany and a largo number of Europeans arrived to greet Stanley, and in tho evening there was a grand banquet at which a perfect flood of champagne was serveft Tho German consul proposed a toast to Queen Victoria, and Capt. Wissmann toasted Stanley, alluding to him as his master in African exploration, Stanley made an eloquent speech in reply, thank ing God that no had done his duty. Ho referred with emotion to tho soldiors, whose bones were bleaching in tho forest, and remarked that his motto had always been, "Onward." Ho also testified-to tho divine influence which liad guided him in his work. Emin then toasted tho kaiser, and Lieut. Stairs responded for Stanloy's officers. Lieut. Brockenburg proposed a toast to Capt. Wissmann, wliich was respond ed to with tremendous cheers, tho whole company joining in tho song, "For Ho 's a Jolly Good Fellow." Stanley is expected to arrive in Zanzi bar on Thursday on board tho German warship Speerber. Einin's people aro on board a British man-o f-war.
