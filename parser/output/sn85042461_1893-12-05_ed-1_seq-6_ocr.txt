6 PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. An Exhaustive Review of Public Affairs of Moment. Our Foreign Relations Pronounced To Be In the Main Satisfactory. The Perplexing Hawaiian Question Handled in a Rather Matter-of-Fact Manner. The Restoration of the Deposed Queen Insisted Upon as the Only Solution of the Question. Attention Called to the Recommendation* or the Ileads of the Various Kxeculive Departments—Civil Service Reform Given Prominent Mention— Fenslon Frauds l>enonnoed — Economy In Public Kx pendituree Considered Imperative and Tariff Reform the Doty of the Hoar. Washington, Dec. 4—Following is the fnll text of the preaident's meaaage, which waa sent to congress today: To The Congress of the United States: The conatitutional duty which re quires the president from time to time, to give to the congeae information of the atate of the union, and recommend to their conaideration auch legislation as he ahall judge necessary, is fittingly entered upon by commending to tbe congress a careful recommendation of the detailed statements and well sup ported recommendations contained in the reporta of the heads of the depart ments, who are chiefly engaged with the executive work of tbe government. In an effort to abridge thia communica tion aa much aa ia consistent with ita purpose, T shall supplement a brief reference to the contents of the depart mental reporta, by the mention of auch executive buaineaa and incidents aa are not embraced therein, and by such recommendations aa appear to be at thia particular time appropriate. OUR 

FOREIGN RELATIONS. While our foreign relations have not not at all timea during the past year been entirely free from perplexing and embarraesing situations, nothing re mains that will not yield to the spirit of fairuoea and love of justice.which joined with consistent firmness, characterizes true American foreign policy. My predeceaeor having accepted the Office of arbitrator of the long-standing missions boundary dißpute, tendered to the president by the Argentine republic and Brazil, it has been my agreeable duty to receive the Bpecial envoys com missioned by the c stateß to lay before me the evidence and arguments in be half of their respective governments. THE 

BRAZILIAN REBELLION. The outbreak of domestic hostilities in the republic of Brazil found the United Stateß alert to watch the inter ests of our citizena in that country, with which we carry on an important com merce. Several vessels oi our new navy are now, and for some time ha7e been, stationed at Rio de Janeiro. The srrnr gle being between tbe established gov ernment, which controls the machinery of administration, and with which we maintain friendly relations, and certain officera of tbe navy, employing the ves eels of their command in an attack upon the national capital and chief seaport, and lacking aa it does tbe ele ments of a divided administration, I have failed to see that the insurgents can reasonably claim recog nition aa belligerents. Thua the posi tion of our government haß been that of an attentive, but impartial observer of the unfortunate conflict. Emphasizing our fixed policy of impartial neutrality in such a condition of affairs as now exists, I deemed it neceaeary to disavow in a manner to be misunderstood the unauthorized action of the late naval commander of these waters in saluting the revolted Brazilian- admiral, being indiapoaed to countenance an act calcu lated to give gratuitous sanction to a local inaurrection. CHILEAN CLAIMS. The convention between our govern ment and Chile, having for its object the aettlement and adjustment of the demands of tbe two countries againat each other has been made effective by the organization of the claims commis sion provided for. The two govern menta failing to agree upon the third member of the commission, the good offices of the president of the Swiaa re public were invoked as provided in the treaty, and the Belection of the Swiss representative) in thia country to com plete the organization waa gratifying to the United Statea and Chile. 

MINUTER BAGAN REBUKED. Ihe vexatioas question of the so called legation asylum lor offenders against the state und it 3 lawe, was pre sented anew in Chile, by the unauthor ized action of tha late United States minister in receiving in his official resi dence two persons who had failed in an attempt at revolution, and against whom criminal charges were pending growing out of a former abortive dis turbance. Tho doctrine of asylum as applied to this case is not sanctioned by the best precedent, ami whe:i allowed tends to encourage sedition and atrife. Under no circumstances can the repre aentative of thin government be per mitted under tbe iii- efintd fiction of extra territory to Interrupt the adminis tration of criminal justice in the coun tries to whieii they are accredited, A temperate demand having been made by the Chilean government ior the cor rection of this conduct, in the instance mentioned, tlie minister waa instructed no locger to harbor tbo < ffttndc re. CHINESE REGISTRAR ION. The leg : aUtion o! !ne: year known as the Geary law, requiring the registra tion of all Chinese laborers-entitled to reside id the Unite.) Statea. fr>d the de portation of all Dot coroplyi i? with the provisions of tlie act within the, time prescribed, met with mcc.li opposition from the Chinamen .n this country. Acting upon the adv:i c ol oiaineiH coun sel that the law was utieonKilutuiital, the great ma«« "ft hinese laborer*, pend ing a judicial decision a« to n.. validity, in good taitli de.clitieil lo „,u, |or ihsir certificates, required \n its provisions. A test, upon p. - vat. pn«. was brou.'V >"•:• • ir'. vi" court, and on " — H>. ! .<•., (ertfion was made by tha' H'hu 1 t . vi, \OH the law. It ia believed ai.tiei .... ..cw; ..inond ment of the act extending the time for registration the Chinese laborers there to entitled who desire to reside In thi conutry will now avail themselves o the renewed privilege thus afforded o establishing by lawful procedure their right to remaiD, and that thereby the necessity of enforced deportation may be to a great degree avoided. MCRDERED MISSION Ait IBS. It haa devolved upon tbe United States miniater at Pekin, aa dean of the diplomatic body, in the abaence of a repreaentative of Sweden and Norway, to preaa upon the Chinese government reparation for the recent murder of Swedish miaaionariea at Sung Pu. This question ie of vital intereet to all coun triea whose citizena are engaged in mie sionary work in the interior. THE AFRICAN SLAVE TRADE. By article XII of the general act of the Brussels congress, aigned July 2, 1890, for the euppreeeion of the - hue trade and the reatriction of certain in juries to commerce iv the inu'e:> ndent state of the Congo and in the adjacent statea of central Africa, the Unite! States and other signatory powers igreed to adopt appropriate means for die punishment of persons selling arms md ammunition to the natives, and for he confiscation of the inhibited arti cles. It being tho piain duty ol this ;overnment tn aid in suppressing the lefarioue traffic, impairing aa it does lie praiseworthy and civilizing efforts iow iv tbat region, I recommend that n act be paseed prohibiting the sale of rms and intoxicants to the nativeß in he regulated zone, by our citizena. EXTRADITION CONVEN HONS. Costa Rica has lately testified it? ■iendlineea by aurrenderiug to tbe Inited States, in the abaence oi a cou ention of extradition, bur upon dnly übtnitted evidence of criminality, a oted fugitive from jintice. It is mated that the negotiations ol a treaty rith that country, to m..et recurring »cc» of thia kind, wil! soon ba accent liahed. In my opinion, treat with all those countries with which the United States has not already conven tional arrangements of that character. I have deemed it fitting to express to the governments of Costa Rica aud Colombia too kindiy desiro of ihe Unittd Statea to see their pending boundary dispute finally concluded by arbitration to conformity with the spirit of the treaty concluded between them some years ago. FRANCE AND GERM ANY. Our relations with tne French repub lic continue to be iutimato and cordial. I sincerely hope that the extradition treaty with that country, us amended by tho Benate, will be operated. While occasional questions affecting our natur alised cit zena returning to the land of their birth tiavearisen in our intercourse with Germany, our relatione with that country continue aatiafactory. RELATIONS WITH GREAT BRITAIN. The queationa affecting our reiatioue with Great Britain have been treated inaauintof Inendiinesg. Negotiations are in progreaa between tbe two govern ments with a view to aucn concurrent action aa wi'l mane tbe award aud regu lations agreed upon by the Behring eea tribunal of arbitration, practically ef fective, and it is notdoubtiul that Great Britain will co-operate freely with thie country for the accomplishment of that purpose. The dispute growing out of the dis criminating toll imposed on the Wel land canal upon cargoes of cereals bound to and from the lake porta of the United States, was adiusted by tbe substitution of a more equitable schedule of charges, and my predecessor thereupon eva- I pended his proclamation imposing dis criminating tolls upou British transit through our canals. The request for additiona to the list of extraditable offenaes covered by the existing treaty between tbe two coun triea ia under consideration. TRoin;,E with il»Yri. I During tho paat year an American j citiz°n, employed in a subordinate com j mercial position in Hayti, after euifer -1 ing protracted imprisonment on an uu i founded charge of smuggling, was j finally liberated on a justice examina tion. Upon urgent representation to | the Haytian government suitable in demnity was paid to the eufferer. By a J law ol Hayti a sailing; vessel having dis charged ocr cargo, is refused clearance until the duties on auch cargo have iieen made. The hardship of this measure npon American shipowners, who conduct the bulk of the carrying trade of that country, has been insisted en, wil h a view of securing a removal oi this cause of complaint. THB AM APA LA AFFAIR. j Upon receiving authentic information ■of the firing upon an American mail steamer touchingat the port of Amapala because hey captain refused to deliver np « passenger in transitirom Nicaragua to Guatemala, upon demand of the mil itary authorities of Honduras, our min ister to thnt country, under instructions, protested againat the wanton act and demanded eatielaction., Tjie government i I Honduras, actuated'iL, a sense of jus t.cc and in a spirit of the utmost friend sin;!, promptly disavowed the illegal c.sduct of tt* oiUcere Bad expressed am . ■■ r-'crw!

A notable port of the southeasterly coast of Liberia, between the Oavally and San Pedro rivers, which for nearly half a century has been generally rocog nized as belonging to that republic by accession and purchase, has been claimed to be under the protectorate of France, in virtue of agreements entered into by the native tribes, over whom Liberia's control has not been well maintained. More recently negotiations between tbe Liberian representative and the French government resulted in the signature at Paris of a treaty whereby, as an adjustment, certain Liberian territory is ceded to France, this convention, at laet ad vices, had not been ratified by tbe Li berian legislature, and the executive feeleng a sympathetic interest in the fortune of the little commonwealth, the establishment and development of which were largely aided by tbe benev olence of our countrymen and which constitutes tbe only independent sov ereign state on the west coast of Africa, this government bas suggested to tbe French government its earnest concern lest territorial impairment in Liberia ehould take place without her uncon strained consent. FKIENDSUIP FOR MEXICO. Our relatione with Mexico continue to be of that close and friendly nature which sbould always characterize the I intercourse of two neighboring renub j lies. The work of relocating the monu ments marking the boundary between the countriea from Pa*o del Norte to the Pactic, is now nearly completed. The commission organized under the con ventions of 1881 and 1889, it is expected, will speedily settle the disputes trowing out ot the shifting currenta of the Kio Orande river, eaat of El Paso. AFFAIRS IN NICARAGUA. Nicaragua has recently paaaed through two revoiutione, the party at first suc cessful having in turn been displaced by another. Our newly appointed minister by his timely good efforts aided in a peaceful adjustment of the controversy involved iU the first conflict. The large American interests eetabliahed in that country in connection witii the Nicara gua canal were not molested. TilE NICARAGUA CANAL. The canal company has unfortunately beoom.) flnancially seriously embar rassed, bu*> a generous treatment has been extended to it, by the government of N e*ragna, and ths (Jotted States are especially interested in the successful ae;iievement of the vast undertaking this company has in charge. That it should be accomplished under distinc- American auspices and its enjoy ment assured not only to tho vessels of this country, aa a channel of commer cial communication between out Atlan tic and Facuic seaboards, but the ships oi the world in tha interests of civiliza tion, is a proposition which in my judg ment does not admit of queetiou. GUATEM iLa'B TKIALS. Guatemala bas also been visited by the political vicissitudes which have afflicted her Central American neigh bors, but thedisaoluiionof its legislature and the proclamation of the dictatorship have been unattended by civil war. NEW EXTRADITION TREATIES. An extradition treaty with Norway has recently beeu exchanged and pro claimed. Tbe extradition treaty with Ku«eia signed in March, 1687. and February last, was duly proclaimed last June. THE SAMOAN SETTLEMENT. Led by a deaire to compose the differ ence aud contribute to tbe restoration of order in Samoa, which for some years previous had been tbe scene of conflict ing foreign pretensions and native strife, tbe United States, departingfrom its police consecrated by a century of observance, entered four years ago into tbe treaty oi Berlin, thereby becoming joiotly bound with England and tier many to establish and maintain MaUetoa Laupepa as King of Samoa. The treaty provided for a for eign courtol justice, a municipal council tor the district of Apia, with a foreign president ttiereof, authorized to advise the king a tribunal for the settlement of native and foreign land titles, and a revenue system for the kingdom. It entailed upon the three powers that part of the cost of the new government not met by the revenue of the islands. Early iv the life of this triple protector ate, the native diseensions, it waa de signed 10 quell, were revived. The re vivera defied the authority of the new king, refusing to pay taxes and demanding the election of a ruler by native euli'roge. Mataafa, an aspirant to the throne, aud a large number of hia native adherents were in open rebellio i on one of the islands. Quite lately, i t the req'ieat nf the other powers, and in fulfillment of its treaty obligation, thia government agreed to unite in a joint military movement of Buch dimenaiona aa would probably eecure the aurrender of the insurgents without bloodshed. The warship Philadelphia waa accord ingly put under ordera for Sa moa, but before she arrived the threatened conflict was pre cipitated by King Mataafa'a attack upon the insurgent camp. Mataafa waa defeated and a number of men killed. The British and German veaaela present anbsequently aecured the aur render of Mataafa and hia adherents. The defeated chief and ten of his prin cipal supporters were deported to a German ialand of tne Marshall group, where they are held as prisoners under the joint responsibility and coat of the three powera. This incident and the svente leading up to it signally illus trate the impolicy of entangling alii incea with foreign powera. Spain's delinquency. More tban 15 years ago this govern ment preferred a claim againat Spain, in beheat of one of our citizena for pro perty seized and confiscated in Cuba. In 1880 the claim waa adjuated, Spain agreeing to pay unconditionally ac a lair indemnity, $1,500,000. A respect ful, but earnest note was recently ad dressed to the Spanish government in sisting upon the prompt fulfillment of its long neglected obligation. Other claiuia preferred by the United States againat Spain in behalf of Ameri can citizens for property confiacated in Cuba have been pending for many yeara. At the time of Spain'a title to the Caro line ißlanda wae confirmed by arbitra tion, that government agreed tbat the rights which had been acquired there by American miaaionairiea ehould be recog nized and respected. It is aincerely hoped that this plan will be observed by allowing our miaeiouaries who were removed from Ponape to a place of safety by a United States warship dur ing the late trouble between the Span ieb garriaon and the nativea, to return to their field of ueefulnese. A 

TOKEN OP AMITY. The reproduced caravel Santa Maria, built by Spain and aent to the Colum- I bian expoeition, baa been presented to the United States in token of amity and in commenoration of the event it waa designed to celebrate. I recommend tbat, in accepting thia gift, congreaa make a grateful recognition of tbe sin cere friendship which prompted it. RELATIONS WITH THE PORTE. Important matters have demanded attention in onr relatione with the Ot- toman porte. The firing and partial destruction by an unrestrained mob of one of the school buildings of the An atoly college, established by citizena of the United States at Mareovan, and the apparent indifference of the Turkish government to the outrage, notwith standing tbe complicity of aome of ita officials, called for an earneat remon atration, which was followed by prom ises of reparation and punishment of the offenders. Indemnity for the injury to the buildings and permission to rebuild was given. The regiatration of the school property in tbe name of the American ownere was secured and efficicient protection guaranteed. Information received of maltreatment suffered by an inoffensive American woman, engaged in missionary work in Turkish Kordiatan, was followed by euch representations to the Porte as resulted in tbe assurance of orders for the pun ishmentof her assailants, the discharge of a delinquent officer and tbe issuance of orders for the protection of our citizena engaged In missionary and other lawful work in that quarter, Turkey complains that ber Armenian subjects obtain citizenship in this coun try, not to identiiv themselves in good faith with our people, but with the in tention of returning to the laud of their birth and their engaging in sedition. This complaint is not wholly without foundation. A journal published in this country in the Armenian language openly counsels its readers to arm, organize and participate in the movement for the subversion of Tuikish authority In the Asiatic provinces. The O toman «ov ernment haa announced it« intent ons t< expel from its dominion Armenians whc have obtained natural z.ition in tin United Statea Bince 1838. The riatht tc oxclnde any or nil classes of aliaua is nn attribute of sovereignty. It is a right asserted and to a limitedextentenforeed by the United States with the eauetiou I of our highest courts. There beintr no naturalization treaty I between the United States and Turkey, our minister at Oonetautinople has been instructed that, while recognizing the right of the government to enforce its declared policy agaiust naturalized American-Armeniana, he is expected to protect tbem from unnecessary harsh ness of treatment. VENEZUELAN AFFAIRS. The boundary dispute between Vene zuela and Britiah Guiana is as yet un adjuated. The restoration of diplomatic intercourse between that republic and Great Britain and reference of the quea tion to impartial arbitration would be a moat gratifying consummation. The ratification by Venezuela of the conven tion for the arbitration of tbe long de ferred claim of the Venezuelan trans portation company, ia awaited. In view of the impaired financial re sources of Venezuela, consequent upon the recent revolution there a modified arrangement for the eatiafaction of tbe awards of the late advisory claimß com mission, in progressive installments, has been absented to and payments are being regularly made thereunder. THE HAW/IIAN DIFFICULTY. that 't"he^ d J/i,ftriSPm , in'2*trom 'our're lations with Hawaii have caused serious embarrassment. Just prior to the in stallation of the preaent admiuistratiou the existing government of Hawaii had been suddenly overthrown and a treaty of annexation had been negotiated be tween the provisional government of the islands and the United Statea and anbmitted to tho eenate for ratification. Thia treaty I with drew for examination and diapatched Hon. James F. Blount of Georgia to Honolulu na a special commissioner to make an impartial investigation of the circumetancee attending the change of government, and of all tho conditions bearing upon the subject of the treaty. After a thorough and exhaustive exam ination Mr. Blount submitted to me his report, showing beyond all quea tion that the conatitutional gov ernment of Hawaii bad been subverted with tbe active aid of our representative to that government and through the intimidation caused by the presence of an armed naval force of the United States, wtmh waa landed for that purpoae at the inetance of our min iater. Upon the facts developed it seemed to me the only honorable couree for our government to pursue was to undo the wrong that had been done by those representing ue, and to restore as far aa practicable the status exiating at the time of our forcible intervention. With a view of accomplishing thia result within tbe constitutional limits of executive power, and recognizing all our obligations growing out ol any changed conditione brought about by our nn justifiable interference, our pres ent minister to Honolulu has received appropriate inatructiona to that end. Thua far no information of the accom plishment of any definite results has been received irom him. Addi tional advices are soon expected. When received they will be promptly aent to the congress, together with all other information at hand, accompanied by a special execu tive message fully detailing the acts necessary to a complete understanding of the case and presenting a history of all the material events lead ing up to the preeent situation. INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION. By a current resolution passe I by the eenate February 14, 1890, and by the house of representatives the 3rd of April following, the president wae requested to invite from time to time, as lit occa sion may arise, negotiations with any government with which the United Statea has or may have diplomatic rela tions, to the end that any dif ference or dispute arising between the two governments, which cannot be ad justed by diplomatic figepcy, may be referred to arbitration and be peac.ably adjusted by auch means. April 15, 1890, the International American con ference of Waahington, by a resolution, expressed the wish tbat all c.outrover sies between the republic of America and the nations of Europe might be settled by arbitration, and recommended that tbe govern ment of eacb nation represented in that conference ehould communicate thiß wish to all friendly powers. A favora ble response bas been received from Great Britain in tbe shape of a resolu tion adopted by parliament July 15 last, cordially sympathizing with ths pur pose in view and expressing the hope that her majesty's government will lend hearty co-operation to the govern ment of the United States, to legislation on the current resolation above quoted. It affords me pleasure to lay this parlia mentary resolution before the congress and to express my gratification that the sentiment of the two great and kindred nations ie thus authoritatively mani fested in favor of the rational and peace able settlement of international quarrels by honorable reeort to arbitration. 

RAISED ENVOYS. Since the passage of tbe act of March 3, 1693, authorizing the president to raise the grade of our envoys to corre spond with the rank in which foreign countries accredit their agents here, Great Britain, France, Italy and Ger many have conferred npon their re spective representatives at this capital the title of ambassador, and I have re sponded by accrediting the agents of the United States in those countries witb the came title. A like elevation of the mission ie an nounced by Russia, and wben made will be similarly met. This step fit tingly compares with the position the United States holds in tbe family of nations. THE 

CONSULAR SERVICE. During my former administration I took occasion to receminend a recast of the lawa relating to the consular aervice in order that it might become a more efficient agency in the promotion of the interests it was intended to subserve. The dutiea and powers of consula have been expanded with the growing requirementa of our foreign trade, diECharging important I duties affecting our commerce and and American citizena abroad, and in certain countriesexercisea judicial func tions These officera ehould be men of character, intelligence and ability. INTERNATIONAL COPYRIGHT. Upon proof that the legialation of Denmark secures copyright to American citizens, on an equal footing with ita own, the privileges of our copyright lawa have been extended by proclama tion to subjects of that country. PUBLIC lit.VfcNUES. The secretary ot tho treasury reports that the receipts of the government from all aources during the fiscal year ended hum oi), 189.2, amounted to $461,718, --501 94, and its expenditures, to $459,574, --874.39, There was collected from cus toms $201i.355.01f}.75, and from ihternal revenues Our dutiable imports amounted to $421,850,711, an increaee of $52,163, --9UI over the preceding year, and itnpor tationa free of duty amount to $144,544. --211, a decrease from the pieceding year ol $13,455,447.

The Bum paid from the treasury for sugar bounty waa $9,375,130,881, an increaee over the preceding year of $2,033,053.09. It ie estimated upon tbe basis of the present revenue laws that the receipts of the government for the year ending June 30, 1893, will be $430,121,365.38, and its expenditures $458,121,366.38, reaulting in a deficiency of $28,000,000. 

CONDITION OF THE TREASURY. On the first day of November, 1893, culation, or not included in the treasury Holdings was $1,718,544,682, an increase for the yearof $112,404 947. Estimating our population at 77,446,000 at the time mentioned the per capita circulation was $25.49. On the aame date there wae in the treasury gold bullion amount ing to $90,667,273 and aiiver bullion which was purchaeed at a cose of $120, --261.553. The purcbeee of silver under the law of July 14, 1790. during the last fipcal year aggregated 5,400,816,259 fine ouncea, which coat $45,531,374.53. The total amount of silver purchased from the lime that law became operative until the repeal of ita purchasing clauee on on the last day of November, 1893, wae 16 867,459.046 fine ounces, which cost $155,930.940 84. Between the first day ol March, 1873, and the lat day of November, 1893. tbe government, pur chaeed under all laws, 503,003,717 fine ouncee of silver, at a coat of $510,022, --948. The silver dollara that have been coined under the act of July 14, 1890, number 36,087,285. The aeignorage arising from euch coinage waa $6,977, --098 89. leaving on hand in tbe mints 140,699,700 fine ouncea of aiiver, which coßt $126,578,218. Our total coinage of all metale during the laat fiacal year constated of 97,280,875 pieces, valued at $43,085,188.80, of which there was $30,038,140 in gold coin, $5,343,710 in silver dollars, $7,217,220 90 in subsidiary aiiver coin and $1,080,102.90 in minor coma. During the calendar year 1892 the production of precious metale in tbe United Stated waa estimated to be $1,593,376 fine ouncea of gold of the commercial and coinage value of $33, --000,000. and 68,000,000 fine ouncea of aiiver of the bullion or market value of $50,750,000, and of tbe coinage value of $74,989,900. It ia estimated that on the first day of July, 1893, the metallic etock of money in the United States, consisting of coin and bullion, amounted to $1, --213.559,169, of which $597,685 waa gold and $015,801,184 waa silver. NATIONAL BANKS. One hundred and nineteen national banks were organized during the year ending October 31, 1893, witb a capital of $11,230,000. Forty-aix went into voluntary liquidation and 158 suspend ed. Sixty-five of the suspended banks were insolvent, 80 resumed business and seven retnaiued iv the bands of bank examiners witb pros pects of epeedy resumption. Of the new banks organized, 44 were located in the •• tern states, 41 weat of the Mississippi river and 34 in the central and southern states. The total number of national banks in existence the 31et day of October, 1883, wae 3796, having an aggregate capital of $695, --548,120. The net increaee in the circu lation of these banka during tbe year waa $36,886,972. REPEAL OF THB SHERMAN LAW. The recent repeal of tha provision of the law requiring the purchase of bul lion by the government, ac a feature of our monetary scheme, made an entire change in the complexion of our cur rency affairs. I do not doubt that the ultims.te result of this action will he most salutary and far-reaching. In the naiuro of things, however, it ie impossible to Itnow at tnis time pre cisely what conditionß will be brought about by the change, or what, if any, supplementary legislation may in the light of such conditions appear to be es aential or expedient. Ot course, after the recent financial per turbation time ie neceeaary for the re-eatablishment of buaineaa confidence. When, however, through thia restored confidence the money which haa been frightened into hoard ing places ie returned to trade and enter prise, atairvey of tbeeituation will prob ably disclose a safe path leading to a permanently Bound currency,abundantly sufficient to meet every requirement of our increasing population and buaineaa. In the pursuit of this object we should resolutely turn away from alluring and temporary expedienta. determined to be content with nothing lees than a lasting and comprehensive financial plan. In theae circumetancee I am convinced that a reasonable delay in dealing with tbia subject instead of being injurious will increaee the probability of wise action. MONETARY CONFERENCE. The monetary conference which as sembled at Brussels upon our invitation was adjourned to the 30th day of No vember in the present year. The con siderations just stated, and the fact tbat a definite propoeition from ua seemed to be expected npon the reaa- Bembling of the conference, led me to express a willingness to have the meet ing still further postponed. It seems to me that it would be wise to give general authority to the president to invite other nations to auch a conference at any time when there ehould be a fair proepect of accomplishing an interna tional agreement on the subject of coinage.
