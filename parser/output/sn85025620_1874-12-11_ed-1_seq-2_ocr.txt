On the first day of the session of Congress, Mr. Hitchcock introduced a bill in the Senate appropriating $100,000 for the relief of the grass hopper sufferers on the western Iron tier. The bill also directs the issue of disused army clothing to supply the extreme wants of suffeiers. This is well enough, as far as it goes, but it is not half enough. It will take much more than that amount to re lieve the Minnesota sufferers alone, and we are well off compared with poor Kansas and Nebraska. PRESIDENT 8 Mt&SA GE. We give, on our first page, the President's Message, lead to Congress on Monday. The President reaffirms the position taken in his veto of the currency bill anU desiies a speedy re turn to specie payment. He is tired of using the power of the General Government to keep the lebels of the South in order, and also of endeavor ing to enfoice civil sen ice refoim.— But we sincerely hope he will fight it out on this line if it takes all the rest of his term. It is always unpleasant to do an unpleasant duty, but it is sure to yield the peaceable fruits of a good conscience and ultimately of an approving public sentiment.
