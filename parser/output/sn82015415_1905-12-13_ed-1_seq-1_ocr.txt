He declared that the attorneys for the Pioneer Mill Company were acting In bad faith, to harrass and oppress Mose Meheula, and that their action In securing de- lays of his right to take possession of 4 k 4 CHRISTMAS DISPLAY.

When we first heard that tho 'way had been opened for immigration from Europe, we planned to take Immediate steps towards sending you to recruit labor in tho Azores and Madeira Isl ands. However, after full consultation with the Governor and others, ns well as with members of tho Planters' Asso ciation, we have decided that the .wis est thing to do Is to ask you to go now to the Azores and Madeira Islands and investigate the labor supply of those islands. If after Investigation there (Continued on page four.) rcr-TrnTtrH TO APPEAL TO WASH the property -Involved were "grossly and wantonly oppressive." H. E. Cooper, E. B. McClanahnn and S. H. Derby all filed affidavits In reply to Ashford, denying the bad faith and setting f'qrth the steps taken to appeal to Washington. It was also denied that there was any oppression, or that Me heula was put to any loss by the delay, while on the, other hand, the attorneys stated, the Pioneer Mill Company's mill would have to shut down If Meho illa took possession of the property he claims, as the company's railroad crosses It. The court, consisting of Justice Hart well and Wilder and Circuit Judge De Bolt, heard argument by Ashford, Kin ney, McClanah'an and Derby and a ru ing was given advancing the case for argument next week.

A Chicago dally contains an account of a Hawaiian who promises to rise to national prominence In the gamo of baseball. Ho has been "discovered" In California, arid a Chicago club Is trjrrn.sjsnvlinas a player In tho National League, which will mean that he"wlll"pay with 'the best' In 'the coun try. The Chicago paper has tho fol lowing on the subject: "President Charles W. Murphy of the local National league club has received a letter from Manager Chance of the Cubs, who is passing die winter in Cali fornia, asking If there Is any rule In the National leagjio against playing a half-breed Hawaiian In the National league. Chanco has found a very piomlslng young player In the person of John Kaulas, who originally came from Hawaii and had been playing along tho California coast and Is said to have all tho earmarks of making a, great player. "Kaulas Is an outfielder and has the speed of a deer and stands to the bat with all tho promlso of a second Pete Browning. "Some of his ancestors came from China, however, and some of his grand fathers married native Hawaiian wo men and mixed up his race so badly that he hardly knows whether he Is a Caucasian or a Mongol. His color re sembles the negro so much that the patrons of tho great American sport would not allow him to mako a living ns a professional ball player In a big leaguo and It Is this fact that causes Manager Chance to hesltato In. asking the young hopeful to put his name to a Chicago contract. 'The Hawallans are natural-born athletes and take to baseball without urging. Kaulas Is a good-sized man, much larger than the ordinary native of Hawaii, for his life for the most part has been passed In California and the climate there Is said to grow big ger men than down In tho Pacific Isl ands. "I don't know that there Is any su-' rulo In tho National League as would prevent us playing this young Hawai ian," said President Murphy this morn ing. "I am going to ask when I go t" the annual meeting In New York next month If there is any reason why we should not sign this Hawallan-Chlna- man or this Chinese-Hawaiian for tho Cubs next year. I remember that Man ager McGraw of the Giants a few years, ago, when ho was manager of tho Bal timore team, signed up a negro under an Indian name and he was not allow ed to take him away from Hot Springs becauso of tho fear that tho nubllr would not stand for the player. From what Manager Chanco says of thU young fellow In California ho has all tho necessary qualities of a good play er.' "

This price, for bonds bearing only 3 per cent Interest, will be tho best ever received for Hawaiian government bonds. It is considered likely that Secretary Atkinson will make a sale In New York. Tho last legislature amended the loan act, so as to authorize acceptance of a private bid for bonds, "provided such bid shall be above tho llgure of the last sale." . Tho last sale made by the Territory was of 4 per cent bonds, at 1.01. ay ALAMEDA'S MAIL OPENS CAM PAIGN FROM HERE FOR "MUCH DESIRED LEGISLATION. Governor Carter kept several steno graphers and typewriters busy until late last night and up to the time of the Alameda's departure this morning, with tho opening of Hawaii's fight for the legislation favored' by President Roosevelt in his, annual message. A big batJh of coirrewpondence, the most important sent for a long time, wont, forward on . the steamer, on tho sub ject of tho proposed reservation of 75 per cent of Hawaii's federal taxes as a fund to bo used In the islands. The governor sent letters on the sub ject to Delegate Kuhlo and F. M. Hatch Washington representative of the Planters' Association, also to Secre tary Atkinson, as well as to some lead ing men In both house of Congress, giv ing facts as to local cbnditlons on which the argument for the proposed legis lation is based. Letters on tho samo subject were sent from hore by other prominent men who havo friends In Congress. The Alameda mall, In fact Is tho opening of a vigorous move on Congress. Tho chanco for getting a reservation of federal taxes Is believed to be very good, though there are some who think that Congress may cut the propor tion to fifty per cent. Tho fact that tho President accepted Carter's pro position of 75 per cent, however, Is proof that Hawaii can bring vory lm prcsslvo arguments to bear In favor of that proportion. The Governor was at his office very early this morning, completing his big batch of mall, a largo part of which was sent to the steamer after tho mulls had closed at tho postoffice. L or Life
