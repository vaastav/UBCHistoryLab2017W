PUBRIIBHED WEEKLY BY JOHN M. VROOMAN, Editor & Prop'r. LEWISTTOWN, MONT., Dec. 14, '98. It will he in order to congratulate Judge Brantly on his election. He will be the next 'lchief justice of Moin tana. There will be no contest over his electio'n. Assistant Naval ('onstructor Hob son will sail for Manila in a few days to superintend the raising of the sunken Spanish war vessels in the harbor. He is reconlmlended for pro motion by the president to naval constructor. The peace treaty was signed in Paris last Saturday and nothing serious occurred to mar the last pro ceedings, although it is said the dons were a trifle sulky. The American conunmlssioners will probably sail for home this week. Chicago is having her first catshow, and strange as it lmay seem, there Is not ni replresentative fronm Cat island there.--(reat Falls Leader. Are you sure you scanned the ceit alogue carefully? The cat found on the Cristobal Colon at the timeof the catstrolphe near Santiago, is on exhibition. The total vote of Montana thsl year was a triile less than 50.000, against ,4..NNH) in iS0;, a heavy vote considering that this is an off year. There in little donuilt but Montana noIlw oulnt.aiis o\'ter ti0,(H)i) legal voters. T'Iwo years ago the I epublican vote was 11).7,M:t at the recent election Thus . (. .1l'rshall. (aididate for coin gress, re.eiv'.d 14.s:.0, showing a gain of nearly ,,t4t10. The figures indicate that i,.tpuimlieans are falling back into line w\ith the'ir party, and there will be itoIre ill 114.IHN). After discov ering thait thlie I)emlltC'.ralts are really to dropl the silver issue when it fails to secure the ottices they will return to the plrty that has the welfare of the whole country at heart. Secretary Alger says it Is proposed to send regnhlir regiments to relieve the volunteers in .Mianila just as soon as transplortation can Ie' arranged. The voluliteers will tbe returned to the Inited States ill tlihe order in which they left. T'his will bring the troop ill the following order: First ('nlifurnia, First Oregon, First Col ravdo, Tenth I'lennsylvania and the Utah hattery. As the Montana regi Inltelt was ialb,.ult the last to arrive at Manila it will lprobably ble one of the last to retullin. Much depends, nlso, upon what a'ction congress takes re gardling an increatse of the regular army. Should action be taken at this session and the army greatly augmrented. the new recruits would relieve the vtolulnteers il the Philip pines and elsewhere. All this takee time,. however. and if the Montana boys do not return home before next fall it should surprise no one. There will be little necessity for their pro tracted stay in the Philippinesunless Agulnaldo shoull prove obstinate and inaugurate a revolt against American control, which is hardly probalble. The allunsin by Pr.sident McKin ley in his message to the destruction of the Maine has stirred up the ire of the Spanish press and it is making some very bold charges. The Impar cial says: "The partisansof the war realized that something startling wats ell(essary to arouse national sentiment. It was a remarkable chance. Almost all the Maine's offi cers were on I,oaurd another ship at the time of the catastrophe. Those who charge the Spaniards with being capable of such a monstrous act are well capable of committing it them eelves." The aboveshows with what little consideration Spain holds the lives of her common seamen. Just as though the absence of the officers of the Maine would render the time opportune for the destruction of the ship by the "partisans of the war." No American or anyone in sympathy with the Cubans would have jeopard ized the life of one of the Maine'screw to aid the Cuban cause. While it Is possible that those high in authority in the Spanish government have no knowledge of the perpetrators of the hellish deed, there is little doubt but some parties in sympathy " r con nected with flle Spanish army in Cuba is responsible. This view will always be entertained by Americans. For the first time in the history of this country the balance of trade is on our side. The lines representing imports and exports of manufac tures have been wide apart for many years, the imports until now far ex ceeding in value the exports. In 1s0 the imports were valuvd at $2L60,000, 000 anid the exports at $100,u0,000. In 1~3 the imports amounted to $3..),000,000 and the exports to $130, 000,000. In 18$8 the imports amounted to $325,000,000 and the exports to $120,000,000. In 1893 the imports were valued at $368,000,000 and the exports at $190,000,000. In 1896, when Mc Kinley was elected, the Imports were valued at $.30,000.000 and theexport at $230,000,000. This year the situa tion ham been reversed, the imports amount to $229,991,231 and the ex ports to $291,2I0,35s'. This is a re markable showing for the first year of the Dingley law and does not in dicate the presence of that "Chinese "wall" \we heard so much about thret or fltour years ag8o, miand it does not appear that America has "lout thi markets ",fithe world" to any alarm ing extent by adhering to the policy of pr' tection to American industries. The imports of manufactures into the United States in the fiscal year 1l9tn were thirty per cent less than those of 'lbt, although the popula. tion has increased twenty-five pet cent. meantime. The President's Message. President McKinley's annual mees age is a lengthy production and one of the most important state paper, to issue from the executive of the nation for many years past. This i| not owing to the recommendations contained therein but to the stirring events of the past year which made their recital necessary in order thai the people as well as congress may become advised of every act per. formed by the coummnander-in-chie of the army in the prosecution of the war. In this regard it is a moastcom. plete history of the conflict, told in a straightforward and unassunmin manner. There is some criticism of the mees sage because the president did not take it upon himself to outlin- a pol. icy for the government of the Philip. pines. It would certainly have beeIt in had taste to anticipate the antionli of the 'pace ciullomissioner.ll andil offe' sullggesti.Iils before tlhe treamlty wni signed. This and other iUiilnrtuiii I questions resulting fromi the war will be treaterd in aI specil llmesscage at a later date. However, the president hais made recommendations, and the followingi nre amolnig the monire important ones to which he invites the attention ol congress: Self-government for Cuba "tit thll earliest moment consistent witl safety and assured success. A just. humanlle and bIenevolent governmenit' in which "neither revenge or olnssiori should have a place.-" i demanadedo Military occupation to continue in SDefinlite action on the Nicaragua, ,_canal qu(estion by congress at thi e present sessi.on, bearing in mind thai i "our national polley now Imore im t peratively than ever calls for contro e by this government." , Appropriations for fifteen new waj ships. r Increase of the standing army tc t 100,000 men. Initiation of steps for an int(rna. tional agreement to exempt all pri. vate property at sea from capture o. destruction in time of war.
