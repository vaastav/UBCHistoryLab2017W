The Lost Continent By CUTCLIFFE HYNE. Published by Harper* Bros. Copyright, iqoo, by Cntcliffe Hyne. This story of “The Lost Continent” is the translation of an ancient manuscript found in a cave in the Canary islands. It was written upon a peculiar substance, each sheet made up of two parts. One side resembled talc, end over the other side was spread a coating of dark coffee-col ored material that resembled wax. A lib eral translation gives the following story; CHAPTER I. MY RECALL. The public official reception was over. The sentence had been read, the name of Phorenice the empress odored, and the new 7 viceroy installed with all that vast and ponderous ceremonial which had gained its pomp and majesty 7 from the ages. Formally, I had delivered up the reins of my government; formally 7 , Tatho had seated himself on the snake-throne, and had put over his neck the chain of gems which sym bolized + he supreme office; and then, while the unims and the trumpets made their proclamation of clamor, he had risen to his feet for his first state progress round that gilded council chamber, as viceroy of the Province of Yucatan. With folded arms and bended head I followed him between the glitter ing lines of soldiers, and the brilliant throng of courtiers, and chiefs, and statesmen. The roof-beams quivered to the cries of “Long live Tatho!” “Flourish the empress!” which came forth as in duty bound, and the new ruler acknowledged the welcome with stately inclinations of the head. In turn he went to the three lesser thrones of the lesser governors —in the east, the north, and the south, and received homage from each as the ritual was; and I, the man whom his coming had deposed, followed with the prescribed meekness in his train. It was a hard task, but we who hold the higher offices learn to carry before the people a passionless face. Once, 20 y-ears before, these same fine obeisances had been made to me; now the gods had seen fit to make fortune change. But as I w 7 alked bent and humbly 7 on behind the heels of Tatho, though etiquette forbade noisy salutations to myself, it could not inhibit kindly glances, and these came from every soldier, every 7 cour tier, and every chief who stood there in that gilded hall, and they 7 fell upon me very 7 gratefully. It is not often that the fallen meet such tender looks. Then, one behind the other, the new viceroy and the old, we marched with formal step over golden tiles of that council hall beneath the pyra mid, and the great officers of state left their stations and joined in our train; and at the farther wall we came to the door of those private chambers which an hour ago had been mine own. Ah, well! I had no home now in any 7 of those wondrous cities of Y'ucatan, and I could not help feeling a bitterness, though in sooth I should have been thankful enough to return to the continent of Atlantis with my 7 head still in its proper station. Tatho gave his formal summons of “Open ye to the Viceroy,” which the ritual commands, and the slaves with in sent the massive stone valves of the door gaping wide. Tatho entered, I at his heels; the others halted, sending valedictions from the thresh old; and the valves of the door clanged on the lock behind us. We passed on to the chamber beyond, and then, when for the first time we were alone "together, and the forced etiquette of courts was behind us, the new viceroy turned with meekly folded arms, and bowed low before me. “Deucalion,” he said, “believe me that I have not sought this office. It was thrust upon me. Had I not ac cepted, my head would have paid for feit. and another man—your enemy— would have been sent out as viceroy In your place. The empress does not permit that her will shall ever be questioned.” “My friend,” I made answer, “my brother in ail but blood, there is no man living in all Atlantis or her ter ritories to whom I had liefer hand over my government. For 20 years now have I ruled this country of Yucatan, and Mexico beyond, first un der the old king, and then as minis ter to this new empress. I know my colony 7 like a book. lam intimate with all her wonderful cities, with their palaces, their pyramids, and their peoples. I have hunted the beasts and the savages in the for ests. I have built roads, and made the rivers so that they 7 win carry shipping. I have fostered the arts and crafts like a merchant; I have discoursed, three times each day, the cult of the gods with mine own lips. Through evil years and through good have I ruled here, striving only 7 for the prosperity of the land and the strengthening of Atlantis, and I have grown to love the peoples like a fa ther. To you I bequeath them, Tatho, with tender supplications for their Interest.” “It is net I that can carry 7 on Deucalion’s work with Deucalion’s power, but rest content, my friend, that I shall do my humble best to fol low exactly on in your footsteps. Believe me, I came out to this gov ernment with a thousand regrets, but 1 would have died sooner than take your place had I known how vigor ously the supplanting would trouble you.” “We are alone here,” I said, “away from the formalities of formal as semblies, and a man may give vent to his natural self without fear of tarnish ng a ceremony 7 . Your com ing was something of the suddenest. Till an hour ago, when you demanded audien :e, I had thought to rule on longer and even now I do not know for wl at cause I am deposed.” “The proclamation said: ‘We re lieve our well-beloved Deucalion of his present service, because we have great need of his powers at home in our kingdom of Atlantis.’ ” “A mere formality.” Tatho looked uneasily 7 round the hangings of the chamber, and drew me with him to its center, and low ered his voice. “I do not think so,” he whispered. “I believe she has need of you. There are troublous times on hand, and Phorenice wants the ablest men in the kingdom ready to her tall.” “You may speak openly,” 1 said, “and without fear of eavesdroppers. We are in the heart of the pyramid here, built in every way by a man’s length of solid stone. Myself, I over saw the lay ing of every course. And besides, here in Yucatan, we have not the niceties of your old-world di p omac j, and do not listen, because we count it shame to do bo.” Tatho shrugged his shoulders. “I acted only according to mine educa tion. At home, a loose tongue makes a loose head, and there are those whose trade it is to carry tales. Still, what I say is this: The throne shakes, and Phorenice sees the need of sturdy props. So she has sent this proclamation.” . “But why come to me? It is 20 years since I sailed to this colony, and from that day 7 I have not re* turned to Atlantis once. 1 know lit tle of the old country’s politics. What small parcel of news drifts out to us across the ocean reads with slender interest here. Yucatan is another world, my 7 Tatho, as you in the course of your government will learn, with new interests, new peo ple, new everything. To us here At lantis is only a figment, a shadow, far away across the waters. It is for this new world of Yucatan that I have striven through all these years.” “If Deucalion has small time to spare from his government for brood ing over his fatherland, Atlantis, at least, has found leisure to admire the deeds of her brilliant son. Why, sir, over yonder at home, your name carries magic with-it. When you and I were lads together, it was the cus tom in the colleges to teach that the men of tne past were the greatest this world has ever seen; but to-day 7 this teaching is changed. It is Deucalion who is held up as the model and example. Mothers name their sons Deucalion, as the most valuable birth-gift fhey can make. Deucalion is a household word. In deed, there is only one name that is near to it in familiarity.” “You trouble me,” 1 said, frowning. “I have tried to do my duty 7 for its own sake, and for the country’s sake, not for the pattings and fondlings of the vulgar. And besides, if there are names to be in every one’s mouth, they should be the names of the gods.” Tatho shrugged his shoulders. “The gods? They occupy 7 us very lit tle these latter years. With our mod ern science, we have grown past the tether of the old gods, and no new one has appeared. No, my Lord Deucalion, if it were merely the gods who were your competitors on men’s lips, your name wou.d be a thousand times the better known.” “Of mere human names,” I said, “the name of this new empress should come first in Atlantis, our lord the old king being now dead.” “She certainly 7 would have.it so,” replied Tatho; and there was some thing in his tone which made me see that more was meant behind the words. I drew him to one of the mar ble seats, and bent myself familiarly toward him. “I am speaking,” I said, fWmm 

TATHO ENTERED, I AT HIS HEELS. “not of the new viceroy 7 of Yucatan, but to my 7 old friend Tatho, a mem ber of the priests’ clan, like myself, with w'houi I worked side by side in a score of the smaller home gov ernments, in hamlets, in villages, in smaller towns, in greater towns, as we gained experience in war and knowledge in the art of ruling peo ple, and so tediously won our promo tion. I am speaking in Tatho’s pri vate abode, that was mine own not two hours since, and I would have an answer with that plainness which we always then used to one another.” The new viceroy sighed whimsic ally. “I almost forget how to speak in plain words now,” he said. “We have grown so polished in these lat ter day's, that mere bald truth would be hissed as indelicate. But for the memory of those early 7 years, when we expended as much law and thought oter the ownership of a hay byre as we should now over the fate of a rebellious city, I will try and speak plain to you even now, Deucal ion. Tell me, old friend, what is it?” “What of this new empress?” He frowned. “I might have guessed y 7 our subject,” he said. “Then speak upon it. Tell me of all the changes that have been made. What has this Phorenice done to make her throne unstable in Atlan tis?” Tatho frowned still. “If I did not know you to be as honest as our Lord the Sun, your- questions would carry mischief with them. Phor enice has a short way 7 with those who are daring enough to discuss her politics for other purposes than politely to praise them.” “You can leave me ignorant if you wish,” I said,* with a touch of chill. This Tatho seemed to be different from the Tatho 1 had known at home —Tatho my workmate, Tatho who had read with me in the college of priests, who had run with me in many a furious charge, who had labored with me so heavily that the peoples under us might prosper. But he was quick enough to see my change of tone. “You force me back to my old self,” he said, with a half-smile, “though it is hard enough to forget the caution one has learned during this last 20 years, even when speak ing with you. Still, whatever may 7 have happened to the rest of us, it is clear to see that you at least have not •changed, and, old friend, I am ready 7 to trust you with my life if you ask it. In fact, you do ask me that very thing when you tell me to speak all 1 know of Phorenice.” I ndoded. This was more like the old times, when there was full con fidence between us. “The gods will it now that I return to Atlantis,” I said, “and what happens after that the gods alone know. But it would be of service to me if I could land on her shores with some knowledge of this Phorenice. for at present I am as ignorant ccnceining her as some savage from Europe or mid-Africa.” “What would y ou hare me tell?” “Tell all. I know only that she a woman, reigns, where, by the an cient law of the land, a man should rule; that she is not even ci the priestly clan from which the law says all rulers must be drawn; and that, from what you say, she has caused the throne to totter. The throne was as firm as the everlast ing hills in the old king's day, Ta tho.” “History has moved with pace since then, and Phorenice has spurned it. You know 7 her origin?” “I know only the exact little I have told you.” “She was a swineherd’s daughter from the mountains, though this Is never even whispered now, as she has declared herself to be a daugh ter of the gods, with a miraculous birth and upbringing. As she has decreed it a'' sacrilege to question this parentage, and has ordered to be burned all those that seem to rec ollect her more earthly origin, the fable passes current for truth. You see the faith I put in you, Deucal ion, by telling you what you wish to learn.” “There has always been trust be twen us.” “I know; but this habit of sus picion is hard to cast off, even with you. However, let me put your good faith between me and the torture further. Zaemon, you remember, was governor of the swineherd’s prov ince, and Zaemon’s wife saw Phor enice and took her away to adopt and bring up as her own. It is said that the swineherd and his women objected; perhaps they did; anyway, I know they died; and Phorenice was taught the arts and graces, and brought up as a daughter of the Priestly clan.” “But still she was an adopted daughter only,” I objected. “The omission of the ‘adopted’ was her will at an early age,” said Ta tho, dryly, “and she learned early to have her wishes carried into fact. It was notorious that before she had grown to 15 years she ruled not only the women of the household, but Zaemon also, and the province that was beyond Zaemon.” “Zaemon was learned,” I said, “and a devout follower of the gods, and searcher into the higher mysteries; but, as a ruler, he was always a flabby fellow.” “I do not say that opportunities have not come usefully in Phoren ice’s way, but she had genius as well. For her to have raised her self at all from what she was, was remarkable. Not one woman out of a thousand, placed as she was, would have grown to be aught higher than a mere wife of some sturdy country man, who was sufficiently simple to care nothing for pedigree. But look at Phorenice: it was her whim to take exercise as a man-at-arms and practice with all the utensils of war; and then, before anyone quite knows how or why it happened, a rebellion had broken out in the province, and here was she, a slip of a girl, leading Zaemon’s troops.” “Zaemon, when I knew him, was a mere derision in the field.” “Hear me on. Phorenice put down the rebellion in masterly fashion, and gave the conquered a choice between sword and serv. *e. They fell into her ranks at once, and were faithful to her from that moment. I tell you, Deucalion, there is a marvelous fas cination about the woman. [To Be Continued.]
