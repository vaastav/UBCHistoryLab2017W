The lawyers went on talking The judge went on listening. No body seemed to worry. After the girl had sat uncon scious for nearly 10 minutes, a woman ln the audience WHIS PERED to the bailiff. He brought a glass of water and touched it tc her pile lips. There was so sign - of life. Then her attorney ceased bis . arguing at the bar and took notice, i He picked the girl up and car - ried her from the courtroom, just 1 as the members of the jury who > were to hear her suit against the man she claimed had wronged her, ' filed in and took their places. Nobody made a move to assist. Nobody seemed concerned. The Juil_<e sat apparently as un- | moved as a mummy on the bench. Opposing attorneys stared in blank curiosity. The great machinery of the court was unruffled. The wheels of justice moved coldly on wlth ' out a hitch. It waa the humanity of a court of law! If the judge bad shown algns of sympathy for a Buffering litigant, or undue interest in summoning aid, he might have committed an 1 error. The final verdict might have been set aside by the supreme court. Was he AFRAID to be human? If anyone had shown a heart flutter, justice might have miscar ried. An error of law might have been committed! Let the girl die? Ah, but the dignity of the court must be pre served ! We must not sho wsympathy, compassion, kindness, helpfulness —only the law and the evidence. The wheels of justice must move on, without feaf or favor! The scales must balance evenly, coldly, measuring out our fate. No place for a drop of heart blood. WAUKEGAN, lll.—Admittance, two potatoes.

C, Dec. 5.— The first demonstration by suffra gists, such as "heckled" the Brit ish house of commons in the past, occurred in congress here today while President Wilson was read ing his annual message to a Joint sessio nof the house and benate. Soon after the presilent had started speaking a big yellow silk banner was unfurled from the house gallery by a group of suf frage sympathizers. It bore the inscription: "Mr. President, what will you do for woman's suffrage?" A page was dispatched to the gallery hurriedly and tore down the banner. The president went on with the reading of Ms speech, apparently giving the banner no attention, though it was unfurled directly ln front of him. The unfurling of the banner had been carefully planued. Immediately after the demon stration, pamphlets were passed out by women In the corridors, giving printed details of just what happened Insofar as the women were concerned. This printed in formation Included the names of tho women who unfurled the ban ner. James Griffen, a page, went down in history as the youth to draK down the first suffrage bat tle flag unfurled in the halls of congress.

AMERICANS REPORTED SAFE; CONSUL KILLED il niii-il Prt-KM I iri~.il Wlrr.) ■L PASO, Tox., Dec. 5. —The first autlie.ntie nows from Ameri cans in Chihuahua City reached relatives today. Aliduelion of German Consul Vogel of Matamoras by bandits, said to be Villlstas, was reported MILLIONS SPENT ON soldiers; As a means of showing compar atively the amount of money that will be spent ln Washington and the Northwest for maintenance of, the proposed army post at Amen can lake, government statistics have been obtained regarding the Texas Cit yand Galveston soldiers. There are 10,000 nvjn In the! 2nd division at these two points. I Statistics were taken from March I 1, 19K1, to Oct. It, 1915, a period! of 32 months. During that time $6,000,000, was spent for fuel, forage nnd sub- , ■istence, and $8,000,000 tor the! salaries of men and officers. This is at the rate of $450,000 a month I for 10,000 men, and does not; take any account of the money! spent for rifles, artillery, cart-1 ridges, harness, wagons, autos and auto trucks. Thus, army men estimate, the 1 figure of $620,000 a month, or $7,400,000 a year, that it is fig ured would be spent at American lake for the maintenance of 15, --670 officers and men is very con servative. In addition to the $7,400,000 which wilt be spent annually Cor maintenance of the American lake army post, Tacoma and other Washington cities will be able to bid for contracts to supply the soldiers with uniforms, ihoes and all manner of clothing.
