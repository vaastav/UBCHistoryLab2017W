THE PRESIDENTS' MESSAQE President Roosevelt's annual message was transmitted to both houses of Congress Tuesday. It is a voluminous and exhaustive document, treating mainly of the public measures and needs which Congress has failed to provide effective laws for during all the Presidents' administra tion. The recommendations made by the President are nu merous and, if Congress would enact legislation in accordance witli the suggestions of the ex ecutive, the entire nation would be much benefitted. Among the most important recommenda tions are those pertaining to the national control of combinations ; the supervision of all railroads by the Interstate Commerce Commission; the limit of the power of injunction and other salutary measures for the bene fit of labor; the preservation of forests and all natural resources; the improvement of inland wa terways; the establishment of postal savings banks and of local parcels post on rural routes; the Federal control of fisheries; the improvement of the army and navy; the granting of American citizenship to Porto Ricans; the admission of Arizona and New Mexico as separate states and many other sensible suggestions for the good of the nation. It is not at all probable that Con gress will do any of the good things recommended by the President for the reason that the time will be spent in a senseless attempt to get even.

CHRISTMAS SHOPPER The Christmas shopper and that means everyone who has a dollar to spend in the Christmas season is the annual recipient of abundar.t advice as to the ad vantages of early shopping. In a number of cities the promulga tion of this advice has taken or ganized form. We have what are termed "Consumers' Leagues," originating, as we believe, in Philadelphia, the principal pur pose of which seems to be to en courage and persuade the pros pective buyer of Christmas gifts to buy early and avoid the rush. The advice is positively good- It appeals to the sober common sense of every person; and to ac cept it and act upon it is demon strably advantageous to mer chants, clerks and the purchasing public. To what extent does it become effective? This is a question that is best answered by the individual pur chaser. It is a question which the individual purchaser should E (BABSPET& MmoU si IE a In Resolve to visit us. We have something suitable for every member of the family,.

It really suggests an individual duty and service of self interest that, properly appre ciated, would make the advice most effective. 'r -The advantages of early Christ mas buying to all concerned have been dwelt uponlso frequently and so fully as to preclude rhe utterance of anything new.on the subject." The better service to the buyer from the greater leisure of the seller; the avoidance of the cruel nervous strain and physical fatigue of the time-honored Christmas rush have been forci bly and convincingly presented. Bat all this goes for naught, un less each person who intends to buy Christmas goods shall con sider the counsel as a matter of individual concern. Suppose that we should abandon the idea that the suggestion of early buying was intended for that indefinite aggregation known as the gener al public, and that we were to consider, each in his individual capacity, that it . was meant for us; thar. the advantage was ours and was worth the while. What would follow? v The Christmas holiday, in its practical aspects, would be rationally observed; in most appreciative manner we would do ourselves a benefit and evince our good will toward all others. THE NEXT GOVERNOR Prominent Men Mentioned as Candidates. There is now considerable guessing being done by state politicians as to who will be the next candidate for Governor of Oregon. While the Secretary of State will fill out Governor Chamberlain's unexpired term, in the event of the Governor be ing elected to the United States Senate, still the next general election is not so far distant and fence building has already been commenced to corral the big prize. Among the prominent Repub licans who have thus far been mentioned for the office are the names of S. L. Kline, of Corval lis, president of the Oregon Re tail Grocers' Association; Dr. James Withycombe, of OAC, Corvallis; ex-State Senator C. W. Ilodson, president of the Portland Commercial Club; J, II. Ackerman, State Superin tendent of Public Instruction; J. W. Bailey, State Food and Dairy Commissioner; Dr. An drew C. Smith, former State Senator; Thomas Ryan, of Ore gon City, and District Attorney George J. Cameron. The Demo crats thus far have given pref erence to State Railway Com missioner Oswold West; Mayor Harry Lane, of Portland, and ex-District Attorney John Man ning. llie mention of the name of La irao asff Bangjm, TdDtD considering the problem of t S. L Kline for the highest office in the state is a compliment both to that gentleman and to his' home city. Mr. Kline has a wide acquaintance throughout the state and his position as---presi-dent of the Oregon Retail Groc ers' and ; Merchants Association has brought him into personal: contact with the ' leading, busi ness men of the commonwealth. Should he receive the nomina-. tion and be elected, there is no question but what he would give Oregon a conservative and business-like administration, while his loyalty to r the Republican party is unquestionable.
