WIFE CHARGED WITH MCRD*R. Mm. John 'Hoiwek Arretted While At tending Her Hatband's Funeral. New Virginia, Dec. 6.—While at tending her husband's funeral, Mrs. Margaret Hossack yesterday was ar rested by Sheriff Lewis Hodson of Warren county, charged with the murder of her husband, John Hos siick, who was killed in cold blood Saturday night at the Hossaek home, six mile's northwest of this place. The attendance at the funeral was unusually large, farmers coming for miles around to attend. But when the sheriff stepped up to Mrs. Hos sack, shortly after the last chunk of dirt hnd been thrown upon the newly made grave, and she was on her way to town with her children by her side, the arrest caused a tremendous sensation.. Mrs. Hossack took the arrest calmly, evidently having an ticipated the event. She expressed a desire to go first to her home to get a few things and withih an hour the sheriff and the accused were on their way to the county jail at In dianola. More than twenty witnesses were examined by the coroner and his jurj before the evidence was closed. Al most the last witness, and by far the most important one examined, was Mrs. Hossack herself. She reiterated her former statements of the crime, and although she was under examin ation for nearly three hours nothing in the way of causing her to break down or to cross herself her c\i dence resulted tr The evidence upon which Mrs. Hos sack was arrested is purely circum stantial, the only testimony being to the effect that Hossack and ins wife had frequent quarrels, and tne im probability of the woman storj that she slept peacefully by the side of the murdered man and heard no sounds until after it was all over and the murderer had escaped through the front door. TITUS SATS AMENDMENT IS VALID. Points to Earlier Court Decision* to Sn«taln His Constitution. Muscatine, Dec. 6.—Senator Titu», author of the Titus amendment for biennial elections in Iowa, is firm in the belief that the new law is no invalidated l)ecauK€ of its failure of entry on the house journal. "In the Iowa prohibitory liquor amendment case," said the senator, "the court held that it was not es sential to the determination of the case. While opinions differ, the great weight of authority holds that omis sions and errors which work no wrong to substantial rights are to be disregarded. I have conferred with both AtorUey General Remley and Attorney General-elect Mullan. Neither has given an adverse opinion as reported. We are again to have the question passed upon by the su preme conrt and will secure just as early a decision as possible." TO ISII'K.ICH THEIR MAYOR.

Iowa Has One l'aper in the List in Printers' Ink. Des Moines, Dec. 3.—Printers' Ink, a New York journal of the newspa per craft, prints a list of "the forly best newspapers in the United States," prepared by an advertiser. The only Iowa paper in the list is the Des" Moines Daily News, a fact the more complimentary because the Daily News is sent to mail subscrib ers for $1 a year, being the lowest priced daily in the world.

TITUS AMENDMENT Declared Void Because of an Error ,by Journal Clerks. Burlington, Dec. 5.—1tfhc Hawkeye claims that the Titus amendment is absolutely void because of the failure of the journal clerks to spread the same as adopted upon the journal of the house. The Hawkeye sums-up the case as follows: "1. The constitution required that the resolution amending that instru ment must be entered at length upon the journals of each (both) houses. "2. It was not so entered in tli" house journal of the twenty-seventh general assemblj'. "3. The supreme court has hoin that this is mandatory and failure to comply renders the amendment null and void. "4. Uposj a rehearing the eo 'ft re affirmed and reinforced its opinion by the statement that 'where the ex isting constitution prescribes a meth od for its own intendment, an amend ment thereto to be valid must lie in strict conformity to that method. Omitting the entering in fuller the resolution upon the house journal was a glaring violation of the pre scriptions oi the constitution anil renders the amendment invalid. Sl'KI'-DV TEST TO BE MADE. Supreme Court to Fast on the Titur Amendment. Iov.a City, Dec. .1.—Attorney Gen eral Milton Remley, Senator Titus and Attorney WILL BK HAItD FOUGHT CASE. Warreu County Tragedy Transferred to the Court*. Indianola, Dec. 7.—Mrs. John Hos sack, who has been arrested for the murder of her husband, was brought to this city and lodged in jail. Several members of the family were in the city arranging matters of business and preparing for the long legal contest which is no doubt soon to follow. There is every indication that the Hossack ease will be hard fought. The fact that all the evidence against Mrs. Hossack, as far as has been given out. is purely circumstantial that the family has lived in the vic inity for more than thirty years, and has numberless friends. The family is well-to-do and has plenty of money at its command to fight the case. The accused takes her arrest with considerable stoicism, although it is apparent that she feels the. disgrace attending her arrest keenly. COUNTY liA KD HIT. Verdict of 98,000 Against Webster County in llively Case. Fort Dodge, Dec. 7.—A message from Clarion announces the finding of a verdict against Webster county in the Hively vs. Webster county case for $8,000. The verdict caused a sur prise among the county officials in this city, as it. was commonly expect ed that the plaintiffs would secure a verdict, but it was not expected to in any way reach the amount returned by the jury. Killed While Quail Hunting. Chariton, Dee. 3.—John Slielton wa.-s shot through the head and killed by E. P. Smoot. a companion, while out hunting. How it happened is not known, as Smoot is crazy with grief and unable to give the particular He has gone from one swoon into an other since the accident, and it U. feared he will not recover from the shock. It is generally accepted to have been accidental, as Smoot has an enviable reputation. Renegade Shoots His 1 If a slight variation in the phraseology of the prohibitory amendment made it. invalid, how much greater in destructive effect must be the entire omission of tlie resolution from the house journal. The constitution was clearly violaUv. and its requirements ignored in the house of the twenty-seventh general assembly and consequently th: amendment is of no effect.-' General-elect Mul­ lan of Iowa, in conference here, formulated a plan whereby they hope to secure a speedy opinion of the supreme court and put an end to the Titus amendment muddle. While they refused to state their plan which was agreed upon, it is understood that they have mad ar rangements for a test case in the su preme court at an early date. The case as proposed will be brought up in a district court before a judge who will give a speedy decision nud will at once be carried up as the case is tried. The supreme court, it is under stood, is not adverse to advancing the case on the calendar and render ing a decision at once. The argu ments will probably be submitted to the supreme court in advance and everything be in readiness in order that a decision can be rendered promptly. It is expected that the decision willl be made the first day the supreme court is in session. None of the state officers is disposed to question the right of these men, elected at the last election, to take charge of he offices and none is will ing to make the test. The case, as proposed, will be*an earnest controversy and it is ex pected that both Remley and Mullan will champion the cause of the newly elected man who wit. make the test. Both of these men believe that the amendment should be construed ac cording to the intent of the author. Senator Titus, who thought he was framing a bill which would lengthen the terms of the o.-.ecrs w-hose terms expired on the first Monday in Janu ary, 1902. Wife. Burlington, Dec. 1.—Vincent Dodge, a worthless resident, shot his wife twice in an attempt to murder her. The wounds are not necessarily fatal. The woman is in the hospital and Dodge escaped. Probably Accidental. Allerton, Dec. 1.—William Barber shot and killed himself in his own yard. Whether it was accidental or done with intent to kill is not known. Mr. Barber was in good circum stances and there seems to be no plausible reason for j.im killing him* self. 

NEWS IN GENERAL -J BRITAIN IB FIBM. H*r to 5o Ultimatum Could Force Forego Her Plans London, Dec, 7—The fifteenth par liament of the reign of Queen Vic toria opened yesterday. Before the lights went out in the ancient cham bers almost every leading politician had spoken. Such fierce personal an imosity and such bitter invective nad scarcely ever before marked the pro ceedings at Westminster. Mr. Joseph Chamberlain, secretary of state for the colonies, was the center of the storm. The policy ox the empire re garding South Africa and China, the action of the government in causing a dissolution when it. did, the conduct of the war against, the Boers, and, in fact, all the questions vitally affect ing the empire, w-ere gravely discuss ed and explained, but dominating all was the opposition's hatred of the colonial secretary. After the reading of the queen's speech Lord Salisbury, after paying a tribute to the skill of Lord Roberts and General Kitchener and to the bravery of the officers and soldiers, said the Tratisvaalers, the Free Stat ers and the world should understand there could be no ueviation from the policy of the government already ov.-r. lined. Anything resembling indepen dence never could be granted. The war must proceed to the inevitable issue. We must let it be felt that no one, by the issue of an insolent and auda cious ultimatum could force the Brit ish government to humble itself and abandon its rights. He could never allow that a shred of independence should be left, llow soon the Free Staters and the Transvaalers would have anything like self-government depenued on themselves. It might be years and it might be generations. The feature of the session was Lord llosebery's spirited attack on the government, lie was unsparing in his criticism of the dissolution of parliament, the conduct of the war and the policy of the government towards China, anil everything han dled by the cabinet. Lord Rosebery's comment on the charges against Mr. Chamberlain, the secretary of state for the colonies, was severe.*1*He. deprecated overbelief in the ejre^ita&flity of aSlithe charges, but saia^evident ^fiat the head of the cabinet had failed in proper supervision and the pride of England in the purity of its public men had suffered. PEACE TKKMS AKK FIXED. Amercan View Prevail* on Certain Con troverted Points. Washington, Dec. 5.—The state de partment. announces that the minis ters at Peking yesterday reached an agreement which was submitted to the home offices. Secretary Hay yes terday cabled Mr. Conger authoriza tion to sign the agreement on be half of the United States govern ment. It is difficult to gather de tails of the understanding at this time. However, it is known that on the two important issues that, were still open, namely, those relating to punishment and indemnity, the view of the United States government, has prevailed. As to punishment, they are. to be the severest that can be inflicted by the Chinese govern ment. As to indemnity the Chinese government, is to formally .admit, its liability and then the matter is to be left for future negotiation. It is understood that on other points the French proposition formed the basis of the agreement. London, Dec. 6.—"It is the general belief here," says the Tien Tsin cor respondent of the Daily Mail, wiring Tuesday, "that China will accept the demands of the joint note which all the powers approve within a fort night. or three weeks, and that then the second stage of the negotiations —the examination of proposal after proposal in detail—will begin."' KMTKROK SNUIIS KltUOKR. Saul l'revioiin Engagement Prevented Meeting at Berlin. Berlin, Dec. 4.—Mr. Kruger has abandoned his proposed visit, to Ber lin owing to the receipt of an offi cial intimation that Emperor William regrets that in consequence of previous arrangements, he will be unable to receive him. The Boer statesman will therefore procee direct from Cologne to Holland. He telegraphed to this effeet this after noon. The Cologne Gazette, in an inspir ed comminique says: "Mr. Kruger's visit is not agreeable to Germany his aim being to obtain intervention in South Africa. It would be a grave political mistake, it would be even a great crime, to allow him to entertain even a spark of hone chat Germany will render him any prac tical support." This declaration is accompanied with reproaches, Mr. Kruger being charged with having encouraged useless guerilla wart are and having disregarded Germany's advice when he might, have still fol lowed it. The press generally strikes the same note. Iteer Tax Slated for Cot. Washington, Dec. 7.—The revenue reduction bill is completed by the re publican members of the ways and means committee. Chairmar. Payne has introduced it. It is understood that in addition to the abolition of stamp taxes on telegrams, express receipts and proprietary medicines, heretofore reported, there will be a reduction in the beer tax to $1.60, or 25 cents per barrel. Stamp taxes are almost entirely wiped out, with the exception of the tax on stocks. Death of Mrs. Miller. Washington, Dec. 3.—Mrs. Eltoa W. Miler, widow of the late Associate Justice Miller of the United States court, was found dead in bed Satur day morning at her home in this city. Death resulted from Angina pectoris. Mrs. Miller had just returned from her old home in Keokuk, Iowa. Thanksgiving evening she dined with Senator and Mrs. Cullom. This is the way Goethe defined it: "111 humor is nothing more than an inward feeling of our own want of merit, a dissatisfaction with our selves." MICASAUCA CANAL. ••port of the Commission Submitted to Congress. Washington, Dec. 5.—The report ol the Isthmian canal commission, sub mitted by the president to congress j'esterday, gives as a unanimous con clusion of that body that "the most practicable and feasible route for the Isthmian canal under the control, management and ownership of tlio United States is taken as the Nicar agua route." 1'he commission esti mates the cost of this route at. $200, 540,000. This estimate, much in ex cess of any heretofore made, is due to the increased dimensions and oth er features not heretofore consid ered. The commission also estimates the cost of the canal by the Panama route at. $142,342,579, according to one route, and $156,378,258 according to another route, As between the Nic aragua and Panama route the com mission sums up a number of advan tages favorable to the former. It states also that, under the conces sions given by the Panama govern ment to the Panama Cauul company that, the company is not, free to grant necessary rights to the United States, except upon conditions made by the company. The report, is al most as long as the president's mesi sage. Although the work of the com mission is not yet completed, many field parties still being out, yet jt. has been sufficiently advanced to make it practicable to present tho preliminary report giving essential findings. 

ENGLAND IS THREATENED Mercier Tells French Senate an vasion Would be Easy. Paris, Dec. 5.—General Mercier caused a deep sensation in the senate yesterday during the debate on the naval bill by pointing out the ease by which England could be invaded. He demanded that the government introduce into tue plans for mobili zation of the army and navy methods for the rapid embarkation of an ex peditionary corps. The president, M. Fallieres, intervened, declaring that such proposals were out of oraer. Iu the course of an extraordinary speech General ftfercier said: "In- view of the possibility of war wifcitvfireat Britain, the use of the army is not sufficiently taken .nto ac count. The tiuie is not what it was a hundred years ago. Moreover, Eng land herself is no longer the same. The Transvaal war has shown that the British army, althousrii brave, is not equal to the task which England expected it to. perform. The British navy is powerful, but it nas many coasts to defend. "France therefore is numerically England's equal at certain points and is even her superior in tne instru ments of destruction. A landing in England, therefore, is not beyond re alization. "This is not only my opinion but that, also of high naval officers. The British premier recently expressed significant fears, and, if the prineipje of landing is admitted, the practical means of execution may be discussed. "I venture to think tliut the work I prepared while commanding an army corps would serve as a basis for such a project, which would not be expensive." At this point, protests were raised and M. Fallieres asked General Mer cier not to enter into the details of the scheme. General Mercier replied that the scheme could be "held over the head of England like the sword of Da mocles" and he proposed a resolution that the senate should invite the government to complete immediate preparations for the mobilization of the army and navy by preparing everything necessary to embark and disembark as rapidly as possible an expeditionary corps. Protests were raised from various benches and if. de Lenessan, minister of marine, followed the president's ruling that the motion was out of order in the present debate by de claring amid cneers that the govern ment could not possibly accept it. 

IIOLLAND HAS A WELCOME. Cordial Hand Extended Oom Paul at The Hague. The Hague, Dec. 7.—At the opening of the second chamber yesterday^ President Gleichnian said: "President Kruger arrives here to day. I take occasion to propose that the chamber authorize me to wel come, in its name, the president to our country and offer him an expres sion of our cordial sympathy." The proposal was adopted amid cheers. When Kruger arrived he was greet ed at the station by the burgomaster and councellors and a choir of 610 girls, who chanted Psalm 72, verses 6, 7 and 11. The former president and suite then repaired to the royal waiting room, where the burgomas ter warmly welcomed him in a brief speech.

It is also stated that Germany means to appoint consuls at places throughout that region.
