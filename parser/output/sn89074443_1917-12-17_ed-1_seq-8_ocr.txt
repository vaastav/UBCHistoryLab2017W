THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE what it lias to say regarding domestic conditions, President Wil son's message to congress has at least one very strong point. In its failure to mention another equally important domestic matter the message is disappointing. The president recognizes the fact that all that should be done in price regulation lias not been done. He recognizes that, in fixing the price of wheat, the government has regulated and cut down the price on what the farmer has to 

SELL, Avhile the farmer is held up for exorbitant prices and profits on what he has to BUY. This is the strong part of his message in regard to domestic conditions. But the president fails to recommend a revision of the plan of congress for financing the war. He does not ask for heavier war profits taxes, or insist that a larger proportion of the revenue be raised by taxation of wealth and swollen incomes. The war profits tax of 30 per cent, made by congress, is inadequate. It leaves in the hands of the war profiteers 70 per cent of the five billion dollars a year they are making out of the distress of humanity. Great Britain takes 80 per cent of the excess war profits. AVe should take at least that. The president, however, leaves the way open to make such a recommenda tion. He says he will deliver other messages to congress, as the session proceeds. It is safe to say that the great majority of the people sincerely hope that he will use his further opportunities to speak to congress to take up this matter. The president's recognition of the fact that all is not well in regard to price-fixing should cheer League members. His language on that point is almost in the exact words of the resolutions adopted by League delegates at their great conference at St. Paul last September. He says: Recent experience has convinced me that the congress must go further in authorizing the government to set limits to prices. The law of supply and demand, I am sorry to say, has been replaced by the law of unrestrained selfishness. While we have eliminated profiteering in sev eral branches of industry it still runs impudently rampant in others. The farmers, for example, complain with a great deal of justice that, while the regulation of food prices restricts their incomes, no restrictions are placed upon the prices of most of the things they must themselves pur chase and similar inequities obtain on all sides. The newspapers that called the farmers traitors for using almost this identical language at the big St. Paul conference, will get little satisfaction from this part of the president's message. WHO 

PROMOTED THE P. S. COMMISSION? of the street car employes at St. Paul and Minneapolis Avho are attempting to get justice in wages and working condi tions, are pointing out some very interesting thifigs in regard to the Minnesota Public Safety commission. The Safety commission recently ordered employes of the street car company not to wear but tons signifying their membership in their union. In other words, the commission objected to workmen identifying themselves as organized workmen while on duty. The same situation would exist among farmers if the Public Safety eommission should order persons to refuse to do business with farmers .J *jx -.1 EVERY PAGE BIGHT who wore buttons signifying they belonged to the Nonpartisan league, the Equity, the Grange, Farmers' union or other farmers' organiza tions. Farmers, who, during last year's campaign, wore buttons signifying they were members of the League, and farmers and people generally will see nothing to approve in the silly order of the Safety commission. The National Counsel of Defense has asked the Minne sota Safety commission to withdraw its foolish requirement about the union buttons, but the commission has refused to comply with the re quest. It may seem to some a silly thing to fight over,, but no can blame the organized workmen who refuse to permit this insult to their organization. The friends of the union workmen charge that the law creating the Public Safety commission was obtained by the street ear magnates for the very purpose of helping the company in case of trouble with its employes, and in addition to "get" Mayor Van Leer of Minneapolis, who has the united support of the union men and common people gen erally and who is against a new franchise for the company on the present terms. They point out that it is of public record that Ambrose Tighe wrote the bill which was passed by the legislature creating the commission. Tighe is general counsel for the street car corporation. They also point out that it is of public record that Senator J. D. Sulli van of Stillwater, Minn., introduced into the legislature the bill written by Tighe. Sullivan is an attorney of the street car magnates and represents their interests at Stillwater, being on the payroll of the corporation. The law creating the Minnesota Public Safety commission is a re markable one, giving almost unlimited authority to the iliembers of the commission, on which is no farmer or working man. No other state has delegated such sweeping powers to a body of men, even under the necessity of concentrated authority in war times. The union men point out that the street car corporation has stead fastly refused to'agree to arbitration of the labor troubles by the St. Paul city commission, by the federal government or by any other neutral .body—the company wants the safety commission, apparently created by the activity of its agents, to do the arbitrating. And the result is that union men arc insulted by a nonsensical order forbidding tlicm to exhibit the emblem of their organization. MR.
