PAGE SIX THE MOHAVE COUNTY MINER AND OUR MINERAL WEALTH, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 6, 1919. IS READ TO CONGRESS A diversified program to restore a peace time business status, revise the tax system, curb unrest, reduce the cost of living and rectify labor and f aiming conditions was recommended by President Wilson in his message to the new session of congress. The president asked for new tariff laws based on the nations changed relation to the rest of the world, sug gested that the income and excess profiits tax schedules be simplified, advocated steps to improve rural con ditions and promote production, and "declare or a "genuine democratiza tion of industry" to protect both labor and capital. The railroad problem he reserved for a future message and he made no statement of his intentions regarding the peace treaty of Mexico. Many of his resolutions were the 'same as those submitted to the special (session last -spring and several of therm are embraced in legislation al ready being formulated in the two houses. To meet the cost of living, the presi dent asked extension of the war time food control bill, federal regulation of cold storage, readjustment of food transportation and establishment of a system of federal licensing for all cor porations engaged in interstate com merce He declares the causes of unrest to be superficial and temporary and made his only reference to the senate's fail ure! to ratify the peacetreaty in say ing that restlessness was due largely to the nations hesitation in determin ing its peace policy. The federal gov ernment, he declared, should be armed with full authority to deal in the crim inal courts with those who promote violence. In an extended discussion of labor conditions, he declared the workers had just cause for complaint in many matters, and that there should be a "full recognition of the right of those who work, in whatever rank, to par ticipate in some organic way in every decision that directly affects their wellfare." He asserted that the right of indi viduals to strike must bo held invio late, but added that there must be a firm stand against "the attempts of any class to usurp that only govern ment itself has a right to exercise as a protection to all. Finally he suggested the establish ment of a tribunal for peaceful decis ion of industrial disputes. He renewed his recommendation for a budget system of national finances, esked for special protection to pro mote the dye-stuffs and chemical in dustries and declared the administra tion bill providing farms for soldiers should be passed 'without delay. The message, about 5,000 words in length, was transmitted to' the capitol by messenger, the president expresing regret that his health, would not per mit his delivery of it in person. It was read seperately in senate! Uind house where it drew mixed expres sions of approbation and (disappoint ment. The democrats generally prais ed it as setting forth decisively a prac tical program of reform, while on the republican side there were many com plaints that it lacked definiteness and omitted mention of important problems. U. S. HAS 19, 

PHYSICALLY FIT MEN According to a report from Wash ington, the United States ha a poten tial military strength of 19,000,000 men, and 80 per cent, of theimen of the country between the ages of 18 and 43 years of age are physically fit. This fact is said to be revealed by a final study of the selective draft records. The total number registered was 23,908,575. The medical reports indicate, it is said, that the section from which the greatest percentage of healthy men came runs north and south through the center of the country. SALE OF THRIFT STAMPS & TREASURY CERTIFICATES TO BE CONTINUED THRU 1920 San Francisco, Dec. 5 Definite an nouncement that theJGovernment will continue the sale of Thrift and War Pavings Stamps and Treasury Savings Certificates during 1920 was received here today from the Treasuiy Depart ment by C. A. Famsworth', Associate Director of the War Loan Organiza tion of the Twelfth Federal Reserve District. "I know that this will be pleasing, not only to hundreds of able Ameri cans, who, recognizing thfe value of the Government's thrift work, have given of their time and ability in fur thering it," said Famsworth, "but it will be equally as well received by those who have taken advantage of the exceptional opportunity of saving offered by the Government through the Thrift and War Savings Stamp and Treasury Savings Certificate. To the educators of the west, too, who have adopted the Government's thrift program in the schools as a valuable factor in habit forming education, I. am sure that this guarantee of the permanency of the War Savings move ment will be gratifying." In making the announcement, Wil liam Mather Lewis, Director of the Savings Division of the Treasury De partment, said, "The savings move ment is to be continued throughout 1920. The 1920 issue of Thrift and War Savings Stamps and Treasury Savings Certificates will be on sale January 1. Monthly sales for 1919 have been showing a steady and wholesome increase, while the prog ress of the thrift movement in the schools and industrial organizations and generally has been gratifying. We are off to a flying start for 1920 which promises to be a banner year for the savings movement." SEATTLE MAYOR BLAMES AUTHORITIES FOR RIOTS In a letter written yesterday by Mayor C. L. Fitzgerald of Seattle to the Editor of the New York World, in reply to an inquiry as to the feel ing of the people of the Northwest regarding the action of the Govern ment in taking aliens who are mem bers of the I. W. W. to the Eastern coast and then releasing them, on bail or otherwise, and allowing them to go back west again and continue their ac tivities, Mr. Fitzgerald intimated that such action by the Federal Govern ment is responsible for recent distur bances in the Northwest which finally culminated in the Armstice-Day shoot ing of World War Veterans at Cen tralia. Continuing Mr. Fitzgerald said: "I believe that so long as these dif ferent kinds of Anachists are allowed to travel from town to town in our country inflaming the minds of our people with their false doctrines, and heroes and martyrs are made of men who have been regularly convicted by due process of law in the duly consti tuted courts of our land, just that long will these outrages continue. "As Mayor of Seattle, I desire to say that we intend to keep our city free from this lawless element and I have suggested to them that in ar ranging itineraries in 'the future they leave out Seattle. We are still con fident that the Federal Government will soon find proper means to care for these Anarchists all over the coun try." Make Arizona the healthiest state in the American Union.

The matter of 1919 assessment against the Nellie Mining Company was taken up and discussed, and the Treasurer was instructed to deduct from their 1919 assessment the amount assessed against Patented Mining Claims for the reason that no patent has ever been received, or any assurance from the Land Office that a patent will be granted, and that they have done the full amount of assessment work on each claim for the year 1919. Taxes assessed against Paris V. Brough and Pete Vukoye for the years 1918 and 1919 were ordered stricken from the Tax Rolls, for the reason that they are discharged soldiers. County Treasurer, Wayne Hubbs, appeared before the Board with a list of delinquent taxes which he asked to be allowed to strike from the Tax Rolls for the reason that it ismostly personal property and uncollectable, having either been destroyed or moved from the County. It was unanimously agreed that the Treasurer be ordered to strike these taxes from the Rolls. Notary Bonds of A. Cornwall and Mary E. Carrow were approved by the Chairman of the Board. Mrs. G. E.

A committee of gentlemen from Chloride, consisting of Mr. Sterling, Mr. Graves and Mr. Ausenhaus, appeared before the Board and made a proposition that the citizens ofChloride would willingly repair the grade at the summit of the road leading to the Searchlight Ferry, which is in a deplorable condition, and would like to have the County give them whatever assistance they could. While the County's Road Fund is also in a deplorable condition at the present time, the Board feels that this road must be fixed, and it was unanimously agreed that the County would assist the Chloride citizens to the extent of $750.00 for this work. There being no further business before the Board they stand adjourned until nine o'clock A. M. December 15th ,1919. GEO. B.
