Comrade: Doubtless you feel some hesitancy-about taking the decisive step that we have been urging npon yon. It is not unnatural that yon should. It involves a tangential departure from the ideas with which you entered office and a radical vari ation from tho policy advocated by a large portion of the press and the political lead ers with which and whom you are in politi cal sympathy. But while this consideration has weight, it is; far from being any real obstacle to a man who has new convictions forced upon him. History is full of instances of men who have earned a glorious immortality of fame by a sudden-coming clearness of vision, which has shown the duties lying before them in an entirely new light. Throwing off their past like a garment, they have holdly entered upon the new path which better knowledge revealed to them and won tho lasting praise of all men by so doing. "We cannot refer you to a more im pressive insiance of this than is related in Acts, ix, 1-30. Paul, who had " been breathing out threat euiugs and s'aughter against the disciples of the Lord," went down to Damascus as a Special Examiner from the Interior Depart mental Jerusalem, with written instructions "that if he found auy of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them, bound, unto Jerusalem." The simi larity of his commission, to those issued from a Department of this Government will strike you. He was at once Judge and exe- cntiouer. He settled in his own mind who were guilty and jut how guilty they were, and then applied the penalty thatha thought would fit the crime He tried and sentenced them without their knowledge, and then called upon them to prove their innocence if they could. In the course of a few mouths he "suspended" a very large number in this summary way. But in the very midst of these special examinations Panl saw a wonderful light, and the result was that he turned his back on the Southern Brigadiers and Christian-haters of Judea, and became the greatest of all the Apostles. We introduce this incident, not because it bears a strong likeness to anything at pres ent occurring, but merely to show that radi cal alterations of policy, resulting from better acquaintance with the subject, are time-honored, and have a scriptural warrant. Such a departure in your case would not be as radical as it may at first appear to you. The unstinted vituperation of old soldiers, the malignant opposition to all forms of pensions all ways of justice is really confined to a relatively small portion of the people. Like the coyotes of the far Western, prairies, each one howls until he prodnces tho impression that he is 20, even 50, times as numerous as he is. The great mass of the American people are very proud of their citizen soldiers, and very auxious that justice shall be doue. Nor do they want this justice strained, They want it administered with a strong leaning toward generosity to those who in the days of the Nation's extremity v.ere extravagantly generous of their blood and their lives in rescuing it. Many people have been tempo rarily carried away -by the clamor that the Nation's gratitude has been abused, but they have not gone so far but they can be quick 13' recalled by an authoritative statement of the fact3. Ths makes your position clear and your duty plain. Tuu cannot any longer be in doubt that not only have tho great mass of pensions with singularly few ezceptious been honestly allowed and most justly deserved by those who have received and are receiving them, but you must be equally convinced that there are hundreds of thou sands of the most deserving veterans, and their widows, who are wrongfully, fraud ulently kept out of their righla by the unconscionable delays in settling their cases. If you wished you could startle and shock the country by pub lishing the evidence in your, possession of the mountainous volume of misery and suffering caused to the worthiest of men aud women by this cruel procrastination. Every mail that reaches the Pension Bureau must be laden with tear-compelling appeals for action on cases that have been hanging in it for weary years, and which represent all that stands between the cold mercies of the poorhouse aud the men who years ago gave the Government the priceless donation of their youug manhood's strength and courage. Comrade Lochren, the great, generous heart of the American people has never been appealed to in vain. The call of justice, mercy, and honor has never failed to stir it to the uttermost. It is now ready for such a call from you. For nine long months the country has been anxiously watching you for some decisive word on the much-vexed pension question. Now is the time to give it. Let it be a full statement of what facta you have learned during your occupancy of the office of Commissioner of Pensions a recital of the infinity of sorrow to which hundreds of thousands of deserving and rapidty-dyiug veterans are subjected by the delay in settling their claims and an appeal that you be given the means of settling every one of these cases by Dec. 21, 1891. Comrade Lochren, such an appeal will come like a burst of sunlight clearing away clouds of pestilential vapors. It will be as welcome to the justice-loving people as to the anxious veterans. For the people it will mean nn ending of their doubt and I solicitude as to their duty toward those to whom they feel they owe everything. To the veterans it will mean that at last the Winter is past, tho rain over and gone, the flowers will appear again on the earth, tho time of the singing of the birds will have come, and the voice of the turtle be heard in the land. "Will you not do it? The time is apt, oc casion lit, with head and heart agreeing. Yours, appealingly, The National Tkiiiunk. AN ANSWER TO THE PRESIDENT. The Commander-in-Chief of the Grand Army of the Republic has promptly met the baseless allegations in tho President's Message with the following timely circular: IlEADQUAnTKRS, G.A.R., L.YSS, M ass., Dec. 4, 1S93. f Circular No. 2. Whereas tlio President of tho United States, In his ruc.3nge to Congress, has stated I lint thousands of neighborhood have their well-known fraudulent pensioners, and as tho mission of the Grand Army of tho Republic is to encourage honor and purity in public affairs, I therefore call the attention of all I lie comrade.-, Posts, and Department of our Order to tho statement of tho President, and urge them to report to tho Honorable Commissioner of Pen sions, Washington, D. C. any person known to bo in receipt of n pension not juilly entitled to the same under the law, and to forward a duplicate of said report lo thee headquarters at once. Tho in formation that comes to these Headqunrlersdaily of comrades totally disabled whose pensions have been siiHpended, and of willows whoe husbands were killed in baillo, being suspended until they can provo that their husbands were naturalized citizens of the United Slate-, leads the Commander-in-Chief to believe that that statement is bioader than can be Mibslnntintcd by facts. If these wi .us actually exist, the Commander-in-Chief pledges the support of the Grand Army of tho Republic to those who attempt in tho line of duty to rectify these wronip, n-stiring them that tho Union vet erans are as anxious to guard the Treasury of tho Nation in time of peace as they were to defend its flag In limo of war. Jons G. B. Adamh, Comtnander-iu'Chlcf. Oflicial: James F. Mnncir, Adjutant-General. Tiie President's assertions were simply unwarranted by any facts within his knowl edge, or within the knowledge of anyone. They were the echo of a clamor which has been filling the soldier-hating papers for years, and for which no proof has been fur nished, though The National Tbibunb and other friends of the veterans have con stantly challenged them to produce even a m i u im um of proof. As our readers well know, we have per sistently and earnestly urged all manner of undeniably fair tests which would develop the truth in regard to pensions. In not a single instance have we been able to get even an answer from those who were attack ing pensions and pensioners. Still farther, in all the years that the pension system has been under fire not one of its assailants has ever suggested or advocated any plan by which the actual facta in regard to pensions might be ascertained. This is very significant. It shows con clusively that these men do not want the truth known. They fear it. They do not want anything which will interfere in the least with the wide liberty they give them selves in denouncing pensions and pen sioners. It is startling to find a President of the United States incorporating these calumnies in a formal State document, and giving them his powerful indorsement. It is simply in credible that he, of all others, can actually believe these to be true. For over nine mouths now he has, through, his subordi nates, been in absolute control of the Pension Bureau with all its records, files, papers, and oibcial machinery. The Bureau has de voted a large portion of its energies to in vestigations extending all over the country, and. wherever there was the least expecta tion that an investigation would be fruitful in developing fraud. It has spent hun dreds of thousands of dollars an unpre cedented amount in this work. What have been the results of this prodigious and costly effort? Practically nothing. A few unworthy pensioners may have beeu found here and there, as there will always be among any class of recipients of public money, no matter how carefully it id dis bursed. But the number of these has been astonishingly small. There has been much beating of journalistic tom-toms and sound ing of editorial hew-gags over alleged dis coveries from time to time, bnt when it came to the actual test of tho cases these have petered out in the weakest way, as in the much trumpeted Justice Long case, tho famous "bald-headed" case, and the Owen "slight deafness " case. If frauds exist so numerous and palpable as the President asserts, why have they not been shown up long ago? Nine months is a long time in which to do the work, and'with the hundreds of thousands of dollars ex pended on it, the best expert and (detec tive talent has been secured for it. Then, too, a pension case is a very simpl and easy thing to examine. It has no "com plicated and intricate features foicquiro the patience aud geuius of a Vidocq or a Fouche. Either the pensioner is the man he claims to be or he is not; either he terved in the regi ment he claims or he did not; either ho is disabled or ho is noL All these arc the p'ainest and simplest of facts, and can be determined by auy man of ordinary ability with quicknes and certainty. That all this determined effort, lavish in expense and extending over so long a period, has failed to show any appreciable propor tion of frauds, is tho strongest possible demonstration that they do not exist, except in the imaginations of men who hold that Union veterans as a class, and all that per tains to them, must necessarily be "wrong and deserving of condemnation. j The action of the Commatider-iu-Cliief i'b entirely right and proper. Though there is no legal or even civic obligation upon the comrades to volunteer in a "fraud hunt" which is being conducted by well-paid offi cials of the Government, yet it is well to reiterate in the strongest way the desire of all comrades that the pension roll shall con tain none but thoroughly deserviug men and women, and that the veterans of the Union, who mado it possible to have a Govcrdmenti ' a Treasury, aud a pension ioll, are the strongest supporters of that pension roll a3 a roll of honor. jf Tiie atrocious act of. the French rascal who threw a bomb into tho Chamber of Deputies last Saturday will case a general demand everywhertsforstringent legislation against such miscreants. But, really, this will be useless. Thetrorld has thoroughly tried the experiment "Of '.extraordinary pun ishments for 8pecially)heinous offenses, and found them worsj&tlftfn useless. It is the certainty rather tlfai? the severity of the punishment which deters men from the commission of crime. The French police have done admirably so far in promptly discovering and arresting the rascal. Now tho best that can be done, and all that can he done, is to guillotine him as speedily and quietly as the forms of law will permit, s; allowing him no opportunity for heroics aud sensational posing before the public. Nothing quelled anarchy in this country so effectively as tho execution of the Hay market bonih-fhrowcrs in Chicago. TnirNow York IHmcs thinks that now is the time to push tariff reduction, " because stocks are low and manufacturing greatly reduced." Certainly; the best time to take blood from a patient is when he is weakest. It ill probably kill him, but he will not feel ib as much as when he is strong and well. There are 3,000,000 men now out of employment, and the Times thinks it will not be pariicularly noticeable if a few mil lion more are thrown out. Nice paper for a period of commercial distress, that Times. TilEUEis some comfort to begotten out of decreased customs revenue. It shows that we are buying lcs3 abroad, and this means in time more purchases of home products. The hand-to-mouth policy which now pre vails among merchants is favorable lo Amer ican and unfavorable to foreign manufac turers. Such supplies as are needed must bo furnished at once, and not waited for until they can be brought across the ocean. We want to give a straight tip to many of tho able editors who are ridiculing Gov. Tillman's "State barroom." That is, that it will not be long until they will be called upon to support a similar system in their own States. It is the coming experi ment in regulating intemperance, aud sub stantially the whole civilized world is going to try it. The idea was first put into prac tical shape in Sweden, where it is known as "the Gothenburg1' systen," and its success there has directed general attention to it. The English clergy and politicians are ear nestly discussing it with reference to its in troduction into that cotintry, and it will not be long until it Wjill be a theme of absorb ing interest to our own clergymen and poli ticians. Txik Berlin lierichi ucber Handel und In dustrie makes this admission of the efficacy of our system of prorcction : Tho MeKinley bill had greater influence In'lS92 than in Hie foregoing year. Its couliuunuco in duced the Americans tocoininenco the manufacture of many articles for lheuetvr4 which they had previously imported, and consequently tha export of German goods to the United Statea fell ofl in a corresponding degree. We hear much from free traders about buying from foreign nations, so that they cm buy from us. They want us to first put our money in their pockets, and then, per chance, they will pay some of it back to us for our goods. Why is it not much better to put Iho money in the pockets of our own people, who can hardly help buying from us? Let us fir.it increase the purchasing power of our owu citizens. Oue customer iu the United States is worth a dozen in Europe. I,,. The stringency and competition of small concerns have bursted one of tho strongest trusts in the country, the National Plate Glas3, Association, witha capital of $10,000, 000. It is impossible that any of these trusts or combines shall havo'long life. There are too many men outsido of them anxious to make money. Tho -moment that auy big concern is seen to be making inordinate profits, competitors will immediately spring up and force a division of gains. John V. McKane, of Gravesend, L. I., thought he was a much bigger man than the courts of New York. The courts are now about to make an expert examination of his relative size, aud iu the tussle they will probably win six falls out of every half dozen. 9 The freely-given evidence of the Con gressional coHeagues of "Minister Para mount Blount" is to the effect that his distinguishing mental eharaeteris'ic was the colossal amount of things he didn't know. A fitting selection-lo inaugurate the Ha waiiau blunder.

Wo will make tho picture, print 100 cards, and send them to any address for $3. Sub scribers to The National Tbibune can get them for $2.75. Senator Hoar's comparison of Minister Willis's mission with the Biblical incident of Joab's treacherous assassination of Amasa, has caught the public fancy immensely. Undoubtedly the Administration intended that the incident should be carried out with scriptural completeness, and that Willis going to President Dole with words of pleasant greeting on his lips should plant the sword of destruction under tho fifth rib of his power. But cunning schemes of this kind depend for success wholly upon throwing the victim off his guard. The inference from tho Biblical narrative is fair, that if Amasa had becu aware of Joab's in tention, be would have sent that gentleman before the Coroner, instead of becoming a post mortcn exhibit himself. In this case Amasa Dole was fully advised of Joab Willis's intentions before the Administra tion's Lord High Executioner arrived in Honolulu. So wore the people of the United States, and if there i8 any prodding under the fifth rib to be done, it will be under other ribs than those of the Provisional Govern ment of Hawaii. . Ministeu Willis, as far as can be found out, declines to play the ignominious part he was sent to Hawaii to perform. He was de ceived by "Minister Paramount" Blount's misrepresentations, and finds the conditions in the Islands very different from what the Georgia malignaut pictured them. Willis seems to have some geuuinely-American ideas and principles, and is reluctant to be come the instrument of foisting a rotten old humbug of a monarchy upon a free and in telligent people to whom it has become in tolerable. The Senate is not in a humor to wait for the message' containing the facts in regard to Hawaii, which the President obligingly promised Congress when it should please him to send it in. Management of our for eign relations is the Senate's special prerog ative, and it is not at all pleased with such a fiagraut invasion of ita duties as the Presi dent contemplated. The request to have all the facts laid before it at once went through the Senate with scarcely a word of dissent or question. Uncle Sam: was exceedingly sersitive about his credit with the men who lent him money. The country, weak and staggering from the awful strains of the war, was taxed to the last limit of endurance in order to pay the money-lenders principal and in terest in gold. Why can he not show a little sensitiveness aa to his credit with the men who saved not only his credit but his life, and who have now been waiting more than a quarter of a century for him to fulfill his solemn promises to them? The stale old lie that the rebels 'only had 

GOO.OOO men in their armies bobs up ttgtin in the pages of a leading magazine. Where were the rest of the 1,700,000 men of military age that the figures show they had? None of them were at home. Were they all hid ing out, dodging tho conscripting officers? The Anlietam Commission has, after an immense amount of work and a very pains taking investigation of such facts and wit nesses as they could get hold of, prepared a I very valuable map of all the positions of the Uuion and Confederate brigades on the field of Antietam on the night of Sept. 16. This is now published by the Bureau of War Eecords of tho War Department. Kansas has not furnished a public sensa tion for some mouths now. Why this ap parent restfulness? What is brewing? It seems queer, doesn't it, that only people outsido of the United States hope to make money by the passage of the "Wilson Bill? Nobody inside the country expresses auy such, hopes. TnE crooks of the country ought to form a trades union to restrain Gov. Aitgeld from pardoning anymore out of the penitentiary. Thtre is not near enough work now for those already engaged in the business, and if many more are released there will ho much suffer ing among the thieves and burglars this Winter, because of a lack of sufficient em ployment for all. There are cheering indications that the good men of all parties in the State of New York are thoroughly aroused to tho neces sity of such renovation of the election sys tem of the State as will secure honest voting and honest counting. President Peixotto ought to go very carefully about enlisting Americans. If he should get a regimeut or so down there and things didn't go exactly to suit them, they might turn in and whip the whole Brazilian Republic. 1 Russia is making her competition with us felt iu more ways than in the grain and moat markets. Iler cheaper kerosene has driven the Standard Oil Company out of the eastern Mediterranean ports and taken away nearly one-half of its immense trade in Japau, Chno, Hindustan, and Java. The public is awakening to a rapturous I appreciation of the merits of ex-Minister Stevens. We expect every day to hear some one nominate him for President of the United States. We go so far as to say that he has got the making in him of a first-class Secretary of State. The motto of the Pension Bureau should be, " Lei no. guilty man escape, but above all, let no deserving, man aufier." THE

The flmeMean f af mef. - The Oldest Agricultural Paper in America. Published at 1729 New York Avenue, Washington, D. C. Price, only 60 Cent3 a Year. TnE Asieeican FAK3rER is a great Na tional agricultural paper. It circulates in overy part of the country, and represents the interests of all the fanners in tho Nation. Being located at the seat of Government and the only agricultural paper that is it has special facilities for yetting informa tion of real interest to all farmers of all that goes on affecting them in Congress, or in any of the Departments of the Government. This will be of particular importance to all farmers this Winter, when there will be a prolonged and bitter struggle in Congress over the po icy of protecting farm product. The American Farmer is on the .side of the farmers, and bitterly hostile to the an nounced program ot placing wool on the free Iit, and reducing the duties on other agricultural product-. It denounces this as making tho finners bear the greatest part of the weight of the alleged tariff reform, and protesiH ng.tinst this sacrifice of the larmera in favor of other interest". Every one who favors jnatice and right to farmers and not political buicombe, should rally to its support and give it the utmost strength by doing what they can to extend its circula tion. Now is the time to do this, before Con gress takes up the wool and farniiug products schedule. The paper is a large eight-page quarto, priuted in large type, on fine white paper, and plentifully illustrated. It Ls filled with mat er of great practical interest to all farmers. The National Trirune will he sent with Tlic American Farmer for one year for $1.25. PreseiitsubscriliTH to TttE National Trirune can have The American Farmer for one year by sending 25 cents additional. A Sl'LKXDID TOLUME.

At this buttle, while tho infantry was fiercely engaged with the troops under command of Gen. Banks, the artillery fire from the batteries iu the rear became very destructive to tbo Union troops. Capt. Anderson, of the 12th U. S., called for a volunteer to go back nnd order the artillery to cease firing. Comrade Younger took tho message safely, but on his return he was severely wounded. Tho medal is a very hnudsomo one. On one side Is u figure of Colum bia; on tbo other side Is engraved "The Congress to John L. Younger, late private of Company A, 2d Battalion, 12th U. S.
