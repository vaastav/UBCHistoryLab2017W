The outbreak of domestic hostilities in the republic of Brazil fouit I the United States alert to watch tho interests of our citizens in thut country, with which wo carry important commerce, bevc.rul vessels of time and of d have been, stationed at Rio d The struggle being between the established government, which controls tiie machinery of administration, and with which maintain friendly relations, and certain officers of the navy, employing the vessels of their command in an attuck upon the national capital and chief seaport, and lacking, as it does, the elements of divided administration, I have failed the insurgents cau reasonably claim rbcog uitiou as belligerents. Emphasizing fixed policy of impurtiul neutrality in such u condition of affairs us now exists, 1 deemed it necessur ' to disavow, in a manner not to be misunderstood, tiie authorized action of our late naval mder iu those waters iu sulutiug tiie revolted Brazilian admiral. Tiie legislation of lust year, known us the Geury luw, requiring the registration of all Chinese laborers entitled to residence in tiie United States, and tbo deportation complying with the provisions of the act within the time prescribed, met witii much opposition from Chinamen in this country. Acting upon the udvice of eminent counsel thut the luw Htitutnmul. the great laborers, pending judicial inquiry us to its vulidity, in good faith declined to apply for the certificates required by its pro visions. It is believed • that under tiie revent amendment of tho act, extending the time tor registration, the Chinese laborers, thereto entitled, who desire to reside iu this country will avuil themselves Of the renewed privilege. Our relations with the continue sincerely hope thut the extradition treaty with that country, us amended by the Senate. will soon be operative. While occasional questions affecting naturalized citizens returning to tiie lund of their birth, have arisen intercourse with Germany, our relations with that country continue satisfactory. Tho questions affecting with Greut Britain have been treated iu u spirit of friendliness. Negotiations are in progress between the two governments with a view to such concurrent action as will make the uward and regulations ugreed upon by tiie Behring Sea tribunal of urbi effootive; und it is not Brituin will co-operute the of ties of is A 75 ie thut uncon s of Chinese French republic he intimate und cordial. I : trution pariiculuriy doubted thut Greut freely with this country for the iTccom plislimeut of that purpose. The dispute growing out of the discrimi nating tolls imposed in the Wellumi canal upon cargoes of cereuls bound to aud from the luke ports of the United Status, was adjusted by the substitution of u equitable schedulo of charges and my n predecessor thereupon suspended his proclumution imposing discriminating tolls upon British transit through cunals. A request for additions to the list of extradituble offences covered by the istiug treaty between the two countries is der consideration. Our relations with Mexico continue to be of thut close und friendly nuture which should always characterize tho intercourse of two neighboring republics. Led by u desire to compose differences and contribute to the restoration of order in äutnou, the United 8tutes, departing from its policy, entered four years ago i the treaty of Berlin, thereby becoming jointly bound with England andGeriuuny to establish und maintain Muhetouiluupepa as King of 8unioa.

Just pri of the p null J" 1 dimensions the installation :i udiu iu ist ration the existing governmental Hawaii had been suddenly overthrown and a treaty of annexation had been negotiated between the provisional overnment of the islands and the United tates and submitted to the Senate for rati fication. This treaty withdrew for exumi nstion and dispatched Hon.

With »mplisli ing this result, within tho institutional limits of executive power d recognizing all our obligations und responsibility growing out of any changed conditions brought ubout by justifiable interference, our present min ister ut Honolulu has received appropriate instructions to that end. Thus far no in formation of the accomplishment of any definite results has been received from him.

Since the passage of the act of March 3d, 1893, authorizing the President to raise tho grade of our envoys to correspond with tin: rank in which foreign countries ac credit their agents here, Great Britain. France. Italy und Germany have conferred upon their representatives at this capital the title of ambussudor und 1 have re sponded by accrediting the agents of the United titates in those countries witii the e title. A like elevation of mission is ou need by Russia aud when be similarly met. This step fittingly coin with tho position the United .States holds in tiie family of nations. Upon the proof thut the legislation of Denmark pyright to Aweriafh citizens ! nul footing with its copyright laws have been by proclamation to subjects of thut country, lu his rofere to a de will 'U, the privileges exten led to the report of the «Secretary of tho Treasury the Presi dent soys : The recent repeal of the pro vision of the law requiring the purchusn of silver bullion by the gover monetary scheme lias the complexion of i don't doubt that •ill be a of of !•• feature of entire change ii currency affairs. the ultimute result of this action salutary und far rcuclnng. In the nuture of things, however, it is impossible to know at this ti know precisely what conditions will be brought about by tho change, or what, if any, supplementary legislation may, in the iiglii of such con ditions, appeui' to be essential or expedient. Of course, after the recent financial per turbation. time is necessary for the re establishment of business confidence. When, however, through this .restored confidence tho money which lias be frightened into hoarding places is returned to trade mid enterprise, a survey of the situation \wll probably disclose a safe path leuding to a permanently sound currency, abundantly sufficient to meet every re quirement of our increasing population und business. In the pursuit of tins object tay from should resolutely alluring und temporary expedients, de termined to be content witii nothing less than u lasting and plun. In these circumstunces, 1 viuccd that a reasonable delay in dealing with this subject, instead of being injuri . will increase the probability of wise of preheusive financial action. The admonitions of the lust two years touching our public heultli and the demon strated (langur of tho introduction of tugions diseuse from foreign ports has in vested the subject of national quarantine witii increased interest. A more general and harmonious system than now exists, acting promptly und directly everywhere, (l constantly operating by preventive means to shield our country from the in on of disease, and ut the sumo time having due regard to the rights and duties of local agencies, would. I believe, add tiie safety of our people. greatly The Secretary of War reports that the strength of the army on tiie 30th day of September last was 25,778 enlisted men und 2.144 officers. Neither Indian outbreaks domestic violence had called the army into service during the year und the only active military duty required of it hus been in the department oi Texas, where violations of tins neutrality laws of the United States und Mexico were promptly and efficiently deult with by tho troops, eliciting the w approval of the civil unci military authori ties of both countries. Tiie operation of laws and the influences of civiliza tion constantly tending to relieve tho country from the dangers of Indian hos tilities,* together with the increasing ability of the States, through the efficiency of the National Guard organization to pro tect their citizens from domestic violence, lead to the suggestion that the time is fast approaching whou there there should be a reorganization of our army on the lines of the present necessities of the country. It is gratifying to note thut we have begun to attain completed results in the heusive scheme of seu coast defence imd fortification entered upon eigiit years ago. A lurge sum hus been already expended, but the cost of uiuiutenuuce will be incon siderable us com pared with the ex ne with the construction and orduuncu. At end of the current calendar yei department will have nine 12-mc 10-inch, and 34 8-iuch guns, mounted on gun lifts and carriages. 75 12-inch mortars. The work of locating and . Gettysburg battle field is making satisfuc tlie plans directed by the tho the 3, 2U »icly the lines of battle ut the ggy The reports of the military academy at West Point, aud the several schools for spcciul instruction of officers, show marked advance in the education of the army l a*commendable ambition among its officers to excel iu the military profession and to tit themselves for the highest to the country. The report of the Attorney-General tains the usual summary of the affairs and proceedings of the department of justice tor tho past year, together with certain recommendations as to needed legislation various subjects. 1 cannot too heartily endorse the proposition that the fee system as upplicubleto the compensation of United States attorney, marshals, clerks of Federul courts and United States commissioners should be abolished with as little delay possible. It is clearly in the interest of the community that the business of tbe courts, both civil and criminal, shall be as small and as inexpensively transacted us the ends of justice will allow. The system is therefore thoroughly vicious which makes tbe compensation of court officials depend upon the volume of such business and thus creates a conflict between a proper execu tion of the law and private gain, which cannot fuil to be dangerous to the rights and freedom of tho citizen and un.irreslsti ble temptation to the uujustiliablcexpendi ture of public funds. If iu addition to this reform another was inaugurated which would give to United States commissioners the final disposition of petty offences with in the grude of misdemeanors, especially those coming under tho internal revenue laws, a great advance would be made toward a »rogress ongress. is it in to decent administration of the criminal luw. It is, therefore, parent that the reasons given in 1885 for a change in the manner of enforcing the Federal criminal law huve gained cogency and strength by lapse of time. The report of the I'ostnmster-general tains a detailed statement of the operatic of the ixistofiice department during tho last fiscal year and much interesting in formation touching this important brunch of the public service. The business of the mails indicates withabsolutecertuiuty, ditionsol' the business of the country and depression in financial affairs inevitably U quickly reduces the postal revenues. Therefore, *u larger discrepancy than usual between the postollice receipts und peuditures, is the expected und unavoid able result of the distressing stringency which has prevailed throughout tho country during much of time covered by the I'ostma-ter-general's report. At a date when better times were anticipated it was estimated by his predecessors thut the deliciur.cv on the 3oih day of June, 1893, would be* a little over u million and a half dollars. It amounted however, to more than five millions. had uil of that 11 The report of the Secretary of the Navy exhibits a most gratifying condition of the personnel of our navy. During the past six months the dcmmuls for cruising sels have been many uud urgent. There have been revcduiious calling for vessels to protect American interests in Nicaragua, Guutemula, Costa Rica, Honduras, Argentina uud Brazil, while the condition of affairs of uud the the that iu Honolulu has required the constant presence of one or more ships. Progress in the construction of new vessels has not beeu as rapid as was anticipated. There have beeu delays in tho completion of armed vessels, out for the most part they have been such as are constantly occurring its as to countries having the largest expe rience in naval shipbuilding. The most is of delays, howovor, have been in ork upon armed ship*. The trouble has been the failure of contractors to de liver armor as agreed. The difliculties . however, to have been all As a result of the experience ac quired by ship builders and designers and material men, it is believed that the (lutes when vessels will be completed be estimated with G reut guns, rapid fire guns, torpedoes and powder are being promptly supplied, while _ ami distinctly in favor of consistently pursuing the policy wo have inaugurated of building up a thorough mid etlicient navy. 1 cannot refrain from the tiou that the Congress should take into account tho number of unfin ished vessels on our hands, and the de pleted condition of our treasury in consid ering tbo propriety of an appropriation at this time to begi The report of tho Secretary of the In terior is or special value and interest. On the 30th dav of June, 1893. there w the pension rolls 906,092 names, an in crease of 89,944 over the number on tho rolls June 30th, 1892. The discovery hav ing been made that many names had been put on the pension roll by means of wholesale and gigantic fruuds The —~ suspended payment up number of pensions which seemed to bq fraudulent or unauthorized, pending a complete examination, giving notice to the pensioners in order that they might have an opportunity to establish, if possi ble. the justice of their claims, notwith standing apparent invalidity. I am unubie to understand why frauds in the pension rolls should not be exposed and corrected with thoroughness and vigor. Every name fraudulently put upon those rolls is a wicked imposition upon the kindly senti in which pensions have their origin; has become a the nable accuracy. ! » work, It tho on Dr. at ami hns the bo the the of to every fraudulent pens! bad citizen; every false oath in support of a pension has made perjury and false and undeserving pensioners rob the people, not only of their money, but of the patriotic sentiment which the sur vivors of a war, fought for the preserva tion of the Union, ought to inspire thous ands of neighborhoods to have their well known fraudulent pensioners exposed. Recent developments by the bureau establish appalling conspiracies to accom plish pousion fruuds. By no means the least wrong done is to brave and deserving pensioners, who certainly ought not to be condemned to such association Those who attempt, in tho line of duty, to rectify these wrongs, should not be accused of enmity or indifference to the claims of the honest veteran. The condition of the Indians and their ultimate fate are subjects which luted to a sacred duty of the government, aud which strongly uppeul to tho sense of justice and the sympathy of our people. Our Indians number about 248,000. Mi located comm' his 161 reservations, of lund. About of the containing 86,110,531 110,000 of these Indians have, to a largo degree, adopted civilized customs. Lands in several territories have been allotted to many of them. 1 educated and moral and religious touching ortaut factors iu any effort to to civiliza tion. I believe too, that the relinquish uicut of tribul relations, aud the holding of land in several territories able conditions, uid this consummation. The solution of tho Indian problem de good administra tif agents und that secular. must be i InSi und lead hi in favor pends very largely up tion. The personal ii their adaptability to the peculiarity of car ing for their wards, is of the utmost im portance. Tiie law providing that except in spcciul cases, army officers shall be de tailed us Indian agents, it is hoped, will prove a successful experiment. I especially commend to the attention of the Congress the statements contained iu the Secretary's report concerning forestry. Thetimo bus come when efficient measure should be taken for the preservation of forests from indiscriminate and remediless destruction. The report hf tiie Secretary of Agriculture will be foU'i I e : ceedingly interesting especially to that mrt of our citizens intimately con in agricultural occupât Tho continued intelligent • the Civil Service law and tho increasing upprovul by the people of its operation most gratifying. Tiie recent extension of its limitations and regulations to tiie employes at free delivery pustoffices, which bus been honestly and promptly accom plished by the commission with tiie hearty co-operation of the Postmaster-General, is immensely important udvunce in the usefulness of the system. I more than ever convinced of the Incalcu lable benefits conferred by the Civil Service luw. not only iu its.effect upon the public service, but also, wliut is even more im portant in its effect in elevating the tone of political life generally. Tiie course of Civil Service Reform iu this country,instructively and interestingly illustrates how strong u hold a movement gains upon our people which has under lying it u sentiment of justice and right und which at tho same time promises better administration of the government. to be entirely inconsistent well oblige the for clerical assistance from other depart at lurge pa cerned i Of .if It scents to with the character of this reform as with its best enforcement, to rely 1 detailed commission upon clerks monts. 1 earnestly urge that the clerks necessary to carry on the work of the commission be regularly put upon its roster and that the system of obliging the commissioners to rely upon the services of clerks belonging to other departments« be discontinued. Economy iu public expendi ture is u duty that cannot innocently be neglected by those intrusted with the con trol of money drawn from the people for public uses. After a hard struggle tariff reform is directly before us. Nothing so important claims our uttoutiou and nothingso clearly presents itself as both an opportunity ana u duty, an opportunity to deserve the ratitude of our fellow citizens and a uty imposed upon us by our oft-repeated professions and by the emphatic muudute of the people. After full discussion our country have spoken in favor of this reform, and they have confided tho work of its accom plishment to the hands of those who solemnly pledged to it. Nothing should intervene to distract turb plisbed bv wi While * the principle that rovenuo justifies the imposition of tariff duties and other Federul taxation, and that they should be limited by strict cannot close our eves to the attention effort until this reform is nccom i cureful legislation, should staunchly adhere to ly the necessity of economy, fact thut conditions have grown up among , diich in justice and fairness call for iu the distribution of the enter government actually de discriminating such duties aud taxation geucies of inund. Manifestly, if we are to aid tho people direct!v through tariff reform, one of its obvious features should be a reduc in present turiff charges upon tiie necessities of life. Not less closely related to prosperity and well being is the removal of étions upon the importation of the materials necessary to our manufac people's Hirers. Tho world should he open to tionul ingenuity and enterprise. This he while Federal legislation, through the imposition of high turiff, forbids to American manufacturers as cheap material sed by their competitors. It is quite obvious that the enhancement of the f irice of our manufactured produce result* ug from this policy not only coniines the market lor these produit« within borders to the direct udvamage of manufacturers, but also increases their cost to as thus citizens. The interests of labor though indirectly, involved in this feature tariff system. The sharp competi o among our manu* •ply the limited demand for fill the narrow mamet to confined. Then foil suspension of ..work in mills und factories, a discharge of.employes and distress iu the homes of our workingmen. if the often disproved assertion could be made good, that u lower wages would result from free tenuis and low tariff duties, the intelli gence of certainly, tion and uctive stru facturers to their goods, which they workingmen leads them quickly to discover that their steady ployment, permitted by free raw material, is the most important factor in their rela tion to turiff legislation. A measure has been prepared by tbo appropriate congressional committee, em bodying tariff reform ou the lines herein suggested, which will bo promptly sub mitted for leaislutive action. It is the result of much patriotic and unselfish work, and I believe it deals with its subject consistently und us thoroughly as existin'.: conditions permit. iiitislied thut the reduced tariff duties provided for in the proposed 1 legis lation. added to existing international enuo taxation, will, in the near future, though perhaps not immediately, produce sufficient revenue to meet the needs of the government. In conclusion, my intense feeling of responsibility impels me to invoke for the manifold interests of a generous and tiding people tho most scrupulous care und to pledge my willing support to every legislative effort for the advancement of greatness and prosperity loved country.

His text was Matthew xxv, 40: "Inasmuch as yc have done it unto one of tho least of these, my brethren, yo have done it unto Me." lie said in part : There is a great deal of common sense and practicability about Christianity. Tho whys and wherefores as to the causes of so much poverty und suffering in the world matters over which wo need not split straws. That they exist to au alarming extout is self evident. The Bible tells us, and It is corroborated by reason and common sense, that sin is "the primary cause of all sorrow; that «ally pure and holy and But by disobedicnco he fell,and entailed sin upon the race. One thing wo do "know, that where men and women live up to their full knowledge, doing the best they can by industry and diligence, by economy and frugality, sin and suf fering are mitigated and lessened. But tho poor and needy are still with us, they have been through tho ages, and, Christians, we Hud an opportunity of doing a great work among them. It has been well said that the only religion for a hungry man is bread; tho ligion for tho naked is clothing. God, tho All-wiso Father, has made those who are blessed with plenty the stewards of tin suffering poor. Just think of it friends! By helping tho poor we honor Christ! "Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of the least of theso, my brethren, ye did it unto me." If Christ wore on the earth now, in human llesh, how we would delight to know Him! And yet we may Him by helping the poor and needy, by giving, as Ho hath prospered us, to those around us who are perishing for bread and clothing. And He accepts such acts of charity as though done unto Himself. May wo not help to feed the hungry, clothe the naked, secure work for those out of work, and do good in intensely practical way to all wc have opportunity? God docs not ask nor require what we cannot do. Ho does ask and require each of us to do all that wo can. We if we caunot do something! Can wo not give a cup of water, a kind word, and speak words of encouragement .to thoso about us who are despondent and down cast? Can we not bid them look up, and not down? Cau wo not lead them by acts of charity and love to the living Christ, the One who is touched by our infirmities, tho Great Sympathizer, the Great Physician who can heal all our diseases, both of soul and body! Who tender as He? Who can heal the broken heart but Christ? IIis exceeding great and precious promises and not, as favored few. The reason everybody don't love Christ is because they don't know Him. If all the world my Saviour knew, would love Him 3 the that tion a in city fr< origi ilhout sin. to A of ly re of destitute indeed. for ail, to think for u Thou alt tho Our theology bee times, that Ö 1 Yes, in a thousand w loved us that He die for us." "Greater love hath thau this, that a man lay down His life for his friends." "Though He was rich, sakés He became poor that we, through His poverty, might be made rich." What is Christianity ? It is to be like Christ. Like Him iu our love, in sympathy, in sacrifice, in in our faith, wherever He went. Ho came to give life, not to destroy it. Hence He healed the sick, opeued the eyes of the blind and spread true joy among men every where He went. God help us to imitate our Master, and open blessed truth. To be a Christian menus something.

ITS MANY WEAK POINTS EXPOSED He Has No Defence if This is His Best Defence. IIIh Biography 1 no Light on ue—How He Avoids icksUpa Ills Oust. An Extract Fr 111 row arable l)e!iv< Peril nent Facts a His ■ Ki Now York Evening Post. DecomborSd. In Lanman's "Biographical Annals" find the following entry : "Stevens. John licavitt, * * * studied theology, and at the age of 21 was ordained a minister of the Um versalist church; * * * then became associated with James G. Blaine hi the ownership aud management' of the Tint liebet' Journal ." These biographical items go far towards explaining the extra ordinary document with which the minister to Hawaii broke in upon the Thanksgiving repose of the American people. Its vigor of pious blackguard and its intimate acquaintance with the nameless and abhorrent sins of inconvenient witnesses who the author's crookedness, understood with that early record before the eye, while its furious parading of irrelevant mutter and its ab normal acuteness in detecting tho corrupt schemes of England are the legitimate fruit of association with James G. Blaine. Mr. Stevens' defence, in fuel, is best de scribed as an after-glow of tbo Blaine school of politics. Confronted with a lestai do up by a trained lawyer, he a tremendous dust over points aianche of E , lets loose scurrilous epithets with Christian adjec tives attached, shouts loudly that England, Japan, is back of the attacks upon his veracity, and sedulously avoids mention ot the evidence, much of is documentary and signed by his own name, which convicts him of being a conspirator and a falsifier. Blaine himself could not have done it better. The real strength of the Stev the light of his defence. The evidence of witnesses whose character he does not undertake to impeach, and of documents whose existence he ignores, sufficient him. Granting the truth of every word he suys, the facts and* evidence to which he does not make the faintest allusion enough to convict him. The testimony of Mr. Wunderberg, a member of the mittee of safety, is not referred to by Mr. . Uucontrudicted, it proves that league with the revolutionists beforehand, uad promised the troops in their uid and us the Huwuiian government the moment they read a proclamation at the government building "or any other build ing ut Honolulu." The testimony of Mr. Damon, »resident of tho advisory council of the provisional government, Mr. Stevens nowhere touches upon. Uncontradicted, it proves that Stevens recognized "about 18 in all," sneaking through the streets to avoid arrest by tho police, as the de facto government of - the country, though they were not in possession of a single government building. We should have been glad of less information about the gambling and licentious habits of wit nesses whose testimony is not material, and more about these witnesses. But Mr. Stevens seems to thiuk thut by refusing "recognize" them they will be blotted c of existence. Then there is the documentary evidence which the ex-minister forgets to mention. There is the written appeal to him of the committee ot safety, asking him to laud troops on the distinct grouud that "we uuublc to protect ourselves without aid." There was the formul protest of the Queen's government the same day ugainst landing the troops, with the assurance that the police and military forces ample to preserve order and to protect American property. There was also the protest of the Governor of the island, A. 8. Cleghurn. It is true Stevens does dis pose of him by showing thut lie was only an "honorary" Governor at best, and, what is pretty damaging, "a brother-in* the füllen Liliuokalani," and, what is absolutely fatal, "the reputed father of residing in murried to After such ■ against when read in Tear alone austuin the charges against Stev them to land recognize to ont the so-called Princess England, wöoso hulf-sister i the English minister's son." hilutiug stroke it seems hard to go back to the law of the cose, and ask. as both the local and the general government had to Und troops. It really is not u complete answer to say thut somebody's half-sister is married to the English minister's sou, but wc suspect it is the only answer we shall ever get from Stev One other of the vital points Stevens fumbles over, which shows that he is aware of the pickle the documents leave him in. In his dispatch to Secretary Foster lie said that he did not recognize the pro visional government until alter it was "possession of the government buildings, archives and treasury." This was given the lie by Mr. Damon, and is also in direct extant letter from did, what right Stev contradiction with President Dole, thanking him for his "recognition," und requesting "the imme diate support of tlse United States forces" enable tho new government to get »osaession of what Stevens deceitfully told already in possession of. thut the Queen's forces "must have surrendered in a few hours." anyhow, us they were "surrounded" présume by tnoso "18 men in all." This is a clear admission thut lie lied to Secre tary Foster, as he did agaiu, by implica tion, when he said that the other foreign ministers "promptly recognized" the pro visional government, the fact being that of them did so till the next day. The merits of the controversy clearly before the public. Un the hand is the carefully prepared legal case of Mr. Blount with its array of authenti cated testimony ami documentary evi dence. On the other is tho Kennebec Journal harangue of Mr. .Stevens, filled with per sonal assaults and irrelcvancies, but sedu lously avoiding tbe crucial uudcumulative evidence against him. If that is bis best defence, hu hus no defence. F .Stevens -Walter Wedding. Harry T.
