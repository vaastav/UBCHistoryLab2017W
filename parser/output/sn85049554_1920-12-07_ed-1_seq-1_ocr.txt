SAYS NATION MUST LEAD DEMOCRACIES budget System,' Independence of Philippine Island*, Revision of Tax Laws Embodied in Recommends* tions—-President Terms Message Declaration of Faith Rather Than Advocacy of Legislation. By Associated Press. Washington,Dec. 7. -r President ^Wilson sent his message to congress today. Because of this being his itnal message. much Interest at tached to the document, and its read ing was listened to with close atten tion in both houses. The president made no reference to the league of nations, or the peace treaty, and confiixed hl^ recommendations to questions which, have been before the public and some of which have been endorsed! in party- platforms. 1 The text of the message follows: Vf ,D Quotes Lincoln. "When I addressed myself tp per forming the duty laid upon the presi dent by the constitution tt present to you an annual report mi the state Ot t)\c union found thought dominated by an immortal sentence of Abraham Lincoln's: Let ns have faith that right makes might, id .n that faith let us dare to do our duty eft we understand it'—a sentence im* oncrtal because it ombodlos in a iorm utter almEl'City i:nd purity the ee sentiaT faith of the nation, the faith ift which it was conceived and the faith In which it has grown to glory apd poorer. "With tliatjalth and the birth of a. nation Itout^ded kpon it came th«» '•Hope into a ne* prdot 'Vwuld flfcevajil o?_ mankind, an order in which reasoti and right would take precedence of covetousness and force, and 1 be lieve that 1 express the wish and, purpose of every thoughtful Ameri can when I Say that this sentence marks for us in the plainest manner the part we should play alike in the arrangement of our domestic affairs ind in our exercise of hjfluence upon the* affairs of *:e world. By this faith, and by this faith alone, can the world be lifted out ot its present conCu fiun and dispair." *'Tv, Faith Won the War. "It was this faith which prevailed over" the wicked force of Germany. You will remember that the begin ning of the end of the war came when the German people found themselves face to face with the conscience of the world, and realized that right was everywhere arrayed against the wrong that their government was at tempting to perpetrate. I think, therefore, that it is true to say that ..this was the faith whioh won the war. Certainly this is the faith with which our gallant men went into the field and out upon the seas to make sure of victory. This is the mission Ufcon which democracy came, into the world. Democracy is an asser tion of tbe'riJfHt of the individual to live and to. ,be treated justly as against any "attempt on the part of any. combination of Individuals to make laws which will overburden him or whlqh will destroy his equal ity among his fellows in the matter of., right or privilege, and I think we all realize that the day has' cuino when democracy is being put upon its linal test. The old world ie just now surfing from a wanton rejec tion of trte principles of democracy and a substitution the principle of autocracy,0 as asserted in the name, but without the authority and sanction of tie mu titude. This is the time of all oUicrs when democracy should prove Its purity and its spirit ual power, to prevail, it is surely the manifest destiny of the United States to |ead in the attempt to make his spirit prevail. Win by Example. "There are two ways in which the United States, can assist to accom plish this great object: First, by offering the example within her own borders of the will and pow$r of democraoy to make and enforce laws which are unquestion ably just and which are equal in their administration—laws which se cure its full right to labor and yet at the same time safeguard the in tegrity of property, and particularly ,of that property which is devoted to the development of industry and the increase of the necessary wealth of the world. "Second, by stand for right and justice as toward Individual nations. The law of democracy is for the pro tection of the weak, and the influence of every demrocacy in the world should be for the protection of the weak nations, the nation which is struggling toward its right and to ward its proper reoognition and priv ilege in the family of stations. "The United States can not refuse this role of champion without putting the stigma of rejection upon the great and devoted men who brought its government into existence and established it in the face of almost universal opposition and intrigue, even in the face of wanton force, as, for example, against the orders in council of Great Britain and the ar britrary Napoleonic decrees which Involved us in what we know as the war of 1.812. *1 urp« you rto consider thai th» High Lights in Final Message of President Wilson By Associated Press. Washington, Dec. 7.—President WiLs&n's concrete recomendation to congress in his message today were Revision of the tax laws with simplification of the income and profits taxes: Independence for the Phillipines. A loan to Armenia. Eiconomy in government appropria tion:! and expenditures and creation of a "workable budget system. Cold storage and other laws affect ing the cost of living, and federal li cencing of corporations as recom mended in previous messages. RishubiHtatlon and training of dis abled soldiers and eallors.' The president did, hot endorse a bon as. J. Nowhere dM the president refer to the league of nations or the peace treaty fight except, perhaps, by In ference in his 6pening, when ho quoted Abraham Lincoln's let us have faith that right makes might and In that faith let us dare to do our duty as we understand it." Tllie president's message was trans mitted by messenger, the president adhering to his decision not to ad dress congress in person. Tlje president's messsage was not ready immediately in the senate, which waited until it had disposed of routine business. Secretary Tumuky was among th-i spectators in the sen ate, occupying a seat on the floor. Public galleries again were filled and several diplomats were present. display of an immediate disposition on the part- of congress to remedy any injustices or evils that may have shown themselves in our .own nation al life will, afford the most effect ual offset to the forces o.' chaos and tyrs.nny which are playing so disas trous a part in the fortunes of the free peopled of more than one part of he worl(d. The United States is of necessity the sample democracy of the world and the triumph of democracy depends upon its success. Advocates Budget System. "Recovery from the disturbing: and sometimes disastrous effects of the late war has been exceedingly slow on the other side of the water and has given promise, I venture to say. Of early completion only in our own fortunate country but even with us the recovery halts and is impeded at tim^s and there are immediately ser viceable acts of legislation which, it seems to me, we ought to attempt assiiit that'recovery and' prove the indeptrpctible recipera*ive.foBce ofvu great government the.,peo£lf *«r&c of-these is to prove that a'grwl: democracy carf. k^fephojise asfrtfc ce.«»,. fully and ift as businesslike^''fashion as fmy other government."It seems to me that the first steji toward prov ing this is to supply ourselves with a systematic method of handling our estimates and expenditures and bringing them to the point where they will not be an unnecessary sire in upon our income or necessitate unreasonable taxation, in other words, ttf workable budget system, and I respectfully Sfuggestf that two ele ments are essential to such a system, namely, not only that the proposal of appropriations' should be in the hands of a single, body, such as a single appropriations committee in eaclt house oi the congress, but also that this body should be brought into such co-operation with the depart ments of the government and with the treasury of the United States as would enable to act upon a com plete conspectus of the needs of the government' and the resources from •vhiih it must craw itft incomo." "J reluctantly vetoed the budget ^ill passed "by the tfast session of thr congress bocaufee of a constitutional objection. The house of representa tives subsequently modified the bill in order to meet this objection. In the revised form I believe that the bill, coupled with action. already taken by the congress to revise its rules and procedure, furnishes. the foundations for an effective national budget sys tem. I earnestly hope,' therefore, that one of the first steps taken by the •iresent session of congress will be to pass the budget bill. State of Finances. "The nations finances have shown marked improvement during the past yea x\ The total1 ordinary receipts ot $6,694,000,000 for the fiscal year 1920 exceeded those for 1919 by $1,5^2,000, 000, while the total net ordinary ex penditures decreased from $18,514, 000,000 to $6,403,000,(100. The gross public debt, which reached its high est point on Aug. 31, 1919, when it was $26,596,000,000, had dropped on Nov. 30, 1920, to $24,175,000,000. "There also has been a marked de crease in holdings of government war securities by the 'banking institutions of the country as well as in the amount of bills held by the federal reserve banks secured by government war obligations. This fortunate re sult has relieved the banks and left them freer to finance the needs of agriculture, industry and commerce. It has been due in large part to the reduotion of the public debt, es pecially of the floating debt, but more particularly to the improved distribu tion of government securities among permanent investors. The cessation of the government's borrowing except th ru short term certificates of indebt edness has been a matter of great consequence to the people of the 'country at large as well as to the holders of liberty bonds and victory nGtes, and has had an important bearing on the matter of effective credit control. This year has been characterized by the progressive withdrawal of the treasury from the domestic credit market and from a position of dominant influence in that market. The futpre course will necessarily depend up6n the extent to which economics are practiced and upon the burdens placed upon the traasury as well as upon industrial development and the maintenance of tax receipts at a sufficiently high le?el, .War Debt Matures Soon. "rlie fundamental |act which at present dominates ttn foverngaent's financial situation Is that $7,500,000,000 of its war indebtedness matures with in the noxt two and one-half years. Of this amount $2,500,000,000 are float ing debts and $5,000,000,000 floating notes and war savings certificates. The fiscal program of the government must be determined with reference to these maturities. Sound policy de mands that the government expendi tures be reduced to the lowest amount which will permit the rious serv ices to operate efficiently, and that government receipts from taxes and salvage be maintained sufficiently high to provide for current requirements, Including interest and sinking fund charges on the public defbt, and at the samq time retire the floating debt and part of the victory loan before matur ity. AVith rigid economy, vigorous salvage operations and adequate revenues fro taxation, a sur plus of current receipts over current expenditures can be realized and should be applied to the floating debt. All branches of the government should co-operate to see that this program is realized. Economy Urged. "I cannot over-emphasize tho ne cessity of economy in government •appropriations and expenditures, and the avoidance by' the congress of practices which take money from the treasury by indefinite or revolving fund appropriations. The estimates for the present year show that over a billion dollars of expenditures were authorized by the,last congress in ad dition to the amounts shown in the usual compiled statements of appro priations. This strikingly illustrates the importance of, making direct and specific approprii^ions. The relations between the current receipts and cur rent expenditures of the government during the present fiscal year as wel{ as during the last half of the last fiscal.year, have been disturbed by the extraordinary burdens thrown upon the treasury by the transportation act in connection with the return of the railroads to private control. Over $600, 000,000 has already been paid to the railroads under this act—$360,000,000 during the present fiscal year and it is estimated iliat further payments aggregating possibly $680,000,000 must tiiiil be made to the railroads'during the current year. It is obvious that these large paym/Lits have already seriously limited the government's progress in retiring the floating debt Tax Laws Need Revision. Closely connected with this, it seems to uie. is the necessity for an immediate consideration of the re vision of our tax laws. Simplification of the income and profits taxes has become an immediate necessity. These taxtes performed an indespens able service during the war. The need for their simplification, however, is very great, in order to save the tax payer inconvenience and expense and iii order to make his liability more certain and definite. Other and more detailed ree*?ii)cnenda4t©fts wjth re», Sard to taxefi will nb doubt be -laid' before you by the secretary of the treasury and tho commisslonier of in ternal revenue. Plea For sabled Soldiers. "It is my privilege to draw the at tention of congress for very sympa thetic consideration of the problem of providing adequate facilities for the care and treatment of former members of the military and naval forces who are sick or disabled as the result of their participation in the war. These heroic men can never be paid in money for the service they patriotically rendered the nation. Their reward will lie rather in reali zation of the fr.ot that they vindi cated the right?, cf their country and aided in safeguarding civilization. The nation's gratitude must be ef fectively revealed to them by the mos^ ample provision for their medi cal care and treatment as well as for their vocational training and replace ment. The time has come when a more complete program can be for mulated and more satisfactorily, ad ministered for their treatment and training, and I earnestly urge that the congress .give the matter its early consideration, The secretary of the treasury and the board for vocational education will outline in their annual reports proposals covering medical care and rehabilitation, which, I am sure, will engage your earnest study and command your most generous support. Reiterates Former Recommendations. "Permit me to emphasize once more the need for action upon cer tain matters upon which I dwelt at length ip my message to the second session of the Sixty-Sixth congress— the necessity, for .example, of en couraging the manufacture of dye stuffs and related chemicals the importance of doing everything pos sible to promote agricultural produc tion along economic lines, to improve agricultural marketing and to make rural life more attractive and health ful, the ineed lor a. la,w regulating cold storage in such a way as to lim it the time during which goods may be kept in storage, prescribing the method of disposing of them if kept beyond the permitted period, and re quiring goods released from storage in all cases to bear the date of their receipt. "It would also be most serviceable if it were provided that all goods re leased from cold storage for inter state shipment should have plainly marked upon each package the sell ing or market price at which they went into storage, in order that the purchaser might be able to learn what profits stood between him and the producer or the wholesale dealer. Indeed, it would be very serviceable to the public If all goods destined for interstate commerce were made to carry upon every packing case, whose form made it possible, a plain state ment of the price at which they left the hands of the producer. Would License Business. "I respectfully call your attention also to the recommendations of the message referred to with regard to a federal license for all corporations engaged in interstate commerce, in brief, the immediate legislative need of the time is the removal of all ob stables to the realization of the best ambitions of our people in their sev eral classes of employment and the strengthening of all Instrumentalities by which difficulties are to be met and removed and justice dealt out, whether by law or by some form of 

MARSHALLTOWN, IOWA, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1920. ASSEMBLY PUTS OFF Delegates Sidestep Many Questions Not Agreed Upon. COVENANT SECTIONS BEYOND SOLUTION Most Enthusiastic Supporters of League Admit League Foundation Has Many Defects—Controversy Concerning Powera of League As sembly and League Council Avoided For the Present. By Associated Press. Geneva, Doc. 7.—Plans for co-6p cration of the league of nations by representatives of Armenia and former Russian states, tho these states were not admitted to full membership in the league, were dis cussed by the assembly of the league here today, fthls .was the principal Item on the agenda, havinjr been brought into prominence by the de cision yesterday of the committee on the admission of new fetates. The assembly also continued the task of laying a working basis for the league which would enable it to function as efficently as possible, pending the time necessary to get a clear interpretation of various mat ters and note the practical effects of the Intricate system by which the as sembly and council dovetail into each other. The most enthusiastic supporters of the league now admit there are problems in the covenant which seem for the moment at least beyond solu tion since it is impossible to tell how present arangements are going to work out. HSie general policy adopted scorns to be to let time work out a solution of some problems. Going Around Trouble. ^sS Decision was reached by the com mittee on relations between the as sembly and council last night^to ap ply this policy to the contested point as to .whether the word "exclusive" should bfc eliminated of the four general principles Enun ciated by the committ£e,a» a: working basis for the league. This sentence reads at present: "The assembly has no power to modify decisions coming within the exclusive competence of the council." The committee decided to recom mend that the whole paragraph be dropped from the report rather than prolong a discussion which might be fruitless. 

HEALTH OF NAVY GOOD. Tho Recruiting Was Heavy Last Year Death Rate Was Low By Associated Press. Washington, Dec. 7.—Despite the influx of recruits, health conditions in the navy during the last year were good, Surgeon General Braisted said in his annual report just made pub lic. Influenza was the only com municable disease which was unduly great, Admiral Braisted said, adding that the number of sick leaves on this account were not overlarge. when taken in consideration with the re placement of the duration-of-the-war enlistments. The death rate of the navy, the re port showed, was 5.90 per 1,000 in the last year while for the year 1918, with the thousands of wartime en listments, the death rate reached 1S&7 per thousand. If pneumonia could have been eliminated,. the re port said, the death rate last year mediation and conciliation. I do not feel it to be my privilege at present to suggest the detailed and particular methods by which these objects may be attained, but I have faith that the inquiries of your several committees will discover the way and the meth od. Wfnts Loan Fcr Armenia. In response to what I believe to be the impulse of sympathy and opinion thruout the United States, I earnestly suggest that the congress authorize the treasury of the United States to make to the struggling gov ernment oi Arm mi .a such a loan as was made to several of the allied gov ernments during the war and I v.ould also* si r.st tiiat it would be desirable to provide in the legislation itself that t' expenditure of the money thus leaned should be under the supervisH-! of a commission, or at least a commissioner, from the United States in order that revolutionary tendencies with Armenia itseif miuht not he afforded by the loan a further tempting opportunity. Independence For Philippines. Allow me to call your attention to the fact that the people of the Philippine islands have succeeded in maintaining a stable government since tho last action of the congress in their behalf, and have thus ful filled the conditions set by the con gress .is precedent to a consideration of granting independence to the is lands. I respectfully submit that this condition precedent having been ful filled, it is now our liberty and our duty to keep our promise to the people of those islands by granting them the independence which they so honorably covet. '1 have not so much laid before you a series of recommendations, gentle men. as sought to utter a confession of faith, of the faith In which I was bred and which it is my solemn pur pose to stand by until my last fight ing day. I believe this to be the faith of America, the faith of the future and of all the victories which await national action in the days to come whether in Anjevica or elsewhere, Nobel Peace Prize To Be Awarded to President Wilson Hy Associated Press. Copenhagen, Doc. 7.—Announce ment is made that the Xobel petuv prize will be conferred on President Wilson, of the United States, on Dec, 10. The .Nobel peace prize carries with it a grant of ubout $40,000, which Is one-flfth of the annual interest on about 19,000,000, left for that pur pose by Alfred B. Nobel, the Swedish scientist and the inventor of dyna mite, who died in 1896. Tho only two Americans who, in the past, received the Nobel peace prize were Theodorn Roosevelt, in 1906, and Elihu Root in 1912. Would have been only 1.84 per thou sand. The naval medical corps like other branches of the service has suffered from the competition with private business and, the surgeon general said, has not been able to counteract "the reaction against military pur suits" in keeping Its rolls filled. The year ended with 762 regular medical and reserve officers, 193 officers hold ing temporary appointments and seventy-nine former pharmacists commmissioned as temporary as sistant surgeons. As the authorized strength is 1,225, the existing vacan cies number 570. The dental corps likewise suffered losses from Its ranks, members of the* corps being unwilling to refuse al luring prospects of greater remuner ation in private life. As a result the corps finished the year with only *two thirds of its authorized strength. A shortage of specialists in the navy has caused the establishment of a special series of studies wfcich the officers are ^enabled to attend. The surgeon' general, however, saw no immediate hope of bringing the staff of specialists to the point he believed the navy required be cause of the constant resignations. He urged, therefore, that action be taken to make professional work of the ser vice more attractive.

TWO MAIL ROBBERS GIVEN LONG TERMS Fred Poffenbarger and Orville Phillips Sentenced to 'Eighteen and Thirteen Years in Leavenworth Prison For Participation in Council Bluffs Mail Thefts. By Associated Press. Des Moines, Dec. 7.—Fred Poffen barger and Orville Phillips, of Coun cil Bluffs, two of the participants in the big mail robbery there recently, were sentenced to eighteen and thir teen years in prison at Leavenworth late yesterday by Judge Martin J. Wade, of the United States district court. They pleaded guilty. Proffenbarger and Phillips were in dicted by the federal grand jury charged with being the men who act ually took the nine registered mail pouches from the car. United States District Attorney Moon told the court "these boys, the evidence indicates, were the prime movers in planning the robbery. They are the parties who actually took the mail sacks out of the car. Five of the bags wore dumped into a car driven by Keith Collins and the other fcur bags were taken by Poffenbarg er to his father's home. Poffenbarger subsequently met Collins and they divided $50,000 in cash." Counsel for the two boys said he did not believe the lads realized what they were doing. Inauguration of Actual Legislative Program Planned. MEAT PACKER BILL TO COME UP SOON Kenyon Bill on Calendar For Early Debate and Vote May Be Reaohsd Jan. 8.—Exp«ct« to Take Up Legis lation For Restriction of Immigra tion— Message Read in Both Houses at Noon. By Associated Press. Washington. Dec. 7^—Receipt of President Wilson's annual message wan the principal business before congress today, altho the program in both the senate and house called for the Inauguration of actual legislative work. The senate calendar today called for debate on I the bill for federal regulation of the meat paoklng in due try, left over from the last ses sion, but there was a possibility, it wan said, that it might go over until some future date. Senator Ken yon, reptfblioan, of Iowa, one of the fram ers of the bill, in reply to a Question from Senator Sherman, republican, of Illinois, for a postponement, said he would agree to the delay provided unanimous consent could be obtained for & vote on the measure by Jan. 8. In the house legislation for ,the re striction of Immigration was expec ted tp be taken up. Tariff and Taxes linked. Inasmuch as President-Elect Hard ing today told some of the house re publicans that he hoped hearings on tari ff legislation would be held during the ,winter, it Is probable that the program of Representative Fordney, Michigan, chairman* to begin hearings in January will be approved. II: is Mr. Fordney's Idea that the tariff hearings should begin on Wed nesday, Jaru 6. That consideration of tariff and taxes will iro hand in hand was the Inference drawn from a statement by Mr. Harding that he would recom mend to the incoming congress a re vision of tax mws Mr Harding, while not wishing to announce adefl nito date for a special session of the new congress, made it plain that one would be called almost immediately after his inauguration March 4. Mr. Fordney believes but few hear ings will be necessary on tax legisla tion. It is his notion that the ways and means committee, In executive session, with the aid of tax experts, car. quipkly whip a tax bill Into shape after the main points of policy hav.e been decided upon. Because the in augural nieusage may contain definite recommendations on disputed points, republican/ leaders believe It may bfc just as well to defer any tax hearings until after the new administration cames in. It is certain there will be no at tempt to enact tax and tariff meas ures at the short session of congress, which ends March 4. Mr. Harding urged that such legislation as bills for appropriations and the budget bill be pushed in the short session to clear the decks for the tax and tariff revision at the special session. The congressional investigation of the "increasing unemployment," to determine what action If any to re lieve the situation can be taken by the federal government, was pro posed in a Joint resolution Introduced in the house today by Representative Mason, republican, of Illinois. 

INSURANCE FOR JOBLESS. Al Workers of Great Britain Aided During Unemployment. By Associated Press. liondon, Dec. 7.—Bight millions of British workers become automatical ly insured against unemployment under the unemployment insurance act of 1920, which has just come into operation. This new act extends compulsory insurance against unemployment to practically all persons In Receipt of remuneration not exceeding £250 a year. After a "waiting period" of three days of unemployment, beneficiari^p become entitled to 15 shillings per week for men, 12 shillings for women, 7 shillings for boys under 18, and 6 shillings for gils under 18. To qualify for 'benefit an insured person must not quit his or her job without good cause and must not have been discharged for misconduct i- have gone on strike. There must also be no refusal of a suitable Job offered, and should a dispute arise on the question of "suitability," the insured parson may appeal to a oourt of referees. Not more than fifteen weeks' benefit may be drawn In any one insurance year. Employers are free to get «p in surance schemes of their own giving equal or greater advantages. The state rate of contribution to such special schemes or contracts will not exceed 3D per cent of the amount Piiid to the general scheme, as it is taken for granted that in industries v/ith insurance systems of their own, le rate of unemployment will be Solving Naval Problems.

HARDING TAKES ADVICE. Holds Busy Round ef Conferences With Members of Congress. ByAssociated Press, Washington, Dec. T. 1*resfdent Elect Harding faced a busy round of conferences today before leaving Washington at 4 o'clock for his home in Marion. His program was not made public, but it was understood that during the day he would discuss domestic as well as international is sues with a number of members of the senate and house. Neither was it disclosed whether Mr. Harding would call at the White House to see President Wilson, and the best information seemed to be that the president and the president elect would not meet, as did their wives yesterday when Mrs. Harding accepted Mrs. Wilson's invitation to tea at the White House.
