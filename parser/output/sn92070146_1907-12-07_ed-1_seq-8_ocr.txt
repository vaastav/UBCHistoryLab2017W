PRESIDENT'S PLAIN WORDS ON MANY PUBLIC MATTERS Salient Points of the Message. Advises National Control of Corporations, Currency and Land Reform, Income Tax, Postal Savings Bank, Postponement of Tariff Re vision. Conservative Treatment of Most Topics. Makes Good Impression. President Roosevelt's message to Congress was read in both branches Tuesday. The members of Congress and members of Di plomatic Corps paid strict at tention to the reading of the doc ument. President Roosevelt's communications to Congress have frequently created unfavorable comments from those opposed to his policies, but few words of anything but commendation were heard in the corridors or about the city after the members had had time to think over the vari ous suggestions offered. Repub licans and Democrats alike were impressed with the conservative tone of the 1 message. The message fills eighteen col umns of the Los Angeles Times, but the following extracts give a fair summary of its points and a general conception of its spirit. Causes of Financial Trouble No nation has greater resources than ours, and I think it can be truthfully said that the citizens of no nation possess greater energy and industrial ability. In no nation are the fundamen tal, business conditions sounder than in ours at this very moment: and it is foolish, when such is the case, for people to hoard money instead of keeping it in sound banks; for it is such hoarding that is the immediate occassion of the money strin gency. When the misdeeds of success fully dishonest men are discover ed, suffering comes not only upon them, but upon the inno cent men whom they have misled. It is a painful awakening, when ever it occurs: and, naturally, when it does occur those who suffer are apt to forget that the longer it was deferred the more painful it would be. Yet it is not possible to refrain because of such distress from striving to put an end to the misdeeds that are the ultimate causes of the suffering, and, as a means to this end, where pos sible to punish those responsible for them. Control of Railroads In my judgement there should now be either a national incor poration act or a law licensing railway companies to engage in interstate commerce upon certain conditions. The law should be so framed as to give to the Interstate Commerce Commis sion power to pass upon the future issue of securities, while ample means should be provided to enable the commission, when ever in its judgement it is neces sary, to make a physical valu ation of any railroad. The railroads and all other great corporations will do well to recognize that this control must come; the only question is as to what governmental body can most wisely exersize it. Supervision of Trusts The anti-trust law should not be repealed: but it should be made both more efficient and more in harmony with actual conditions. It should be so amended as to- forbid only the kind of combination which does harm to the general public, such ammendment to be accompanied by, or be an incident of, a grant of supervisory power to the government over these big con cerns engaged in interstate busi ness. To"! confer upon the national government, in connection with the amendment I advocate in the anti-trust law, power of super vision over big business concerns engaged in interstate commerce, would benefit them as it has benefitedjthe national banks. In the recent business crisis it is noteworthy that the institutions which failed were institutions which were not under the super vision and control of the national government. Those which were under the national control stood the test. Elastic Currency We need a greater elasticity in in {[our currency; provided, of course, that we recognize the even greater need of a safe and secure currency. There must always be the most rigid examination by ff' the national ; authorities. Provision should be made for an emergency cur rency. The emergency issue should, of course, be made with an effective guaranty, and upon conditions carefully prescribed by the government. Such emer gency issue must be based on adequate securities approved by the government, and must be issued under a heavy tax. The Tariff This country is definitely com-i mitted to the protective system and any effort to uproot it could not but cause widespread] indus rial • disaster. It is ; probably well that every dozen years or so the tariff laws should be care fully] scrutinized so as to see that no excessive or improper benefits are conferred thereby, that proper revenue is provided, and that our foreign trade is encouraged. The subject can not with wisdom be dealt with in the year preceding a Presiden tial election, because as a matter of fact experience has conclu sively shown that at such a time it is impossible to get men to treat it from the standpoint of the public good. In my judge ment the wise time to deal with the matter is immediately after such election. Income and Inheritance When our tax laws are revised the question of an income tax andean inheritance tax should receive the careful attention of our legislators. In my judge ment both of these taxes should be part of our system of Federal taxation. The tax should if possible be made to bear more heavily upon* those residing without the country than within it. A heavy progressive tax upon a very large fortune is in no way such a tax upon thrift or industry as a like tax would be not a small fortune;- ~ Abuse of Injunction Instances of abuse in the grant ing of injunctions in labor dis putes continue to occur and the resentment in the minds of those who feel that their rights are be ing invaded and their liberty of action and of speech unwarrant ably restrained continues like wise to grow. I earnestly com mend to the attention of the Con gress this matter, so that some way may be devised which will limit the abuse of injunctions and to protect those rights which from time to time it unwarrant ably invades. Employer's Liability. The number of accidents to wage- workers, including those that are preventable and those that are not, has become appall ing in the mechanical, manufac turing and transportation opera tions of the day. The law should be made such that the payment for accidents by the employer would be automatic instead of being a matter for lawsuits. Workmen should receive certain and definite compensation for all accidents in industry irrespective of negligence. Labor Disputes I renew Jmy previous recom mendation that the Congress fa vorably consider the matter of creating the machinery for com pulsory investigation of such in dustrial controversies as are of sufficient magnitude and of suffi cient concern to the people of the country as a whole to warrant the Federal government in taking action. Work as a Profession Our school system is gravely defective in so far as it puts a premium upon mere literary training and tends therefore to train the boy away from the farm and the workshop. The calling of the skilled tiller of the soil, the calling of the, skilled mechan ic, should alike be recognized as professions, just as emphatically as the callings of lawyer, doctor, merchant or clerk. Water Highways Our great river systems should be developed as national water highways. The National Gov ernment should undertake this work, and I hope a beginning will be made in the present con gress. From the Great Lakes to the mouth of the Mississippi there should be a deep waterway with deep waterways leading from it to the east and the west. Irrigation Irrigation should be far more extensively developed than at present, not only in the states of the Great Plain and the Rocky Mountains, but in many others. The work of the reclamation ser vice in developing the larger op portunities of the western half of our country for irrigation is more important than almost any other movement. Land Law Reform The land law system which was designed to meet the needs of the fertile and well watered regions of the Middle West has largely broken down when ap plied to the dryer regions of the Great Plains, the mountains and much of the Pacific slope, where a farm of 160 acres is inadequate for self-suoport. In these regi ons the system lent itself to fraud and much land passed out of the hands of the government without passing, into the hands of the home-maker. The government should part with its title only to the actual home-maker, not to the profit-maker who does not care to make a home. Some per sons actually demand that the present forest reserves be thrown open to destruction. But only a savage would, in his private af fairs, show such reckless disre gard of the future. The only trouble with the movement for the preservation of our foresst is that it has not gone nearly far enough, and was not begun soon enough. There should be no tar iff on any forest product grown in this country; and, in especial, there should be no tariff on wood pulp. In my judgment the govern ment should have the right to keep the fee of the coal, oil and gas fields in its own , possession and to lease the rights to develop them under proper regulations. Postal Savings Bank I commend to the favorable consideration of the Congress a postal savings bank system, as recommended by the Postmaster General. Through the agency of the postal savings banks hoarded money would be restored to the channels of trade, to the mutual benefit of capital and labor. Parcels Post I further commend to the Con gress the consideration of the Postmaster-General's recom mendation for an extension of the parcel post, especially on the rural routes. These recommend ations have been drawn up to benefit the farmer and the coun try storekeeper. Shipping Laws Unless the Congress is prepar ed by positive encouragement to secure proper facilities in the way of shipping between Hawaii and the mainland, then the coast wise shipping law should be so far relaxed as to prevent Hawaii suffering as it is now suffering. Campaign Contributions It is well to provide that cor porations should not contribute to Presidential or national cam paigns and furthermore to pro vide for the publication of both contributions and expenditures. The need for collecting large campaign funds would vanish if congress provided an appropria tion for the proper and legiti mate expenses of each of the great national parties. Ocean Mail Service I call' your especial attention to the unsatisfactory condition, of our foreign mail service which because of the lack of American steamship lines is now largely done through foreign lines. I strongly recommend, therefore, a simple amendment to the ocean mail act of 1891, which shall au thorize the Postmaster-General in his discretion to enter into contracts for the transportation of mails to the republics of South America to Asia, the Philippines and Australia, at a rate not to exceed $4 a mile for steamships of sixteen knots speed or upwai d subject to the restrictions and obligations of the act of 1891. Army and Navy Perhaps the most important of all legislation needed for the benefit of the army is a law. to equalize and increase the pay of officers and inlisted men of the army, navy, Marine Corps and Revenue Cutter Service. It is evident that it is folly for this nation to base any hope of securing peace on any inter national agreement as to the limitation of armaments. Such being the fact it would be most unwise for us to stop the up building of our navy. To build one battleship of the best and most advanced type a year would barely keep our fleet up to its present force. This is not enough.* In my judgement, we shoud this year provide for four battleships. Foreign Policy In foreign affairs this country's steady policy is to behave toward other nations as a strong and self-respecting man should be have toward the other men with whom he is brought in contact, in other words, our aim is dis interestedly to help other nations where such help can be wisely given without the appearance of meddling with what does not concern us; to be careful to act as a good neighbor; and at the same time, in goodnatured fashion, to make it evident that we do not intend to be imposed upon. In view of the close neighbor hood of the two countries the relations which exist between Mexico and the United States are just cause for gratification. Other Recommendations I again recommend that the rights of citizenship be conferred upon the people of Porto Rico. A bureau of mines should be created under the control of direction of the Secretary of the Interior. There should be a national gallery of art established in the capital city of this country. So far from there being a tarriff on works of art brought into the * country, their importation should be incourapfed in every way. Melon Growers >J At the annual meeting of the El Centro Fancy Melon Growers' Association, the following officers were elected: President, John Norton; Vice-president, W. R. Waldrop; Secretary, W. S. Ballard; Directors, J. A. McCause and W. A. Thayer. The association had 260 acres in melons last season; it has 400 acres already signed for' the coming season .and expects to have a total of 600 acres. Baseball Meeting At a meeting of the baseball team Tuesday night, Manager Buttress was authorized to ar range for a game with the Yuma . team at Yuma on January 1. Pro- '- vision was made for the payment of bills on the grounds and the • purchase of supplies. It was al so decided that a subscription pa per be circulated for the benefit . of the team, as further 'expense in arranging the grounds and seats will be necessary. A Break for the Border While the jail was being scrub- • bed out last Monday the prison ers were taken outside and al- • lowed to bask in the sunshine. Jack Templar Brown, the man i charged with unnatural crime, , made a sneak and was discovered I going south across lots at a pace » astonishing for a man of his years. . The first guard who gave chase on foot was unable to catch up,* with the fugitive, and deputy Buck went after him on horse back, but was blocked by wire > fences. Deputy Bradford com mandeered a saddled broncho on i the street and headed Mr. Brown, i off from the Mexican line with a. shotgun, but Mr. Brown had a . hunch that Bradford would not . shoot him and paid no attention to the gun. The deputy threat ened to run the horse over him, but that did not turn Brown's ■ mind from the border and liberty and Bradford had to dismount .' and join him in a foot race. Be ing in good baseball training Bradford won the race and . brought Mr. Brown back to jail. About Digestion It is not the duantity of the food : taken but the amount digested and '. assimilated that gives strength and ( vitality to the system. Chamberlain's Stomach and Liver Tablets invigorate • the stomach and liver and enables them . to preform their functions.

Good Cough M'dirtne for Children The season for coughs and colds is • now at hand and too much care cannot be used to protect the children. A child is much more likely to contract , diphtheria or scarlet fever when he has . a cold. The quicker you cure his cold the less fc the risk. Chamberlain's . Cough Remedy is the sole reliance of many mothers, and few of those who < have tried it will use any other. Mrs. F. F. Starcher, of Ripley. W. Va.,says "I have never usea anything other than Chamberlain's Cough Remedy for my children and it has always given good satisfaction.
