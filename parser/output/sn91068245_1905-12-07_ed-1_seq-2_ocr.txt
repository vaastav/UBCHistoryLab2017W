Prefiid-ct UjOjevfrlt's met-sage was read in both houses of Cuogrev Tuesday at noon. We are sorry we haven't room to publish It in full, but the document id quite lengthy and would require more apace than i we have at our command, so we are giviDg our readers ihe most import-; ant feature of the message. One of the roosst important fea tures of the President's message was his advocacy of government control of railroad rates. This does not mean to take the authority of fixing raveo uui ui iuo usuub u tua roads altogether but to have a com mUsion to see that no one is over charged or discriminated against. The President al-o calls attention to the necessity for legislation requir ing the use of block signals upon railroads engaged in interstate com merce and states that Congress should provide, by appropriate leg islation, for the Introduction of block signals upon all such railroads at the earliest practical date, as rf measure of increased safety to the travelling public. Further important recom mendations of the President were, the urgent need of action to make our criminal law more efl'ective, the need of a greater merchant marine, the necessity of a law to regulate interstate commerce in misbranded and adulterated foods, drinks and drugs. Such a law would protect the legitimate manufacturer and the consuming public. The President also recommends that Indian Terri tory and Oklahoma be admitted as one State, and that New Mexico and Arizona be admitted as one State. Mr. Roosevelt states that nothing has taken up more time in Congress during the past few years than the Question as to the siatthood to be A granted the lour lemiuiieb wen Honed above, and recouuuei cl thai ihm?

LAWS SUOULU . i.i: i ! The Winston Daiiy 1S niiiA-l (dem ocratic) is of the opinion Jiat lh next legislature hhuukl nd a part of ita time in repta!iL the i.eedlesf laws now on the statute Looks. The Sentinel says : 'One of the be&t things the next legislature cculd do would be to take from the statute bi oks some of the laws now contained therein. We have many very excellent laws and some very needle-83 ones and the lai ter should be repealed. It is taty to see that disrespect tor one law breeds contempt for all law. There can be little doubt of too fact that we have too many laws and every legislature naturallv increases the number. Ot course new conditions are constantly arising and these necessitate new 'laws, but we hope the next legisla ture will confine new laws to the minimum. Ve also hope that the next legislature will take action to have provision made tor the care ot ail the insane of the State, no matter how much it costs. This trouble about inadequate space at the State ' hospitals is constantly arisiug, and we believe the condition complained of should beremedied once for all." The Sentinel is right. Many ot the laws now on the statute books should be repealed because other laws have been passed in their stead while there are many 'more that have been passed by recent legislatures that are obsolete for the reason tha they have, never been enforced They should either be repealed or the officers of the law should be fined for not enforcing them. If a man can violate one law and go un punished he naturally concludes he can break other laws and escape pun ishment. As the Sentinel says Disrespect for one law breeds con tempt for all law." An exchange says that the 1aw less may expect to be punished." Well, If they do, many of the law less don't get what they expect. Water-Rate Decision. The Sapreme Court of Florida decided that an ordinance passed by the city of Tampa, regulating water rates in that city, is valid. The plant in Tampa is owned by a cor poration and the city passed an ordi nance fixing certain rate charges for water. The water company appealed jand the court upholds the city -LEADI5G A. XTKAK. LOT." The JUleigh EfenlngTimea(dem ocratlc) thinks the democratic con tingent In Coogrew U a weak lot. The Times, In looking over the "lot," take this view of the situa tion: The nomination cf John Sharp Williams, of Mississippi, f r Speaker by the Democratic m.i.tere of the ilouto of Repreutativfs, mean tht he will again officiate as the minority leader, and ind ed no other arrangement would have been t I -factory to the party. Mr. Cannon, of course, will be the real speaker. In Conre the demerit cut a very Horry figure in quantity and quality, tor It seemi to be a rule in some parts of the South and West to pi k up a man without ability and elect him simply because h has the pnll' with the politicians. There are con stant changes from almost every dis trict and before a member has had time to familiarise himself with con ditions, he is left at home and an other stranger Is sent to Washing ton to set the woods on fire; soon he returns." The Greenville Reflector says: We notice that a veteran In Vir ginia has refused a pension and hack pay amounting to upward of 15,000. If be was in North Caro- Ina he would be sent up about taleigh." The Reflector doesn't make it plain whether tne man would have been sent to the penitentiary or to he Insane asylum. But that wouldn't have maae mucn ainerence, as here are many in the prisons who should be in the asylums, and it is safe to say there are some in the asylum who should be in the peni tentiary. Where the Trouble Lie mm to Tafclxir Care of the Insane. in discussing the agitation con cerning the indigent insane of the titate, which shows an alarming and shameful condition of things relative to these poor unfortunates, the Char lotte Observer, getting off on the ine that we have spoken on before, says: But what we started out to say is that the present agitation is in reality out cf season at present ; it should have occurred just before or during a session of the legislature. The State Hospital authorities have never in recent years failed to ac quaint the members of the legisla ture with the true condition of af fairs and urge them to do whatever was necessary for the care of all the nsane in the x State, always laying emphasis upon the condition ot those who could not be admitted for lack of room. Tnere is no evidence that conditions are worse now than they have been for some years and certainly they are a great deal worse than they should be. The legisla latuie alone can remedy present con ditions, and it does not meet for over a year yet. "We have repeatedly called atten tion to tne very tacts .that are now beii g made u;-e of; Indeed to such extent that we were feariul of weary ing our readers. The legislature, however, tailed to act, and until it does no relief that is worthy of the namo is to be expected. As to the hospital authorities, there is no doubt that they have done their duty, despite assertions to the contrary. The responsibility for present conditions lies with the members of the legislature." The appeals to the Governor in behalf of the indigent insane dur ing off years by some of the politi cat organs do not win much applause from the people as to their good in tentions or statesmanship. Neither has the recent management of the State Hospitals merited much es teem from our recent legislatures. J hey have gone off after strange gods," as it were, and neglected these unfortunates at the time that they could have provided for them. They have thought of the reassess ment of property, of providing for special and higher taxes, of raiding salaries and of creating new offices, of giving place to political favorites and cf iriietuatine the oower of the Democratic party, and in the wind up they have consumed all the taxes that have been raised and there is no money leu for the manv needed purposes. This has been the program each time the legislature has met, and there is no use to mince words about it, the blame should fc go where it belongs. The next campaign will be waged on the idea of re-electing Simmons to the ft. B 1 a a a. united oiates senate ana its cor relative, perpetuating the Demo cratic machine and we will not hear a word about the poor indl Lgent insane then. Union Republi can. Hii Peculiarity. The Washington Mirror tells of a surprise that came to a man that remarked to a stammerer : 'You must find that impediment in your speech rather inconvenient at times, Mr. Biggs." "On, n-no; everybody has his peculiarity. Stammering is m-mine; what is yours T" . 11 T ii it w weii, reaiiy, i am not aware that I have any." D-do you stir your tea with your right hand?" "Why, yea, of course." ..rr .... i . -w-weu, mac is y-your p-pecu- liarity ; most p-peopla u-uae a t-tea- spoon." 

TBOH OUR KXCUASI. Malb of lBteret we !. iimth- wlta oar paetcrpot u4 aaears. There la a new clamor for the punishment of the ft tola who point unloaded guns" at people. We are greei. And white we are at h, why not ay a word in favor of punhb Ingthooe who deliberately kill their fellow-man ? Raleigh Enterprise. Mr. W. J. Bryan, the American democratic party, i traveling in Ja pan. He tried to bay the old war Htool upon which Admiral Togo hat when he attended the Shinto cere monial iu Uyeno park, at Tokio, to celebrate the naval triumph. The stool which his ieeu used fr centu ries (since 1607) has been banded down in the Og?awara family of Shinto prierts. W bat did Mr. Bryan want with the old etool ? While he is over there he had better be look ing about the Junk shop fr a cheap second hand platform. HU prople over here need that m re than they do the stool. People's Paper. More Official Brutality. At Wilmington, Jas M. Wade, a deputy sheriff, arreted u woman for dssorderly cot-duct. She cursed the officer and the brute beat her until she had to be sent to the hospital. He wa fined $80 and costs and iuadf to resign his office. A good thrash ing should have ben addfd. We publish this to show that Democratic officials sometimes do wrong as well as Republicans. Our Democratic friends have spasms whenever a Republican officer goes wrong, but they tread lightly on the toes of the brutes of their own party. We believe in condemning wrong wherever it exists, regard less of party. Democratic officials in the East are being criticized for not enforcing the provisions of the Ward and Watts laws, blockade distilleries are greatly on the in crease in the East, but revenue offi cers are expected to do all the cut ting up. Davie Record. A Farce in the Name of Juatlce. Progressive Farmer. The following dispatch was printed in last week's Progressive Farmer : Fayetteville, Nov. 21st : Messrs. John C. Haigh and George Myrover, tormerly cashier and teller of the Bank of Fayetteville, plead guilty to the charge of embezzlement in the Superior Court today and judg ment was suspended on payment of costs, restitution having been made to the bank." Fairbrother's Everything calls at tention to the fact that the same day Haigh and Myrover were turned loose on the people they had robbed of $28,000, a negro in Salisbury wa sentenced to five years for stealing $35, and another negro was senteneed to one year for stealing a plug of to bacco. Everything" also reflects the general sentiment of the press and our opinion so clearly that wh reprint herewith what it says in lieu of any comments cf our own : "Webster's Dictionary, defining the word embezzlement, says: 'Lar ctny aenoies a taxing oy iraud or stealth, from another's possession embezzlement denotes an appropria tion, by fraud or stealth, of pro erty already in the wrong-doex's possession.' Thu9 it will be seen mat the man who embezzles not only steals but violates a sacred trust It certainly was a sublime spectacle to see men standing up in a court of justice and stating that they be lieved the ends of justice would be met if the brace of thieves would pay the costs in the case after they had pleaded guilty to taking nearly thirty thousand dollars that did not belong to them, and by so doing caused the bank to temnorarily sus pend. Suspension of judg ment, upon payment of costs, and the men confessing that they took twenty-eight thousand dollars of money entrusted to their keeping great God 1 with such a fnrie, why should court-houses be built 1" A Kecklees Stewardship. The Democratic party has been in power in this State for years and all at once the people stand aghast at iuo umuuacemeni mat tnere are hundreds of insane persons who can not gain admission to the State in stitutions. Unfortunately Demo cratic Legislatures have been too busy raising salaries, multiplying omces, passing Watt liquor laws which their own officials won't en force, finding negroes in every wood pile, reckless appropriation of funds until nothing is left but a Dankrupt State Treasury, enacting fool private laws and many of a public nature, which the Supreme Court sets aides in a majority of appeals, while the poor and helpless insane are kept in pens like cattle, or in jails like crim inals, for lack of accommodation at Baleigh and Morganton. Now there is a terrible blow and bluster about the unfortunates and it is well. But why, at this late date ? Simply be cause patience has ceased to be a vir tue, and there is a demand all over North Carolina which the Demo cratic party cannot any longer cast aside at will to patch the holes in their extremely rotten political fences in order to carry the State and keep machine Democracy with I its legion of bonds and bankruptcy Woe Railway Kfaasa. or foclWro1af Cucgret, aftaembllog early this iri?ntb, moat grant or deny tha na tion demand for a square deal In railway freight rates. The people have become convinced that private control of rates on the public high ways the railways is the main factor in building up the great Ira- that trar gle competition and rob s . . a a consumers, in Li conviction is toe power bt-hind the argent popular de mand that railways rates should be regulated by the Federal govern ment. Itay Stannard Baker In Mc- Clure's Magna ine for November shows ui exactly how a dos9tt pri vate citizens, responsible only to railway managers, intent on charg ing the public not a fair rate but all that it possibly can pay, make rates in secret and in violation of law. President Iloosevelt will ask Con gress this winter to enact a taw which tne people who support the railways can, through federal offi cials, get prompt and sure protection against extortionate and inequitable charges upon these highways of the nation's cooimerce. When Uou e and Senate vote oq this proposition we shall know exactly which mem bers serve the people, and who are the others that give their first alle giance to the railway kings. They must toe the mark or quit the track. Frank Putnam in National Maga zine for December.
