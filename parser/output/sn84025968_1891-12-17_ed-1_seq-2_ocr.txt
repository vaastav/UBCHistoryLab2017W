2 AT THE CAPITAL. Proceedings of Both Houses of Congress. Speaker Crisp Announces the Committee on Rules. Stewart to Address the Senate on the Coinage of Silver. Circuit Judges Nominated by tho Presi dent—A Number of Recess Appoint ments Con Armed by the Senate. Associated Press DlßDatches. Washington, Dec. 10.—Speaker Crisp has announced the appointment oi tiie committee on rules as follows: The speaker, chairman; McMillin, Catch inge, Reed and Burrows. A resolution was presented providing for the appointment of a standing com mittee on order of business to consist of fifteen members, of which the speaker shall be ex officio chairman, which shall have jurisdiction of the order in which business shall be considered. Referred to committee on rules. Bartine of Nevada, who was absent on account of illness, appeared at the bar of the house and took the oath of office. Taylor of Tennessee announced the death oi his colleague, Leonardis 0. HobJc, who died in Knoxville, last May. The house then as a mark of respect to the memory of the deceased, adjourned till Saturday. THK BOLES COMMITTEE. The appointment of the house com mittee on rules is regarded by members of the house as a return to the former policy of appointing members to this committee without reference to their other committee assignments. McMil lin, one of the new members of the rules committee, is prominent as a tariff reformer, and was one of the most active members of the ways and means com mittee. Ho says, however, that he is in favor of the appointment of Mills is chairman of the lait-named com mittee. MoMillin's selection as a membei of the rules committee is ascribed to big parliamentary ability ; his effectiveness as a debater, and the fact that he is very well liked by the members of the Democratic side, and will, therefore, be of great assistance in securing the harmonious adjustment of any differences which may arise as to party policy. Catcliings of Mississippi, a firm personal friend of tiie new speak er, and one of the active managers of his canvass, also a very popular, expe rienced member of the house, an active worker and a clear, forcible speaker,was also appointed. S EN ATE I'ROCEK DINGS. Among the papers presented and recorded in the senate, today, were numerous memorials against Sunday opening of the world's fair.

Stewart then gave notice that he would on Monday, next, address the senate on that portion of the president's message relative to the coinage of silver. The Benate at 12 :40 proceeded to executive business, and at 1:15 adjourned until tomorrow. PB

AMERICAN REPUBLICS. First Annual Report of tbe Bureau at Washington. Washington, Dec. 16. —President Har rison today sent to the senate a letter from the secretary of state, enclosing a copy of the first annual report of Di rector Curtis of the bureau of American republics. It says the immense number of applications received for information about the North American countries give evidence of awakened interest in the commerce and condition of the neighboring countries, that is encourag ing to those endeavoring to promote the social and commercial relations of the American republics. The report refers to the rapidly in creasing export trade to the Central and South American republics, and says many United States manufacturers, who never attempted to sell merchandise in the southern continent, are sending agents into those markets to introduce their goods. Merchants hitherto buying in Europe exclusively are now coming to the United States, and invariably discover that they can find nearly every article they need here, of better quality and at no greater cost. The recently negotiated reciprocity arrangements, it is said, also afford them opportunities that are beginning to be understood and appreciated. The report refers to the work un dertaken by the bureau of interesting the governments and people of Latin America in the world's fair. The invita tion extended to them to participate | has been duly accepted by every re ; public and colony, and appropriations ■ have been made to pay the expenses of 1 representation that exceed in the aggre gate $2,000,000 more than has been pio vided for the same purpose by the states of the United States, with the state of Illinois excepted. The companies operating lines of steamships between the United States and Latin America have joined heartily in the enterprise, and made generous concessions. The bureau has been enabled to pro pare, for exhibition at Chicago, an his ' torical collection illustrating the discov | cry, conquest and settlement of Latin , America, and the subsequent periods. The report contains much information jof interest. Among other things it is ; proposed to prepare for the exposition a ' commercial exhibit illustrating the vari i ous classes of merchandise best adapted | to the wants and most acceptable to the . tastes of the consumers in Mexico, Cen j tral and South America and the West I Indies. This exhibit, it is proposed, at j the close of the exposition will be per ! manently established either iv Wash ington or New York.

CLARKSON AND CONGER. j Both Non-Committal as to Blatne'l Candidacy in '08. Minneapolis, Dec. 1(1. —Chairman Clarkson, of the national republican committee, and members of thecommit i tee spent the day in looking over the i exposition building and consulting with j architects as to its remodeling to meet I the needs of the convention. Clarkson | said Blame wasjfeeling better than he | had in many years. As to whether | Blame would run again, be decliued to be quoted. He thought tbe defeat of Mills settled Clevelaud's chances. Colonel Conger, member of the repub lican executive committee, in an inter view today, speaking of tiie convention said: "The committee proposes that the whole field shall be looked over and the strength of the various candidates care fully considered. Then a decision will be made and the men will be named by acclamation by ttie convention. There will be no contest on the floor of the convention. There will be no attempt to put down public sentiment, but the whole matter will be informally under stood and acquiesced in by the delegates before the convention gets down to work. In regard to a letter of declina tion fioin Blame, I do not believe there is anything in it. There is no reason j why Blame should write a letter now, or until the nomination was tendered ! him, and in that event, undei the plan the committee proposes to work, he cer tainly could not decline. Neither could Harrison or any other man who may be selected." IMPROVED FORECAST. Tho Weather Bureau Going to Give a Butter Service.

Denver, Colo., Dec. 1G —Iv the Barn aby trial today Mrs. Worrell was called to tbe witness stand. She said she be came acquainted with Barnaby iv Edin burgh, Scotland, in 1875. She accom panied Mrs. Barnaby on her California trip at the hitter's request. Witness went on to state that she arrived in Den ver with Mrs. Barnaby in July, and both attended the wedding of young Barnaby. From here they went to San Francisco, and from there witness re turned to Denver alone, April 7th. Mrs. Barnaby was met by a woman in San Francisco who recommended her to a doctor. Witness thought it very strange, and spoke to the clerk of the hotel about it, but Mrs. Barnaby decided to remain and be treated by this doctor. WitneßS left her with Mrs. Fisher and left for Denver, arriving here April 9th. Witness was told that there was a pack age here for Mrs-. Barnaby after they returned from the ranch on the day they took the fatal fluid. Mrs. Barnaby said she was tired, and thought a li.tie fine old whisky would help her. She made two toddies, and witness took oue and drank it. She exclaimed, "It is vile stuff!" but Mrs. Barnaby drank here, and finally said, ''It is poor stuff." Then witness became ill. Her son hurried in and told her she should not have drunk before dinner. Witness vomited and became unconscious until 2 o'clock next morning. She could not keep anything on her stomach. Witness was able to take solid food when Dr. Graves arrived from the east, and when Mrs. Darnaby's body was taken east a few days later, she was able to go to tbe depot with the party. She knew when Mrs. Barnaby was here in January that she received medicine from Graves, which came through the mail, and which was for rheumatism, and when they were in California she had on various occasions received let ters and papers. She tirst met Mrs. Barnaby in Europe, in 1.584, aud traveled with her for three months. She after ward visited her at l'rovidenceon several occasions until three years later, when they had a misunderstanding, and their relations ceased for a short time, after which their friendship was renewed. When witness made her last visit to Providence she noticed that the rela tions between Mr. and Mrs. Barnaby were very much strained, and she en deavored to make peace between them, but failed. She told this to a reportsr for one of the Boston papers, and also informed him that Mrs, Barnaby had left in her will $50,000 to Dr. Graves. Stie admitted that Mrs. Barnady told her that Dr. Graves was the one who ad vised her to contest her husband's will, and on one occasion she said if she did not take her business out of the doctor's hands she would soon be ruined. When Mrs. Barnaby and witness were traveling through Cal ifornia she used to write to Dr. Graves regularly, sending him her kindest re gards and expressing satisfaction at everything he did, and also keeping him informed as to her movements. Wit ness left California before Mrs. Barnaby, who arrived in Denver two weeks later, and found the bottle supposed to con tain whisky awaiting her. Mrs. Worrell then related the story of the death of Mrs. Barnaby, heretofore given in these dispatches. Evidence was then introduced by the prosecution to show that Graves always intimated that. Mrs. Barnaby was in competent, ami threatened to have a guardian appointed to take care of her unless she did absolutely what he said. Tbe executors of the estate deny that they advised Dr. Graves to take this con rae. William 11. Wood, one of the execu tor?, was called, and stated that Mrs. /a Barnaby had been left $100,000 by her husband's will. Several sums had been paid to Mrs. Barnaby, but the greater prrt had been paid either to Dr. Graves or Mr. Ballon. Embarrassed Banks.

MISS MYERS' CHARACTER IT IS SAVAGELY ATTACKED IN THE (JOHN CASE PROCEEDINGS. X Yesterday's Proceedings in the Great Will Contest-What Miss Myers Is Al leged to Have Said — Miss Pena's Story. The hearing jn the contest over the estate of the late B. Cohn was resumed before Judge Ciark in department two, of the superior court, yesterday. The respondents continued to intro duce testimony to impeach the wit nesses for the contestant, and Miss Hen rietta Meyers, the comely young woman who was such a strong witness for Del flna, is coming in for a lion's share of attention at the hands of the legal gen tlemen who are engaged in fighting the contestant. Miss Meyers, it will be remembered, was on the stand when the case was be gun. She testified in a very positive man ner on several very important points. Among other tilings, she said she saw tiie much-talked-of marriage contract, which the contestant alleges was drawn up and signed by the deceased. Miss Meyers stated Bhe was at Delfina's house when the contract was made, and that after it was signed one of the parties to the agreement exhibited it to her. She also testified that she and l'elfina were ttje best of friends. Since the respondents have had a whack at the case there have been a number of witnesses who directly con tradict Miss Meyers. Several of these witnesses accredit her with using language regarding Delfina winch is un lit for publication, and the young lady is said to have stated that she knows of persons whom Delfina should call hus band rather than Cohn. She is said to have referred to A. J. Domingo as one upon whom Deltina might have a claim, and laughed at the idea of her claiming Cohn as her hus band. The language in which Miss Meyers is said to have expressed her self is not of the kind which a modest person would use. One of the witnesses who has given testimony that appears damaging is Ap polano Pena. Siie possessed a fund of information about the case, and es pecially about Miss Meyers's status with the contestant and her conversations regarding Delfina. The witness, Miss Pena, ia a young Mexican woman. She testified that she was invited to the res- idence of one Morano several days ago, and while there signed a paper which was presented to her. A notary public who was present took her acknowledg ment. The counsel then introduced a paper in evidence which the witness identified as the one she signed. It pur ports to be an affidavit in which Miss Pena states that she knew nothing about any conversations or remarks of Henrietta Meyers concerning Delfina. Miss Pena swore she was induced to affix her signature to the paper by rea son of threats that if she did not sign she would likely go to the penitentiary. She made her mark fearing dire conse quences should she refuse. Miss Pena also testified that Delfina threatened her if she weut on the stand and testified against her. Witness at tributed some vile language to the con testant. The witness was subjected to an ex tremely rigid cross examination upon every material point in her testimony. The "contestant claims that Miss Pena has very little regard for truth, and her statement that she signed the affidavit by reason of being threatened they re gard aa a creation of her own. The bearing will be resumed this morning.
