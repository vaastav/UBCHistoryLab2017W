ANNUAL DOCUMENT IS READ Conservation, Ship Subsidy and For tification of Panama Canal Lead ing Topics Discussed?Has | Little to Say About Tariff. I \ Washington, Dec. 6.?Economy in government affairs is the keynote of President Taft's annual message read before both houses of congress today. The message approximates 40.000 words and is one oi the longest ever submitted by a president. Conservation of the public domain, ship subsidy, fortification of the Pana ma cana! and the continuation of the present tariff board are the leading subjects touched upon. He also re views the work of the various gov * -> ?- - ond f.nmirc in VUimcuL Ufpai i:u^ruio uuu wtivM.w recommendation, tending toward the bettering of the service, made by sev eral of the members of his cabinet. Economy Is Urged. In dwelling on the urgent need for economy in government expenditures, the president says: "Every effort has been made by each department chief to reduce the estimated cost of his department for the ensuing fiscal year ending June 30. 1912. I say this in or;er that congress may understand that thvje estimates thus made present th? smallest sum which will maintain the departments, bureaus and officer of the government and meet its othrfr obligations under existing law, and that a cut of these estimates would re sult in embarrassing the executive branch of the government in the performance of Its duties. This remark does not apply to the river and harbor estimates, except to those for expensts of maintenance and the meeting of obligations under author ized contracts, nor does it apply to the ' public building bill nor to the navy build <*>? nnnrco qo tn rhpvjp rnn vi, vvuiwv, ? i grcss could withhold any part or all of the estimates for them without interfer ing with the discharge of the ordinary ob ligations of these functions of its depart ments. bureaus and offices. "Against the estimates of expenditures $640,494,013.1!!, we have estimated receipts for next year 

S'JSO.OOO.OOO, making a proba ble surplus of ordirnry receipts over or dinary expenditures of about J50.000.000, or taking Into account the estimates for th> Panama canal, which are $55.92\SI7.CP. and ; which will ultimately be paid in bends, it will leave a deficit for the next year of i about $7.W.1P0, if rongress shall conclude ! to fortify the canr.l." Wants Forest Limitation Removed. On the subject of conservation he de votes considerable space to forest, coal. j oil and f?as. phosphate lands and water j power sites. As to tb? reservation of ' forest lands he says: "The law now pro- j hiblts the reservation of any more forest > lands in Or^sron. Washington. Idaho. | Kontana. Colorado and Wyoming, except ! by act of congress. I am informed by the j department of sericulture that the gov- J ernment owns other tracts o* timber land j in these states wliich should be included j in the forest reserves. I recommend t<? ' congress that the limitation herein im- ! posed be repealed. "Congress ought to trust the executive , to use the power of reservation only with ; respect to land most valuable for forest f purposes. During the present administra- j , Tlon. 02.250.000 acres of land largely non- J timbered have been excluded from forest reserves, and 3.500.000 acres of land prln- i clpallv valuable for forest purposes have t been Included In forest reserves, making i a reduction In forest reserves of non- ' timbered land amounting to 2.750.000 acres." Wants Canal Fortified. Regains the Panama canal, the presl- ' dent asserts that unless unexpected ob- | stacles arise the waterway will be com- i pleted well within time limit of Janu- : L arv 1. 1115. and within estimate of cost, j $375,000,000. Suggestions for levying: of tolls and mano<jr>rnent are made, and re gard! ng fortification of the canal, he says: "Among ouestionc nrls'ne for present solution is thp decision whether the can-vl shall be fortified. T have already stated congress that T strongly favor for '^tlncatlon and I now re'"r??o this opin ion and ask your consideration of the ] subject in the light of the report already i I before you marl** by a competent board. ! "Failure to fortify the canal would | leave the attainment of both these aims In the position of rights and obligations j which we should be powerless to enforce* j and which could never In any way be ab- ' solutely safeguarded asrainst a desperate and irresponsible enemv." Ship Subsidy. The president urges such action as he believes will Increase American trade abroad, and says:: "Another instrumentality indispensable J to the unhampered and natural develop ment of American commerce is merchant ! marine. All maritime and commercial na- I tions recognize the importance of this factor. The greatest commercial nations. I our competitors, jealtus'y foster their merchant marine. Perhaps nowhere is the need for rapid and direct mail, pas senger and freight communication quite so urgent as between the United States and Latin Amerca. Ve can secure in no other quarter of the world such imme- , diate benefits in friendship and com merce as would flow from the establish ment of direct lines of communication with the countries of TVUin America ade quate to meet the requirements of a rap Idly increasing appreciation of the reci procal dependence of the countries of the western hemisphere unon each other's products, sympathies and assistance. "I alluded to this most important sub ject in my last annual message: it has often been before you aid I need not re capitulate the reason?; for Its recommen dation. Unless prompt action be taken the completion of the Panama canal will find this the only great commercial na A Quick Recovery. "It s"?ms that prizefighters never 'come back.' "Maybe nor. but 'blind tigers' do. One resumed business the other day in 15 minutes after it had been raided." Depending on Chance. "I wonder why there are so many failures in the world." "Probably because so many people go through life hoping to win some day on a 100-to-l shot" His Selection. "I am afraid to go near Sharp's house or to meet him; he has such a vicious dog for a pet." "Rut you must remember that ln'mfAir oiw.U o Atrni/. p luiidiuuid iiuuccii ci vviin. he wouldn't keep any other dcg than a biting kind." Depsrtrrert of the Interior.

Ashley?I gutss so; I was in the I cafe where the congressmen eat. tion unable to avail In International mart time business of this great contribution to the means of the world's commercial in tercourse." Criticism of the Tariff. In the space devoted to the tariff the president say:-:: "The schedules of the rates of duty in the Payne tariff act have been subjected to a threat deal of criticism, some of It just, more of it unfounded, and too much misrepresentation. The act was adopted in pursuance of a declaration by the par ty which is responsible for it that cus toms bill should be a tariff for the pro tects :i of heme industries, the measure of protection to be the difference be tw.'cn the of producing the imported article abroad and the cost of producing it at home, together with such addition to that difference as might give a reasonable profit to the home producer. The basis for the criVeism of this tariff is that in respect to a number of the schedules the declared measure was not followed, but a hisher difference retained or inserted by way of undue discrimination in favor of certain industries and manufactures. Lit tle. if any. of the criticism of the tariff n:ip been directed against the protective principle above stated: but the main body of tlm orft:c'r?a lias been based on the at ten-nt to conform to the measure of pro tection was not honestly and sincerely adhered to." The president also refers to the appoint ment of a bo*>rd of experts to investigate the cost of production of various articles included ir *he schedules of the tariff, and <-oneiudes: "Whether or not the protective policy Is to be continued, ar.d the degree of protec tion to be jK '-r 'ed to our home indus tries. are questions which the people must deride throusrh their chosen representa tivc-s. But whatever policy is adopted, it is clear that the necessary legislation should be bas^d on an impartial, thor ough and continuous study of the facts." Recomrr.snds Parcels Post. The adoption of the parrels post is again adopted. On this subject President Taft says: "TVith respect to the parcels post. 1^ respectfully recommend its adop lion ori' an rurai delivery romes, ann mai 11 pounds?the international limit?be irrf.de the limit of carriage in such post. The samp argument is made against the par'-rls post that was marie against the P"s'"l savings bnnlc?that it is introduc ing tiie government into a business which should he conducted by private persons ?nd is paternalism. The postoffice depart ment has a greet plant and a great or ganization. reaching into the most remote hamlet of the United States, and with this machinery it is able to do a great many things economically that if a new organization were necessary It would be impossible to do -without extravagant ex penditures." Department of Justice. Discussing the affairs of the department of justice, the president says: "T invite especial attention to the prose cutions. under the federal law of the so called 'bucket shops.' and of those schemes to defraud in which the use of the mail is an essential part of the fraudulent conspiracy, prosecutions which have savr-d ignorant and weak members of the public and are saving them hun dreds of millions of dollars. The viola te. ns of the anti-trust law present per haps the mos* important litigation before The department, and the number of cases filed shows the activity of the govern m?nt in em ^-cm 7 mat statute. "In a spVial message last year I brousrht to tin- attention of congress the propriety and w'sdom of enacting a gen eral law provid'ng'for the incorporation of '""'histrial and other companies engaged in Interstate commerce, and I renew my recommendation in that behalf." The cryincr need In the United States of cheapening the cost of litigation by simplifying judicial procedure and ex pediting final judgment is pointed out and action looking to correction of these evils is urged. The president recommends an increase in the salari"? of federal judges. Postal Affairs. In regard to postal matters the presi dent points with pride to its present effi cient management and the recer reduc tion in the deficit. The present unre stricted franking privilege comer, in for comment with a suggestion for the adop tion of better methods for its regulation. Abo'ish Navy Yards. The president calls attention to certain reforms urged by the secretary of the navy which he recommends for adoption, and continues: "The secretary of the navy has given personal examination to every navy yard. ana rjas siuaico me uses 01 ine navy yards with reference to the necessities of our fleet. With a fleet considerably less than half the size of that of the British navy, we have shipyards more than double the number, and there are several of these shipyards expensively eonipped with modern mchinery, which, nfter investigation the*secretary of the navy believes to be entirely useless for naval purposes. He asks authority to abandon certain of them and to move their machinery to other places, where It can be made of use." ? Speaking of our foreign relations the president says: "During the past year the foreign relations of the United States have continued upon a basis of friendship and crood understanding. "The year has been notable as witness ing the pacific settlement of two impor tant international controversies before the permanent court of The Hague. "The arbitration of the fisheries dispute between the United States and Great. Britain, which has been the source of nearly continuous diplomatic correspond ence since the fisheries convention of 1818, has given an award which is satisfactory to both parties. This arbitration is par ticularly noteworthy not only becaure of the eminently just results secured, but also because it is the first arbitration held under the general arbitration treaty of April 4. 190$. between the United States and Great Britain, and disposes of a con troversy the settlement of which has re sisted every other resource of diplomacy and which for nearly ninety years has been the cause of friction between two countries whose common interest lies !n maintaining the most friendly and cordial relations witb each other. President Taft makes a few recommen dations for changes in the interstate com merce law and says: "Except as above. I do not recommend any amendment to the interstate com merce law as it stands. I do not now recommend any amendment to the anti trust law. In other wojds, it seems to me that the existing legislation with reference to the regulation of corpora tions and the restraint of their business has reached a point where we can stop for a while and witness the effect of the vigorous execution of the laws of the statute boolcs in restraining the abuses which certainly did exist and whiah roused the public to demand reform."
