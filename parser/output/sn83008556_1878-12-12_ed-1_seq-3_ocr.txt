PLEASAM FIcrRESTO KKAD. , "We own a Thousand Million hollars to foreign countries for money borrowed to carry on the war, to build railroads, aiul for articles imported for use and consumption | here," was the statement only three j or four tears ago. and the actual amount of idebtedness was even i greater. At least sixty million dol lars liad to be sent abroad each year, topav the interest on this sum. What more pleasant reading, than to learn that. while supporting our selves, ami even reducing the aggre gate of home indebtedness, individ ual, municipal, aril national, our people are rapidly wiping out this foreign deht by economy in luxu ries and in the expenses of loving, and by producing more ai d more to send to other lands—by increased effort, bv developing the agricultur al resources of our great countyrand by the blessing of Providence in fiving us magnificent crops u the American Agriculturist for September, we showed that doling the year ending July Ist. our coon trv exported of its products $261,714- 679 more than we imported : in two yevh?. an excess of $128.'281,5116 i nnd in five years. $667,218,495. In our October number, we presented the figures showing that from Aug. IS7S we bad reduced our national inter cat bearing dela. S *7l, 852. (,j --from $2.381.530.271, to $1,809,677.. 900), and our annual interest pay ment in the s one time, from $150.- 977,098 to $95,181 .iK<7. an annual saving of nearly $56 000,000 ; and our annual taxation from $488,274,- 465, to $£40.753, 805, or uore tlian half. The good work still goes on ; onr former figures were made up t June 80. We now have the official statis tics to Oct. 1. Exclusive of specie, the exports during September were $57,924. 808.and the imports only $36,399, 541, a Rain during the month of over Twenty Million Dol lars ($20.52.5.267). The total ex ports from January Ist to October Ist, 1878. were $533 729. ID; the imports <1 urine the same -time, were only $324,598 6 1. a grain in 9 months of S2US-,60n5-7. At the same time, the large products of our gold ai d silver mines are being letaine.t in tle country hv so much iot oulv increasing our solid wealth, hut ad ding to tne reserve for resumption of s;ecie pavments. The yield of the mines lor our last fiscal v*ir WHS a Unit $94,000,000 or $40,226 106 of Gold, and $.6 726.2 4, of Silver. (About $2,500,000 of Gold ands3.- 000,000 of salver are consumed in the arts and manuNct lies. The total stock of gold and silver in the comi trv July 1 was estimated at $332.- 443 948, an increase of about s9h -000.000 during the >c-r.r, to v.hich $26,000,000 was added from the mines from July Ist to October Ist). The uu-offieial reiiorta show that the gain is still goi.,g on, though temporarily lessened a little in Oc tober by the Scotch 3mk failure and consequent tt .accial disturlun- i cea in Great Britain, which, for tlie | time being, checked orders tor i breadstuff*. The business is reviv ing again now. Great. Britain his still large requiretu ;uts fur urea !- stuffs, Willi exlraordin irv sintil supplies to entne from Hungarv, India, and Australia. From Jan. 1 to sfept. 27. British India export ed only 1.19 5.706 bushels of wheat against 10,485, 158 bushels in the ftatne tiuie last year. F rut ice is also fe la vet buyer this year, her imports of wheat during September alone being 2,386.320 bushels this year, against bushels last year.— The cotton crop is the largest ever produced in this country, and de spite the retardation by yellow fev er, which has now happily ri:suje peared, the exports in ten weeks from Sept. 1 were this jear 493 887 bales against 341 751 bales during the same period in 877. Surely fcnere is a hopeful outlook for all classes. White very high prices for corn and wheat can riot be expected, it is satisfactory o learn that there wi l boa demand, at some price, for all the immense products of the past two harvests, so that the country will lie cleared and a demand exi-t for the next year's harvest. Our agricultural readers can with hope and confi dence lay out their plans, during these leisure winter days, for putt ing in a good area of spring crops. Let thern not forget that the best Wiping crops are those in which the largest vield is obtained from the smallest area. We will do our share in showing how tnis is to be accom plished.—American Agriculturist- for December.

The expenses of a printing office are large and constant. Labor, rents, fuel paper and other materials are all cash items whoso payment it will not do to put off. The only safe way in the printing business is to pay as you go. \\Y would there fore most kin-My ask our friends to come to our help bv paving the sin all sums they owe us either on subscription, advertising or job work.
