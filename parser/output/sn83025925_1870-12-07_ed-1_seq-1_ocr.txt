Pprerh of Henor ('n.iflnr In the Cor tea Upon Ibe Candlitature ol the Duke ol Aeata. In reply to Prim's speech la the Cortes, intro ducing the Aosta candidature, Castelar moved a vote of censure, lie passed on thus: "Now, then, to the candidature. Measuring the grandeur of the point as compared to my weak forces, if my conscience did not impel me, I would renounce my thankless task. Ihe present situation of Spain may be summed up in one graphic description substitution of the personal policy of General Prim for the dynasty policy of Isabella II. This has brought on a series of evilsin the interior, chaos; in the exterior, war. If I were given to recriminations, there would- now spring from my lips the records of the countless times I have prophesied that tha attempt to secure a foreign king would result In a fearful catastro phe. Sad were my presentiments, but far sad der has been the reality! Oh, when I hear the lamentations of widows and orphans when I contemplate the ruins of the cities destroyed when 1 feel the heat of the Cres which send up clouds of blood into the air, filled with tears when I see half a million of unburied corpses exhaling pestilence from their remains, and Paris, the great capital ol mankind, threatened, like Rome, by Alaric I cannot comprehend, you monarchical Ministers of Spain, how it is yon have not disappeared from view, buried be neath the weight of your own remorse." Of course Castelar did not omit allusion to Maximilian of Mexico. Here he brought his impassioned eloquence into full play: "I will present to General Prim an example he ought to recollect as to how diplomatic mo rarcbies exist. The monarchical diplomacy of Europe saw, with horror, in America, a land without a king, as they see now with horror another land on this side of the ocean without a king. That hind is called New Spain, and this land is called Old Spain. In both General Prim had a prominent part to discharge. An illuetrieus Prince of the House of llapsburg went to scat himself on the throne, elevated thereto by European diplomacy, behind the buck of the great North American Republic, then compromised in a frightful war, as now the Kepublic of France is also compromised in a frightful war, A woman of great heart and grand intelligence accompanied the Prince to Mexico. What a tragedy! ,'Esebylui and Shakespeare have not written better. In a few years that Emperor his heart pierced by Republican balls was a corpse; and that Kin press her heart pierced by bitter grief became worse than a corpse, became mad (seusation). Oh, you may give to a monarch a great people over whom to rnle, a great crown to wear, the Palace of Madrid in which to dwell, the throne of San Fernando for a footstool, glorious re cords to flatter his pride, magical seats in the heart of the Guadarrama mountains, or by the banks of the majestic river immortalized by Garcilaso, to recruit his frame, the Spanish glories as mottoes for his shield, and the Esco rial for his tomb, but beyond all these grandeurs, joining to the shadow of General Prim he will see floating those two figures of the Emperor and Empress of Mexico, like the two figures of the 'Inferno,' of Dante, shedding rivers of tears and rivers of blood, and teaching by their sad example how, under come antecedents, the same catabtrophes are repeated in the pjiea of history." With General Prim Castelar wui very severe. He said: "What they were trying to brine would not be the king of the nation, or even of a party, but the king of a fraction of a party the Secretary of the Council of Ministers the responsible editor of their politics the shadow , of General Prim reflected from the throne. This was personal government with a vengeance. Was General Prim one ol those grand pohti cians, like Gladstone, who renew society be cause they have have faith in one Idea? Cer tainly not. Was General Prim oueof these K re at statesman like favour and Bismarck, who attempt high enterprises and aggrandize their people.' certainly not. He had had two op portunities afforded him of following such policy, but be had lost them both. Ilia only God was chance; his only religion, fanaticism; his only reliance, the arruv; his only faith, force: his only idea), present chaos; and his only aspi ration for the future, the retention of power to bis party. "This great t-entimcnt (independence) is the creative fire of our nationality. All our pro vinces experience in the same degree their fanaticism for Spanish independence. The Basques believe themselves epruoir from their boil like their trees, they give to their dialect the antiquity of man, and they glory in never naviDg mixed tneir biooa wiln other blood When oilier nations suffer the Russians in Moscow, the French in Paris Fichte exciting the Germans against Napoleon, and Victor Hugo exciting the French against King William, and Byron with the lyre in oue band and the sword of Leonldas in the other defending Greece against the Turks all, all turn their eyes to our country, and pointing those who light for their respective nations to our smoking ruins, show them how to overthrow their conquerors, aud how to light aud die for their country. fLoud applause.)

CORKED. A Washington despatch of yesterday savs: There) is no longer any doubt among Senators and members mat tne rann ot Admiral of toe Navy will be speedily abolished, partly because the office is useless, and partly to re'lieve the President from the embarrassment of deciding w better to nominate Admiral rorter or not. All Senators and members who have expreste opinions favor the abolition of the office. Toe President has not resumed friendly relations with Admiral Porter, and he manifests much disappointment and ebaerrln at rorter s course The original letter of Porter to Secretary Welles is now at the White House, and is ex hibited to Ccikgrekemen who are curious to view it.

WQRK BEFORE CONGRESS. The Baetaeeeertke tteaaloa-Freapeete af pertaat ffleaearee aevr readies New Lecla latloa te be lairedarea'. Tha Washington correspondent of the N. T. Tribune writes: The important legislation now pending before Congress, or likely to be brought up for action dnrlng the session, may he classified as fol lows: I. Measures for the restoratioi of American commerce. II. A further reduction of internal revenue taxation. III. Attempts to make changes in the tariff IV. Some legislation to secure a resumption of specie payments within the next year. V. A general amnesty oiu. VI. A great number of projects for subsidis ing- Western railroads with grants of public lauds, including the important Southern Pacific Railroad bill. There must also be mentioned, as subiects for debate, if not for action, the San Domingo Pur chase, tne Abolition ot me a ranking rrivuege, Givil fcervice iteiorm, me Canadian risnery the Georgia Senatorial Question, a proposed in crease of the navy, and a mass of nn finished work of last session in the way of claims and other legislation of minor interest; and this is, of course, In addition to the regular annual Ap propriation bills, the discission and passage of which are imperative. The most Important measure under the first heading is the bill to admit foreign-built vessels to American registry when owned by American citizens, which was introduced into both houses in pursuance of the recommendation in the spe cial message sent in by the President in the closing hours of the last session. Ic its present shape the operations of the bill are limited to six montbs irom tne date 01 its passage, and it can be called up at once in either house. Its supporters say that the measure is stronger now than it was last session, and mat tuey men couldlhave carried it through the House by a mftinritv of 30. had they had a dav's more time. It will be strongly opposed by Judge Kelley and others as an attack upon the vital principle of Erotection. The numerous steamship subsidy ills do not appear to have a very brilliant pros pect. They will be skilfully lobbied, however, and if their managers combine and consolidate, instead of fighting each other as they did last summer, some of the more deserving may succeed. Another modification of the Internal Revenue laws, for the purpose of further reducing the income of the Government, is understood to be lavored by General 8chenck and other members of the Ways and Means Committee. The Gene ral docs not Intimate what chauges he intends to propose, but says it is too early to go into details before his committee have met aud com pared views. There will certainly be a great deal of tariff agitation this winter, but it is not likely to result in any new legislation. We shall only have a f klrniibU of words preceding the actual battle, which promises to be the great event of the forty-second Gongrcss. ine nevenuc ue- formers," knowing they will be stronger in the next Congress than iu this, will probably con tent themselves with speech-making aud plotting to control the organization of the next House. There is good ground to hope for the adop tion of legislation to enable the Governmeut and the banks to take the short remaining step necessary to reach a resumption of specie pay ments, ine icciing is general among me oest men in Congress that resumption can easily be accomplished within a year, and that it should be done before the opening ot me next Presi dential campaign, as the crowning good work of the Republican party. A conference on this subject of the leading members of the Finance Committees of both houses is already talked of. ihe prospects of tne passage ot a General Amnesty bill are better than ever before. Many members who, six months ago, were in favor of continuing disqualifications indefinitely, now frankly say that tney nave changed their views, and believe that the time lias come to give the linishing stroke to the work of reconstruction: thus settling the whole matter, so that it will play no part in the politics of the future. If the present Congress ret uses to do tnis, it will be the earliest action of the next. The strong cround taken by both parties, dur ing the recent canvass, in opposition to further grants of land for the benefit ot corporations, has produced such a marked effect upon the mind of Congress that the prospects of the numerousTailroad bills which slipped so cully through the Senate last session are exceedingly black. There are about a dozen on the Speaker's table and twice as rcany more in the Committee on rublic Lands, ine committee is favorable to most of them, providing the clause be added which they have devised, obliging the roads to sell the land to actual settlers at an average price of f 2 50 an acre; but the House is less favorably disposed than the committee. No railroad land grant bill appears to have auy chance, with the single exception of the South ern Pacific, which has a strong backing from men who oppose all other grauts, and support this solely because of the important national character of the enterprise. As to the San Domingo purchase, it is as yet unsafe to predict the result of a reconsidera tion of the treaty, lhere will be some talk aud no action about the franking privilege. No Civil Service bill will be passed, although seve ral members who lost their nominations last fall solely on account of dissatisfaction with their distribution ol federal patronage are ready to change front on the question, con viuccd by tad experience of their folly. The fishery ouestion is one for resolutions and speech-making, and, finally, for Executive rather than Congressional action. The question ot building iron-clad to strengthen our uavy. and of properly arming our forts, many of wmcn are reported by me cmei ot urduance to be defenseless for want of heavy guns, will come up in connection with the Appropriation Altogether, we may look for an interesting, but not an exciting, session. A considerable number of members go back to private Ufa on the 4th of March, and naturally take less inte rest in public a flair as their terms of office draw to a close. This fact, together with the general lull in politics, will make a quiet ses sion, devoted to finishing the uncompleted work of lust session more than to originating ne w measures. THE

General Terry, the yommauder ot me Department ot the South, now comprising me states or is.entucKy. leu uessee, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia. South Carolina, and Florida, in his annual report makes the lollowlug remarks in regard to mili tary affairs in ueorgia: "The powers thus conferred upon me as District ittmruanaer tj act oi uongreas, January 1, 1870. have generally been exercised through the civil authorities of the fctate. The Instances In which they have been directly exercised may be briefly enumerated aa follows, viz.: An investigation Into the eligibility uuder the reconstruction acts of certain persons to seats la the Leiisla- tuie ui ueorgia, ana toe exclusion from seats of such of them aa were elearly found to be ineligible; the removal from office of two county officers, and the appointment of other ptrsons to nil their places; aad the arrest of a few persons ou the charge of murder, or attempt to murder, or on the charge of complicity wita thoee ho had committed that crime. Of the persons so arrested, one was discharged on a writ of kaba e-mpui, and tne otaera were eitner released after examination or turned over to the civil authorities for trial. In no case has any cltixen been brought , In-fore a military commission or other military tri I ijuuat, and no arrests have been made except when ' Ue j'liUic taiety pjared to demaud the Interference cf military authority, since my last report there lias been a manifest improvement In the condition of affairs In Georgia. Cilme has been much less'freqnent than It was during the previous year, and sections or the Stale which were then la a disturbed condition have be come peaceable and quiet. Home outrage upin the blacks are still from time to time report l to me, but the change In this respect Is greater than could have been reasonably expected." A list of places temporarily occupied in the whole department is given, and is followed by the statement that In almost every instance they have been occupied npon the application of the civil authorities, eitner state or national, rue detachments tent were small, but their presence produced good results. Two applications only came from r loriua. a. lew cans came irons South Carolina, on account of the threatened disturbances. Kentucky, Tennessee, and Mis sissippi made no requests for military interfer ence or aid. At the time of the writing of the report Alabama was the most disturbed portion of the department, and from the northern part of the State many applications were presented for the aid of troops, and numerous detachments were sent to support the civil authorities. In all cases such detachments acted in strict subor dination to those authorities. THE NEUTRALITY LAWS. Arreat of General Jordan-Th Aecnaed lleld Hail IB SlUtUUU. At the instigation of the Spanish authorities. and through the instrumentality of Messrs. Webster and Craig, counsel lor the Spanish Minister at Washington and Spanish consul at this port, affidavits were prepared aud presented to District Attorney Davis reciting the facts connected with the fitting out of the expedition which left this port under the command of General Thomas Jordan to aid the Cuban revo lutionists against the Spanish Government, and witnesses were procured to go before the United States Grand Jury, now in session in Ibis dis trict, and testify to the facts recited in the affi davits. The result of these proceedings was that an indictment was found by the grand jury against General Jordan, and otlier indictments against several of his coadjutors, the indictment being presented Yesterday. On the presentation of the indictments, bench warrants were Immediately issued for the arrest of the Indicted persons. Last evening, about 7 o'clock. General Jordan was arrested at bis bouse in i nirty-tmrd street, and taken to the residence of Judge Wood ru IT, to have the amount of his ball fixed. After some con versation and a brief discussion the amount was fixed at $10,000, two sureties being required, cud it being understood that the bail was to be given for his appearance for trial at the Feb ruary term of the United States Circuit Court for this district. This preliminary having been arranged, all interested went to the house of United states uommiosioner Jiette, before whom it had been arranged that temporary bail snonld be given, to be renewed before Jndge Woodruff this morning. Ihe ball was given, Seuors Aidanm and Del Monte, ot the Cuban Junta, becoming securi ties. This morning all concerned went before Judge Woodruff to renew the bail bond, and ex-Assistant united States District Attorney a. k. i neips moved mat me oan oe reduced. ihe court refused the application, on the ground that, considering the nature of the of fense charged, the bail was quite moderate. The bail bond was then renewed, the same sure ties remaining upon it, and General Jordan and bis friends left the court. The names of the other persons indicted, one of whom is in Philadelphia, are withheld for the present, as premature publication might prevent tbeir arrest A . l.rosl, last evening.
