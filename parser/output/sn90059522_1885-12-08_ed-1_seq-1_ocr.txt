VOL. VII. CONGRESS IN SESSION. Our National Lawmakers Turn Up Again in Washington for the Purpose of Legislation. Both Houses Elect Officers and Adjourn Out of Respect for the Lata Vice President. Sherman Made President of the Sen ate and Carlisle Speaker of the House. Che President's Message Expected to Heacli the Loim-Suffering Public To-Day. Yesterday in the Senate. Washixgtox, Dec. 7. — The senators were promptly on hand this morning, and ! or half an hour before noon gathered in xiendly groups around the senate chamber, jxchauginc: greetings and discussing the iituation. The galleries of the senate have aot for many years been so crowded on the spelling day of the session. The walls of the senate chamber were draped in deep black, out of respect to the memory of the late vice president. Promptly at noon Gen. McCook, secretary of the senate, called the body to order and prayer was offered by the chaplain. Rev. Dr. Huntley, after which Senator Edmonds offered a resolution de claring Senator John Sherman the president pro tern, of the senate. Senator Voorhees moved an amendment to strike out the name of John Sherman and insert instead the name of Isham Har ris. The amendment was voted down by a party vote — yeas 21). nays 34 — and Mr. Shennan was without division declared duly elected president pro tern. Mr. Sher man and Mr. Harris both abstained from voting. Upon the request of Secretary McCook Mr. Sherman was escorted to the chair by Mr. Edmunds and Mr. Voorhees and the oath of ollice was administered to him by Mr. Edmunds. MR. 

BHEKMAH TIIEN* SAID! Senators: 1 return you my grateful thanks for the high honor you have conferred upon me. In common with all the people of the United States I feel profound sorrow for the sudden death of the vice president, who by the constitution is also declared to be presi dent of the senate. The contingency has now nrrlved when it becomes the imperative duty of the senate to elect a president pro tern. In accepting the position assigned me I feel that there are many senators on either Bide of the house more apt in tuo discharge of the duties of this position; more experienced in the ruh-s and orders of the senate than myself, still, I accept with the sincere desire that I mas - be able to enforce the rules with kindness and impartiality, so as to ascertain, if possible, the sense of the majority of the senate and to give to the minority its full constitutional right and protection. With the sincere desire of performing this duty I appeal to each individual senator for his courtesy and forbearance. 

LOGAN'S CREDENTIALS. Mr. Cnllom presented the credentials of Mr. Logan's re-election as senator from Illinois, and Mr. like presented those of Mr. Blair as senator from New Hampshire. The credentials were read and Mr. Logan and Mr. Blair were at once sworn in by the president pro tern. Twelve o'clock noon ■was lixed as the hour for daily meeting, unless otherwise ordered. The secretary was instructed to inform the president of the United Stales and the house of repre sentatives that the senate had chosen John Sherman as president pro tern. Senators i Edmunds and Harris were appointed a | committee to join such a committee as may | be appointed by the house of representa ( fives to wait upon the president and inform r him that a quorum of eaeli house was as f sembled and that congress was ready to r receive ?.ny communication that he saay be '/ pleased to make. While awaiting in- I formation of the action of the I house of representatives the senate t took a recess. At 2:40 the newly ! chosen president pro tern, called the sen \ ate to order. The clerk of the house of i representatives brought a message from L that body announcing the election of its |. speaker and clerker and the appointment of j a committee to wait on the president in i conjunction with the committee already \ appointed by the senate. Mr. Voorhees y then offered the following resolutions, pre ! facing them with the remark that in doing 1 so he was performing the saddest duty of HIS 

PUBLIC LIFE. • Resolved, That the senate has received j". with profound sorrow the intelligence of the L death of Thoraua A. Hendrieks, late vice I president of the United States, and for a f. number of years a distinguished member of ; this body. Resolved, That the business of the senate ■ be suspended in order that the eminent pub j. lie services and the representative virtues of I the deceased may be appropriately com j- memorated. Resolved, That the secretary of the senate be directed to communicate these resolutions (to the house of representatives. Mr. Voorhees asked that the resolutions \ be permitted to lie on the table, subject to ' being called upon at a future day. of which ■ the senate should have due and timely no ', tice. The resolutions were accordingly laid lon the table. Mr. Harrison then moved an immediate adjournment of the senate out of respect to the memory of the late vice ; president. The motion was agreed to, and the senate at 2:43 p. m. adjourned till to morrow noon. House of Representatives. Washington', Dec. 7. — The chamber of the house presented a pleasant scene, the bright-red carpet lending an air of cheeri ness and warmth to the hall, which has ■ been thoroughly renovated since last spring, Awhile a number of desks, including that of The speaker, were decorated with flowers. ■Here and there groups of members stood chatting and laughing, political animosities being set to one side for the time being, while the members took advantage of the occasion to extend their acquaintance among their older and more experienced colleagues. Apart from the exchange of cordial greeting the chief topic of conversa tion was the proposed change of the rules. The galleries were crowded, with the ex ception of the executive gallery, which was only partially filled. The majority of the spectators "were ladies. At precisely noon the house was called to order by J. B. Clark, its clerk, and the first session of the Forty-ninth congress began. When order was seVured, the clerk proceeded to call the roll of members-elect. While the roll-call was in progress, a page walked down the center aisle, bearing in his arms a huge floral design representing a section of a canal navigated by a canal boat laden with diminutive bags" of grain, the' whole being inscribed 

"HEXN'EPIN." As he placed it on the desk of Mr. Mur pliy of lowa, the especial champion of the Hennepin canal project, the house broke into applause and laughter. The call dis closed the presence of 320 members, the only absentees being Miller of New York, Henderson of North Carolina. Aikea of South Carolina, Craig of Texas, and Croxton of Virginia. Nomi nations for speaker were then in order and Mr. Tucker of Virginia was recognized, who presented the name of John Griffen Carlisle of Kentucky. Messrs. Hiscock of New York and Cannon of Illinois then rose, but the latter was recognized, and he placed the name of Thomas B. Reed of Maine in nomination. Messrs. Morrison of Illinois, Tucker of Virginia. Hiscock of New York and Brown of Indiana were ap pointed tellers to count the vote, which was immediately proceeded with. The re sult was announced as follows: For Car lisle 177 for Reed 137. and amid loud ap plause the clerk declared Mr. Carlisle elected, and appointed Messrs. Tucker and Reed as committee to conduct the speaker to the chair. On taking the chair MR. CARLISLE SaTD: Gentlemen o f the House of Representatives : In assuming the duties and responsibilities \^ \y : of this place for a second titnej beg to return \ i my most profound thuuks for the manifesto- : tion of your continued confidence. It is a I compliment which I shall always remember i with pride and srratitude. No where else in the world can there be found a legislative as sembly representing so great a constituency as i hat. represented by this house and cer taiuiy no similar bo.Jy, consisting of an equal number of members, is its superior in point of ability and devotion to the interests in trusted to it. The privilege of presiding over the deliberations of such a body is a very high and honorable distinction, the highest and most honorable it can confer on any of its members, and I appreciate it as such. But, | gentlemen, my lull appreciation of your action today can best be shown by a conscientious and impartial discharge of my official duty, and, although it may not be wise to make pledges in advance, I venture to promiso that, to the fullest extent of my ability, the law governing the proceedings of the house shall be evenly administered, with a view to the 

PRESERVATION OF ORDER and decorum, the protection of the personal and representative rights of members and ' thu prompt transaction of public business. None of these results, however, can be ob ! tamed without your active co-operation and ! support. In a body so large as this, repre senting such vast and sometimes conflicting interests, a constant observance of estab lished rules and precedents is imperatively required, not only by the considerations j vitally affecting the public welfare, but in order to maintain the honor and dignity of the house itself. In the sharp con tests for priority which unavoidably occur in such a body, the re straints imposed by fixed rules are sometimes quite severely tested, especially if there has been a large accumulation of business. But experience has shown that tho necessity of resularitj in the consideration of legislative measuies is so fully appreciated by gentlemen on the floor that they can al ways be relied upon to sustain the presiding olKcer in every proper effort he may make to obtain that result. In view of this fact, I feel much more confident of a reasonable de gree of success in this trying positiou than would otherwise be justifiable. Questions of order must be decided promptly, as they are raised generally without much opportunity for deliberation, and, consequently, whoever may occupy the chair, and however careful he "may be, mistakes must frequently be committed. But, fortunately, this house has at all times in ITS 

OVT2J HANDS the power to correct and preserve the integ rity and consistency of its practices, and I am sure you will not hesitate to exercise that power whenever the occasion may demand. Gentlemen, we are about to enter upon the work of an important session, more so, per haps, than any that has preceded it for many years. The political relations heretofore ex isting between the two sides of the house and the executive department of the government have been reversed, and this of itself imposes new duties and obligations on both. Under a popular form of government like ours a political change in the executive branch nec essarily, to a greater or less extent, involves altered methods of administration, inaugu rates a new legislative policy, and conse quently presents new questions for the con sideration of the people and their representa tives. It is probable, therefore, tliat many snhjects not heretofore prominent in our de liberations will engage a larger share of our attention during the present congress. It may reasonably be anticipated, also, that wide differences of opinion will exist on many of these questions, resulting in long, earnest, perhaps exciting contests, on the floor, and it may be that these differences will not always be defined by recognized party lines. TTnder these circumstances a proper appreciation of the integrity and patriotism of each other, a sincere respect for the honest opinion of opponents in de bate, and the cultivation of a spirit of mu tual 

FORBEARANCE WIIX BE NECESSARY to enable tho house to conduct its proceed ings with order and deliberation, and avoid unpleasant incidents, which are always, in my experience at least, most seriously re gretted by those who participate in them. The house is the only custodian of its own peace and dignity, and without cordial support no presiding officer can preserve either. And now, gentlemen, before taking tho oath of office, allow me to renew the expressions of my sincere acknowledgement of the great honor you have conferred, and the great trust you have confided to my hands. I ac cept both with a proper sense of the obliga tions they impose, and certainly with the earnest desire to discharge these obligations without prejudice to any public interest. [Loud and long-continued applause.] % THE 

OATH OF OFFICE was administered to him by Mr. Kelley of Pennsylvania. The clerk then proceeded to call the roll of members, who. as their names were called, appeared at the bar of the house and were sworn in by the speaker. No objection was raised to any member, and the ceremony was performed promptly and quietly. The election of otiicers of the house being then in order, the names of those selected by the Democratic caucus were presented by Mr. Tucker, while Mr. Cannon moved to amend by substituting the names of those chosen by the Republi can caucus. The amendment was rejected, and the gentlemen named on Mr. Tucker's resolution were elected by a viva voce vote. Thereupon they appeared at the bar of the house and qualified. On motion of Mr. Morrison of Illinois the clerk was directed to inform the senate that the house had organized and was ready to proceed witli business. On motion of Mr. Blount of Georgia the speaker was authorized to ap point a committee of three members to join a similar committee, appointed by the sen ate, to wait upon the president and inform him that the 

HOUSE nAI> ORGANIZED and was ready to receive any communica tion he might be pleased to transmit. Messrs. Blount, Randall and Reed were ap pointed as such committee. While waiting for the committees to report the house pro ceeded, on motion of Mr. Springer, Illinois, to save time to draw for seats. Mills of Texas asked unanimous consent that Mr, Kelley of Pennsylvania, the father of the house, be permitted to choose his seat in advance, but Mr. Bennett of North Caro lina objected, Mr. Reed thereupon sug gested that Mr. Kelley leave his desk and assured him that his wish would be re spected. The members then retired behind the row of desks and waited eagerly while a blindfolded man drew from a box the num bered marbles which corresponded to the numbers attached to their names. The first marble drawn was No. 237. and Stahluecker of New York proved to be the lucky man. He selected a seat on the Democratic side, a little to the left of the speaker's chair, and three rows from the front. Mr. Brecken ridge of Arkansas was the next fortunate one. and he took possession of HIS OLD DESK. The next dozeu names drawn were those of new members, and the faces of the older men lengthened as they saw their chances of securing prominent seats lessening. On the Democratic side, however, Mr. Warner of Ohio, Mr. McAdee of New Jersey, Mr. Springer and Mr. Eden of Illinois and Mr. Bland" of Missouri were all to secure good positions. The name of Mr. Mahoney of New York was called in time to allow that gentleman to obtain a front seat, but he contented himself with a seat far in the rear. Mr. Adams of New York locates on the main aisle directly in the rear of Mr. Weaver, Greenbacker, from lowa. Mr. Blount of Georgia was somewhat disap pointed in not being able to recover his old seat, but contented Himself with getting one in the same neighborhood. Mr. Randall was fortunate enough to secure his old posi tion, while Mr. Holmau got a commanding place. Pennsylvania was the fortunate state on the Republican side, Messrs. Neg lev, Harmer, Bingleyand Bain being among the first called. Mr. Cannon of Illinois chose a seat in Mr. Kelly's neighborhood, in close proximity to Messrs. Brown of Indi ana, Goff of West Virginia and Parker of New York. Mr. West of New York will strive to catch the speaker's eye from a seat on the front row. while Burrows of Michi gan will have to make the attempt from O>"E OF THE LAST ROWS. Mr. Payson of Illinois will expedite rail way legislation from his former desk, while Mr! Reed of Maine -will be obliged to take part in debate from a seat in the rear. Mr. McKinley of Ohio was able to secure a front seat but too far to the side, however, to be desirable. He was, however, more fortu nate than his colleague, Mr. Butterworth, who was releeated to the lastjrow, where ST. PAUL. TUESDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 8, 1885.— TEN PAGES. he was soon joined by Mr. Hiscock of New York. Messrs. Tucker of Virginia and Hewitt of New York were late in having their names drawn, but nevertheless secured rather good seats. Mr. Morrison also se cured a front seat somewhat nearer the center, while Mr. Tucker preferred a back seat on the main aisle. Among the last names called out was that of Mr. Kelly,and he took the seat which his hat and the courtesy of his fellow members had reserved for him. Messrs Long of Massachusetts and Fhelps of New Jersey were obliged to go far to the left, and finally located in Mr. MeKinley's neighborhood. Mr. Van Eaton of Mississippi was the first Democrat who 1 was obliged to look for a vesting place ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, i where he was soon joined by Messrs. Gib son of West Virginia and Townshend of i Illinois, the latter of whom was obliged last congress also to take a position among his political enemies. The last name called I was that of Mr. Geddes of Ohio. Mr. Holmau of Indiana then rose and said: Mr. Speaker: The melancholy duty has de volved upon me of anuouuclng to tho house that Thomas A. Hendricks, vice president of the United States, at his home in the city of Indianapolis, Ind., on the :?sth day of last month dt-parted this life. The death of this eminent citizen after a long period of public service, holding the second office in the gift of the people, with a reputation in public and private life of unsullied goodness, has occasioned a widespread expression of grief throughout tho whole of the Kepublic. Un doubtedly congress will at an early moment, acting through both of its houses, provide an occasion for a proper expression touching the life, character and public services of the de ceased. Out of respect to his memory I move that the house do now adjourn. The motion was agreed to unanimously, and accordingly the house adjourned. 

SPORTS AT. THE SEASIDE. O'Leary and "Weston Make a Start on Tlielr lion: Race. A Knock-Out on tlie Banks of Clear Lake — Notes. Doing's at New Tork. Special to the Globe. New York, Dec. 7. — The stake program book of Coney Island Jockey club is printed in colors, and it is a handsome af fair. There are blanks for nomination to fill up and keep for reference, and blanks to be filled and mailed for entry. The June meeting will commence Thursday, June 10, and continue each Saturday, Tuesday and Thursday until the end of the month. A stake for two -year-olds and one tor three-year-olds will be decided each day, and these will make the card attractive. The added money alone amounts to 830, -.000. The stakes will close Jan. 1. The autumn meeting will begin Saturday, Aug. 28. and close Sept. 21. The track will be faster and more elastic than it was the past season. The horses will not be stung by the flying sand and pebbles thrown by the feet, and brilliant sport will be witnessed. Edward Payson Weston and Daniel O'Leary started on their long walk of 2.500 miles this morning in the Metropolitan rink, Newark, N. J. The word was given by Mayor Hayues, who simply added: "May the best man win." O'Leary started off at the greatest pace, and Weston ex pects him to hold the lead for two weeks. Both of the pedestrians are remarkably well preserved for men who have passed through so many trying ordeals. Engage ments in New Jersey have been closed which will take up two weeks of their time. Then the walkers will go to New England, and from there will work toward the West. Weston poses as an example of temperance and O'Leary as the advocate of license. In the Ring 1 . A prize fight to the finish with hard gloves for §25 a side and gate receipts took place on the banks of Clear lake last Sunday be tween William Ryan of Cottage Grove and Patsy O'Maly of East St. Paul, and re sulted in the defeat of the latter. R. W. Edmondsou of Woodbury acted as second for Ryan, while T. F. McGuire, also of Woodbury, did like service for O'Maly. William Kenehan of Waseca acted as ref eree. The fight lasted for seven rounds, O'Maly being unable to respond when time was called for the eigluh. Both men were badly bruised, and the light was a question of O'Maly's wind against Ryan's blows. The former weighed 150 pounds, is 5 feet 9 inches high, while the latter weighed 145 pounds and is 5 feet 7)4 inches high. O'Leary in the Lead. Newark, N. J., Dec. 7.— The §2,500 pedestrian contest between Weston and O'Leary began here this morning. There was a fair attendance of spectators. Both men were in excellent condition. The rink was thirteen laps to the mile. Each man will walk twelve hours a day until Saturday night, when the walk will be continued elsewhere. O'Leary kept the lead all the afternoon and evening by a mile to a mile and a half. This evening little interest was shown in the race.not over one hundred and fifty persons being present. The contest closed for the night at 10:30 o'clock. O'Learv had then walked 54 and Weston 5*3 miles. The contest will be resumed at 10:30 a. m. to-morrow. Pnjji lists Sentenced. Rochester, N. V., Dec. 7. — Patrick and William Baker, the principals in a prize fight last August, were sentenced to-day to be imprisoned in the penitentiary for one year, and to pay a fine of S5OO each. This is the full extent of the law. ltnce at the Rink. This evening at the Jackson street roller rink, W. W. Woodside of Ireland on a bi cycle, and J. L. Alexander of Indiana will race three miles. Both are experts, and the race will no doubt bean interesting one. The start will be made at 9:30. Business of the Boat Club. At the meeting of the board of directors of the St. Paul Boat club held last evening C. H. Warren and H. F. Wood were elec ted active members. It was decided to give a club social at the Hotel Ryan on Wednesday, Dec. 16, to be limited to mem bers of the club only. The board placed or ders for two four-oared shells and two double-sclmll shells, one to be of cedar and one of paper. Patrick Eiran Talks. Liscols, Neb., Dec. 7. — Patriot Egan. president of the Irish National league of America, interviewed to-day regarding the report that Parnell will not attend the Chicago convention, and the statement that bitter dissensions exist in some of the Irish associations, which will probably lead to unpleasantness in the convention, said: The statement that Parnell will not attend is a mere conjecture. He has promised to come. I know he is anxious to come, and I believe he will come in any case. At least three of the very best men of the party will certainly be sent over. The statement that the lord mayor-elect of Dublin, T. D. Sulli van, Mr. Haley or T. P. O'Connor could not i come, as each had been elected for two con- ! stituencies, is absurd. The new parliament j will meet about the second Thursday of Feb- ; ruary, and whoever comes over will have ■ ample time to get back by that time. With \ regard to the reported fationism, I have only to say there are seme differences amongst Irish- Americans, just as there are j in various American party organiza- i rions, but, fortunately they are con- j flDed almost entirely to New York. I Taking the Irish-American element as a whole it is united on this Irish national ques tion as it has never before been, and I have every reason to expect that the approaching 1 convention at Chicago will be— as every other convention since the commencement of this movement has been — a model of order, self respect, harmony and patriotic devotion." Robert Browning has been elected to sue- ; ceed Lord Kay as president of the associated '■. societies of Edinburgh university. A 

CROTON COLLAPSE. Four Men Lose Their Liyes in an Aque duct at Merritt's Corners, New York. Terrible Suffering of Passengers From a Wrecked Canadian Pacific Train. A Row at a Hanging at Williamsburg, Ky.—Burras Held in the Sam of $10,000 Bail. Three Negroes Hanged for Burglary- - A Very Valuable Find Be neath a Barn. Death in an Aqueduct. Mekritt's Corners, N. V., Dec. 7. — Another accident has happened on the new Croton aqueduct. It occurred early this morning at Shaft No. 3 and resulted in the death of four men and the probable fatal injury of a tiftli. The men were descend ing to work in one of the buckets used for lowering them down the shaft. The start was made all right, but before the bucket had descended many feet the cross beam, or "quilly," as it is called, caught on the shaft and remained fast until the bucket had almost reached the bottom of the shaft, when it shook loose and came crashing on the heads of the unfortunate men. The following men were instantly killed: FRANCES CABR, single. FREDRICK DRESSER, single. LORENZO BOBBINS, married, leaves a wife and f umily at Hibernia, N. J. PATRICK MORAN, married. John Boardman, the other unfortunate man, will probably die of his injuries. When the cross beam struck the bucket he was knocked out, but in his descent, tell on a shelving construction near the bottom and on the side of the shaft. This in all proba bility saved him from instant death. Wreck on the Canadian Pacific. Toroxto, Dec. 7. — Through passengers east from Winnipeg arrived here last night by the Canadian Pacific railway brought de tails of a terrible railway accident that hap pened to a train by which they were travel ing on Friday last. The train was nearing Ludbury Junction, east of Port Arthur. A rail, which had become loosened in some manner, spread, causing the train to go down a deep embankment. The stoves be ing overturned, set tire to all the cars, most of which were well filled with passengers, many of whom were injured, and some fa tally burned. The whole train was a com plete wreck. The baggage and mail cars and one of the passenger cars were totally burned. The passengers succeeded in put ting out the fire in the other cars. The ac cident happened in a desolate part of the country, and being unable to find a place of shelter, suffered very much from cold, and men, women and children who escaped from the sleeper in their night clothes, were obliged to remain sitting in the snow for an hour or more, the thermometer being below zero at the time. They were saved from being frozen by keeping near the burning wreck till assistaoce arrived. The Chicago Fire. Chicago, Dee. 7.— Shortly after mid night a fire was discovered in Cribben & Sexton's stove warehouse, a five-story brick building at the corner of Erie and Town send streets, filled with stoves. Before any engines could get to work the building was a mass of flames. Tbe p .ve was difficult to fight, as the building was protected by iron shutters at all the windows, and the fire men had great trouble in getting at the blaze. The fire soon went through the roof, and floor after floor suuk under the great weight of the iron stock and the walls fell. The west wall fell onto G. B. Page's oil warehouse, in which were stored 3,000 barrels of lard oil. By the strenuous efforts of the firemen the flames were kept down and the only damage done was to the roof of the building and to a part of one wall. The damage to the oil warehouse is about $500 and to stock about SI, 000. Several small frame houses were badly scorched. The stove warehouse is a five-story brick building, having a frontage on Erie street of 150 feet and running back 100 feet. It was erected at a cost of $30,000, and was insured for its full value. Mr. Sexton placed the amount of stock stored in the building at §25,000, and stoves worth nearly §200,000. They were insured for about $150,000. A large amouut of valu able wood patterns stored there, worth §35,000, will be a total loss. The insurance on this stuff was about §25,000. The ma chinery in use was expensive and could not be replaced for less than $25, 000 and was fully insured. Only two accidents occurred, although dozens of firemen were often in imminent danger from the overhanging walls. When one wall fell John Haunon and Ed Cadmore, firemen, were injured, the latter suffering a fracture of the leg. An UnlticKy Assignee. Cincinnati, Dec. 7. — It has been ascer tained to-day that the assets of Archbishop Pursell, the assignment having been men tioned in these dispatches heretofore as re duced by shrinkage in values of stocks bought by Assignee Mannix by order of the court, are made less by the direct action of the assignee himself. Mr. Mannix now says that the former statement, placing the burden on the court, was an effort to shield him, which he had not asked and did not authorize. He says there was an order of the court to invest the proceeds of one sale in Southern railroad lands. There was a loss on them, and he undertook to retrieve it by other investments. More losses and more ventures followed, until now the de ficit is nearly 8200,000. The bulk of this will fall upon his bondsmen, who are able to make it good. Mr. Mannix has always been of high reputation at the bar. Held in $10,000 Bail. Special to the Globe. Chicago, Dec. 7— The case of A. J. Burrus, who has been under arrest since Oct. 28, charged with an attempt to murder Mrs. Eey Goode and Miss Lilian Walters, employes at Dun's commercial agency on Monroe street, was called for the fourth time in the armory police court this morn ing. The prisoner, who is confined in jail, did not appear in person, but his attorney was on hand and said he would waive ex amination in both cases. Neither Mrs. Goode nor Miss Walters was able to appear, and both were reported to be still in a criti cal condition. Burrus was held to the criminal ceurt in bail of 810,000 in the case of Mrs. Goode and without bail in the case of Miss Walters, the woman who is con sidered the most dangerously wounded of the two. A Nebraska Fire. Special to the Globe. Wilbeb, Neb.. Dec. 7. — Just before daybreak this morning a fire was discovered in the saloon of W. B. Kokufl, adjoining a large two-story brick brewery, also owned Iby him. The flames spread rapidly and, j owing to the complete absence of fire ap i paratus and water supply, had by 6 o'clock ' entirely destroyed the saloon, brewery and : KokufFs residence. The loss is estimated at 522.000, and there was not a dollar of in surance on the property. Several thousand i dollars worth of beer in stock is included in I the loss. The brewery was Wilber'a chief industry, and it will be rebuilt Tbe Brooklyn Bridge Disaster. New York, Dec. 7. — Conductor Myers of the Brooklyn bridge cars, who was in jured in the accident of Saturday, will prob ably die. The others injured are doing well. The accident did not decrease the car traffic Saturday. There were more than 60,000 car passengers on that day. The bridge engineers think the wheels of the train were brought to a stand still, but that the second train slid down the wet track on the steep grade into collision. They assert that if the brakes on the second train had not worked at all there would have been a great loss of life. Row at a Hanging. Louisville, Dec. 7.— A Courier-Journal special says: James Early was hanged this afternoon at Williamsburg, Ky.. in the presence of 1,000 people. He was resigned to his fate and said he believed the Lord would forgive him for killing Leander Law son. He ascended the scaffold without a tremor. Some of the crowd were very drunk and laughed and joked, and a great many of them tried to climb the scaffold. The guards pushed them back, and then threats to tear the scaffold down were made. A row was started and two shots fired. The second shot struck Alia Sharp, colored, in the head, making a bad scalp wound. The women screamed, and for a time there was great excitement, but very soon perfect or der was restored. Early was asked if he had anything to say, and he replied "No, I am ready whenever you are." He died in twenty minutes from strangulation. The crime for which Early was hung was com mitted some months ago, when he entered a school taught by Leander Lawson and created a disturbance. Early was drunk and was put out. He returned and shot and killed Lawson. Thoughtful of the Sheriff. New York, Dec. 7. — Ex-Policeman Kennedy of Brooklyn, who escaped from jail July 13, directly after his conviction for betraying Miss Martha H. Wood under promise of marriage, is back in jail in that city. The sheriff found Kennedy in Mon treal, and the latter, upon learning that the sheriff would be responsible for many thou sands of dollars because of his escape, vol untarily returned to suffer, as he said, for a crime he never committed, rather than have the sheriff put to any loss. Over $100,000 Under a Barn. Mansfield, 0., Dec. 7. — Joseph Hos dowitch, defaulting teller of the Farmers' National bank, who returned from Canada, had agreed to show the bank officials where large quantities of the bank's securities were hidden. He took them last night to a barn, beneath the foundation of which were found two tin boxes containing upwards of 5100,000 worth of papers and bonds. He then directed them to the vault behind the bank and from that they fished out papers amounting in value to $300,000. Haneed for Bursrlary. Kaleigh, N. C, Dec. 7.— To-day at Gatesville, the county seat of Gates county, three negroes, John Swanney, Isaac Kich ardson and Edward Saunders, were hanged for the crime of burglary committed last September at a country store. They robbed the store of considerable money and goods, and, being heavily armed, overawed the clerk. Into the Sea. Havana, Dec. 7. — Miss Susan Morse, a daughter of Samuel F.B. Morse, inventor of the telegraph, while en route to this place.'on the Spanish mail steamer, disappeared shortly before the arrival of the vessel. It is supposed she threw herself into the sea in a temporary fit of mental aberration. ■ CESSATION OF THE SCPPIY. Pennsylyanians Inconvenienced by the Failure of Gas Supply. Pittsburg, Pa., Dec. 7. — Quite a com motion was created among the consumers of natural gas throughout two cities to-day by a sudden cessation of the supply of fuel. There was lively scampering about to se cure coal, and dusky diamonds were in great demand again. Many consumers were un able to build coal (ires in time to keep up the proper temperature of their houses, and in consequence indulged in angry com plaints. Hundreds of families had to re sort to laundry stoves for cooking purposes or eat cold meals. Several factories sus pended work, clerks in business houses wore overcoats and scholars in the public schools, where natural gas was used, were dismissed. The shortage in the supply is attributed to inadequate pipeage, the de mand being much larger than usual on ac count of the cold snap. The gas company will connect with a twenty-four-inch main from Murrayville Wednesday, and after that there will be no more trouble. WENT SUPPERLESS TO BED. Pittsburg, Pa., Dec. 7. — From 1 o'clock yesterday afternoon until 10 o'clock last night the towns of Beaver Falls and New Brighton were cut off entirely from natural gas to make connections with the Rochester main. The weather was intensely cold and much suffering and inconvenience resulted. Many families went to bed to keep warm, or to their neighbors', who still use the old fashioned fuel coal. No suppers could be cooked, and restaurants using coal did a land-oflice business. Hotel guests aban doned the hotels and churches held no evening service. Manufacturers running at night had to shut down, and it is thought considerable loss will be experienced at the glass houses and pottery from the cooling of pots and kilns. At 10 o'clock the gas was turned on and many got out of bed to cook suppers. A New Torpedo. Special to the Globe. Michigan City, IntL, Dec. 7. — Capt. J. A. Howell and Lieut. A. R. Conden of the United States navy have been in the city for several weeks experimenting with a submarine torpedo invented and patented by Capt. Howell. The results have improved from the beginning, and the accidents sup posed to be inseparable from new work have in most instances been overcome, so that there has really been a steady advance from the first. Twenty-four trials have been made with varying speed. The torpedo, which is the only one of the kind ever invented, is expected to aid very materially in ef fective warfare. A speed of eighteen miles per hour for 200 yards was obtained with an extreme range of over 500 yards, while perfect direction has been combined with great regularity of submergence. The torpedo is cigar-shaped and weighs 248 pounds, carrying forty pounds of charge. The extreme length is 9 feet, diameter 14^ inches, shell of galvanized iron 1.32 of an inch in thickness. Got. Cameron's Message. Richmond, Va.,Dec. 7. — Gov. Cameron sent his message to the legislature to-day. It is devoted almost exclusively to state matters. In the matter of the public debt he reiterates his previous expressions in in dorsement of the Riddleberger bill, believ ing that every consideration, moral and legal, was met by the plan for funding the debt made in that statute. The amount of debt outstanding (other than the Riddle berger bonds, principal and interest, to Oct. 1, 1885, is 530,752.282. The governor recommended the purging of the election laws by the passage of an act making it mandatory that judges of election shall be chosen from both political parties, and that the representatives of opposing candidates shall be present when the votes are counted. November Fire Losses, New York, Dec. 7.— The New York Daily Commercial of to-morrow will esti mate the loss by fire in the United States and Canada during November at $7,500, -000. Although this is 83,500,000 more than the average November fire waste of the previous ten years taken together, it is en couraging as being less by 81,000.000 than the figures of November, 1884, and §4,400, -000 less than those of November, 1883. Moreover. August; September and October have shown a smaller fire loss than the average of those months in ten previous years, so that in spite of the increased se verity of fires in the first six months of the current year it now looks as if :, 1885 would enable insurance companies to ■. at least come out even on the year's business. Thus far, up to Dec. 1, the aggregate i fire loss foots up $85,000,000. ..:• The Bulletin gives a list of 124 fires of $10,000 and ' up wards in , : November. There were eight fires whose reported loss was $100,000 or more, their aggregate reaching $3,500,000, or nearly 47 per cent, of the total Novem ber losses. ,%•:,'<■•;' r.V" THE 

EASTERN BLIZZARD. The Performances of tho Storm King to the East Vm. ■■■ New York, Dec. — A Northwest bliz zard struck the city about 1:30 this morn ing. Ten minutes before that hour the sky was perfectly clear and the weather tran quil, with the thermometer at about. the freezing point The wind, which blew at the rate of fifty miles per hour, was accom panied by a blinding snowfall. The ther mometer ran down quickly into, the twen ties, and, though the snow soon abated, the wind continued very high. The telegraph, which has suffered considerably, advised us of the nearer and nearer approach of .the hurricane. A dispatch from Boston says: Capt. Martin, keeper of the • Minet's Lodge lighthouse, was able to leave his post yes terday for the first time since the great storm or last week. The storm was sur passed in violence only by the great one of 1851, when the first Minet's Lodge light house was carried away. No other light house .in the world is so exposed to the mercy of the sea and the wind. The pin nacle of the structure towers nearly two hundred feet above the waves, and the tre mendous seas last week dashed fifty feet above the peak. AT CHICAGO. Chicago, Dec. 7.— The frightful gale swept the lakes Friday night was followed yesterday by another of almost equal vio lence this morning. Fears are entertained for the safety of every vessel known to have been caught out in the storm, and it is generally predicted that many disasters will be heard from. The wind was blowing from the west yesterday until about noon, when it gradually began to work around to the northwest and increase in violence. By dark a terrific northerly gale was blowing, the average velocity of the wind being esti mated at fifty miles per hour. With the shifting of the wind the sea began to make, and at midnight a tremendous sea had been worked up, the waves dancing high into the air, completely submerging the breakwaters in the outer harbor. The weather was bit ter coid, and tiie frigidity of the tempera ture was made more aggravating by the tierce wind. Furious snow squalls swept up the lake in rapid succession, and at times it was impossible to see the end of the piers from the top of the life-saving station. The few vessels arriving reported an unusually severe trip. In each case the vessels were covered with ice from stem to stern, and their crews were worn out from exhaustion and exposure. The schooner Morning Star has> arrived with a cargo of lumber from Manistee. During the severe gale of Satur day she put into Milwaukee harbor, but found it little better than the open sea, as the river had risen several feet and broken vessels from their moorings, and they were swinging around to the imminent danger of shipping and the bridges. AT DETKOIT. Detboit, Dec. 7. — The storm of the past two days has been almost unparalled in its severity. Old lake men, who . have been on the lakes for the last \. quarter of a century, say it is heavier than they have ever known. Fears are entertained for the safety of every vessel known to have been out in the gale. The propeller Sanilac left Cleveland Friday night and . it had been reported that she was wrecked north of Cleveland. This morning J. B. Baker, her Detroit agent, received a dispatch stating that she is safe at Black ' River, twenty miles above Cleveland, where she ran in for shelter. ::-i I^ J :5 lOWA PUBLICANS. . The Sherman-Brown Imbroglio Growing Interesting:. Special to the Globe. . /" r \™ Burlington, la., Dec. 7. — matter that is bothering the heads of the Repub lican leaders is the Sherman-Brown im broglio. Brown, it will be remembered, was suspended by Gov. Sherman last March on account of alleged irregularities by the latter in the examination into the condition of the insurance companies of the state. The matter was taken to the supreme court, which sustained the governor's action, but expressing, at the same time, the opinion that it was the governor's duty to fully investigate the charges against the auditor, and to reinstate him if the charges were not sustained. No action has been taken by the governor since, and now Brown's friends go so far as to demand that Governor-elect Lar rabee shall not be inaugurated until Gov. Sherman's action in this matter is inquired into, some even going so far as to demand his impeachment. Sherman's friends, on the other hand, oppose any action in the case of either Gov. Sherman or Governor elect Larrabee, but insist that the matter shall be left entirely to the legislature. The coming session of the legislature promises to be a lively one, and if there is not con siderable hair-pulling in the Republican ranks the signs are very deceptive. A bad break in the Republican ranks of lowa seems not improbable, and many staunch Republicans are already looking with much apprehension to 1888._ Can't Do It Consistently. Special to the Globe. New York, Dec. 7. Senator Palmer of Maryland, when asked about the coming session, replied: "A man can only speculate at this stage, and wo are so close at the door of the session that It is hardly worth while to guess." "What are you going 1 to do about confirm ing 1 appointments?" "I think that we shall have to stand upon some broad and general ground, and confirm and reject all appointments on some agreed upon basis. For instance, we may say that we will not confirm any appointees where the man removed had not served out the full time for which he was appointed. We could go be fore the country safely with work under such a rule. We can't confirm one man and reject another, whose case was exactly parallel without creating the suspicion that we are at work purely on personal or selfish grounds. , Where a man is removed for hav ing been an offensive partisan I am in favor of requiring proof to be adduced and the wit ness brought forward. There will be some queer developments in that event. Then I think that where an offensive . partisan is ap pointed to office on the removal -of a man charged with some patriotic crime, we should not by any means confirm the new man.' We can't do it consistently." Still Sijjns of life. Special to the Globe. Pana, 111., Dec. 7.— The wife of Fletcher Anderson, a farmer living three miles east of here, was supposed to have died sud denly yesterday morning under the follow ing circumstances: Having called her son to start the fire, and having pointed out to him the paper rack where he could get paper, she fell back on her pillow, appar ently dead. She had not yet left her bed. The body was prepared for the funeral, which was set for 10 o'clock this morning, but owing to signs of life in the body, which does not yet grow cold, the husband refuses to allow the funeral to take place until assured that his wite is really dead. The case has excited much interest. manning's Annual. Washington, Dec. 7. — The secretary of the treasury to-day transmitted to con gress the estimates of appropriations re quired for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1887.
