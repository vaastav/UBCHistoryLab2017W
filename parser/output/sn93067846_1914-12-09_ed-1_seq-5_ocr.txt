COHCBESS SESSION OPENS. CHtRCTlFS A KD WOMKN WOULD FORIUD POLYGAMY. Ovalkm to Speaker Champ Clark In the House? final Session of This Congress. Washington. Dec. 7.?The final ses? sion of the Sixty-third congress open ad today In the senate. Memorials were received from many churches and women's clubs, urging the adop? tion of a constitutional amendment prohibiting polygamy. In the house Speaker Clark received a great ova? tion. Washington. Dec. C.?The third session of the Sixty-third congress will be convened at noon tomorrow. Members of both houses Hocked to Washington today, ending the'.r holi day recess of six weeks which fol? lowed the long session that closed late In October. Democratic leaders unani? mously express the hope that the leg? islative programme of appropriation measures can be concluded by March 4 next when the present congress au? tomatically will end. Many Republi? can leaders, however, have said they would urge many Important meas? ures and some Indicated that supply bills ought to be delayed to such an extent that an extra session next spring and summer would be neces? sary. Democrats think an extra ses? sion unlikely. Administration leaders await eager? ly the message of President Wilson which will be delivered Tuesday for a definite outline of the president's wishes for legislation. Already, how? ever, they have prepared for some things generally expected to be press? ed before adjournment. Conservation measures for which there is strong support include the general water power and land leasing hills. The bill to pave ths way for Phil? ippine lr dependence, which passed the house at the last session, is pending. Another Important measure pending m the senate Is the Immigration bill with ths literacy test for aliens which has passed the house. Some majority lealers have declared that It will be permitted M die with the expiring congress, to be considered when con? ditions resulting from the European war have sssumed more definite snap* Rural credits legislation is pend? ing. This legislation, however, also Is on ths list of measure administra? tion leaders are understood not to want to press at this time. At least seven of the great annual supply measures of congress are to ho rushed so as to report them to the house before tHe Christmas holidays. Others are to be hastened through to head off the necessity, if possible, of an extra session. When tho house convenes the bus? iness before it will be the postponed financial relief for the cotton States. Representative Hei.ry, chairman of the rules committee, said he Is pre? pared to renew his fight for tho $110, 000.000 otton currency bill as a sub? stitute for a currency measure for enlarging the amount of currency that can be used on commercial paper, a measure the federal reserve board and Democratic leaders have agreed is no longer necessary. Chairman Glass of the house cur? rency committee, who pressed this commercial paper bill at tho last ses? sion, has abandoned his efforts. In? dications are that the cotton proposi? tion will be defeated. A conference of Southern senators and representatives will bo hold Monday night or Tues? day morning to discuss the subject. Members already in Washington have informally discussed the mili? tary situation, particularly agitation startet! by Representative Gardner of Massachusetts for an investigation into the preparedness of the United States for war. Representative Gardner's resolution for investigation has been pending in the house since tho latter part of the last session. Senator Lodge of Massachusetts plans to introduce a similar resolution in the senate. Ad? ministration leaders and the president are said to oppose the resolution, ar? guing that all acts relating to the con? dition of the army and navy arc known or are obtainable. Appropriations for the army and navy will further open debate on the military situation. Both the house military and naval com? mittees have been at work on supply bills and will continue daily sessions. In the naval committee the battle? ship construction programme is the chief subject. Secretary Daniels will appear before the committee during the week to discuss the building pro? gramme and naval requirements. Champions of increased naval con? struction are certain to urge a three or ?our battleship programme, the erection of more torpedo boats and submarines and increased outlays for aviation work. Rivers and harbors appropriations, greatly curtailed at the last session, will be pressed again, but it is not likely, according to party leaders, that new projects will be urged. Another measure which will occupy much of the session's attention will be the ship purchase bill, which, it is understood, will he Included In the administration programme. Constitutional amend? ments for suffrage and national pro? hibition also are pending. "President Wilson Is for my cotton warehouse bill and it will pass the house," declared Representative Cover of South Carolina tonight. He added that Chairman Henry of the rules committee would report tomor IOW a rule to consider it; that com? mittee already having agreed to It. The bill is a substitute for a similar measure that passed the senate and is designed to make the purpose of the legislation more cloiir. "I have no doubt," Mr. Lever said, "that the estimates of various con? gressional committees show large In? creases over last year. The Increase in the estimates of tho secretary of agri? culture to congress tomorrow aggre? gating $200,706,000 constitutes an in? crease of $840,000 and this increase probably is the lowest of the 1 ig ap piopiiatlon drafts. The bill probably Will not provide the money needed for the suppression of the live stock foot and mouth disease epidemic but a sep ? arate bill probably will be reported to tho house with an appropriation ag giegating $2,500,000."
