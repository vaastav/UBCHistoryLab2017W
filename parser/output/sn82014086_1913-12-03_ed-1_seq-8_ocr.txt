CRAIG PICTURED AS A PERSECUTED MAN Attorney for Defense Attacks Case of Prosecution. Shelbyville, Ind., Dec. 2 The defense begun today in the trial of Dr. William B. Craig for the murder of Dr. Helen Knabe. At the morning session a vig orous assault was directed against the state's case, as outlined yesterday. In a three hour defense by Henry N. Spaan, of counsel for the accused man. Dr. Craig was held to be a persecuted man, who not only could establish a reputation for clean living through the testimony of one hundred witnesses, but who also could produce other wit nesses to swear that he was elsewhere until a late hour at least, on the night he is alleged to have killed Dr. Knabe in her flat. When the prosecution again assumed the aggressive, at the afternoon session and 'began the introduction of witness es in support of its case, the defense met the attack boldly. The hypothesis of murder on the one side was pitted against the suicide theory on the other and when the day ended there was no testimony before the jury to show by what means Dr. Knabe came to her death. Four physicians this afternoon testi fied that they had been summoned to Dr. Knabe's apartment on the morn ing her body was found. They des cribed the wounds that caused the woman's death. The state has con tended that the wound on the left arm was received by Dr. Knabe in an effort to ward off the blow dealt by her slay er. According to the defense theory, she Inflicted the wound on herself in the convulsion of the death struggle. On cross examination, none of the wit nesses would say that the cut might have been made that way. A paring knife found "on the chif fonier, bore no bloodstains the wit nesses testified. No other instruments by means of which the fatal wound might have been made have been dis covered. PROPERTY DESTROYED BY POSTAL EMPLOYES. Spite Work Because of Refusal to In crease Their Wages.
