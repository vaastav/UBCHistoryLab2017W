WILSON ACTIVITY I ISNOWPREDICTED Leaders of Both Parties in Congress View Him as Political Factor. CHALLENGE BY PRESIDENT Unwarranted Statements Made About Clemenceau Visit. > Pnnli "Snnh" TTpnipH. BV JOHN EDWIN NEVIN. Woodrow Wilson is expected to bo- j come a very active factor in national j affairs long- before next summer rolls j firound. That was the declaration here yes- i terclay of republican and democratic congressional leaders alike. It followed careful analysis of the address of President Warren (1. Harding to ?*ongress in which he dealt with more "live dynamite" than any other chief executive in the nation's history. : The President threw down the gauntlet to the former administration as well as to his own party critics, and democrats insisted that, inasmuch as Mr. Wilson's health is vastly improved. he can be relied on to accept the challenge. Of course, no one know just what i Mr. Wilson plans do except him- I self. When his devoted wife, who he I admits is a wonderful nurse, was in P.altimoTe on Thursday attending a "democratic jubilee." she was asked probably a score of times whether Mr. Wilson ever again would become an active candidate tor the presidency, lake the diplomat that she is, she j Very smilingly evaded any direct re- i Idy. i That is where the situation rests now. The distinguished author of the league of nations covenant and of | the "fourteen points of peace'* so far lias refused to let the public see what is in his mind. Kv?*n though his health is getting better daily there has not" oonie in any official manner even a suggestion that he is ready to take a public position on current events, always, of course, excepting his Armistice day address and the several notes that he has sent to party leaders touching on why he believed the Tecent election turned out as it did. Unwarranted Statement*. Certain persons who have claimed to be in position to "interpret" his views have suggested how he stood. Hut even these "inspired" suggestions j have failed to bring any positive dec- I laration from him. Kecause of this. \ various statements have been made i regarding the visit of M. Georges Clemenceau to the former President. Most of these as a matter of fact have been unwarranted. The quarter-hour chat was extremely personal, in that it dealt with the men themselves instead of with the subject dearest to their minds. "World problems were not brought up. but M. Clemenceau did recall certain humorous episodes of their relations in France, and Mr. Wilson told the j "Tiger" a couple of new stories. I So far as M. Clemenceau was con- ! cerned, he was disturbed by the sug- j gestions that Mr. Wilson did not de- } sire him to visit him. This feeling! was intensified by the declaration j that when Marshal Foch tried to visit the ex-President a year ago, | during the progress of the naval I armament conference, he was snubbed, j As? a matter of fact the exact truth I regarding the now world-famous j "snub" was obtained yesterday. Noth- | ins took place along the lines that were i broadcast at the time, but for personal reasons no effort ever was made J by Mr. Wilson to set at rest, the untrue report. It can be stated that there was neither snub nor thought of snub. Mr. and Mrs. Wilson did expect to receive the allied commander-in-chief, but they had failed to set any date for the expected visit. When Marshal Foch reached Washington he told a member of his party one morning that he wanted to go out and visit Mr. Wilson immediately. The individual consulted ordered the automobiles at the disposal of the Krench commander-in-chief around j to the Willard Hotel and a start was i made for the S street residence. ! ( Had Indigestion Attack. j - uiuui an noiir earner Air. wnson had been seized with an attack of indigestion and his physicians were railed in. When the Foch party reached the S street house there was nobody downstairs but a secretary and member of the Wilson household. When the door bell rans it was opened by the secretary, who does not speak French. Marshal Foch and two members of his party presented their cards. They were told that Mr. Wilson was indisposed. Cards were deposited and the party left. ; More than an hour afterward Mr. Wilson issued orders that should the French marshal call he would receive him in his bedroom. But it was not until forty-eight hours later that it ' was learned that the party had been 1 there and had departed. 'That is the only basis for the snub report, it was explained yesterday. ] The real facts were that both the former President and Mrs. Wilson had expected to receive the French hero in the most informal fashion, i but this was made impossible by the ; failure of those in charge of the visit to consult any one in authority at the 1 Wilson home. The Olemenceau visit, following: on Mr. Wilson's Armistice day address, has served to emphasize that in any plans or preparations for the next < national campaign the attitude of Mr. Wilson himself will have to be taken Into consideration. With returned health he must be consulted by the party leaders, it is declared. (Copyright. 1022.) accuSIbeath of closestfriend Jly the Associated Press. BAY 

CITY. Mich.. December 9.?Arraignment of Harold II. Mendell. forty-two, charged with the slaying of his closest friend, Rollin Morgan, thirty-five, whose body was recovered from the Kawkawlin river August 9 last. u*ns nnstnnnprl lata tnrlav until Monday. Mendell is being held incommunicado at the county jail. An admonition to investigate Morgan's death, received at the sheriff's office from an unidentified woman, led to the charge against Mendell, according to Sheriff Theodore Trudell. The sheriff said the woman filled while he was absent and told Mrs. Trudell Morgan's death might not have been accidental. Morgan's body was disinterred. Physicians skid he had not been cirownea, Dut tnat a diow on the temple had rendered Morgan unconscious and that he had died from suffocation. That Mendell was in love with Morgan's wife is an angle of the case the prosecutor's office is investigating. it was announced. The Morgan and Mendell families are ^aid to have been much together. Mrs. Morgan left here shortly after her husband's funeral and is said to have joined her parents in Albuquerque, N. M. Morgan was the father of three rhildren, the eldest seven years old.

Schneider of 2309 Wisconsin avenue northwest started on a spectacular, driver less run backward down Pennsylvania avenue from 15th to 14th streets about 8 o*clock last r.ight. Policeman E. K. Shelton of the first precinct jumped to the running board and stopped it. Experiencing self-starting trouble, Schneider proceeded to turn the engine over by hand, forgetting to pif.ee the gear-shift lever in "neutral." The engine started and immediately the automobile began moving backward in a remarkably straight line down the Avenue, attaining a speed of about fifteen | miles an hour.

URGE PARTY MEETING i Declaring the republican party in New York appears to have "lost contact with the people." Representatives Luther Mott and Hamilton Fish, jr.. of that state, announced last night that a letter was being drafted to j Republican State Chairman Georire i K. Morris, requesting him to call a | conference of their party, with a view I to lining it up behind "certain pro- j gressive measures." The two representatives said a number of their colleagues in Washington had indicated h desire to sign the letter, which would suggest that j New York republican congressmen.! legislators, county chairmen and l state committeemen be invited to at- \ tend the meeting and consider the advisability of urging the state legislature to support "the statewide primaries, reorganization of the state government and genuine home rule measures, with reference to the transit situation, etc." "The younger element in the party will not follow or remain in if the old reactionary leaders and policies are to dominate." said a statement issued by the two representatives. "Some of the party leaders are under the suspicion of being controlled by the corporations and this influence must be wiped out before the party can regain the faith of the voters. The party must make every effort to show its good faith by supporting progressive legislation at Albany and Washington." i? One-carat b 1 u ewhite a b s o lutely perfect diamond.

BLAZE LAIDTORREBUGS 2,500 Homeless in Astoria, Ore.?Relief Work Begun. 14 Looters Nabbed. liv tlio Associated Press. ASTORIA, Ore., I>eceinber 0.?Astoria today surveyed its losses from the $12,000,000 fire which yesterday razed twenty-four bloeks of the city's business section and set on foot measures to relieve the 2,f?00 persons made homeless by the eonilagration. Mayor Urcnuur yesterday expressed the opinion the lire was incendiary and could be charged to "radicals.*' Chief of Police Carlson concurred in this belief. "I am certain that radicalism is responsible," said the mayor. "Of course, there will be a more thorough investigation than has been possible. When it is over, 1 am sure it will He established that the fire was set." The town of Astoria grew from piles built far out into the water. The piles originally were extended into the deep water to accommodate vessels which otherwise would have had t<? anchor out in the harbor. The business district grouped itself close to the docks. The residential section was built on higher ground. With the heart of the citv in still smoldering ruins, plans for rebuilding were nebulous, but it was the general sentiment that reconstruction on a larger and more substantial scale would start as soon as the more immediate relief needs were supplied. Rain fell today on the ruins, helpins: the firemen quench the smoldering: remnants of the blaze. One report was that the fire broke out in a poolroom at one side of the Beehive department store, and shortly afterward another fire was discovered on the otheT side of that store. Investigators today said this might be accounted for by the flantes spreading- under the piling on which the building was erected. "If the tire was of incendiary origin it was a pure case of arson." said J. Dewitt Gilbert, news editor of the Astoria Budget. "I do not believe that th*?re is any ground f*.r attributing the fire to radicals. The industrial situation at Astoria has not been disturbed. There have been some agitators here, but there had been no strike." "I believe a man should give his wife plenty of rope." "That's what I did with mine, and she skipped."?Exchange.
