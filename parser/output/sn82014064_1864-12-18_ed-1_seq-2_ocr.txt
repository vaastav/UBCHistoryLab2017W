Wc submit that it comes -with a bad grace 'from* paper published in Central Illinois to be talking about the disposition of “our friends ” in this section of the State to “ fur nish occupants for all the offices to be filled, either by the people or the Legislature™ That portion of the State -which the Spring* field Journal peculiarly represents,- has fur-~ nlshed exactly six times as many candidates on - the Republican ticket as Northern Illinois, and three ■ times as - many* -as . Northern Illinois and. Southern HIM nols together. We. might mention the feet that Northern- Illinois has furnished in each instance the necessary votes to over* come the Democratic majority in Central Tin, nols, and to elect the candidates of that mod est section. Senator Trumbull was elected from Southern Illinois twice—once before the Republican party wps formed, and once after ?waid; Mr. Lincoln was nominated as a can didate for Senator from Central Illinois in 1858, but wos.not elected. .We do not aliude.to these fects by way of complaint,hat by way oM vindication.' Wc have no geographical affinities or antipathies 'in the matter. The Republicans of Northern Illinois are actuated by higher considerations, as their behavior during the past eight years ahundimtly proves. Bat it must not he pre sumed that they arc therefore ready to toler ate the imputation of a. grasping spirit like that which the Stale -Journal seeks to -put upon them. • . CHICAGO BITCH. Wc_ publish elsewhere a cogent appeal,, from oucof our most sagacious citizens, for, the immediate initiation of a movement for cleansing the river', and thereby purifying the air we breathe and the water we drink. We commend it to the earnest attention of cveiy man whose health and property arc hound up in the well-being of Chicago. The necessity of the work is universally admitted. It only remains to begin. Here is the great sticking point. To overcome the Ht inertia In the public mind on this subject has been exceed ingly difficult. Wo have urged the regenera tion of the river these many years, and wo have seen its foulness grow more formidable and Intolerable each- season, until the pesti lence which wc have so long tempted cannot, as We firmly believe, bo fkr from our doors. There must Jte enough latent force existing among us after all the discussion, and espe - dally all tho experience, wo have had on this subject, to put the work through, if wo can only find a starting place. To make such a beginning is the object of the writer of the communication to which wc refer. A public meeting is the first suggestion .. made, and it is unquestionably the proper step to be taken to initiate the movement. If that shall not be effectual—if it shall not give reasonable grounds for the expectation that the city authorities will take the matter energetically in hand—then let it be made a prominent issue of the next, and of all sue* cecdlng city elections, until we can actually . see' pure water flowing under our. bridges. Differences ot opinion must arise as to the most economical and efficient means of ac complishing the work. It is desirable that such differences should .exist,, because the most thorough discussion is. necessary to se cure the most excellent plan. Wo must dif fer from one of the views, or more properly suggestions, of the writer of the communica tion referred to,' We believe we cannot afford to banish the industrial .establishments from /which issue the principal streams of imparity which afflict the river. We think the city can hettej* afford to bring its drinking water rom Evanston than to drive the packing •houses-: to St.- Louis,' and ‘ that ail Mother ‘ remedies should be applied, before we contemplate a policy which shall not only expel a largo source of wealth-and population, but. pre vent any addition, to -the city which may bi ing In Us train the ingredients of ifixpority. ■ The river is thenatnral ‘.‘main” of our sewer age system, whether.the fluid contents come ■ 'from one source or another, and the proper course Is to keep such a current flowing in it that there can be no aggregation of putrid matter. Lake Michigan is large enough to receive It all. It contains water cnough*to wash all the people who will ever inhabit the Northwestern States, without sensibly, dis turbing its aggregate purity. The problem before ns is three-fold: to get rid of the filth which finds its way to the river—to bring ns pure water for drinking , and washing pur poses—end to save the industrial interests "of the dtyftam harm; All these things can be done, and we-shall esteem any plan a failure which neglects any one of the three elements /we have mentioned. ... ' Bnt the thing to do now-is to organize the will of the people. ’ ’ 'WII IXDXVJLSI- BLE. Id several former articles wc have endeav ored to guard the 44 Agricultural and Mechan ical College rand’* from-what we conceived to. be two of the? dangers !n its'path. These were : . t -1. The perversion of ■ the institution 1 from -the practical and useful course of education 'designed by the grant into'a mere antiquated routine of classical study, tending to unfit, rather than to fit, the student for . farming, mechanical, or other business pursuits, and! wholly foreign from the purpose ofUmgrant. 2. The location of- the institution In some third or fourUCrate town, .with a third or fourth rate faculty, and a third hr fourth rate building, with corresponding appliances.and* apparatus/which would Inevitably render lt ( a third or fourth rate college of lUinols.in* , stead of being thejleadtog ’.lnstitution of the West—a financial and educational failure-In-, stead ofa sdccess. . .. .. ,* , Wehayenowtourgo Inadditlon that both nthe language of the grant, and (If the wiser plan should be carried out) the - necessities of the college Trill Imperatively require that the fund shall 6c kept united and devoted* to the * , support of but one institution, in which , the object shall -be to teach those 'branches' of learning related to Agriculture jfind the Mechanical Arts.- -- »' The act of Congress Is the fundamental law for the disposition of the fluid.' It does* not • provide that the fond shall he appropriated .4® the endowment, Ac., ofatleastone college . ■where the leading object 'shall be to teach dftsr agricoUnre ortho mechanical arte,’or the brandies of learning related to them. It is not “igticnUnre”—lt is not the mechanic arts”—ltlsnot“lhe branches of learning relat ed to tUhtr of them” thatmnst betangbt,bnt Uis u snchbnD(dießoneamingasarcrclatedto agricnlturcflfitf mechanic arts" (|. c. to both,) and whatever school brschoolsmay be found ed .they and cadr of most. teach those branches' ’"related to hoOi i *or • they ..violate; the. termj..of .the. - grant, 'll any suppose that ibis college can take the place of an. apprenticeship to a mechanical trade, or to farming,' and can torn ont practl cal farmers, gardeners, stock-raisers,'black* srn'tbs, tallora, 'founders, carpenters, boat builders, machlnlstvptlnters, carriago-mak era, cabinet &c., IhroughontUi range of the thousand and one occupations an agricultural or mechanical character, thoy labor under an hallucination. The mere at* tempt would be quixotic and absurd. The trades are too numerous, the business of teaching them in all their details would be undesirable and Impracticable,, and the' students will not have arrived at the age at which they will bo competent to select a business for life, and what they need to know Is not tile labor and drudgery of any one of them, for only by labor and drudgery can any trade be learned In detail, but they need to acquire “ those branches of learning which are more or less related to all of them." We hare al ready Indicated In part what those branches are, and they are substantially the same for agriculturists and mechanics. They are parts of the proper education of every re spectable man, and ' every man, no matter what hls-profcsslon, will be profited by thorn. Franklin was a printer, but .when by the earningsofhlstrade ho bought afield, and sowed In white letters upon , it , the words, ‘.‘This field Is plastered,”.. which in a few weeks were turnfed to green, a mechanic taught the Pennsylvania limners how'to fo^m. ' And yet not so, for withoutbeing acquainted, with the chemistry ot soils they might waste 'a fortune In putting plaster on soils not adap ted to It.' Every former knows thati If ho plant pumklns and squashes side by side they wUrmingle th-iir qualities to thedelri meat of each.*: Only so far as he Is ac quainted* with’ vegetable physiology does he know why. Wnal need has a former to know ought of geology or mineralogy? Lfet the formers of the oil regions of Pennsyl vania, who sold millions of barrels of petro leum for the price of waste timber land, an swer. Every farmer should be a folr mechan ic, and a liberally educated man. Every me chanic-should know enough of the general principles of forming to become one if he choose., Both should bo educated In element’ ary law and medicine.- It would save many a lawyer’s' and doctorisblll to teach formers and mechanics how much less learning there Is In • the learned professions than they have •posed,!, e., bow little is knowledge and how much is mere experiment. , • If will, be seen,, therefore, that there. Is nothing in the scope or purpose of this col lege which admits of separation. It can teach no branch which tho youlhlbl former will . need to know: but with which' the intelligent Allure, mechanic cjm dispense or vice vena. Neither the necessities .nor the language of the grant admit of severance Into one Agri cultural and one Mechanical College, • Further, the mischief and bane of onr edu cational Institutions generally Is this very di vision of funds, and scatters lion of energies among too many institutions, making them all poor, andcompeUlng their professors tohe engaged in studying the finances of their col leges and their households, when they should be absorbed In the glorious pursuit of attaint ing, and no less delightful tawic 0 f imparting scientific truth—enlarging the area ofdlscov ;ery and the bounds of knowledge.. -■ The necessity of unity here set forth Is pre dicated on the hypothesis that tho end to ’he sought is strength, that the Institution is. to he The Jim institution of the T Vat, and no contracted catch-penny failure. If, on the other hand, the end sought Is weakness, If the. college is to he located with .the view of benefiting some rural village, capitalist or politician, and organized In order to promote the Income of any individuals however meritorious,-both of these ends will best be "answered by di viding the ftmd among all the rural villages, so as to give a portion to every meritorious Individual. Wc have thus briefly stated our convictions on these points; first, "because they are our convictions; secondly, because wo believe they arc the convictions of most of the friends of education In Illinois; and thirdly, because calm reflection and fell discussion will tend to that unity and harmony among the friends of the proposed institution which is so csscn-’ tial to its success. It needs, the aid and co operation of all. It cannot well afford to have the hostility of any. : GEN KOSECBANB, Wc publish elsewhere a card .from Major General Rosecrans, addressed to the Cincin nati Commercial, intended to removp certain aspersions upon his reputation, to vindicate . his late campaign against Price, and so forth. ¥ Gen. Rosecrans had contented himself with repelling any charges which hie deemed un founded and injurious we should have pub lished his statement without comment, leav ing the public to judge whether his late operations in Missouri have been attended' with success or otherwise, guided by. such lights as they may have;' But ho has seen fit to go back to the battle of CWckamauga and couple the Chicago Tiuduke, by Implication, with certain other charges which everybody but himself had long since forgotten. In so doing be has not only parted from bis own dignity, bathe has stated that ( which is not true. It Is not true that any person now or hcrctoforc.conncctcd with tho Chicago Tm bcne, cither wrote, suggested or Insinuated any of the things which Gen. Rosccransal legos were so written, suggested or Insin uated.- SINGLE TRACK ACCIDENT, We give in another column one of the most horrid and revolting railroad catastrophes which it has been our province to record. It occurred on the Grand Trunk Railway, near the Detroit and Milwaukee Junction. Others have occasioned far'greater loss of life, but to pin a human being between tbo fragments of a railroad wreck, and then turn him np in toll view of a mass of bis fellow men, who, after striving for many minutes to rescue him, arc finally compelled to give him, with half a dozen over to the flames to be con sumed,'while shrieking and praying for old, this is such a martyrdom as is seldom witnes sed in this generation. But, worst of all, 1} la a martyrdom' to Mammon. The collisions which, like-thisf arise from the use of single tracks, are .wholly unnccessaiy. They are often more expensive to the roads thondonble tracks would be, but to the community, who find it difficult to estimate how many Uvea a railroad company can afford to sacrifice, rath er than lay a doable track, they always ap. pear to be-an unprofitable and nnchristian blonder. ‘ \ ■ . Appropriations to Colleges, " During the last two ybars—a period of war during which our enemies at home and in Europe confidently .predicted our national ruin, a most wondcrtol liberality has been de veloped toward our institutions of learning.

CHICAGO RITEB* The Bull and Use Bemedj. Editor* Chicago Tribute: It Is extraordinary that the condition of the Chicago River does not awaken more at tention, and create more anxiety In the pub liemlpd.' ; That a .city of nearly - two hundred thou sand Inhabitants, of enormous wealth, and of the energy and enterprise of which this city Is reputed, should quietly permit a river run ning through its entire limits to be converted Into a gigantic sewer; that they should, day after day, and month after month, look down upon its waters, here red with blosd, there slimy with grease, and black with filth and putrid matter, tuning what Is In Itself anoble and boautlfhl object Into a sight so foul and loathsome as to oxcito only thoughts of “ tho Elver of Death,” Is a matter of profound astonishment. ’And that such .people should tamely sub mit to have the atmosphere which they are . daily compelled to breathe made, so' offensive as to become disgusting, and [to IWllof pels- Inoua and unwholesome exhalations ss in the opinion of their heat medical men to be dan gerous to bealtb,| if, indeed, It does not in time engenders pestilence; that thoy should permit tho water which ihey drink, and In which they are compelled to perform their daily ablutions, to be made so vile to taste and smell as to remind one of a decayed fish mar ket, and to make all bathing, and oven the .ordinary ablutions, extremely offensive; that all this can go on in a city like this, and among a people like ours, seems to me a . marvel almost beyond belief or explanation ■ Are our citizens so absorbed in the one over mastering-passion of money making as to have become Insensible to all that makes life at tractive and agreeable? Apart from all ques tions of bcaUh,|bave our citizens so little pub lic spirit, so little regard for the reputation of onr littlb pride In Its outward condi tion as to permit ft to continne in a* state so disreputable and so offensive? . But not only is Its condition a reproach to onr good taste, but. it convicts ns of the grossest neglect "of duty with respect to the public health. Pare air and pure water are sanitary condi tions universally conceded to be. essential to the health as well as the comfort of everv city.. . ' There has been scarely a day this fall or winter when the atmosphere of this city haa not been charged with disagreeable odors, or .when.the water of this city has not been offensive to tho smell, and yet we go pnour way as if this extraordinary and disagreeable condition ofaflalrs waaof no particular conse quence, but quite a matter of course. Truly we must confess “our offense Is rank, It smells to Heaven.” We have reason to bo ashamed of ourselves that we have tolerated such a state of things co long; and from henceforth every man who has any pride as a ■ citizen of onr - beatifol city, or any just re gard for Its welfare, or for the comfort and health of its people should make it his spe cial bus! ness to do his part toward effecting a change. Let us determine once and for all that thie note of thing tthaQ riot continue; that cost what It wQi, affect what Interest or class of money makers it may, the river which runs through our city shall bo clean and sweet; the water which we drink and in which we bathe, shall - be pureand wholesome, and the air we breathe shall not he corrupted by noxious and offen sive exhalations. Those of our citizens who were living in Chi cago-when the existing Sewerage Law was en acted, will remember that by the terms of that law. no sewerage could be commenced In any part of the city until a plan of sewerage adapted to the needs of the whole city had been first planned and adopted, and so studi ously careful was that law to Insure a plan which should be free from.all radical defects, thattbe Board of-Bewerogo Commissioners were, after making such plan obliged, to pub lish it and submii it to the critical review of the public for sixty days, who were expressly authorized to file objections to It during that period, and the Board were also to submit it to the Common Council whose duty U was to appoint a committee to examine and report upon It. Now the chief objection which was enter tained at that time to the emptying the sew age into the river was the danger of fouling the stream and making it noxious and disa greeable. And If you turn to the original Sewerage Plan, as first published for-tho ap ‘ proval of our citizens ana the Common Coun cil, von will find that this apprehended dan ger is there ihljy considered and provided against by the proposed erection of pumping works at places specified in the report, and the construction of fluid canals connecting the lake with the river in such manner as that the water of the river could be thereby changed once in every twenty-four hours. If this provision had nbt been Inserted In that plan It would never have received the approval of our citizens and of the Common -Council. But the danger which was appre hended from corrupting the waters of the river by the sewage was by such plan completely obviated. - . Now the evil has come upon us to an ex tent btyond our worst apprehensions at that time. The river has become black, putrid, disgusting to every sense, and why In tho name of all that Is decent is not the remedy which was provided for this very state of things put Into operation ? Upon whom Is the fault, I might almost soy the crime, of this neglect properly chargeable t Is it on the Board of Public Works f Then let us hove a new' Board, or legislate the present one out of .existence, and provide some more efficient body. Is It on the City Engineer? If «o, let him be made to perform hls-duty, or give way to some one who will. Is It on the Mayor or the City Council ? If so, let us have a now Mayor and new Connell who will do their whole duty to the city and the citizens lu re spect to this most important of all municipal matters. But it is said that ibo sewage does not ot present befoul the stream sufficiently toaflect It Injuriously or require the application of tbo remedy to which I have alluded; that the evil Is owing to the pork packers and distil lers. • , If this be so, let suitable and sufficient measures be taken at once (if practicable) to cleanse and purily.tho river from tbo corrupt ing effects of their operations and business; or, if this cannot be done, let the pork pack ers and the distillers be compelled by proper legislation and proceedings to desist from corrupting the public waters of this city. Is it possible that ihc mechanics and labor ing men of this city, who number thousands and tens of thousands, are going to sit tamely down and permit a few wealthy men to cor rupt the air and the water, which are the common property-of all, 4n order that they may pile np additional wealth on tb'clr af ready overladen coffers? • I will not undertake to determine whether tie evils under which we suffer are the fault of the Board of Public Works, the Distillers, or the Fork Packers. My present concern is with the remedy. From, whatever cause the evil comes, it must be at once, and effectually and forever remedied. Now what is the best mode of effecting a remedy!. .. It Is obvious that the public attention needs io be more generally ana effectually aroused to the magnitude of the evil; that more ac curate and reliable Information Is needed as to its cause and the best mode of relief, and that there is need of a combined, continuous concentration of public sentiment and action on this subject until the work is accom plished. - There is nothing that the people cannot do if they will only set about it. • The people are the rulers here, not the Packers or the Dis tillers or the offlce-holdcrvand it is only nccdtol that the people should act in - suen manner as to make their will felt to sweep away all these evils Bronx the face of the city and restore .to vs clean and healthful air and .water,. \. i. . . ... Let, then, some energetic man who works not only to win. a’rood name and fame by a devotion to a grcaCpublic work, but also to be borne upon the strong tide of public favor into high position and influence, take upon himself the engineering of this work.- (if I were ten years younger and had the needful health and strength,! would undertake it myself.) Let him procure a call to bo signed by numbers of our citizens for a public meet ing on this subject, at which able and earnest speakers shall arouse the public mind to the importance of immediate action. At' that meeting let a committee be appointed of en cage tie, determined, and persevering citizens, whose duty it shall be to Institute tnc needful Inquiries and'lnvestigations Into the condi tion of the river and Its causes, to. obtain re liable. information, to visit and examine for themselves, and to report at subsequent meet ings ; and through the public press, so that the public mind shall become thoroughly in formed of the nature of the evil and of the best modes of remedying it. Let that com mittee consider what legislation Is needed to enable the cvQ to be removed,'and prepare the proper bill in season to be acted upon by the Legislature at its next session. , , ~ . Let that committee be. made a permanent body, with power to call public meetings! to raise Binds to pay for.necdtol publications, reports and investigations ; to aad to it§ own members from time to time, and continue its work until the result is accomplished. - . it be lts duty to address a letter in be half of. the citizens to every candidate for Mayor, Alderman, Board of Public .Works, City Engineer, Board' of Health, City Atto? ncy, or any other officer who will have any thing to do with the matter, inquiring wheth er such candidate is In favor of removing these evils and will pledge himself to aid rad support the necessary measures for that pur pose. ; Depend upon It thal the ccncentn ted pow er of r the public opinion of this city thus brought to Dear on an,evil so enormous in Us magnitude, so outrageous in Its character, - rad Born which no mail, woman or child In our city Is exempt, will speedily bring it to an end, let what influence of wealth ana trade combine against it. .. . Del the mass of the people be once tolly aroused rad in earnest about this matter, and let them but know their power rad use It, rad these.,will sweep away with irresistible might everything which stands in its way, and wo shall have Chicago redeemed, purified and no longer bo ashamed to own ourselves resident* of a city of which we were once rad Justly so proud. Bnt who can have pride in a city whose waters are a continued offense to the nostrils, rad whose atmosphere is dally befouled with impurities. • • . Citizens of Chicago,'this shame rad re pioach has rested long enough upon us. Now in the winter months, when we nave a period of comparative safely from these deleterious influences, is the time tor combined action— lor obtaining the needful Information—for or ganizing rad enlightening public opinion—for bringing to bear tbo concentrated power of public sentiment in some practical and avail able mode. Who wQI inaugurate this great and good work? ..Who will win tor himself the gratitude ofhli fellow citizens rad. the honor rad feme which will ho his who shall become the leader rad mover.ln this cause ? j It is not necessary hi this time to consider the various modes of relief tor these ; evils ;«i,63t,00 wUch have been suggested; these can all be considered and discussed at the proper time.

Depend upon It, where there Is a will there will be toond a Legislature Is soon to meet, and it may be found that additional legislation will be requited.' Mo time Is therefore to be lost. Everybody is complaining of the evils under which we suffer, but nothing is being done.

FRIGHTFUL RAILROAD ACCI DENT. - COLLISION BETWEEN TWO TRAINS ON THE GRAND TRUNK ROAD. Dreadful Loss of Ufa and Property, The Cars on Fire—Sercral Persons Boasted Alive. [From the Detroit Fit* Press, Dec. 16.] A most dreadftil accident, attended with, loss’ of lift, occurred last night, shortly before 8 o'clock, on the Grand Trank Railroad, about a mile end a half west of the Detroit «fc Mil waukee junction, through a collision between the day passenger express west and a freight train going east. The particulars which bare been gathered thus for are nearly as fol . lows; •. - .. " The passenger train was behind time, and had mode all tho necessary pauses, according ■to the telegraphic instruction, until.it had passed New Baltimore station, where it is sold it had orders to pass the freight going cost at the Detroit & Milwaukee junction! When it arrived there, according to the story of the operator at the Grand Trunk junction, it had orders to proceed aU right. Under these Instructions It phased tbe Junction,- when shortly afterwords the engineer thought hb discovered on engine ahead. Tbe next moment he heard the whistle to down breaks, whin he immediately gave a similar order and reversed his engine. There were with him In the cab at the time two other persons, be sides . the fireman. Before they could Jump the two engines come crashing together in frlghtibl contact, literally making chaos of everything connected with both. Tho engines were dovetailed into each-other in an Inseparable manner, and tbe maU and baggage car of the passenger train driven partially* through the forward passenger car, thereby causing the frightful catastrophe which followed. The passenger train,, which consisted of only two coaches and a baggage car, was crowded with passengers. Both cars were filled to the utmost, so much so that scarce even standing room could be obtained. After the accident those In the forward-car, who were not helplessly injured, endeavored to get out as soon as possible. It Is said, and wo give it upon the authority of one of the pas- that the baggageman, who, it ap pears, bad charge of the train—there being no conductor aboard—or one of the brak£ men, shut the bind door of the car, and would not for some time allow tbepassengers egress stating that there was no danger. Immedi ately alter the smash occurred the stoves were upset and the cars took fire. In an al most incredible space of time tbe flames en veloped the whole, with the exception of the lost car, and how many perished time alone can tell. The flames shot up In a broad sheet, illumi nating-the heavens lor miles around. As seen from the city, it appeared as tbongh some huge bonfire was blazing at the Skating Park. The hells sounded the*alarm. and the engines turned out, but after proceeding a’short dis tance npwoodwatd avenue, they found that the lire was far beyond the city limits and they returned, various conjectures were rifa aa to the cause, hut it was not until after the arrival of some of the passengers in the city that the nature of the catastrophe was as certained. After recoveringfrom the shock, those who escaped turned their attention to the rescue of those In danger, and succeeded in deliver ing several from' the burning mass. 'Whilst thus engaged they were Torced to witness a sight which fairly curdled the blood In their veins, and towards the recital of which the pen denies its office. The mail agent, George W. Milieu, from Port Huron, was found to be Jammed in between the baggage and for ward passenger car. His leg was Irmly held kitween two pieces of broken timber, and all cflbiUtu rescue him before the devouring flumes cngalphcd him in their (olds proved (btile. The most herculean efforts to extri cate bis crushed and bleeding limbs from Its fearful embrace were used, but the rapidly spreading flames drove the laborers from their work, and they were forced to witness Um perish before their eyes, his heart-rend inp shrieks piercing their care for help, until stilled amid the smoke and dames of the de vouring clement. God of heaven, it was a sickening sight, and completely enervated the energies of those around In their duty to others probably equally terribly situated Alter tbo fire had burned down, his charred trunk was taken from the ruins, the head arms and legs completely devoured, and the body roasted to a cinder. As wc have stated, it is not known how many persons perished. We can, therefore, only as yet surmise the number sacrificed to tlio catastrophe. Some persons working among the ruins discovered n portion of a female's hoop skirt, and shortly afterwards the bones of a human being among the ashes. Another person drew from the ruins a portion of the bottom ,of a silk dress, and a ticket upon which was the address “ Miss Mary Boorlingam, Oneida, N. Y.,” but whether this belonged tojiny one who perishedthas not yet been discovered. It is said that a lady and two children were in the car, who have not turned up. and that a physician was in the city awaiting the arrival of a sitter or some female relative, or both, mourns their übsbncc. It Is probable that five or six have perished. ’ Beyond the melancholy death of Mr. Milieu no other names have transpired. The names of the wounded, so far as could be ascertained, together with the nature of their Injuries, arc as follows: Mr. Davidson, exprets agent, Detroit, head and face severe ly ; a family named Ashley, from North Dan (brth. Mass., consisting ol a mother, son and daughter, were all more or less injured. The mother was very severely cut about the head and face, and the son, U la feared, is Injured internally. Hu was completely bewildered for some time. The daughter ilary, bad her arm broken and her log severely bruised .and appeared to be suffering Intense pain. They were on their way to Wisconsin, where they intended to settle. Mr. Watson, a gentleman from Canada, internally, so bad ly as to be unable to give an account of his residence- and friends; Ebcnezcr BQlyard, Mount Clemens, severely about the head, face and body; N.

Printer*’ Strike in St. Louis. The St. Louis Democrat is in the midst of a strike. It nays: 44 The printers ore on a strike and the pro prietors arc consequently embarrassed to get out their regular editions. We have made the issue with the printers on a question of wages. Since lost summer we have been com pelled by the rules of their Society known as the Typographical Union, to to pay slxty-flve cents per thousand for composition while in other cities in the United States the highest price nald is fifty cents per thousand. The wages in the Job rooms and other departments of our office nave been correspondingly exor bitant and disproportionate. We concluded to stand this no longer. Wc asked the print ers to reduce their bill of prices, offering to pay as much os wnspaid in any other city in the States. This offer. the. printers - have re jected. • -They have therefore been discharged from all our offices. . * 44 We shall publish onr paper notwlthatand the Union, and intend to whiplt out as it has been whipped oat la every other city In the country where the proprietors have resisted Its exorbitant demands. 44 The public most hare patience with tho appearance of our paper for a• few days.

Robinson, the Superintendent of the White Mountain telegraph, communicates to the Tetfffmpher the following Interesting fact: 41 It was found impossible to get a ground connection on or near the summit; although the ground wire was carried some forty rods down the mountain'to a living spring where there was plenty of water, ! could not per ceive the slightest escape.

The notes are issued In denominations of SSO, fioo! SSOO, SI,OOO, and $6,000, with semi-annual interest coupons attached, and payable to bearer or order, aa the subscriber to the loan may desire. The notes ran for three yean from the 15th of August 1861, bear interest at the rate of two cents per day for each one hundred dollars, and are redeemable at maturity, at the option.of the bolder, in 6-20 six per cent gold bearing bonds. They can be ob tained from banks and hankers throughout the country at par, and accrued interest from the 15th of August, 1864; and at the present rato of gold bearing bonds (the 6*Bos being worth 10 per cent premium) arc undoubtedly the beat Investment that canoe mode In Government securities. .

Ba* üboat STavuto, Dec. 17,18 W. The week now clocod baa teen an Important one in tbo record' of tbe present aeaaoo. Hie liberal aupply consequent upon tbe advanced prices paid, baa to some extent shaken the opinion to which many of oar • Important opera tun aeemcd commuted, u to tbe Urn* Ued resources of oar bog districts. The heaviest re* cclpta daring any prevtoos week were those of D> OomberStb, 1863, which amounted to 18JCS live, and 17.710 dressed, or a total ofUWBI. boring tbo present week the receipts amount to 1C6.7D8 live, and 10,908 dmsod, total 128,03 bead; or Only 14,t89 bead Icn than tbe largeel receipts ever known In this city., Tbe weather nptoThariday was cold and vary f** vorable for bnilneaa, besides which tbe active move* xnent In Dog Product, at better prices; seemed tola* ftso a degree of confidence among operators which baa seldom been equaled. The firm tone which cbtr. acterlzed tbo market on Monday, duly Increased, and was nevermore apparent than In the extreme dlapaCch with which basinets was transacted; a very large pro,, portion of the bogs were purchased as soon as onload, ed, If not before, and welshed without feed or water. Teslerday the weather had considerably moderated. The provision market waa doll and.prlces generally lower. This somewhat lessened the previous activity of tho market, tbe tone of which was less firm, at* though at the close there was no- essential change In quotations. To-day the weather baa been still milder, and with no prospect of any Immediate change, sellers have very readily made a concession ot*BS94oo per 100 Be on light and medium hogs, and of 139350 per 100 at on better grades. At this decline a large amount of stock changed hands, the entered sales amounting to SUM head at fUAOOISXO, chiefly at $13.00913-90 per too Vs. Bat even with the redactlon.wblch has been made la prices, several large operators withdrew from the. market, and at the close thlsevenlpß there were over

Eattemsblppersare boylngln a very limit ed way, as seen by the Insignificant number shipped Irora this market during the week, amounting only to 8£&l bead. Our city packers have been the only par chasers of moment, and the best criterion that can he furnished of the magnitude of their present opera* tlons Is furnished by the ease with which so large a quantity of stock as the receipts of the present week have been disposed ofi

At these quotations tba market this evening was very firm, with on Improved demand^ satubd.it EvKSTvn.Dee. 17,1661. The Beef Cattle market during the pact week has been more active than for several weeks past, as the result of an extra demand for army cattle, and for Eastern buyers The result of which has been.addi tions! firmness, with an advance of 25c FIOO fts on the better qualities of stock. The recelpteare itUl very deficient of anything ap proaching to extra qualities. The large quantity of jtcck purchased on army account daring the past fire months will have very materially reduced the qnantl ty of Cattle that arc at this season of the year, usually In the hands of farmers. The scarcity of the supply must net, however, be taken as a proof that there are no good Cattle In the country, as we find tbatalarge number of good Cattle are being kept over for the spring trade, when It Is anticipated that the aupply will be very limited, and prices rule nnprecendcntedly blgb. 1 There has been tbe absence ot anything like excite* meet in tbe proceedings of the market; and the character ofits movements have been of that descrip tion which Is always seen when there Is the absence ofany active demand In a given direction. Specula tor* have been very bnslly occupied, in boring small lots, and then assorting them and selling them at the best prices obtainable, a petty kind of trade that one soon gets weary of.watching. Tbo few extra droves received were eagerly sought for and taken at high figures. Theentered sales to-day amount to only 517 head at f8.65<£5.75 per 100 fts, and the market closed firm at the above quotations. BEEF. CATTLE SALES TO-DAY. TORT WATS* TABOS. ' Sellers. Bnycrt..
