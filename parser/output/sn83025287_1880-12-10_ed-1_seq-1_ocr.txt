United States Senate. Washington, Dec. 9.—On motion of Senator Fendleton, so much of the President b annual message as refers to tha civil service reform non-assessment of government employes for political purposes, wan referred to a select com mittee to examine the several branches of civil service, with instructions to report at an early day by bill or otherwise. On motion of Senator Davis, of Illinois, it was resolved that the adjournment today be until Monday. Senator Pendleton introduced a Joint r .solu tion fot the purposs of obtaining the road Und tight of way from the Canada line of the United States and British America through British Columbia to Fort Wrang^ll end into Alaska. Referred. The Vice President laid baton the Senate a communication from the secretary of war transmitting copies of correspondence had with the legal representatives of the confederate Generals Gre^g and Polk, with a view to pur chase of their private papers relating to the late war, as per the aot of June 16, 1880. The Folk papers have been placed in the hands of the government wilb permission to use such as are deemed important to the publication now authorised by law. The price risked for the entire collection is $10,000. The Gregg papers have been submitted for the purpose of being catalogued. No present price is stipulated for them, but they, a3 well as the Polk collection, were appraised in 1878 at 810,000, and could doubles- not be purchased at that sum. The secretary says that heretofore no purchases for the archives have been made from federal officers, and only trans-Mississippi (Sydney, Johnston and Sce-d) papers fiom confederate officers. The great bulb of acquisitions have been gifts. So far as the secretary knows the only important collections as yet unobtaicod are those under consideration. It is far Con gress to say whether justice to* those who have freely given the most important documents is observed by purchase ot other collections. The Vice President also submitted a commu nication from the secretary of state, transmit ting, at request of Madame Thiers, the eighth and ninth volumes of the speeches of Thiers, late president of the French republic. They were ordered sent to the library. Mr. Paddock presented a petition for exten sion of copyright to foreign authors. 8enator Whithers, by request, introduced a bill to provide for judicial determination of pension clalms.against United States. lie. ferred. Senator Garland effered a resolution in structing the committee on military affairs to inquire whether tbo United States arsenal buildings and grounds at Little Reck, Ark., being one of the posts alluded to by the Presi dent in his last annual message, arc superflu ous, and whether tbe same cannot advantage ously be disposed of to the State of Arkansas, and on what terms. Agreed to. Mr. Burnside announced that Tuesday next he will ask the Senate to consider the bill to apply part of the proceeds of public lands to public education, etc. •■'-. ."'.-' The Senate bill for the relief of Mary A. Lord was taken up. It grants her $2,100 as arrears of pension for her dead husband. It was opposed on technical grounds by members of the pension committee, as the requirements of law had not been observed as to tho time of tilicg the application for pension. After de bate, the Senate, by a vote af 15 to 33, refused to have the bill read a third time, and it thus drops. On motion of Senator Paddock the Senate bill providing for sale of the remainder of the reservation of the confederated Otoe and Missouri tribes of Indians in Nebraska and Kansas, and for other purposes, was taken up. It provides for the sale to actual settlers of raid lands with consent of said Indians, the proceeds to be placed to the credit of the tribes and a new reservation to be selected for them, they desiring to quit the present reser vation. After debate tbe bili passed. Senator Randolph announced that Monday next he will ask the Senate to consider the bill for relief of Fitz John Porter, to which he will offer his aimmdent noticed yesterday re storing Fits John Porter to the army without back pay. On the motion of Senator Garland the Sen ate bill to secure the safe keeping of money paid into court, was taken up aud passed. On motion of Senator Plumb the Senate bill to extend the time for filing claims for horses and equipment.. lost by officers and enlisted men in the service of the United States, was taken up, but ivithout action the .Senate went into executive session and soon adjourned. Uvtine of Representatives. Washington, Dec. 9.—Mr. Baker.of Indiana, from the committee on appropriation., report ed a fortification appropriation bill and it was ordered printed and recommitted. It appro priates $100,000 for the preservation and re pair of fortifications, and $50,000 for tbe pur chase of torpedoes. Mr. Kelly, of Pennsylvania, introduced a bill repealing the tax on bank checks, medi cines, friction matches, bank capital and bank deposits. Referred. Mr. Aldrich, of Illinois, introduced a bill amending the law relating to the ti x on sav ings banks. Referred. Mr. F. Wood, of New York, said he would like to ascertain how many days the gentleman on the other side intended to obstruct public business. Mr. Conger—1 call the_ gentleman to order tor unparliamentary and insolent lane;urge. Mr. WoodIf it troubles the gentleman I will withdraw that language. Mr. CongerThere must be limit to the im pertinence of the gentlemen who make such remarks. Whenever the gentleman is willing to meet the demands of the country and bring his funding bill for action, we arc even*" will ing to postpone the present debate. Sir. Wood —1 thought the gentleman mi?ht indicate when he would permit the funding bill to come before the Honse. Mr. McLane then took the floor acd proceed ed to speak on the Senate resolution., replying especially to the speech made yesterday by Mr. Robeson. That gentleman had laid down the proposition that no judicial power could be exercised by Congress, except by direct grant. The twelfth article of the constitution was the express grant to Congress to count the votes through all time. The idea that the Vice President could count the votes—that he who might have a place on the ticket should decide what votes should be received and what, rejectedhad never been accepted in the history _>f the conn try. Over and over again had this .subject been debated, Unhappily once in the history of the country a law had been passed under the oper ation of whioh a count had been made which would forever stand a monument of disgrace and dishonor to the country— that count had counted in a man wbo had not re ceived a majority of the electoral vol-:.. The twelfth article gave the House the power to elect the President under a certain contingency. If jurisdiction was conferred on a tribunal on a certain contingency, that tribunal was certain to judge when that contingency had occurred. The House must judge when the contingency on which it might elect the President had oc curred, and the House could not judge of that contingency unless it verified every vote. The twelfth article imposed on the Houso the actual necessity of counting and verifying the votes. That was a power that could not be delegated. Knowing tbat the gentlemen on the other side meant to set the constitution at defiance, it was his hope that ho would yet live to see bis party again in the majority in. the Honse. If the gentlemen on the other side of the House chose to obstruct business until the dsy should come for counting . the electoral vote, let them bave the responsibility. ; Let the Democrats await that day, and when it came let them take their seats and Bee that tbs votes opened by the Vice President were genuine votes. Let them Bee that every elector was qualified, and let them take any other step they pleased in the way of inquiry and investigation to know whether tbe electors who ha-' cast the votes were qualified electors. If perchance they should find that, as was the case in 1877, electors bad voted who were not qualified, let them have the courage to refuse to certify or connt such votes, or if they found that the vice-president had opened the certifi cates, where the votes alleged to bave been cast were forgeries, let them have courage now and forever to refuse such votes. Let them do as their fathers had done— their seats, ap point tellers, count the votes, and as honorable representatives of the people certify to the genuineness of the votes or refuse to certify to it. fie bad never met a man who had not re gretted the necessity for the electoral commis sion, but now he looked back witb infinite sat isfaction to the fact that the Democratic party bad both in 1876 and 1880 ths candi dates who believed it was tbe duty of the Houses to count the votes. Every per son felt that in delegating that power to another tribunal, the responsibility had been with Congress, and if there had been any shame or dishonor in tho action if reacted here, fie bad for that reason never felt at liberty to denounce that tribunal, He would, however, never cast a vote to create another. fie hoped the Democrats would not be influ enced eitber by filibustering or by offensive insinuations thai they were hatching mischief. Except in case of a State which had voted for Hancock there was no question in any State. There was a question' and a very serious ques tion as to the vote of Georgia, fie could not conceive of any more detestable tbiog than re jecting the vote of : a Btate except the voting a State against its will. That was the crime of tho Republican party. It had accepted perjury and forgery as a means of certifying votes. In face of this fact gentlemen on the other Bide stood here and endeavored to give the Vice President power to count the votes. It was an attempt at usurpation that looked to the future, and there was no legislative action that was not justifiable to defeat that purpose. A disjointed running debate then ensued, participated in by McLane, Calkins, Hunter, Cos:, of New York, and Mills, daring tbe course of which Mr. Mills intimated his opposition to the pending resolution on the ground that under its provisions tbe Senate might declare who was President. Mr. Lftpham said that last session be had looked upon the landing measure as an at tempt to debauch the electoral ant. Why were tbe wheels of legislation now blocked to consider a question when it was admitted that, there was no necessity whatever for the oper ation of the ;• extraordinary pro visions of this . resolution. That there was lying, r behind it some purpose ho wsa bound to assume from the tenacity with whioh the matter was pressed. Under its provisions, ' questioning a return would justify a majority in rejecting tho vote of a State. It provided that if more than ono list of electoral voters, or "papers purporting to be such list," were received from a State, either house may refuse to receive the vote. What was this paper? Au official paper. Not at all, but a paper certified by a chairman of a Democratic State committee would answer the requirement of that provision. The Re publicans were willing to justify themselves in resorting to every expedient known to par liamentary usage to resist the purpose of this resolution. Mr. Herbert argued in opposition to tit theory that the Vice President had a right to count tbe votes. He denied that there was any political motive which induced the Democrats to press the matter, unless the desire to- pre vent the theory that the Vice President bad power to declare who was his successor from passing into a precedent were a political mo tive. .- ' \ Mr. Newberry made an elaborate argument in support of . the proposition. that the power to count the votes was vested in the Vice Pres ident. The proposed rule was unconstitutional in the attempt to take from the president of the Senate certain powers and rights and vest them in the two houses. Pending further de bate the House adjourned. General Capital News. Washington, D. 0., Dec. 9.—In the commit tee on ways and means to day a long discus sion took place upon the proposition to remove the internal revenue tax from bank checks, friction matches, patent medicines, eto. The matter was finally referred to a subcommittee on internal revenue, with instructions to con sider and report upon the same at a future meeting, .-'J-.?'-..-"■ The President, Secretary Ramsey and Gen.

This will be offered by Representative Kelly as a substi tute when the Wood refunding bill is called up. •■;..■-;_ -.-;: Senator Johnston, chairman of the Senate committee on agriculture, has prepared a reso lution calling upon the public printer for a statement of reasons why the agricultural re port for 1879 has not yet been printed. The treasury department to-day purchased 400,000 ounces of fine silver for delivery at the San Francisco and New Orleads mints. A joint caucus of Republican members of the Senate and House was held tbis evening in the hall of the House of Representatives, for the purpose of determining the party policy in regard to the Senate concurrent resolution now pending in the House, which provides for the adoption of a specified joint rule to regu late the counting of the electoral vote. .Be tween eighty and ninety were in attendance and the debate, which occupied two hours and a half, was quite general. Among those who took part were Senators Blaine, Anthony, Ferry and Teller, and Representatives Lapham, Hawlcy, Conger, Keife, Haskell, Batter worth, Hiscock and Robeson. The only qnestion upon which any difference of opinion was ex pressed was the extent to which it should be considered necessary or advisable to oppose adoption of the pending rule. While. many of the speakers believed there was no purpose on the part of the Democrats to attempt reversal of the result of the recent Presidential elec tion, or any danger at the present juncture need be anticipated from adoption of the pro posed rule, many held that a great principle was at stake, which might at some time affect the stability of our institutions and the policy of the party should be to meet the issue now and resist by every known parliamentary method the adop tion of the proposition, alike unwarranted by the constitution and at variance with the pre cedents of the post. At the conclusion of the debate a vote was taken on, Judge Laphani's resolution declaring it to be the sense of the caucus that the Republican minority should resist the adoption o f this joint rule by all the means authorized by parliamentary law, and without dissent it was adopted. The Astronomical department of the Histori. cal society holds its annual meeting this even ing, at the rooms in the capitol. A general at tendance of the members is desired also, that of all interested or willing to join as new mem bers. ' * : . "■ ■ ; .:,",-■;.' Beautiful Holiday Goods. "' -..;".

SAINT PAUL FRIDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 10, 1880. THE MARKET HOUSE, , A Characteristic Communication from. Col. Allen ou the Subjeot— Inestimable -Benefits Conferred Upon the City by the Completion of Our City Mart Accompanying the final estimate of the contractors for the new market house sub mitted to the common-council yesterday was the following report from Col. Allen, the chairman of tho committee, and the father of the enterprise. It needs only to be read to be appreciated: Hon. President of tbe City Council. Deab Sib: Allow me on behalf of the com mittee of the market house to present the final estimate on the completion of the new market house. v.""'"-.. ■ 1 believe the contractors have complied with, and carried out the contract in every particu lar. I must congratulate the city in getting so prompt and reliable a class of contractors. Everything has moved like, clock work from tin time they commenced work,:j until the job was finished. :*'.:■' Not a misunderstanding or a disposition on the part of the contractors to slight the work or wrong the city out of a farthing; not one feature in building operations has been omit ted; not a change in the plans nor a single cent edded to tho cost of the building since it was commenced. Tbe custom cf the country is to allow changes in the plans of construction, giving the contractor an opportu nity to add one-fourth or even one-third to the original cost of the structure. Not so in our case. Our architect, Mr. Radcliff, had all of his plans and specifications so well digested and perfected we avoided the customary addi tional expense, to tbe surprise and disappoint ment of the contractors. Well may the city feel proud of such a no ble, commanding and useful a structure, and built at so small expense.' Many believed it would cost $100,000, and none supposed such a magnificent structure, complete in all its parts, could bave been built for the money. In a short time it will be the bee hive of the city. You will hear the click of the cleaver and the buz of the butcher's saw. Fatted bullocks from the Saskatchewan valley and mountains of Montana. Fish from the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, as well as the Gulf of Mexico. Fruits from Southern fields as well as Truman Smith's garden. Flowers from the valleys and berries from the hills. All will contribute to our market house. The grocery man. game man, dairy man, and tea man, pork and sausage man, all will claim a place to do business in our emporium. Every thing a family can eat or drink will be found here.. Also a hall where the young can trip the '. light fantastic toe or listen to ISftthe sweet melody of the Eolian harp, or listen to the eloquence of the popular orator. Not satisfied with this, step in the great room where even justice will be meted out daily to those in need, on scales that are properly balanced, and I trust cur city attorney, W. P. Murray, will attend to the weighing. The basement is all that could be desired for convenience. Here you will find the dining room tables laden with choice viands, and tempting the appetite; also the lunch counter, laden with Yankee pork and beans, fried cakes and coffee, chickens and cheese, pretzels and Switzercase—everything good to eat, from a five-cent lunch to a twenty-five cent dinner. These attractions will, call people to our market houso and make it the great trading mart of the city. Tha rich and the poor, the saint and the sinner, the old men and maidens, all will come. The small children will drop tbeir playthings, and they will cry to come when their parents start with the market bas ket to be replenished with the delicacies and delicious fruits from our great central market. Very respectfully, A. Allen, Chairman. .-■-. Last tttghVo ---Concert. •-*.»-,... A v.ry pleasant and enjoyable concert was given at the Opera house last evening by Mesdames Carrie Ettenheimer and Fiances Bice, of Philadelphia, assisted by some of our best local musical. talent. The house was comfortably filled with a very choice audience, all of whom seemed to take the liveliest interest in the programme. Liszt's duet for tho piano, Rhapsodic Langroise No. 2, waa exquisitely "rendered by the la dies mentioned. It was followed by a bass song by W. H. Buckelew, "The Storm," sung in the characteristically animated man ner that has made that gentleman so univer sal a favorite in this city. Miss Bertha Bosenfield followed with a reoitation "Cur few shall not toll to-night," whioh was giv en in excellent style and elicited a hearty encore, to which the lady responded with au appropriate selec tion. Miss Gilbertie Davidson then sang the beautiful "Inviolami," from Ernani, with much feeling, and responded to an en thusiastic encore with "Come In and Shut the Door." The flute solo by Mrs. Bice was a thoroughly artistio performance and elicit ed a loud encore, to which the lady respond ed later in the evening with the "Carnival de Venice." Prof. Otto Schmidt's violin solo was an exquisite piece of instrumentation, and received as it merited, loud applause. The remainder ef the programme was thoroughly enjoyable, the artists acquitting themselves with great credit and winning the loudest applause. It is to be hoped tbat the entertainment will be repeated at an early day. DAILY WEATHER BULLETIN. , Office op Observation, Signal Cokps.

THE LAND LEAGUE. A Public Meeting to Be Called January loth-New Members Admitted, Etc. ■ - The regular meeting of this organization was well attended last evening, President McCarthy in the chair. A communication from Rev. Father Walsh was read regarding the formation of leagues and the remittance of f ands to the proper depositories. On motion the treasurer, Mr., Bell, was authorized to forward the funds of the league to Dublin as directed by Father Walsh. - • | The committee whose business it is to provide for a public meeting by whhh an expression of public sentiment as to the iniquitous measures the English landlords have adopted in relation to their Irish tenants, made their report and it was decided that such a meeting should be held in the Opera House on the 15th of January next. Twenty new members put their names on the roster. There are now over 100 members of the league in (his city, and when fully represented there must be at least 250, for the Irishmen of America are still possessed of hearts, and witness the oppression of their brethren in Ireland with strong disap probation. John W. Willis, J. 'O'Connor and several other gentlemen made strong and spirited addresses; which were well received and had a deep effect upon the assembly. The league then adjourned, to meet for the transaction of farther important business, on Thursday, December 16,1880. Condition of the Northern Pacific Railroad. There are now completed and in operation 600 miles of road, on which there are no mortgages or liens;.on the Missouri and the Pen d'Orielle Divisions (together with about 426 miles), which it is expected will be com pleted before the c! ><?a of the year, there arc sectional mortgages amounting ~ to $6,500, --000. Of this amount $2,500,000 has been placed on the Missouri Division, and on the Fen d'Orielle division the mortgage of $4,500,000 has been reduced by $500,000, redeemed under - the land grant. These mortgages, being prior to the present mortgage, the ■.. total funded debt of the company amounts to $46,500, --000. It is believed that the issue of first mortgage bonds will amount to $50,000,000. The amount is limited, however, to $25,000 a mile of finished road. j These divisional mortgage bonds, like the company's pre ferred stock, may be used in purchase of the lands at par; the new bonds* can be used only at 110. To complete the road there remain to be built 1,600 miles; 323 miles on the Eastern end, 457 miles on the Pacific end, and a gap of 820 miles on the Central Division, connect ing the Missouri and Pen d'Oreille divi sions. This part of the unfinished road lies in the Territory of Montana. *It has been considered a difficult part of the route, and toward the western line of the Territory the road extends through a mountanious region. But no difficulty is anticipated by friends of the company in completing the road with the proceeds of the present sale of bonds. It is expected by the company and by the members of the preeant syndicate that the development of the mineral and agricultural resources of the Territory will aid greatly in the prosecution of the work. The Union League's Grand Council. Philadelphia, Dee. 9.The National Council of the Union League of America had its annual session to-day. Gen. J. S. Negley, of Pittsburgh, was elected president and other officers re-elected. A report on the Indian policy of the government was adapted, strongly advocating the necessity for dissolving ths tribal system and requir ing that Indians should be made citizens. Resolutions were adopted congratulating the country on the election of Garfield end Arthur, and pledging support to the new administration. The subject of reorganiza tion of the Republican party in the South by inviting the co-operation of all progres sive men, without regard to their past polit ical affiliation, was warmly, discussed and speeches made in favor thereof by Col. J. E. Bryant, of Georgia; Hon. James T. Beach, of Missouri, and Hon. J. D. Brady, of Vir ginia. Mr. MoEaelly, of Pennsylvania, pre sented a resolution in i elation to the duty of the Republican party to educate people in their political duties by means of the news paper press of the country.
