EDITORIAL. There are Indications that Canada - .,,) iit - tVi fart that may auuu thvv w v.. - ; Uncle Sam is a dangerous individual to monkey with. W. H. Bowers has resigned his place as editor of the Sevierville Republican Star. The Company in their resolutions adopted at their last meeting pay a deserved compliment to the retiring young- editor. , 1 It is probable that the President's recommendations for additional re strictions on immigration and for the establishment of a national quarantine will be acted upon at this session. Bills looking thereto have been introduced in both Houee and Senate. We did not notice the name of our Congressman among the prominent members of the house as the list was given by both Democratic and Republcan papers. Can it be pos sible that "our John" isn't as promin ent in Washington as he is down here? His name was surely ommitted through some mistake. Wk received a communitcatioe from one of our readers last week in re tard to farmers wanting a stock law. If this reader will read chapter 3,' of the code of Tennessee, he will see that we have a very good law in re gard to stock, fences &c. Of course if this can be impoved it is the duty of the legislature to take it into con. sidaertion. In their interest for the purity of the ballot-box it seems as though the Democrats were going to repeal every Federal law that in any way con 'trols elections. They evidently go on the old saying "If you want any thing done well do it yourself." And they don't propose to let "Uncle Sani" have anything to do with their elections which they wish to have carried on to suit themselves. We advise our enthusiastic Dem ocrats who go to Washinhton seeking Federal positions to take along two pair of pantaloons and have heavy soles put on their shoes. Do this for the reason that the part of your pan taloons that will be used the most may get thin, and there is some rough walking between Washington and Tennessee, providing you should de cide to walk home. Rockwood Times, A Better day seems to have dawn ed for the enlisted men of the Regu lar Army. Recently n Sergeants were examined for promotion to Second Lieutenantcies; nine of them passed, and the 10th, who failed by a very narrow per centage, will probably be given a commission also, The new law allows pra-ates to com pete for commissions after a service of only two years, so that every man who enters the Army has a fair chance raising to any position to which his abilities fit him. National Tribune. "Circumstances alter cases," in politics as in everything else. The very Democratic Congressman who talked wildly about impeaching Sec retary Foster when he said that if it become necessary he would not hesi tate to use a portron of the $100,000, 000 gold reserve' fund in the Trea sury to meet the obligations of the government, are now themselves say ing that if there is a deficit in the Treasury after it passes under Dem ocratic control this reserve fund can be used to make it up. There appears to be a good many Democrats who have such short memories that they have already for gotten that they declared in their national platform and upon the stump that protection to American indus tries was unconstitutional. Some of them favor protection openly. Among this number is Representative Boatner, of Louisiana, who says of the tariff bill to bej prepared by his party: "There should be incident al protection for certain American industries, and I beleive that President elect Cleveland will make known, when the proper time, comes, that he favors this system of tariff. President Harrison's message was a statesmanlike paper and is en tirely in keeping with his other state papers. He does not turn his back and run at the first defeat but ad vocates the American policy of pro tection which has brought about our unexampled prosperity. This mes sage, the slogan uttered by our re tiring leader, will be taken up by Robt. Lincoln, or whoever may be our next leader, and when four years from now the Republican host comes marching up to the releif of the American people there will be greater joy among the masses than there was at old Lucknow when the Scottish Slogan was heard as it was shouted by those hardy Highlanders coming to the rescue of the beseiged and dis hearted defenders of that historical place. The Republican Senators held a conference this week, not to decide upon anything, but merely for an ex change of views as to decide what policy they should follow in dealing with the legislation of the session. One of the subjects discussed was whether the House bills for the ad mission of Arizona and New Mexico, now on the Senate calendar, should be passed. No conclusion was reach ed, as there were quite a number of Senators who had not made up iheir minds on the subject. It will not be . The Largest and Cheapest Family Newspaper in the

What would suit Mother or Father bet surprising if a later conference shall decide to take up and pass these bills. It may be set down as certain that there will be no tariff legislation of any kind at this session; there is no disagreement with the President in believing that the proper course is to leave the tariff in its entirety for the Democratic Congress to wrestle with. The more study the Democrats give to the President's message the less they like it. . It is a , hard, mat ter ofYact presentation of figures show ing just what the Republican party has done, for the country, an A the Democrats already realize that it is going to be constantly referred to by those they have hoodwinked, as it becomes more and more apparent, as it will from the time they take con trol of Cogress and the government, that the campaign promises they made are impossible and impracticable. There is no going behind the increase of 287 per cent in the wealth of the conntry since it passed under the control of the Republican party, an increase unparallelled by the history of any country in the world. But the parts of. the message that hurt the Democrats the most are those which tell them that in accordance with their promises they are expected to overthrow the protection system " and inaugurated a tariff for revenue only, and that retrogression in the pros perity of the countrv will be a crime! they do not like to be reminded of tnose tnmgs. The restrictions upon fraudulent voting, in the present federal election laws are few enough and weak enough but the Democrats are in such an al mighty hurry to remove them that forgetting the present Republican majority in the Senate a bill has al ready been introduced in both House and Senate to repeal them all. Senator Hoar truly says that when these laws are repealed "all that will he neces sary in great cities like New York and Chicago, and in many of the States, will be for the Democratic managers, before an election, to declare what majority they desire, and such major ity will be returned. It would seem, if this policy is to be carried out, to be a pity to put the people to the ex pense of an election." The. Dem ocrats are figuring through the repeal of these laws to continue in power indefinitely. They calculate upon a permanent solid south and a large enough manufactured vote in New York, Chicago and other cities to give them permanent control of a majority of the electoral college, what a be ginning for the great Democratic era of reform, "and how pleasing must be the prospect to those who have allowed themselves to believe that anything good or wholesome could come from a party with such a record as the Democratic party has. a- '.

LET'S POP THE QUESTION. .. R. G. Iteming, Let us ask the County Court to make a move in the direction of good roads,! To this end we suggest the following measures: ' Finfit Let the county be divided into t! ee road districts only, and a comp ent, interested man appointed comit sioner in each district. Sepr-od: Let the property road tax be ij jttscd to 15 ct or, ao ct or, 15 ct on fSyioo.oo, as the court' may de cide. Third: Let one half of the tax raised in each district be subject to the order of the commissioner in that district. Forth: Let the three commissions be constituted a joint road commis sion, to have charge of such matters as affect the county as a whole. Fifth: Let one half of the road tax be subject to the order of the com mission, as decided by at least two of the three, and let such part of that half as is needed, be used to pur chas machinery, which shall be used in turn by the three districts, as shall be decided by the joint commission. This machinery should include a rock-crusher, and a heavy steam roller for compacting and smoothing pikes. Sixth: Let all revenue not used to procure machinery for the use of all three districts be distributed to the commissioners in proportion to the tax paid in the district of each, and let the machinery be used by them in the same proportion. Seventh: Let the commissioners do as much permanent improving as possible, such as grading the roads and building first-class pikes. This provides for the purchase of necessary machinery and building of good, lasting roads; and it provides againest partiality to any part of the county. All we need is to hitch together and pull together. We have good rock, cropping out in great abundance. We have the means to buy the ma chinery. We have the men to do the work. We ought to have the roads. Are you ready for the question? All in favor please make it known by telling your jnstices so. Let us go to them personally and tell them what we want. We all want good roads. If we will all tell the court we want something done, something will be done. Yes, let's ask the County Court to do it, like the sovereign citizens that we are.
