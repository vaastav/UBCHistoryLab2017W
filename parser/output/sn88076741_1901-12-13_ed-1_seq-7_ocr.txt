Weekly Market Letter. The following market letter is fur nished by Edwards, Wood & Co.-, Grain Commission Brokers, 8 Chamber of Commerce, Minneapolis, 310 Board o'f Trade, Duluth: Dec. 4.—Last week's grain market was quiet and steady until on Friday, when an advance began, which has reached 4c per bushel for wheat 4 3-8c per bushel for Chicago corn 3 7-8c for Chicago oats. The news for the week was the same as it has been: Large primary receipts of wheat with good cash demand, small receipts of coarse grains, with a large demand and advancing prices continued dry weather in the South west. The advance is based on large buying by the country, continued drought in the Southwest, and higher cables. There was a decrease in re ceipts on Monday and Tuesday of this week, with a decrease of nearly 3,000,000 bushels In the amount on ocean pass age, and small deliveries on December contracts have also helped. An in crease of 3,500,000 bvshels in the world's visible supply has been ignored. This week wheat has shown great strength, independent of corn, and has led the advance. Western primary receipts of wheat were about 7,000,000 bushels for the week. Exports t»--ere 5,117,000 bush els. According to |r»«tsu«.ct. the world's visible supply of wheat has increased 22,125,000 bushels in the last three eeks. Primary receipts from July 1 to Nov. 25, aggregated 144,000,000 bush els, and exports for the same time were 128,000,000 bushels. Exports of corn since July 1 are but 19,250,000 bushels, compared with 74,333,000 bushels for the same period last year. Receipts of corn are very small. The steady advance in price signally justifies all predictions made In these letters during the past month. Minneapolis May wheat is now quoted at 76 5-8c May flax, $1.44 1-2 Chicago May corn and oats, 68 1-2 and 46c, respectively. We think wheat high enough for the present.

Washington, Dec. 5.—Practically the entire time of the senate yesterday was devoted to the introduction of bills and resolutions. Two of these measures, relating to the suppression of anarchy and the dealing with anarchists, were allowed to lie on the table so that their authors, Mr. McComas of Marjiland and Mr. Vest of Missouri, may bring th to the early attention of the sen ate. The Isthmian canal report was transmitted ta the senate by the pres ident and, several bills providing for th construction of the waterway, one of them by Mr. Morgan of Alabama, who has led the movement for the ca nal in the past, were presented. Washington, Dec. 6. Senator Mc Comas of Maryland made an extended and carefully prepared speech In the senate yesterday with anarchy as his theme, and was followed by some brief remarks by Mr. Hoar of Massachu setts on the difficulties in the way of dealing with anarchist assassins. Mr. McComas' remarks showed careflul ex amination of the legal authorities. He maintained that congress had fnfl pow under the constitution to enact a law punishing with death any person killing a president or assaulting »he v' president with intent to kill, or aiding, inciting or procuring such an act. He favored rigid provisions in the Immi gration laws for the deportation of alien anarchists. Much of the speeeh was devoted to an explanation of the dri.gerous doctrines of anarchy, and the extent to which these doctrines had been propagated within recent years. Senator Hoar's remarks were interest ing, coming from the venerable efhalr- ., rian of the judiciary committee, which will have much to do with the framing 'j of any legislation on this subject. said that the difficulty was that assas sins of kings and rulers always gloried In their crimes and were in no wise de terred by the fear of punishment For, this reason he thought «t was almost useless to multiply punishments. The most effective remedy he suggested wculd be to have the civilized nations of the world agree upon some desolate spot on the earth's surface, to whieh all anarchists who uphold &ssttssfna-. ,./k tion or the overthrow of government should be transported. In such a eona an a is a a his theories of living without a gov ernment and the world would be ritt of. 'W his presence. -J The senate passed a bill extending the life of the Industrial conMnlsslrmS'. until Feb. 15, next, to complete thei: work It now has in hand. The commit tee which will consider an appropriate. tribute to the late president McKinley was announced. The senate adjourned until next Monday.
