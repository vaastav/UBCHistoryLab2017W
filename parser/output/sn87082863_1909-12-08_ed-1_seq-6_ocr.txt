PRESIDENT TAFT'S MESSAGE COMPLETE (Continued from Page Three) struction of the Panama canai not out of current revenue but by bond issues was adopted in tho Spooncr net of 1902 and thcro seems to be no food reason for departing from the principle by which n part at least of tho bur den of tho cost of tho cnnnl fell upon our posterity, who are to onjov it: and thcro is all -tho more reason for this view because tho actual cost to date of tho canal, which is now half done aud will bo completed January 1, 1915, shows that tho cost of engineering and constructing will bo $297,7GG,000 in stead of $139,703,200 ns originally esti mated. In addition to engineering and con struction the other expenses including sanitation and government, and the amount paid for tho properties, tfic franchise, and the privilege of build iug tho cannl, increaso the cost by $75, 135,000 to a total of $373,201,000. Tho increaso in tho cost ot engineer ing and construction is duo to a sub stantial enlargement of the plan of construction by widoning tho canal 100 feet in the Culebra cut and by increas ing tho dimensions of tho locks to the tinder-estimate of the quantity of work to bo done under the original plan, and to an under-estimnto of tho cost of la bor and materials, both of which have greatly enhanced in prico since the or iginal estimate was made. Lower Estimates Tn order to avoid a deficit for the cusuing fiscal year, I directed tho heads of departments in preparation of their estimates to mako them as low as possible consistent with imperative governmental necessity. Tho result has been, as I am advised by tho secretary of tho treasury, that tho estimates of tho expenses of the government for tho fiscal year ending June 30,1911 that is, for '(banoxtv fiscnltfyear ate less by $55,003,000 tlM flic total of appropriations for the current fiscal year, and less by $94,000,000 than tho .estimates forthat year. - So far as tha'seMetaryJo'f. tho treas- i ii ry is auio to lorm a juugment as to futuro income and compare it with the expenditures for the next fiscal year, ending June 30, 1911, including tho payments on account of tho Panama Oanal and the public debt, there will he no deficit in tho year ending Juno r 30. 1911, but a small surplus of $712,- uuu. In the present estimates tho needs of tho departments and of tho covorn- ment hnvo been cut to the quick, so to " speak, and any assumption on tho part of tho congress, so often made in times past, that tho estimates have been pre pared nt tho expectation that they may ' lie reduced nnd will result in seriously hampering tho proper administration. The secretary of tho treasury points out what should be carefully noted in respect to this reduction in government- : al expenses for the next fiscal year, that the economies are of two kinds first, there is a saving in tho permanent ' administration of the departments, bu reaus and officers of the government; and, second, there is a present reduction in expenses by a postponement of projects and improvements that have to be Carried out, but which are now de f layed with tho hope that additional jf revenue in tho future will permit their execution without producing a deficit. Plan for Retrenchment Tt has been impossible in the prepara tion of estimates greatly to reduce the cost of permanent administration. This cannot bo dono without a thorough re organization of bureaus, offices and de partments. For the purpose of securing information which may enable the ex ecutive and the legislation branches to unite in a plan for tho permanent re duction of the cost of governmental ad ministration, tho treasury department has instituted nn investigation by one of the most skilled expert accountants in the United States. Tho result of his work in two or three bureaus, which if extended to tho entire government must occupy two or more years, has been to show much room for improvement and opportunity for substantial reductions in tho costs and increased efficiency of ad ministration. The objection of the in vestigation is to devise means to in crease tho average efficiency of each employe. There is great room for im provement toward these ends, not only by tho reorganization of bureaus and in the avoidance of duplication, but also in tho treatment of tho individual em ploye. Undor the present system it constant ly happens that two employes receive tho same salary when the work of one is far more difficult and important, and exacting than that of the other. Superior ability is not rewarded or encouraged. As the classification is now entirely by salary, an employe ofte'h rises to the highest class while doing the easiest work for which alone ho may bo fitted. The investigation ordered by my predecessor resulted in the recom mendation that tho civil service bo re classified according to the kind of work so that tho work requiring most applica tion and knowledge and ability shall receive most compensation. I believo such a change would bo fairer to tho whole force and would permanently im prove tho personnel of tho service Moro than this, ovory reform directed toward tho improvement in the effici ency of government employes must do pond on tho ability of the executive to eliminatcfrom the government servico those who are inefficient from any causo and as tho degree of efficiency in all tho departments is much lessened by tho retention of old employes who have outlived their energy and business fit ness it is indispensable to any proper system of economy thnt provision, bo made so that their separation from tho service shall bo easy and inevitable. It is impossible to make such provision un less thoro is adopted a plan of civil pensions. Most of the great industrial cor porations and many of tho well con ducted railways of tho country aro coming to tho conclusion thnt a system of pensions for old employes and the substitution therefor of younger and moro cnergotic servants promotes both economy and efficiency of administra tion. I am awaro that thero is a strong feeling in both houses of congress nnd possibly in tho country ngainst tho es tablishment of civil pensions and that this hns nearly grown out of the heavy Iiyrdon of military pensions which it has always beon tho policy of our govern ment to nssumo. but I am strongly con vinced that no other practical solution of tho difficulties presontcd by tho super annuation of civil servants can bo found than that of a system of civil pensions. rrito business nnd expenditures of tho government have expanded enormously since tho Spanish war, but as the rev enues hnvo incrensed in nonrly tho same proportion ns tho expenditures until re cently the attention of the public and of thoso responsible for tho government has not beon fastened upon tho question of reducing tho cost of administration. We cannot, in viow of tho advancing prices of living, hope to snvo money by a reduction in tho standard of salaries paid. Indeed, if any change is made in this regard, an increase rather than a decrenso will bo necessary; and tho only means of economy will bo in reducing the number of employes and in obtain ing groater averngo of efficiency from thoso rotaincd in the service. Close in vestigation nnd study needed to mako dofinito recommendations in this regard will consumo at least two years. I nbto with much satisfaction the organization in tho senate of a committeo on public j expenditures, nnd I tender to thnt com mitteo nil too nssistanco wnicii ino ex ecutive branch of tho government can possiblv render. Sugar Frauds I regret to rc.er to tho fact of tho discovery of extensive frauds in tho col lection of tho customs rovonuo nt Now York City, in which a number of subor dinate employes in the weighing nnd othor departments wore directly concern ed and in which the beneficiaries were the American Sugnr Refining company, and othors. The frauds consisted in the payment of duty on underweights of sugar. Tho government has reoovored from tho American Sugar defining com pany all that it is shown to hnvo been defrauded of. Tho sum was received iu full of tho amount due, which might have been recovered by civil suit against tho beneficiary of tho fraud, but there was an express reservation in the con; tract pf,settlemcnt by which tho settle ment should not interfere with or pro vent tho criminal prosecution ot every one who was found to bo subject to tho same. Criminal prosecutions are now pro ceeding ncainst a number of tho govern ment officers. Tho treasury department and tho department of justice are exert ing ever- effort to discovor all the wrongdoers, including tho officers and employes of tho companies who may have been prh'3' to tho fraud. It would seem to mo that an investigation of the frauds by congress nt present, pend ing tho probing by tho treasury depart ment and tho department of justice, as proposed, might by giyiug immunity nnd tlterwise, prove nn embarrassment- in so curing conviction of tho guilty parties. Maximum and Minimum Two features of tho now tariff ait call for special reforence. Byvirtuo of tho clauso known as tho "maximum and minimum" clauso, it is the duty of tho oxecutivo to consider tho lnws and prac tices of othor countries with referenco to the importation into those countries of tho products nnd merchandise of tho United States, and if tho executive finds such laws an dpractices not to bo un duly discriminatory against tho United States tho minimum duties provided in tho bill nro to go into force. Unless the president makes such a finding the maximum provided for in the bill, that is, an increaso of 25 per cent ad valorem Lover the 'minimum duties, are to be in force. Fear has been expressed that this power conferred and duly imposed on tho executive is likely to lend to n tariff war. T beg to express the hope and bolief that no such reesult need bo anticipated. Tho discretion granted to tho execu tive by tho terms "unduly discrimina tory" is wide. In order that the max imum duty shall bo charged against tho imports from what is necessary thnt ho shall find on the part of thnt country not only discriminations in its laws or its practice under them against the trado of the United States, but that the discriminations found shall be undue; that is, without good and fair reason. I conceive that this power was renoscd in tho president with the hope that the maximum duties might never be applied in any caso, but that tho power to npply them "would enable tho president and tho state department through friendly nego tiation to secure the elimination from tho lnws and practices undor them of any foreign country of that which is unduly discriminatory, no ono is seek ing n tariff war or a condition in which tho spirit of retaliation shall ne aroused. The new tariff law enables mo to appoint a tariff board to assist mo in connection with tho department of stato in the administration of tho maximum and minimum clnse of tho act and also to nssist officers of tho government in tho administration of tho entire law. An examination of the law aud an .under standing of tho nature of the facts which should bo considered in discharg ing the functions imposed upon the ex ecutive show that I havo tho power to direct tho tariff board to mako a com parative glossary and encyclopedia of tho terms used and articles embraced in tiio tariff law and to sccuro information as to the cost of production of such goods in this country and tho cost of their production in foreign countries. I havo therefore appointed a tariir board consisting of three members and havo directed them to perform all tho duties above described. This work will per haps take two or three years and T ask from congress a continuing annual ap propriation equal to that already made for its prosecution. T believe that tho work of this board will bo of prime utility and importance whenever con gress shall deem it wise again to re adjust tho costoms duties. If tho facts secured by the tariff board nro of such a character as to show generally that tho rates ot duty imposed by tho present tariff law nro excessive under the prin ciples of protection adopted in tho plat form of tho successful party at the lato election, I 'shall not hesitate to invito tho attention of congress to this fact nnd to tho necessity for action predi cated therein. Nothincr. however, halts business nnd interferes with tho courso of prosperity so much as tho threatened revision of tho tat iff, and until tho facta are nt hand, after caroful nnd do- libcrnto investigation, upon whick such revision can properly bo undertaken, it seems to be unwise.' to attempt it. The amount of misinformation that creeps into nrgumonts pro and con m respect to tariff rates is such as to rcnuiro tho kind of investigation thntT havo direct ed tho tariff board to mako. nn inves tigation undortakdn by it wholly with out respect to tho effect which" tho lacts may have in calling for a readjustment of tho rates of duty. Lower War Expense Iu tho interest of immediate economy nnd becauso of tho prospect of n deficit, I havo rcquirod a reduction in the esti mates of the war department for tho coming' Jlscnl year, which brings the total estimates' down to an nmbunt $45,000,000 less than tho, corresponding estimates for last .year.' This could only bo accomplished by cutting off now projects and suspending for the period of ono year all progress in'mili tury matters. For the snmo reason I have directed that the' army shall not 'bo recruited up to its present authorized strength. Theso moasurcs can hardly be more than 'tomporary to last until our revenues aro in bettor condition and until thowhole quostion of the exped iency of adopting a dofinito military policy can bo submitted to congress, for I am suro that tho interests of tho military establishment aro seriously in need of careful consideration by con gress. Tho laws regulating tho organi zation of our armed forces in tho oveut of war need to bo revised in order that tiio organization can bo modified so as to produce a force which would be moro consistently apportioned through out its numerous branches. To explain the circumstances upon which this opin ion is based would necessitate a lengthy discussion and I postpono it un til the first convenient opportunity shall arise to sond to congress a, special message upon this subject. The sccrotary of war calls attention to n number of needed changes in tho army, in all of which I concur but tho point upon which i placo most empua sis is tho need for an elimination bill providing for a method by which tho merits of officers shall have some effect upon their advancement and by which tho advancement of all may be accel erated by the effective elimination of a definite proportion of tho least efficient. There aro in every army, and certainly in ours, a number of officers who do not violate their duty in any such way as to givo reason lor a courtmartial or dis missal, but who does not show such ap titude, nnd skill and character for high command ns to justify their remaining in the nctivo servico to bo promoted." 1'rovision should bo niado by which they jnay bo retired on a certain proportion of their pay, increasing with their length of service at tho time of their retirement. Thcro js now a personnel Inw for tho navy which itsolf needs amendment nnd to which I shall make further reference. Such a law is need cd quite as much for tho army. Coast Defenses The coast dofenscs of tho United States proper aro geneinlly all that could bo desired nnd in somo respects they aro rather more elaborate than under present conditions arc needed to stop an enemy's licet from entering the harbors defended. Thero is, however, one placo where additional defense is badly needed tand that is nt tho mouth of Chesapenko bay, where it is pro posed to mako an artificial island for a fort which shall prevent an enemy's fleet from entering this most important strategical base of opcrations-ou the whole Atlantic nnd gulf coasts. I hope that appropriate legislation will be adopted to securd this dofeuse. The military and naval joint board have unanimously agreed that it would bo unwiso to make the largo expenditures which nt one timo were ctmtemplnted in the establishment of a naval base and station in tho Phillipinc islands and have expressed their judgment, in which I fully concur, in favor of nink ing an extensive naval base at Pearl Harbor, near Honolulu, and not in the Philippines. This docs not dispense with tho necessity for the comparative ly small appropriations required to fin ,sh the proper coast defenses -in tb.9 Phillipines now under construction on the island of Corrigidor and elsewhere or to complete a suitable repair' station and coaling supply station at Olongapo, whore is the floating dock Dewey. 1 hope that this recommendation of the joint board will end the discussion as to the comparative merits of Manila bay and Olongapo as naval stations and will lead to prompt measures for the proper equipment and defense, of Pearl Harbor. The return of tho battleship fleet from its voyage around tho world, in moro efficient oondition than when it started, was a noteworthy event of in terest alike to citizens nnd tho naval au thorities o,f the world. Besides the benoficial and far-reachine effect on our personal and diplomatic relations in the countries which the fleet visited, marked success of the ships in steam ing around tho world in all weathers on schedule time, has increased respect for our navy and has added to our national prestige. Our enlisted personnel recruited from all sections of the country is young and cnergotic and representative of the nn tional spirit. It is, moreover, owing to its capable of quick training into the modern man of warsman. Our of ficers aro earnest and zealous in their profession but it is a rcgrcttnblo fact that the highor officers nro old for their resposibilities for the modern navy and tho admirals do not arrive nt flag rank young enough to obtain adequate training in their duties as flag officers. This need for reform in tho navy has beon ably and enrnestly presented to congress by my predecessor and I also urgently recommend tho subject for consideration. Navy Reorganization Early in tho coming session a cpm parativo plan for the reorganization of tho officers of nil, corps of the navy will bo presented to congress and I hopo it will meet with action suited to its urgency. Owing to the necessity for economy iu expenditures I havo directed tho curtailment of recommendations for na val appropriations so that tlioy are $38, 000,000 less than the corresponding es timntcs of last year and the request for now' naval construction is limited to two first-class battleships and one ro pair vessel. Tho use of a navy is for military pur poses and there hns been found need in tho department of a military branch dealing directly with tho Military uses of the fleet. The secretary of the navy has also felt the lack ofTresponsible ad isers to aid him in reaching conclu sions and deciding important matters between co-ordinate branches of the de partment. To secure theso results ho is- inaugurating a tentative plan involv ing certain changes in the organization of tho navy department including the huv j'iiiua, uu in which nave ueen found by the attorney general to bo in accordnnco with tho law I havo ap proved tho execution of tho plan pro posed bocause of tho greator efliciency and economy it promises. Tho generosity of congress hns pro vided in tho present naval observatory thoAmost magnificent and exponsivo as tronomical cstablismont in tho world.' It is being used for certain naval pur poses which might easily and adoquato ly bo subserved by a small division connected with tho navy department at only a fraction of tho cost df tho pres ent naval observalory. Tho official board of visitors estnblishod by congress and appointed in 1901 expressed its conclu sion thnt tho official head of the nh servatory should bo an eminent astron omor appointed by tho president, by and with tho advice and consent of tho senate, holding his plnco by a tenure at least ns permanent ns that of the superintendent of tho coast survey or tho head of the geological survey and not merely ns a 'detail of two or three years duration. I fully concur in this judgment and urge a provision by law for tho appointment ot such a director - It may not be necessary to take tho observatory out of tho navy depart ment and put it into another depart ment in which opportunity for scien tific research afforded by tho observa tory would seom to bo moro appropri ate, though I believo such n transfer in tho long run is tho best policy. t I am sure, howof'c'r, I express tho desire of the astronomers and thoso learned in the kindred sciences when I urgo upon congress that tho naval observatory bo now dedicated to science under control of a man of science who can, if need be, render all the sorvico to tho navy department wliich this observatory now renders nnd still furnish to tho ,world the discoveries in astronomy that n great astronomer using such a plant would bo likely to make. "The Laws Delays" Tho deplorable delays in tho admin istration ot civil nnd criminal law nave received the attention of, committees of tho American Bar association nnd of many stato bar associations, as well ns the thought of judges and jurists. In my judgment a change in judicial procedure, with a view to reducing its expense to privnto litigants in civil cases aud facilitating the despatch, of business nnd final decision in both civil and criminal cases, constitutes the greatest nded in our American institu tions. I do not doubt for.ono moment that much of tho lawless violence and cruelty exhibited in lynchings is di rectly duo to the uncertainties and in justice growing out of the delays in trials, judgments nnd the executions thereof by our courts. Of course, these remnrks ns well as the administration of justice in state courts as that that in federal courts, and without making invidious distinction it is perhaps not too much to say" that, speaking gcncfal ly tho defects nrc less in the federal courts than in tho stato courts. But they are very great in the federal courts. The expedition with which bus iness is disposed of both en the civil and tho criminal side of English courts under modern rules of procedure makes tho delays in our courts even archaic and barbarous. The procedure in tho federal courts should furnish an example for tho stato courts. 1 presume it is impossible, with out an amendment to tho constitution, to unite under one form of action the proceedings at common law and pro ceedings in equity in the federal courts but it is certainly not impossible by a "statute to simplify nnd make short and direct tho procedure both nt law nnd in equity in those courts. It is not impossible to cut down still moro than it is cut down tho jurisdiction of the supreme court so as to confine it nlmost wholly to statutory aud constitutional sucstions. Under tho present statutes the equity and admiralty procedure in the federal courts is under tho control of the supreme court but in the pressure of business to which that court is sub jected it is impossible to hope that a radical and proper reform of the federal equity procedure can be brought about. i tnereiore recommend legislation pro viding for the appointment by the pres ident of a commission with authority to examino the law and equity proced. ure of tho federal courts of lirst an stnnco, tho law of appeals from thoso courts to the courts of appeals and in tho supremo court, and the costs im posed in such procedure upon tho pri vatc litigants and upon tho privnto treasury and make irccomuroiidatiion with a view to simplifying and expo diting tho procedure so far as possible and making it as inexpensive us, may be to tho litigant of little means. Tho plntform of the successful party 4ii tho last electron contained tue fol lowing: The republican party will nt all times uphold tho integrity of the courts, state and federal, and will over insist that teir powers to enforce their process nnd to protect life, liberty and proporty shall be preserved inviolntc. Wo be lieve, however, that the rules of pro cedure in tho federal courts with re spect to tho issuance of the writ of in junction should bo more accurately de fined by statute, and that no injunction or temporary restraining order should bo issued without notice, except where irreparable injury would result from de lay, in which -aso a speody hearing thereafter should be grantci)'. "As to Injunctions I recommend that in compliance with tho promise thus made appropriate leg islation be adopted. The endsof justice will best be met and tho chief cause of complaint against ill-considered injunc tions without notice will be removed by tho enactment of a statute forbid ding hereafter tho issuing of any in junction or restraining order, whether tempornry or permanent, by any feder al court without previous notice and a reasonable opportunity tw bo heard on behalf of the parties to bo enjoined; un less it shall appear to the satisfaction of tho court that tho delay necessary to give such notice nnd hearing would result in irrcparablo injury to tho com plainant and unless also tho court shall from tho ovidenco make a written find ing which shall bo spread upon tho court minutes that immediate and irreparable injury is likely to ensue to the com plainant, and shall define tho injury, stato why it is irreparable and shall also endorse on tho order issued tht dato and tho hour of tho issuanco of the order. Moreover, evory such injunc tion and restraining ordor issued with out previous notice and opportunity by the defendant to bo hoard should by force xjf tho statuto expire and bo of no effect aftor seven days from tho issuance thereof or within any time less than that period which tho court may fix, unless within such soven. days or such less period the injunction or order is extended after previous notico and opportunity to bo heard. My judgment is that tho passage of such nn act, which really cmobics the best practico in equity and is very like tho rulo now in- forco in som courts, will prevent the issuing of ill advised ordors of injunction without notico and will render such orders when issued much less objectionable by the short timo in which they may remain effective. The jurisdiction of tho government over intorstato commorco has been left in tho passage of tho so-called "Sher man anti-trust law," and tho "intor stato commorco law" and its nmend- ments. Tho developments in tho opera tion of those laws, as suown oy indict ments, trials, judicial decisions and oth or sources of information, call for a dis cussion and somo suggestions ns to amendments. These I prefer to embody in a special message instead of includ ing them in tho present communication, and I shall avail myself of tho first convenient opportunity to bring these subjects to tho attention of the con gress. Needs New Jail My predecessor transmitted to tho con gress a special message on January 11, 1909, accompanying tho report of the commissioners theretofore appointed to investigate tho jail, workhouso, etc., in tho District of Columbia, in which ho directed attention to tho report us sotting forth vividly "the really out rageous oenditions in the workhouse and jail." The congress has taken action in pur suance of tho recommendation of that report and of tho president to the ex tent of appropriating funds and enact ing flio necessary legislation for the es tablishment of a workhouso and reform atory. No action, however, has been tnlsnn 1- ihi lAnirrifM with TPHTlOCt to w the jail, the conditions of which aro still antiquated and unsaniuirj. j. earnestly recommend the passage of a sufficient appropriation to secure ( a thorough remodeling of that institution to be made without delay. It is a reproach to tho national government that almost under shadow of tho capi Col dome prisoners should bo confined in a building destitute of tho ordinary decent appliances requisite to cleanli ness nnd sanitary conditions. Postal Rate Attacked Tho deficit every year in the post offico department is largely caused by tho low rate of postage of one cent a pound charged on second class mail mat tor, which includes not only newspapers but magazines, and miscellaneous peri odicals. The actual loss growing out of the transmission of this second class mail matter at 1 cent a pound amounts to about $03,000,000 a year. The aver age cost of tho transportation of this matter is more than 9 cents a pound. It appears that the average distance over which newspapers are delivered to their customers is 291 miles, whilo tho average haul of magazines is 1,049 and of miscellaneous periodicals 1,128 miles. Thus, tho average haul of tho maga zine is three and one-half times thnt of tho miscellaneous periodical, nearly four times the haul of the daily news paper, yet all of them pay tho same postago rato of 1 cent a pound. The statistics of, 1907 show that second class mail matter constituted C391 per cent of the woight'of nil the mail and yield ed only 5.19 per cent of the revenue. Tho" figures given aro startling nnd show tho payment by tho government of nn enormous subsidy to the newspaper magazines and periodicals, and congress may well consider whether radical steps should not bo taken to reduce the deficit in tho postoffico department caused by tins, discrepancy between the actual cost of transportation and tho compensation exacted therefore. A great saving might be made, amounting to much more than half of tho loss, by imposing upon magazines and periodicals a higher rate of post age. Thoy are much heavier man news papers and contain a mucn nigncr pro portion of advertising to rending matter and the averago distance of their trans portation is three and one-half times "as great. I commend the whole subject to con gress, not unmindful of tho spread of intelligence wliich a low charge for car rying newspapers and periodicals as sists. I very much doubt, however, the wisdom of a policy which constitutes so largo a subsidy and requires addjtion- III lUXiUlUU IU lIKJCk 11- Postal Savings Banks The second subject worthy of mention in tho postoffico department is -the real necessity nnd entire practicability of establishing postnl savings banks. The successful party at the last election de clared in fnvor of postal savings banks and although tho proposition finds op ooncnts in many parts of tho country, I am convinced that tho peoplo desire such banks nnd am sure that when the banks aro furnished they will bo pro ductive of the utmost good. The postnl savings banks aro not constituted for the postoffico creating competition with othor banks. Tho rato of interest upon deposits to which they would be lim ited would be so small as to prevent their drawing deposits away from othor banks. I believo them to bo necessary in or der to offer a proper inducement to thrift and saving to n great many peo plo of small means who do not now have banking facilities and to whom such a 8vstem would offer an oppor tunity for tho accumulation of cap ital. Thoy will furnish a satisiactory sub stitute, based on sound principle nnd nctunl successful trial in nearly all the countries of tho world, system of gov ernment guaranty of deposits now being adopted in soveral western states, which with deference to thoso who advocate it seems to me to havo in it tho seeds of demoralization to conservative bank ing nnd certain financial disaster. The question of how tho money depos ited in postal savings banks shall bo invested is not freo. from difficulty, but believo that- a satisfactory provision for this purpose was insorted as an amendment to the bill considered by tho senate at its last session. It has been proposed to delay tho consideration of legislation and bring a nostal savings bank until after the report of tho mone tary commission. This report is likely to be delayed, and properl yso, becauso of the necessity for careful deliberation and close .investigation. I do not 8co why tho ono should tio up with tho (Continued on Pago Seven) Silver Belt's Want Ads
