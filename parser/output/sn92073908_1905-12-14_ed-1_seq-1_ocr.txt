VOL.XXI. 5ewSeries--Vol. DITOI'S OBSERVATIONS OF The two most notable gatherings in the State for some time were the North Carolina Methodist Conference at Wilson two weeks ago and the Two Notable Gatherings. Bapti8t state Coavention ,n week . ago. At both of these gatherings there were fine and encouraging reports of the work done in the State this year by these two great religious denominations. The citizenship of the State can compile no index which will eyen suggest the power for good to all the people there is in the work of the ministers and laymen in the churches of all denominations. Eyery man in the State ought to be glad to help sup port the churches about him whether he has any experimental knowledge of religion or whether he simply gives assent to its claims upon men. Without the power of churches our civilization would be a misnomer and would count for naught. t t t t Many persons in discussing the cotton situation, under the fluctuating and uncertain prices, such as have prevailed this season and which pre Uniform Prices. they say, that the farmer should be able to make reasonably accurate calculation at planting time what he may expect to get for bis cotton the next fall.. The correctness and wisdom of this view any one can see at a glance ; and perhaps every farmer would be glad to see such conditions pre vail. They do say, also, that the spinners and manufacturers would be glad to see the same conditions. This would enable the farmers to act with greater wisdom and prudence in the employing of labor and in the purchasing of fertilizsrs, and it would also enable the manufacturer to place his contracts for outputs with more confidence and intelligence. The speculator might be put out of a job, or the profits to his job might be lowered, but cf this the farmer would take little note. tttt In these flush times with the farmers, people in the towns begin to think about what will bring prosperity to them also. One of the surest ways for Prosperity to a Town. mand. This is what farmers are doing. They are producing cotton and peanuts and tobacco, ehickens and eggs and turkeys, and other things for which there is a demand. The prosperous towns In JSorth Carolina are the manufacturing towns, and not those towns that depend upon buying things from one person and selling them to another. Of course this is done in all towns, but It is not what brings prosperity. Towns like Charlotte, Greens boro and High Point, which make things, are the towns that know noth ing about dull days and hard times. Of course almost any town can now and then have a period of thrift on the simple commerce of the people, . but this does not last, unless it has some exceptional advantage in freight rates, trucking or the like. The towns that are prosperous year in and year out are the towns that make things, let us say again. tttt Tub President's message to congress was quite lengthly filling twenty columns of closely set matter in a newspaper. It is a most readable paper and deals with perhaps every impoitant subject Che President's Message. fhe merlcan Congre58. Pre8ident Roosevelt is a master of English and all his papers aro. attractive in style and expression. Some able men could have discussed the same subjects with equal clearness, perhaps, in much shorter space. To many the read in; of such a long message might seem a task, but to one who feels a real interest in the affairs of the country the reading of the meesage could hard ly ba called tiresome. Perhaps the most interesting feature of the message is what the President has to say about railroads and raiiroad rates. This discussion be brings under the general, head of corporations. He thinks that proper industrial conditions both for individuals and corporations should be secured by ihe National Government, since there is little hope of doing many things that ought to be done by State governments. And for certain connections along this line the President believes that if the pres ent powers of the National Government are not adequate, the Constitution ebould be amended so as to make them adequate. These observations about the control of corporations lead to the discussion of Ihe power of the Inter-State Commerce Commission, and to the discussion of railroad rates. The President believes that if rates are too high they ought to be lowered. In his own words : "In my judgment the most important pro vision which such law should contain is that conferring upon some compe tent administrative body the power to decide, upon the ctse baing brought before it, whet her a given rate prescribed by a railroad is reasonable and just and if it is found to be unreasonable and unjust then, after full inves tigation of the complaint, to prescribe the limit of rate beyond which it shall not be lawful to go the maximum reasonable rate as it is commonly called this decision to go into effect within a reasonable time and to ob tain from thence onward, subject to review by the courts" Those who heard the President's speech m Kaleigh on tte occasion ol his visit to the State Fair in October, will remember he uttered some such sentiments there The people generally believe that the President is right in his pos ition concerning railroad rales. Omitting the many subjects which he, discussed with clearness and ability, it is interesting to note his emphasis on the merits of individuals. . It is not, says the President, the question of Oman's riches or poverty, wisdom or ignorance, that is to decidede his tZh as a citizen, but his character and real merit and bis just claim to a TecenULe Whatever el- may be criticised or commended in the Presi tatfMr meseage.this meets the.pproval of every really true man, of whatever pollticial faith or affiliation.
