The object was two-fold. It was to colonize Republican voters in the Northwest, ami to open a market for otherwise unsalable rail? road lands. The emigrants almost invariably directeii their steps toward Kilians, where (so effectosiiiy did tin old Border-Roflbvii Detnoc racy settle the poUtiee ot the State for all tune) the importation of Republican voters would have been about as useful as a project lor taigating the Atlanlic Ocean; but to tins fact the Democratic journalists shut their oyOO. With equally calm disdain they surveyed the further fact thai the land alleged to be'in the tnaiket was in a region lar nway tiom the fuKiltvcs' line of ui.uch ; indeed, thut it lay lnhiud them. In time these luisrepreeentu tions were silenced, principilly perhaps be? cause nobody would believe them. The BOSTOOI found work und shelter in Kunsas, und their simple story of the wronifs they hud siilleted aud the reusous for their removui convinced everybody who heard it. At the time of tli^> Kunsas iBJBllglltloaj it was statetl by iniiny persons who had UHeOli gated this curious movement that the colmed BSSJSBS all over the Cotton States were tesi b-sH and dissatisfied, and that a much more extensivi exotlus might lie looked for at the eloSC of the Winter.

This is one question winch BUS) l?e squarely met. It cannot be kept out of a Presi? dential canvass. Senators ami Representa? tives must take sides, mid it would he the puit of Wieden to choose the right sitle and choose it at once. There is a dominating moral element in the financial questions which have Im e i before the jKHiple for the last twenty years, and, with the history of these years fie-h in iinnd, the man who enmot trust the moral sense of the people is worse than an infidel. The country has a collective conscience. It belie yea ia paying debts, and paying them in thespi.it of the contract.
