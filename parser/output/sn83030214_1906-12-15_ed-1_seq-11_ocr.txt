This is due to the arrival of southern eggs, which always come In during the present month, but are a trifle earlier this year than usual. It all depends on the weather now whether eggs go on falling In price till they reach their lowest point in spring, or whether they go UP again. Butter does not share the fortunes of eggs, and is still rising. The price for tub butter at Washington Market yesterday was 37 cents, an advance of two cents since last week, and print butter was 40 cents. Turkeys have gone up again to their Thanks giving price of 25 cents a pound, but they are worth It. and are getting better every day. Ducks, geese and chickens, which are a.so In fine condi tion, are 22 cents a pound. Game, like the poultry, continues to Improve. Wild ducks are still coming in Quite plentifully and remain at about $2 50 to $5 and $6 a pair. Rab bits, which were due long ago, only came in dur ing tha last week, and are celling at 40 to 60 cents a pair. They are in pretty fair condition, but not as good as if the winter had been colder, as they require cold weather to fatten them. They are scarce, and the storage ones bring almost as good a price as those that are fresh killed. There Is nothing particularly new In the fish market, except that some, things have gone a little higher Spanish mackerel, which was 23 to 30 cents a pound retail at Fulton Market last week, is now 40 cents. Lobsters; are high at 35 cents and are likely to get higher all through the winter. Scal lops are still very high and scarce at 75 to 90 cents a quart and are getting scarcer. PhcWc salmon is "7. to 30 cents, and roe shad $2 *» apiece. Blueflsh 16 80 rents. Nearly all the fresh nsh except cod and haddock come from the South. The market is filled with Florida oranges, and they are at their best and cheapest at 25 to 10 cents a dozen. Grape fruit continues, as for some time past, at 23 cents for three or h cents apiece. Mal aga grapes are 20 cents a pound and hothouse ones $1. Strawberries are 75 cents to 8. 25 a basket. Layer flgs are 18 cent* a pound and loose ones 30. Dates are three pounds for a quarter; apples are 26 to 60 cents a dozen. Florida is supplying a good many of th* fresh vegetables In the markets. Excellent lettuce is coming- from there at 25 cents for four heads, while Florida tomatoes are 20 cents a pound. Llttl© green onions from New Orleans are live cents a bunch. Parsley is five cents a bunch and celery from Rochester is 15 cents a bunch of three stalks. Romalne salad is 10 cents a head and mushrooms SI a pound. Christmas greens are beginning to >»c displayed, but are. unhappily, very scarce and expensive. Evergreen roping is S3 a hundred yards, a dollar more tnan last year, and holly is $4 a case. just twice as much as last year. Mistletoe from France Is 10 cents a twig, and a small twig at that. Holly wreaths are Is cents apiece, and dyed roping, which has a very artificial appearance, Is $2 50 a hundred yards. £LEA^WiNC> 

"BOOZE DROPS." That the tale ct that variety of candy known as "booze drops" to children 13 more common than is supposed, eeems to be indicated by the eimultaneous discovery of the practice recently In Waehinsnon and in Canton, Ohio. A strict in vestigation has been ordered In both cases. The facts -were brought to the attention of the "VTashtncton health authorities by a mother who has eeveral children attending the Central Hiirh School, and who complained that sev eral shops in the neighborhood were eellins candy containing- alcoholic flavors to the chil dren of the school. The candy Is now being analyzed, and the chairman of the District Ex cise Board. Mr. Darneille. has been asked to make a report on whether the sale of liQuor In these small quantise would render the sellers amenable to the excise laws. If co. he has been directed to undertake the prosecution o? the offenders for selling liquor without a license. Mr Daxnellle aaya that this particular plan has never been brought to his attention before, and he will be obliged to ask the, advice of the Corporation Counsel upon the interpretation of the law.

Klober. a Chicago clubwoman, which, while It seems hardly practicable for this vale of tears, at least at present. Is cal culated to give the mistress of maids something to think about. Mrs. Klober's remedy 1b in sub stance as follows: All advertising for servant girls to be done through the state employment bureaus. Official records to be kept of the movements of girls, the causes of their discharge or leaving the previous place of employment, etc Intellljr^nre offlceß to be abolished. Advertising for girls by individual!' to be pro hibited "Fancy the Joys of a life without intelligence Qfn- es or the Inevitable alternative of a string of girls calling at the house!" the New York housewife wiH exclaim. That's what the Chi cago clubwomen did when Mrs. Klober unfolded her scheme. Mrs. Klober asked for a committee to analyze her novel prescription and report later, and she got IL "I believe that n-.-ords are tiie foundation of civilizatiotv 1 said Mrs. Klober in justineation of her views. "When the North American Indian went roaming around and no record was kept of him It waa Impossible to civilize him. A re.-ord should be made of the movements of servant girls. The girls prefer to go where no record Is kept of them, for I recently went to the free state employment oflVe and not a girl was to be had, while an intelligence office had several. The amount of wag»s offered has little to do with the sen-ant difficulty. I know of a family which offered $15 a we^k. with two afternoona off and no children, and yet It conM not get a girl."

"We could see if the place is over crowded. There Is a place In East 44th street that ought to be inspected to see if the sanitary conditions are good. CHILD LABOR IX MIXES. Conditions in Pennsylvania Described at Annual Convention, Cincinnati. Dec 14/ — At the annual convention of the National Child Labor Committee reports w<*re received from state committees, following which thera was a discussion of legal standards and methods of enforcement of child labor laws. Owen R. Love joy, assistant secret.! ry. made, an address. Ho said, in partj The National Child Labor Committee has investi gated child labor in the bituminous fields of Penn sylvania, Maryland and West Virginia, In one borough of Pennsylvania, with about 1,900 mine workers, it is estimated that not less than 175 or 200 boys under sixteen are employed. They work as doorboys. drivers, couplers and runners, while many help the miners load coal into the mine cars. The reason assigned for the large number >1t boys working in this borough was given by the superintendent of schools: "There are too many workers in the mines, so as to have more tenants for the company houses and more customers at the company store. All art* expected to trade at the company -• re. Then, If a man has a targe family and wants to make, a decent living, he talmas his young boys in and is allowed extra cars for them Sometimes they are so small their dinner buckets drag on the. ground, and the father has to do most of the work. Other causes of child labor were found to be racial traits; the attitude of the mine management, the general conditions of labor and defective laws end school opportunities. HOLLISTER BABY FOUND.

[From Th» Tribune Bureau.] ■Washington. D«c. 14. — United States will not build a Dreadnought. At least it is not re garded as likely that provision will be made for such a ship anywhere in the Immediate future. It is understood In the Inner circles of Congress that the President does not approve an attempt on the part of thia country to outdo Great Britain in constructing a monster flshtins ma chine, that he deprecates the policy of each na tion trying to outdo Its neighbors, believes that a halt must come some time, and that the United States might as well halt before it en ters the race as later. Despite the fact that plans were sent yester- j day to Congress and Immediately made public j for a monster battleship of the Dreadnought : class. It is regarded as far more likely that a plan providing for one or two 16,000 to 17.000 ; ton shies will command the President's ap proval,- and that provision for at least one ves sel of the Louisiana and Connecticut type will be made at this session. It will be remembered that the President tn his mesage dealt with the subject of Increasing the navy with a moderation which proved sadly . disappointing to the more vociferous advocates of a big navy, and unless prominent members , of the Naval Affairs committees of the two ; houses have sadly misunderstood the President. | the authorization of one or at moat two battle- I ships of the Louisiana and Connecticut class j will not only meet with his approval, but will I receive his hearty support. The prompt publication yesterday of the plans '■ for the proposed rival of the Dreadnought Is also regarded as additional evidence that It Is neither the desire nor the expectation of th« j administration, to construct a. ship along those , lines.
