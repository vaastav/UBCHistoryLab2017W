It Is not intellectual work that in jures the brain, says a medical journal, but emotional excitement. Most men nan stand the severest thought and itudy of which their brains are capable, and be none the worse for it; for neither thought nor study interferes with tho reouperative influenoe of jleepL It is ambition, anxiety, and lisuppointment, the hopes and fears, ib® loves and hates of our livea that wear out our nervous system and en ianger the balance of the brain. Were men generally as gallant and attentive to their wives as is the os trich, women would be happier and have more ostrich feathers to wear. When you see an ostrich feather on a . lady’s hat or in the hat of a uniform knight or soldier, think of the ostrich and wonder if ths one who cares for the woman thus adorned is as much of a man as is the husband of the hen that laid the eggs from which came the birds that yielded the plumes that add so muoh grace and beauty to femi nine head-gear. i. Tr men were like watches. If they were as clean inside and outside. If they kept such good hours; were so well behaved. If they could be trusted as well in the dark. If they could do their work as faithfully, and without grumbling. If they were as content and satisfied with their environment. If they did as much for others and did it as freely. If they were in all things as true and reliable as a good watch. kh9 Paradise Lost in the old Eden would be transformed into the heaven of whioh the little children sing. Thb trouble with all our institutions of correction is the difficulty of break ing away from the old idea of legal penalties without rushing to the other extreme. Few tasks are more difficult than to make people understand the legitimate object of these penalties; which la primarily, or should be. neither the punishment of the offend er nor the reformation of him. but the protection of society. That pro tection is the only warrant that exists for restraint upon the individual; and It is an a part of such protection, by the preventing future acts of crime, that reformation of the offender has come to play so large a part in the later study of penology. Prison managers should not lose sight of the fact that prisons are places of punishment Neither should they ignore the equally important function of reformation whenever it can be ob served. If any prisons keep their in mates la luxurious idleness it is not in accordance with the principles of the reformatory system, but contrary to it It was the old bridewell system that kept its prisoners in idleness; while it Is the design of the reforma tory system to make them work. It }S not necessary to be brutal in order to make imprisonment a penalty; and deny the prisoner an occasional bouquet, a Christmas card, or the chance to read when his work is dona would be simply a reaction to the dark ages of brutality. There is a force at work through out all Christendom that defies char ity. It was not always thua Eves now there comes to these Mg towns men who look with horror on the ev idences of misery that greet their eyes, and turn back to rural simplicity with a feeling that they would die If con stantly surrounded by so muoh human suffering. Even citizens now dwell ug in the city can remember when no hungry child sobbed itself to sleep. But the town has increased in popula tion and wealth. Magnificent homes line its avenues and palaces of trade offer wonderful fabrics for the opu lent customer. Wealth abounds, and yet doth poverty much mere abound. And the chimes ring gayly for feasts and solemnly for fasts. But the great world wonders not that Christianity is a failure, but that it has not yet turned its attention to one of the great causes which have barred its progress and made mockery of its prayers. Perhaps nothing tends more effect ually to make society er the individual poor and weak and thin, mentally and morally, than intentional ignorance of things important to all the interests of human life. Whether it is due to silly vanity, to fear of fashion's power, or to a cowardly dread of conscience and its dictates, it is always enfeebling to the character and debasing to the life, Those who yield to it shut out from themselves and the cliques to which they may belong much of the beet talent and strength of the world.

William Johnson, of Denver, in the : employ of Cunningham & Co., who run a i large mill at Ivanhoe, was struck and in ! stanti . - killed by an engine near that place (Friday. He was terribly mangled. At the time of his death he was muffled up about the head and ears to protect him from the cold, which was intense, and it is supposed that he did not hear the approach of tbe engine that caused his death. Ev 1 ery effort was made to warn the ill-fated i man. The whistle was blown rej-eatedly and tbe air-brakes applied, but his doom ! could not be averted. Tbe accident hap i pened immediately after the engine had rounded a sharp curve. Johnson was 24 years old and unmarried. A strange accident befell Charles Cheesman, working for the Porter Coal I company, near Durango, last week. The ! company is having a shaft sunk about a mile and a quarter from the present work ings as a sort of prospect to investigate the depth, thickness and quality of tbe vein. Cheesman had placed two shots, and after lighting them was hoisted to the top of tbe twenty foot shaft, when the wind lass broke and the man was precipitated to the bottom with tbe windlass on top of him. While he was at the bottom both blasts went off, throwing the stone with great force, but strange to say, the man was not killed. The men with him—in stead of investigating his condition, be lieving him dead, went to the mine, a mile , and a quarter away, and telephoned to town | that he was killed. They then returned with help, prepared to pick the pieces of the man out of the shaft. The man was J taken out only slightly injured, he having I a cut over one eye and other cuts on his ; cheeks and his band skinned somewhat. THE NEW

Louisville, Kentucky, suffered from several terrible liras on tfee itit The most disastrous occurred in the candy factory of F. A. Menne A Co. The origin af the Are is a mystery. Forty girls were at work wrapping candy on the fourth floor and all were not able to escape. The tire was out at 11 o'clock, and tbeu the work of taking out the bodies began The bodies of six girls were at once taken out, burned beyond identification. G. T. Menne, brother of tne senior member of the firm, is supposed to have burned to death, and the firemen thought at least five other girls would be found as soon as the hot embers would permit of a thorough search. The fire cut off escape by the stairway leading from the fourth tioor where the girls were at work. Many lumped from the windows to a secoud story projection and escaped with broken limbs and bruised bodies. Others got out unhurt. The fire is supposed to bare arisen from one of the candy furnaces, which, possibly exploded. At any rate the flames com rcunicated with the new and big stock of Cnristmas fireworks. The first explosion among the fireworks scattered the firebrands in the shape of Christmas fireworks all over the store The skylight fell In and the entire stock, much of which was highly inflammable, was fiercely blazing almost instantly. The skyrockets, Homan candies, giant fire crackers were so wild in their havoc that they impeded the work of the firemen and made it exceedingly dangerous .'or them to work until the last one had exploded. Troublesome Cheyenne Indians. Orders have been received from headquarters in St. Paul for troops at Fort Keogh to go to tbeCheyeona Agency, as the reds are dancing, in violation of the orders of the agency, and have notified the agent that they intend to make an attack. Since the order of the general land office, allowing those settlers who claimed prior rights within the reservation to mass final proof thereon, trouble has been feared, and the Indians have made threats. Sheriff Jones and C. H. Thompson returned from the agency last night with one of two In dians arrested for killing cattle. Tie otnerjone managed to escape. Consider able difficulty was experienced in making the capture, as the reds put every obstacle possible In the way. Considerable alarm is felt in that section Danger is fear.d from roving reds bent on plunder and mur der more than concerted action. In a Burning Mine. Another serious mining accident is reported from England. On the Vth the Liinor mine of the Whedle Coal Company, near Weslford, Yorkshire, took lire be fore the miners had all entered. Twenty men were already down, however, when a puff of smoke gave notice of the catas trophe to those about above ground. Strenuous efforts were made at once to rescue those in the mine, and several men volunteered, at the risk of thsir lives, to aid in the work. Of the twenty, fifteen were brought up alive; but five remain unaccounted for. and it is feared that they are dead. The fire continued to gain head way, and at latest aocount was raging fiercely. France After the Brazilians. The French government has on hand a very serious question with the Brazilian government and steps have been taken to bring the matter to settlement. It is claimed by the French government that during the troubles growing out of the action of President Fonseca in dissolving the Brazilian Congress and assuming the dictatorship twelve Frenchmen were killed in Rio Janeiro by agents of Fonseca. The French consul at Rio Janeiro has been Instructed by his government to demand of the Peixotto government reparation for the killing of these men. Twelve Hundred Chinamen. The 1,200 Chinese who were throw* i out of employment by the coilapse of the Tehuantepec railway project are making their way in a body through Mexico to wards the United States, pillaging and committing depredations in the country through which they pass. All are in a destitute condition and are unable to find employment. They were imported into Mexico under contract to work on the railway and,owing to the failure of that enterprise, the con tractors were heavy losers at the hands of Salvador Malo, the promoter of the scheme, who is now in London, England, und the Chinese were suddenly thrown out of work with no money upon which to live. Kansas Railroad Law. The Supreme Court of Kansas bus banded down an opinion in the case of the state against the Kansas Central and Union Pacific railroad companies. This was the mandamus proceedings brought by the attorney general to compel the Kansas Central to relay und repair their tracks. The court held that it could not m ike a de cree or enter a judgment until a complete hearing of all the issues in the case could be held. The decision, in a measure, give* the board of railroad commissioners a Mack eye, as it bolds that the board has only ad visory power ana that the Supreme Court alone can compel the enforcement of its decrees. The decision will probably result in the legislature conferring on the board of rail road commissioners the power to enforce its decrees without the delays consequent upon bringing legal process through the Supreme Court. The German-American Agreement. Copies of the correspondence be tween the late Count von Arco Valley, in the capacity of German minister to the United States, to the Washington govern ment regarding the prohibition of the ad mission of American pork into Germany, were to-day distributed among the men bers of the Reichstag The correspondence shows that during the negotiations Germany offered to admit American agricultural products on the terms as those of Austria and other coun tries, whereupon Count Arco Valley wus informed that President Harrison con sidered that this concession obviated the necessity of his applying his discretionary powers in the matter of imports from Ger many, and instructions were issued assur iug Germany of continued exemptions from duty for her products coming under sec tion 3 of the McKinley tariff law.

Did you ever wonder why it is that the great railroad* of the country are constantly improving their roadbed*, adopting improved rails and employing •section gang* ’ to constantly keep their track* in the best condition? I will tell you why it is. Y- s« ago it was found that the cost of running a great railroad line was decreased by every improvement which tended to lessen the grades and make the track smooth and hs- ’. and the best sngineer ing taiont in t world has been em ployed to these railroads to their present condition of excellence. Tw«o ty-fiv»* years ago. before the general adoption of the long solid*faced steel rail, the power required to move the rolling stock was considerably greater than at present In 1870 it cost the New York Central railroad company about one and one-sixth cents to move each ton of freight over 1 mile of rail road. This seem* a very small sum but as small as it may appear it was reduced in 1889 to about ive mill* Other railroad line* show a corre sponding decrease in running eipcn*«s all due to the improvement of the tracks or roadbed. Next to water nothing is so destruc tive of a good road surface as a heavy vehicle running on narrow w., .* It has been proven over and ore • again that wheels with 4}-inch tire* cause only one-half the wear on a r :.J that results from the use of wheels with Si inch tires. It used to be the rule m England to make the tire 1 inch wide for every 800 pounds of load or vehicle that is. if the vehicle and load weigh ed 3 tons. 4-inch tires would be used but it was not found profitable to in crease the width much beyond 4) inches, except in cases where wagon* were used without springs when they were sometimes made as wide as 6 Inches. You ought to treat this matter of wheel tires as you do other things in which you are interested, and gi- e il the same sensible consideration that you apply to the things about your home. When you built your house you commenced by putting down a 16- inch stone foundation, and on thn. you ' built the framework of Qm ture. You have made the foundation broad to prevent the settling of a load which was intended to remain unmo e . as long as it should last and yet you should know that the weight per inch upon that foundation is les. than one quarter the weight per Inch upon your narrow wheel tires when you go to market with a heavy load, to nay noth ing of the fact that your wagon carries a moving load and is therefore much more likely to disturb the foundation than though it remained quiet Your wheel tire is designed to touch the ground at one point only, and when it Is pressed into the earth so as to in crease this point of contact the power required to move a wagon and its load Increases very rapidly. You should use wide-wheel tires, and should en courage your neighbors to use them also.—From •'The Gospel of Good Roads. ” by Isaao B. Potter. Special Farming. ▲iter all the question of special farming resolved iteelf into this No •oil can stand continuous cultivation of any particular crop, for rotation a t crops is just as essential to the soil as fertiliser*. Special farming may do for a short time, a few years at the utmost, but beyond that it cannot be made to pay. Many of those who ad vocate special farming from experi •noe do so after a few years trial of some partloul&r crop, but it takes a long time to test the question thor oughly.
