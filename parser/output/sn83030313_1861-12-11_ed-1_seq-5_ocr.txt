an ioimonse circulation matt represent the Spirit of a very large, if not a very influential claw. But tho Saturday Jtfvino qualifies from ignorance when it uses tho last quoted words; tho writer has only to como to Auicrica to see that it h the most influential journal of the 'lontinont. with a circulation far ahead of any other in the world The Saturday Bevietoers do not exactly say how they came by a copy of the "Little Villain's" paper, in one of the articles in which they disprove a statement in every sentence it contains, but they lead us to infer that they have almost the monopoly of tho article on the other side of the Allan lie ? and bueh rubbish! What an unkind cut, after nil, that the starveling of tho attic in Printing House square has done for his favorite review. Tiik Rkukk Fund fob Ireland.? Our sugges. iion of the propriety of raising a relief fund for the Buttering poor of Ireland is, we are glad to vso, meeting with a cordial response on all aides. It lias already been introduced in Con gress in tho shape of a motion for an appropria tion for tho purchase of food, as oiig nully re commended by us. This will not Interfere with tho efforts of private benevolence, the ext nt Of the lis tress boing likely to nbsorb all tho money that can be raided. The other day the subscription list at our office was opened with a contribution of $:?() from Messrs Brosnan & Dunne. two worthy citi zens in Fulton street. Ye -tor day we pub lished \ !"tter from that excellent actor and genial son of the Emerald If?!e. l'arney Williams, enclosing a subscription of tf20t). Let those ?whose sympathies are slow to move in this good caus'- i -ail Colonel Mulligan's speech at Detroit. .If they cm poru&e that eloquent recital of what Irish valor did for us at Lexington and keep their purse strings closed, they do not de serve to realize the blessings of a restored Union We would impress upon all who are anxious ?to aid the Irish poor in their pie^ent dire ex tremity the necessity of moving quic\ly. Tho winter is upon them, and English charity is niggard in its efforts. There is a fund available for prcsoiit purposes if proper exertions were made to get at it. Some twelve or fourteen years since Massa Greeley an. 1 the other Tribune philosophers collected about forty thousand dollars to alleviate a similar visitation in Ireland. The fund never was ured, and, with ? the accumulated interest, it now amounts to about seventy-six thousand dollars. What has become ot' all this money ? That is a question which it imports the subscrib rs just, now to know. Let t meeting of our Irish fellow citi zens be it once called to investigate i's where abouts. The pressing necessity of the case will perhaps form a sufficient cxcuse to the polished philosophers of the Tribune for the unpleasant directness ,.f the inquiry. Gabrikov'x Libkratob Aui.ax.'!. ? The brutal and bloody abolitiouista arc hard at work wire pulling Congressmen for an emancipation net. Garrison's Liberator is ablaze this week with articles upon the subject. One article calla upon its r'-ailers to deluge members of Congress with emancipation petitions, adding the signifi cant remark, ''they will, of course, go free of' postage." Another article culls the adminisira tion '-perverse, cowardly. Insane." Another aaya of the President's Message, "its chief, al most iu nolo, merit is its brevity;" that it is "very feeble and rambling an;l ridiculous ?s a State paper;" that President Lincoln ? is very weak in his joints aud wholly din. quaUlieil to lend or inspire;" that "President Lincoln ut&y colonize himself j|' he chooses, (Hit it ia in impertinent, act on bis part to pro - potie Hi" getting rid of tnoee wbo are an good as himself " ? meaning tto niggeij* .This ip. iW utyple fall* of such papers as^the -"Llbet'oior^ and mouaurwi ' ought at once to t>e takeu by Cen y gceaa to suppress such revolutionary, anarchi cat, abolition organs. When (be milk und water pence papers were stopped, at the siittinjr of the lust Congress, is it not quite time that these abolition papers ? which would abolish tho government, abolish the constitution' j abolish the country and abolish and "colonize" the President, ull ft>r the sake of the dear nig ger ? were similarly attended to ThK J'lOHriNO, 

LYING AND RUNNING EDITORS ok suk Nkw Yimuc Times.- ? Wo noticed som timo ago the manner in which the New York 7Wfen}' pve aid and comfi.rt. to the rebels by articles showing "How our army is not an army," prepared for republication in England. It appears that the New York Times has been playing the same dodge, by misrepresenting affairs at Fortress Monroe, und sneering at the Eleventh Pennsylvania cavalry, as "twelve hundred weak," &c. We publish a letter upon the subject this morning l'rom the officers o; the regiment, addressed to "the fighting editor of the New York Times." There is no auoh man, gentlemen. If your letlei had been ad. drewed to "the lying editor of the Tim's" it might have been received by that jour nal, on the same principle that a letter addressed to "tho biggest fool in Puuip kinvillo" was claimed and opened by the first comer. The Times has plenty of "lying editors, " and one "running editor," whose feats at Solferino and Bull run eclipse any previous records of the turf. It has also a "drunl&c-i editor," who wrote an essay "on tho elbows of tho Min(hic)cio," and a "secession editor," who broke the oath of allegiance lie was obliged to take at Fortress Monroe, re vealed General Scott's plans to the enemy, and ?exposed the details of our great expedition* But as tj x fighting editor, juu will not find him on the Times. Tiik Triui nk Eating Diut on the Fkemovt Cask.. ? The Tribune of the *mh ult. publishes tho testimony taken before the Missouri Investi gating Committee, aud exposing the swindling jobs of MoKiustry, Selovtr, Fox, Neil. Haskell and Co , who surrounded General Fremont. Th? report, the committee allege, was stolen from them, as its publication was entirely un. authorized. The Tribune has g.?ne to a grout deal of trouble, therefore, to eat dirt in regard to Fremont; for the evidence before &'! iom mittee is vastly more damaging to Fremont, and give* better proof that lils removal was uecessaiy, than anything previously alleged against him. So we go. and the President is proven as entirely right, at he is admitted to be entirely honest. The MwaisToruKLKS of the Satw>0 Ci.iqi k Congress. ?

Oar Pilots. There are but few of our readers, we believe, who hare a correct Idea or the number of persons engaged lu pilot ing vessels to and from this city by way of Sandy Hook, or the oftentimes dangerous and highly valuable serv ices r wlered by them, to the commercial community In par tlc lar, aud the people generally. In the force of the New Jersey and New.Yorlc and Sandy Hook pilots there tire twenty one bouts in active service, each boat having uu average of five pilots, and, for the propor working of thorn, about the same number of hands and apprentices are employed. These boats, taking the oU!or onos with those built within tho past throe or four yoars, are wo, lb an average of $7,000 each, making tho amount of capital employed aud alloat $102, COO, upon which Urge sum tli >re is very little or uo insurance, our lit aril of Vnilerwriters nut bs' Ing willing to tako these risks except at a ruinous pre mium to tho pilots, which is another evidence, if any wero wanted, of the dangerous nature of their voca1 ion. In Boston the Insurance companies have a way of taking care of their pilots, which it would bo plessaut to ha\ e in operation hero, particularly as it Is to the ex- rt Ions of those man they owe a percentage of their large dlvidsn 's. The New Jersey and New York pilots hire eich, o I lectlveljr, a secretary or bookkeeper, who receives all moneys earned, ami puys the bills of tho va. iocs hosts after they have recelvod tho endorsement of the captain. The cost of running a pilot boat during the year, In* eluding wear and tear, depreciation, at >ro bit's , hand hire, ropi.irs, Arc., am >unts 10 at least $3,000, nuking m item of $78,000 for (he fleet.

DEATH OF JOHN r. JAOKROX. Tho duty devolves on us this morning to annnenee the dcatli of Mr. John P.

Mr. Jackson has boon conncctcd with tha: company froui its organization to tho present time He was appointed secretary on the 4th of June, 1832, and held that position to tho 1st of November, 1849. On the 4:h of Juno, 183fi, ho was elected a director, nnd on the 2sih of Juno, 1819, waschoeeu ?i:? president , and in tha' ottlcs, united with the s iperintendoney ot the road, he has rema ned since. Ho w.isamnnof great energy, and the company to which the sorvicos-of tho better port ion of his life was devoted, was indebted in no small degreo fur its fi: o cut prosperity to his judicious ma: agemont and ability 1 in the arrangement of de vails. The duceaaod was educat ed for ?? b:ir, and hold an < xeellotit poa lion in the legal profession, when ha turned hid attention toward the t ail - road business, then just springing into uxistenc. At ti e tiiu" of thorrniit of the charter or the road, though qiiiie a young man, he was Speaker of the House of As ber. bly , and his [.o-ittoa and prospects in political life were i i th ?< m ?t flattering oli.t acler . but from his connec tion with the company he devoted his whole onorg|i>s to its service, and ab.in loned active participation in tho pursuits of political life. Jlo was admitted to the New .Tor sey bar \ery eaily in life. and engaged In tho practice of law fo" sumo lime in one < f the villages of his native county.

Of public sjieakh g he was ott^emoiy fond, and eventually lc; became deeply interested in the politics of his country. Hy reason of his infloonco, his popularity and the confidence of tho people in his integrity, he was yviuo ulectud to tli- I.eg'u'ature of the State, and as a member of that body discharged his duty with credit to himself and to t .0 utmost satisfaction oi his constitu ents. lie was nlso twice elected Clerk of the county of Fsso*, a very lucrative ollice (now the most lucrative in the 8'site), aad tl:o: by ainissed considerable tnon-y.

For some years pisl the interests of the Camden ami Amboy Kailroad Company greatly conflicted with tie soot tho New Jjrsey Traust-ortation Company, and although the Camden nnd Amboy threatened at ono time tn absorb eve y interest in the State conflicting with that company, tho Njw Jersey Railroad and Tivnsiiortalion Company . through the perseverance and sagacity of Mr. Jackson, was p.otccted from any ruiuous competition.
