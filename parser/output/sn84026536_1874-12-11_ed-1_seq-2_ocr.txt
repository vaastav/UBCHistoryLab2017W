A Eirccg effort vail bo mads in tho outgoing Congress to pass the CitiI lights, cr Social Equality, tu.. 1 stands early ca the calendar, and in a good position to be called v.p trd forced through, if Totes can ao i The Radical friends cf the- measure li. 4- 1m Tl?.P.ffl HOW. if pee inai iuut i ever, as every day's delay weakens the chances of its euccess, end the rex. Congress will net tolerato Bucii venge ful fanaticism for a moment. The ro vlval of this mischievous bill, says the New York Journal cf Commerce, wih ba nothing less than a -wanton and studied insult to the public sentiment cf the connlry, emphatically declared at tho late elections. The question cf enforced social equality was one of the riaTy issues cn trial before the peo ple, end their verdict was overwhelm ingly prainst it. Thoro is net a State iut-Vwhosa political canvass it did not ruler, ca a cogent reason for or cgamst the continuance of power in the liar-da of tho bite dominant party. The tlira-itencl passago cf tho bill one of tho greatest causes of dissatisfaction in tho Repub licau ranks. Thiswasnade rnamfe&l at the lait session, when it failed through the parliamentary strategy and votes of Republican members in "ood regular standee. These gentle men represented a wider constituency i than they dreamed of. The--- m no way of getting at the exact facts, but we i : do not believe that one-tenth o; the Tirmlllein voters in the Northern States wen! J, on tho direct issue.stand by the Social Equality bill. At this time it Is a significant fact, that no lea-ling Republican crgius are advo cating tho measure, while some of the most influential journals cf the party ftro warmly opposed to it. At tbe South, where its popularity ought to bo the greatest (in theory) cnong the freed men and their Radical friends, it excites vi r y little interest. They r.re not asides for it. With the exception of . rrv.nl! meetinc of dissatisfied ncgrc d there. and carpet-baggers hero tho people cf the South, WiiitO and Mack, seem to regard tho Civil Rights j bill a3 a question finally disposed of at j the November elections, and are cor.- I tent to let it rest. It is a great mi?- j .-V n t rrmfK Ihr.i lh KtSroeS WCr6 i ;it any time unanimous in demcrding tho passago cf tho bill as a farther conevion of rights.

As a con- j vincicg proof that the Southern freed- j men do not, as a class, require cr ex- I pect s:ny additional security from the !

The agita tion of the Civil Rights bill, whether it passes or not, promises to cause a disturbance in aJlTairs now tranquil nt the South, and for this reason only do the demagogues propose to renew it. .tfHIIIUAN. The election returns iu Michhrp.u have hardlv received tho attention thev 'llesrrved. Returns from ristv- five counties havo been publit,3ied, the j remaining four casting but 717 votes j at the previous contest. Adding the: o j tha total showing is a3 follows: iiepuohcTi .

(JG.CII for B gley) to 1,857. In the seven districts where a light was made.the Democrats carried three and the Rfpnblicaus four, the Demo cratic majorities aggregating -i,ti50,tle Republican -1,829. In the House the Democrats elect forty-eight members of 100 a gain of forty-three; and in tho Senate fourteen of thirty-two a gain of ihirteen. From a majority of 120 on a joint bid lot of 1?.2 votes the Republicans have been reduced to a majority of eight. iiichigan, by thi3 repudiation of Chandlerism, has earned tLe esteem and applause of all who are interested in the re-establishment of an honest Government quite as well as Massa chusetts by htr repudiation of Bnt lerigin. i i ; - j : caws. They aie uahig the usury ques tion dawn in cicorgia bnt there seem9 to bo a difiorence of opinion on the subject. The Atlanta -ZVeit-a, of Satur day last, copies the article from the New York Journal of Commerce, re cently published by us, the same being a reply to certain enquiries propound ed by a citizen of Wilmington to that paper, and makes lengthy editorial comments thereon in favor of a repeal of the usury laws, promising further and fuller installments. We also publish, in this issue, an article from the Newbernian, in ref erence to the usury laws, which will bo read with interest by many. The discussion of this matter is destined to assume a prominent position in this and other Southern States. TUE IIADICAf. ..... cmftll men In all .xaii . 77 - re prone to blame others rather than themselves for the miscarriage of any scheme. This fact ia just now receiv ing an illustration in the endeavor to look up the causes for the defeat of the Radical Republican party in the recent Test conte sta. Some one individual must bo mad3 to bear the sins cf the many, and as General Grant i3 etill in place and position, and will probably ba tho only one to bo depended on to lead tho forlorn Lope cf Li3 party in tho next Presidential contest, some one cl5a nuiii bo made to shoulder all cf the blame. With a wondcrf ol una nimity the party have centred on B. F. Butler as tho man, or, rather, as the person (it is a disgraca to humanity to call him a man), who is to bear the brunt of tho reverses under which they have suffered, and those who are now seated for the last time in the Congressional balls cf the country point to him as the scape-goat of the party, and the causo of their ejectment from a share in the epoils wmch they havo eo long divided out among them selves inn art tne man. id me . . t, - - ii,A if I- Twriv. and the vernier mighty indeed, of h'& - - i r Tin tier has fallen low, under own party tho lash. scourging It was bad enough for tho Beast to bo hurled BO suddenly and eo signally official position, but it is more than humiliating for him to be made to bear the brunt of the disappointment of thoro who are as much inferior to him in brains as they are in rascality, and yet who are not, for all that, either fools or honest men. It is said that in Washington City tho Republican members cf Congress only speak in ominous whispers when giving in their reasons for tho crush ing defeat of their party, and yet the significant urdd "Butler" and But lerism" arc often heard to escape them. They recognize tho fact that their coalition in Congress i3 broken np fur ever, and that the party :s t irrctrievablv ruined, and for ail thir; Butler i-i to blame! Their role redemption lies in the meagre chance of a fence 2ss in the Presidential contest in 107G, and they recognize the fact that this contest will be of a di.lsrent character" than the feeble effort which wao put forth to elect Greeley in 1372.

M ifisis&jppi ia now tho scene of trouble, and at Vicksburg there has t lrea ly beta a fierce fight. This is but ! oae cf a Berka of bloody incidents in ! tue reconstruction programme of the countiy, each of which has, in ita turn, removed a spadeful of earth from ur.uv et of the Administration b.g at Vk-kshurg, for some time past, and which culminated in a bloody hgiit ou Monday, between the while and blacks, 13 directly traceable to the villainy of the Radical ofase holders. Tha tale is told in the dippatches pub lish.:.! this morning. The whiles com pcilrd the negro Sheriff, who was act ive: ::s : ueii ia direct violation ,f thn plain letter of the law, to resign his oiTuj, thereupon a cry went forth into tho country round about and the ne groes assembled and attacked the city. Tho result was that v.hich could easily have been foretold. The negroes were beaton back with the loss of twelve or liftmen killed, several wounded and about twenty prisoners, while one man was killed cn the side of the whites. At the last advices all was qui) i.ne citizens held possession of the place, but it was feared that another demonstration would be made by the negrco3. But a more important fact is vet to come. When quiet was restored an investigation was had, and evidence was obtained that, according to the language used in tho dispatch, renders it absolutely certain that Governor Ames and his Attorney General, one Ueorge E. Harris, incited and advised the invasion of tho city by the negroes mis evidence has been laid before some of the ablest lawyers in Vicks burg, and the arrest and arraignment of those parties will probably be the result. Experiments haTe lately been made in Sweden with a new explosive com pound, which is stated to embody all the good and none of the bad quali ties of every previously known explo sive, than which it is also said to be more powerful This new destructive agent comes under the very expressive uttmeoi "vigonte, ' KICE IVOnDS OF A NICE MAN. If the present Congress would only attempt the reconstruction cf certain men on the same principle, and in the same manner that it has attempted the reconstruction of certain States, we might feel more leniently disposed to wards them in our criticisms of the fearful results that have followed such iniquitous causes. So far as Butler and his compeers tro concerned, the people, sitting both as judge and jury, havo thoroughly worked tip tne:r cases, bnt there are a fow rampant roarinor jackasses in lion's einns ream ing hither and thither throughout the country wkosfl cf3C3 are ytt cn le docket. Such is Senator 2aek Chandler, of Michigan, one of thoso who fail to re cognize tho fact that not only baa the war passed away, but that the people are tired of hearing blood-and-thun-der talk from thoso whoso well-known interest it is to keep alive the fatt dying feeling3 cf sectional animosity. Chandler ia a U. S. Senator from Michigan, a position in which men onca served their country instead of their party, but bo is also at tho head of tho Republican Congressional Exec utive Committee, a fact which will probably explain bis extreme animos ity towards tho people of the South. This animosity, the leading character istic of Chandler's party.found vent m tho following expression used by him recently at Cold water, Michigan : If onr volunteers should be called upon to go South, which I hope they 11. and if thev should ask my adviea before they start, which they won't, my advice would be not to waste their time in capturing prisoners while their ammunition lasted. If it did give out, they might capture a few f jr hanging purposes. This buncombe talk would have sounded well in the ears of Northern men only, perhaps, a little tedious from constant repetition, had it been dated ten years earlier, for Chanceller is one of thoso bloody veterans who always fignt their battles hundreds of miles removed from the scene of con flict, and with a strong army of fight ing men between themselves and the foe. Bat at this time, and emanating from such a somce, it might, with mush reason, ho taken as the oflioial expression of the Radical Republicans It simply mean.3 war in the South, and bloody war r.t tnat, siiculd tlio rap- scallians whom Chanceller leads ever again nud a pretext for a second in vasion of the South. It is significant, too, of the fact, that in the period intervening between this and the next Presidential election attempts are to bo made to again "fire the Northern heart" by incendiary speeches in the North and incendiary torches in the South. But recent events justify us i in believing that the effort will fail, and that honest men e.f both parties, j throughout tho entire country, will i visit all such attempts with the 1 rightous condemnation they aro euro ; !o msiit. SSI SI. For the first tim9 in ten years the Demociats in Pennsylvania are to en joy the privilege cf sending one of tbeir own leaders to the United States Senate. Thi3 duty will devolve upon the Legislature elected in November. There aro many able aspirants for the posiiicn, and a number of prominent men aro already spoke of, but Jud-3 Jeremiah S.

To return him would be a i long step tov'ard elevating the stand i ard of men, and consequently of legis. lai-ion, in Congress. The eamo can be said of Judge Black. Ho is one of the i most btiihant advocates in this or any other country. Tho history of this country, general and constitutional, is t.o him an always open book, and in profound learning and sound practical judgment he has no superior in the present National Senate. Tha selec tion of cither of these statesmen would be a splendid improvement on the opportunity now offered, which we need not fear will be thrown away. 1 .11 .71 KillATIOSi IN AUK 

ASSAM. Here is encouragement for our Ag ricultural Burcau and the friends of immigration in North Carolina gener any. it is from the Little Rock Gazvtlc, which fays, as if ppeaking by authority, that the efforts put forward by Texa3 during the past year to bring immigrants to that State, have resulted in an increase of population of about two hundred thousand. This is the result of two causes first, the government is in the hands of the peo ple; and, second, the has a Bureau of Immigration, whose duty it is to look after her interests in that direction. A cotemporary says that the citv of Concord, N.H., has just settled the last of five suits for the destruction of a Democratic newspaper office by a mob in 1SS1, the city paying $2,000 dam ages in the last case. The mob of voters at the polls on the 3d of Novem ber destroyed a good many Radical newspaper offices, and the owners will get no damages either. The Memphis Appeal eaya: A terri ble disease, known as the black death, has broken out in DeKalb countyand, defying medical skill, is playing havoc with the population. Able physicians of Nashville think the diseasa must be bilious dysentery of a fatal type, simi lar to that which followed the cholera laat year, but not contagious. Judge Black has written a letter to one cf bis political friends, in which he states that, while he will not personally solicit support for election to the Sen ate, he would accept the honor and feel highly complimented. The Norfolk Landmark, with a pe culiar disregard for anatoray.modestly styles Texas and Virginia "the thumb and forefinger of the South." Th Landmark makes no disposition of the intervening States, which wonld seem to drop in baimreen tho I'ltiml, forefinger," i It is very manifest to tvry -no who ads the legislative proct ouings oi rea this State that there is a strong dispo sition to do aomething with our usury laws. And tbe question feems to be, whether. we shall tako a backward leap into the prejudiced and narrow gung- cd legislation ol past pges, or Keep step with the progress r.iut mar?ii ol he present age. in tucsa uays wueu usury laws were firs'i eu.icted all, or nearly all trad3 was fetLcred :y law, prices cf all commodities were used, and under heavy pccaltie?, producers were forbidden to Bell their products at higher rates than tboao named iu the law. But tiiO great lniuRtice ol sueii enactments becrma manifest to all, and they were gradually repealeu, un til at the present time usury is the sole remaining merriment oi the pernicious and unfair legislation of those dark days, and it is rapidly disappearing from tbe statute boots ol the moss en lightened commercial nations of the earth. As long ago as 1S39, the usury law was repealed in England, and sub sequently by most of the nations ou the continent oi Europe, Is it possiblo that this .Legislature will not only refuse to follow the lead of these great nations, but will actual ly undo all that previous .Legislatures have done m mac direction, ana ra store the iniquitous usury Jaws, which only served to enahio cisuonest men to detraud the lender one oi ms money? Is it possible that by any legislation limiting tne rate ol interest., they are going to drive from onr al ready poverty stricken people the little money mat now srraggte3 into tho State for investment? Is it pos sible that they are going to erect 1 gal barriers around the borders oi the State, to keep out capital and labor. for such would surely be the case if we tlnow impediments in the way of their profitable investment ? Is it possible that this Legislature ha3 learn, at this late day, that money i3 a timid, shrinking, nervous thiug thht flies away and hides itself at the first noto of danger, and that true to its instincts it will run away from our State if the profitable investment of 1 is fraught with so much of risk and peril as these would-be reformers would throw about it ? Is it possible or reasonable, to believe that money with all the world open to :t,whereit o.n bo used to serve the needy and promote agriculture and commerce without legal impediment, will coma fcere ana tnrow itseif in tho midst of a psck of hung?y hounds. Wiio would fail upon and u stroy it ? Is it possible that they have eo soon forgotten that in the older anJ I better days it was considered dishon orable anil diegrajjef nl for any man o avail hims If of tbe plea of usury i- evade bis obligations to pay ? And i it possible that they will t'gaia place upon t!io statute-book a law that no honest man, even in these degenente days, would think of availing himse t of? is it possible that a law iigft:u!i; which the moral Fense rovjlta siioaid bo placed upon the etatutc-bcuk for the sole benefit of rcgnts, rubber?, thieves and twindkrs? We had al ways thought that law was fur the pro tection of tho honest and virtuous and for the riunislimeiit of iLo dibhoneht and vile. But the usury laws reverse the proposition the honest man who will pay in any event, law or no law, will be i t quired by reason of such law, and the fact that corrupt men avail themselves of its provisions to defraud tbe lender.to pay a much higher rato of interestthan wonld be the caseif money werefneliko all ether tommoditzes. Ali the lawc that were ever thought of on tho subject might be pissed and still they would not chepp;-n money, nor will they compel the o vber of it u lend it out 8gainst liis will. L,et giich a law be patted, and ho who is in debt j cannot boriow the money from his more fortunate neighbor to cuubiehini to pay out, for it will be dangerous to j lend, and, in the mxt plrce, his ii-rgb- ( bor ciu make mueh more out of his j money by waiting until tho farm and stock oi the debtor are Fold by tie Bheriff, end their value. then buy them at Lull Bat if Rdenuato com- peusation lor tua use of tho money i n feidt-eorjmittte oft-hree be appoints-.1 could be had, tho unfortunate debtor j to vl-.it New ioikm order to e'x tm i.e could beelieved, and bis f.-rm end iuto Ids complaiiit against the Car. stcck saved for tiie .sit pport ot himself j Vdi Cent ml lhv'hviy, lc.:u- the and famiiy. i if-r. refcrr.'ng to thei-o n-.frj ro Jt r.n3 laec ipy rest usbuieu, that money will g where it can be and privation must necessarily ensue.

Sup.-oae it should be said to the farmer by the Legisla ture, in the Rhspc of a law, that if you charge moro than Gfty-threo dollar for a bale of cotton v.hich costs you fifty dollars to niako, you shall forfeit the entire price received for the cotton. for six per cent is all that will ba al lowed in tho way of profit on tho cost of your crop? What wo lid bo thought 01 11 .' uoea it not teem monstrous that a farmer may sell his crop for wuatever pront it may command, and that the law should step in with its iron hand and hold back the use of the money, the proceeds of that very crop, except at tho rate of six per cent in terest or less? Even at tho rate 01 eignt per cent, ws know, m this county at least, several gentlemen who have trust funds to lend out wuo are calling them in because the taxes are such as to reduce the net interest to lews than five per cent, per annum. Therefore all that money and it amounts to many thou sands of dollars will be taken away from the community, and we will be deprived of the use and benefit of it in our business, simply because it can not be made, under the present law, to yield a revenue of six per cent. The borrowers would be willing and glad to pay the taxes in addition to the in terest, but the lenders nny, "No that would be usury, and we cannot run the risk." Is it not a remarkable fact, that in this day of free men, and free every thing else, money atone, which is the great aim and object, as well as the motive power of all business life, stands with tbe thackles of elaverv upon it? Suoh should not be IL case, and no country can prosper where that condition of tilings exists. Therefore give ns free money, and then we will have cheap monev, 7ew berTiian. Hret Elartein ihe Soulfc.

Messrs.

Mr. Boyd opposed tha bill and amendment on the gronnd that the State of .North Carolina with its load of debt needed all its property, and until the State debt question was set tled, he would oppose every move ment that would tend to lessen its asets. Mr. Erwin in his reply eaid that the party to which Mr. Boyd was identi fied was responsible for the onerous debt of the State, and had it not been for that party whose footprints were yet visible "in McDowell and Burke, this legislation would not now be asked for. These counties were now suffering from the baneful influ euce of radicalism, too poor to help themselves, and he merely asked the relief this bill wonld gaye them as a matter of right and justice.

OPENING OF COXORESS. SYNOPSIS OF THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. BRI3TOW ON THE FINANCES. PROCEEPIXG3 IN CONGRESS. DlSTIJIUr Or COLUMBIA AFFAIRS- WAStiixarox. Dec. 7 Noon. l lie Senate attd Home of Representa tives is quite full. The nsa-U eomm tte was Rppo.m.eu to inform tho President of the readi oes of Congress to hear from him. The Premdcui'. cays in ins message that our relations with all foreign powers are friendly and without dis turbance, though there is an uusett.ed question with Venezuela, which ha not yet paid tue awaras oi tu ou-u-Gimmission under the Convention of 1866. Congress, it will be recollected, strongly expressed its sense on this subject in February, 1873.. The Pres ident,in hia message of last December, said there was reason to ueneve ine hesitancy of that Republic ia recogniz ing the claim sprung, in part at least, from real difficulty in discharging them in connection with its obligations to other governments; and, therefore, the expediency of further forbearance on the part of our government was be lieved to be worthy oi tne consiuer tion of Congress. In addition to Vene zuela, we "have nnsettled questions with Spain, growing out of the affair of the Virginius and other grievous transactions on the part of the Spanish authorities in XJuba. The magnitude of the offenses baa not been reduced fiinnj the President's pievious mes sage, a vcar ago. As this nnsettled condition of affairs in Cuba cannot long continue, in may become necessa ry for other nations, with our own, to interrero to terminate the insurrection which has bo long prevailed, the Spanish Government having unsuc cessfully attempted to suppress it. In tho meantime the commerce of all countries, and especially that of the United States, suffers, the flags of the United States and England having been insulted. The President, in con versation, although he does not state tlio fet in his messoee. says the United States purchase about eighty per ceut. of the Cuban exports and, therefore, the duties paid by Ameri can citizens contribute to this extent in helpius Spain to continue tho war against the insurgents. The President had hoped that by tho meeting of Congress to-day, tne present ne gotiations with Spain would have been ended; but in this he has been disap pointed. He, therefore, m ma mes sacre. says little or nothing about in demnity, pending the ne oiintions.but at some future time iil pr Kent the H.ubiect to the pee:d eoi-id. ration of Congress.

Secretary of the Treasure. acd Congress to fix I the bmit. It wonld be the duty of Congress, however, to make regula tions regarding fiee banks of issue, and to state the conditions on which they can be organized and transact busines?, the legislation to bo in ac cordance with the new order of things or in other words, the resumption of specie payments. There should be no monopoly in fixing the amount of is sue. The President will recommend that Congress do not interfere with the present currency - act, passed during the last session, unless it be to amend it eo as to conform with a plan for the resuraptiou of specie payments, The President will make no recom mendation on the Rubject of internal improvements by tho general govern ment, but will merely refer to the fact that Congress has already appointed a Committee on Irai sport at ion Koutes to the Seaboard, which has already made its report, and will give further information on more receut investga tions. The Pretjler.t devotes much spaoe to affairs in Aikansas; giving reasons why he declined to interfere n the recent difficulties in that State, and he adverts to the facts narrated in his special message to Congress February 1873. relative to Louisiana.in which he paid he had no specific recommenda tion to make on the subject, but if there were any practical way of remov ing these difficulties by legislation. then he earnestly requested that the question might ba taken up at tha session of Congreps. He was extreme ly anxious to avoid any pretence of un due interferanoe in State affairs, and if Congress differed with him as to what ought to be done, ho requested its immediate decision to that effect. otherwise he should feel obliged, as far as he poutd by the exercise of le gitimate authority, to put an end to the unhappy controversy which dis turbed the peace and prostrated the bus iness of Louisiana by the recognition ot mat government, which was recog nized and upheld by the Courts of the State. It seemed advisable that be should state what course he should feel bound to pursue in reference to the matter in ttm even: that no action being taken in the pnbjectby Congress at that time, but subject to any satis factory arrangements that might be made by the parties to the controversy and which of all things was the most desirable. It wonld be his duty, so far as it might be necessary for him to act, to adhere to the government heretofore recognized by him. The President again submits the question to Congress, and will continue to act as he has heretofore anted relative to affairs in Louisiana, unless otherwise controlled by Congress. The President reiterates his confi dence in the Indian peace policy. If adhered to ho savs it will nrodnne additional beneficial results, and ulti-J mately free the frontier of Indian depredations. He alludes to the civil service reform, saying it has been as olosely adhered to as the opposition manifested it permitted. ltd results have been beneficial, hayin r elevated the capacity and tone of appointments in the several departments of the gov ernment, but it would be impossible to continue the reform without the direct support of Congresp.sancticned by tho people. The President alludes to the reports of the beads of the several departments, whioh accompany the message, and calls attention to their respective recommendations. He 1 . r : . - .

New York, Dec. 7 Night A Wasiugton special eas ILat Britdow, in his report, states thst the sinking fund is over $20,000,000 behind. He not only takes strong grounds in fivor of specie payments, but sets forth a definite plan for reaching the same. He recommends tho repeal of the legal tender act at a fixed day as to the con tracts thereafter made and ex cept as to official salnriea and ordi nary expenses of the Government un der existing appropriations. The Secretary recommends that authority be given for tho immediate issue of convertible bonds bearing a low rate of interest. He asks that a day may be fixed for the resumption of specie payments, not more limited than three years. At tho end of that time the Secretary to be authorized to raise gold by selling bonds in tuch amounts as may become necessary from time to time to keep tho Treasury ia a condi tion to redeem the greenbacks as pre sented. The Secretary recommends free banking a a part of the plan for the resumption of tq;eei payments, but this branch of the subject is not elaborated. It ia rtcoinav tided that the fractional currency bw replaced by silver, and to aoeompiifh this the Secretary ueoircs to bet ail the mints at work coining silver, and as rapidly as it is produced fraetioci euiieney to be recHibd and des-treytd, begiErirg with the smallest denominations.

Greater economy is recommended ic the expenditure s for public build inga. The Secretary recommt nds that Congress go over the appropriations and estimates for these works with OTHnt. raro with n view of ril- rr cme, aridKvpei.amgothv, Jl j amends that a:l varieties o: Gov ernment notes, bor d., nnd stamps bo done exclusively at the Treasury De partment. Concerning Internal Reve nue the Secretary recommends that the tax be taken off bank checks, wa'ches, osmetics and drugs, and to meet this loss that au additional tax of ten cents per gallon be imposed on whisky. This will raise th revenue a little greater than is now rained from the articles enumerated. The practical workings of putting tea acd coffee on the free list has been fully examin ed by the Treasury Department, and carefully prepared tables of prices in foreign markets and prices to consum ers for a period 6ub-equent Vj t faking off the tax show t-v--t while the de crease in revenue oa account of the re moval of the b x simply added to the price in toreigu markets, it has not bene fitted consumers here in the least.
