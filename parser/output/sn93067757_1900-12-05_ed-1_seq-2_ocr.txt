What is known as the short, session of Congress convened Monday at noon, pursuant to Constitutional provision. It will last till March 4th. The President's voluminous message was read the first thing. It. is a matter of regret not only to the members of the Methodist congregation here, but to all our citizens, that Rev. A. N.

President McKinley makes the following reference in his message to the necessity of increasing the army : It must be apparent that we will require an army of about (>0,000, and that during present conditions in Cuba and the ti.? r? u - ? >' x uitJ I rusiuciii S|Kill liave authority to increase the force to the present number of 100,000. Included in this number authority should he given to raise native troops in the Philippines up to 15,000 which the Taft commission believe will he effective in detecting and suppressing guerillas, assassins and Ladrones than our own soldier. The full discussion of this subject by the Secretary of War in his annual report is called to your earnest attention. I renew the recommendation made in my last annual message that the Congress provide a special medal of honor for the volunteers, regulars, sailors and marines on duty in the Philippines who voluntarily remained in the service after their terms of enlistment had expired. I favor the recommendation of the Socretary of War for the detail of officers from the line of army when vacancies occur occur in the adjutant gen rral's department, inspector general's department, fjuartermaster general's department, subsistence department, pay department, ordnance department and signal corps. The army cannot be too highly commend ed for its faithful and effective service in active military operations i0 the field and the ditfik cult work of civil administra tion. Concerning affairs in tin Philippines lie says : While seeking to impress upor you that the grave responsibility of the future government ol those islands rests with the con gress of the United States, J abstained from recommending at that time a specific and fina form of government for the tor ritory actually held by tlu United States forces, and as long as insurrection continues that the military must necessarily be supreme. I stated my purpose, until the congress shall have made known the formal expression of its will, to use tlu authority vested in me by the constitution and the statutes tc uphold the sovereignty of those distant islands, as in all other places where our flag rightfully floats, placing, to that end at the disposal of the army and navy all means which the liberality of congress and the people have provided. No contrary expression of the congress having been made, 1 steadfastly pursued the purpose so declared employing the civil arm as well toward the accomplishment of pacification, and the institution of local governments within the lines of authority and law. Progress in the hoped for direction has been favorable. Our forces have successfully controlled the greater part of the islands, overcoming the organized forces of the insurgents and carrying order and administrative regularity to all quarters. What opposition remains is, for the most part, scattered, obeying no concerted plan of strategic action, operating only by the methods common to the traditions of guerilla warfare, which, while ineffective to alter the general control now established, are still sufficient to beget insecurity among the popillations that have felt the good results of our c mtroi and thus delay the conferment upon them of the fuller measures of local self-government, of education and of industrial and agricultural development which we stand ready to give them. how to Cure Croup. Mr. R. Cray, who lives near Atnenia, Ductless county, X. Y? says: "Chain beriaiiis's Conjfh Remedy is tlie best medicine 1 have ever used. It is a line children's remedy for croup and never fails* to cure. When given as .soon as the child becomes hoarse, or even after the croupy cough has developed, it will prevent the attack.
