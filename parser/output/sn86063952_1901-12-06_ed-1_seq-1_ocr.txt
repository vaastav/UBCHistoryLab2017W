Washington, D. C, Dec. G. Every department of official life in Oklaho ma is to be exposed to the light of day. hTo card which President Roosevelt lias held In his sleeve, touching Okla homa was dropped today when Secre tary. Hitchcock called at the White house and held an hour's conferenco with the president. At this conference It was decided to Bend to Oklahoma at once two trusted special agonots, presumably Boyd and Taylor, to thoroughly Blft and investi gate every phase of official life. These agents will be accompanied by two accountants, a stenographer and three detectives. Secretary Hitchcock was rather free la talking about the conference. "Wo aro goins to get at the very bottom of all this Oklahoma trouble," said he .and will try and make the term of the new governor as dignified as poaceablo as possible. You may say that aovorhor Ferguson has been re quested to remove all the Jenkins 'of ilclals. This will be done in order that ho may not bo unduly hampered by criticisms of the former governor. With an entirely now official family Governor Ferguson will not be forced to mako apologies for the errors and Indiscretions of the former adminis trations." "Will any more federal changes be mado?" was asked. "Yes," Secretary Hitchcock replied. "The judiciary will be rearranged and those officials who were In anyway connected with the causes leading to Jenkins' removal will be, oUowaI to resign." "What work has been outlined for tho "special agents?" Mr. Secretary. "The agents have not aa yet receiv ed their instructions but tho Bchedule of investigation ha sbcen fired. We havo sevprnl hundred charges on fllo In regard to tho educational Snstltu .tionB of tho territory. From; the Alva and Edmond Normal 8chools,especJal ly, come gravo cliarges. The action of x-Goveraor Jenkins in removing President. Murdaugh on charges of drunkenness and other members of the faculty will bo .gone into. Sena, iorial intelligence sb-ws something i . . Is radically wrong in tho management of tho Edmond Normal. Tho charges inado .against tho Alva school arp more serious. If the charges aro to be believed tho Tninclapls there havo been guilty of grave indiscretions. Tho special agents will thoroughly in vestigate every phaso of tho matter. The school at Langston will also bo looked Into. Other work of tho agents will touch tho management and ap praisement of school' Tands in tho Kio wa country. Threo ot tho land offices will bo gone over. There nevor has been a real thorough and exhaustive Investigation of territorial official matters and tho president Is anxious that my department go clear to tho bottom of hto affair." "It is said tho president desires to havo tho territorial secretary's offlco and tho InBuranco department placed under separate heads and at tho sug gestion of tho interior department Governor FerguBon will recommend this chango to tho next legislature. Judge Merrick is still In Washing ton with air chances of receiving an appointment. Tho president received Merrick today. It is not thought Judge Strang will recelvo, recognition. President Roose velt has received extracts of ex-Governor Jenkins' statement, crtlcizlng tho president's action and, it is said, a caunter-statement will bo published, giving some rather sensational dlvel opments In the Jenkins' case.
