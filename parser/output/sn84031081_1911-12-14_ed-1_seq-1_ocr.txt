The trial of the "shooting show girls" held Interest today through the re-appearance of the spirited Miss Conrad for cross-examination and the unexpected calling of Stokes' young wife late in the afternoon. The calling of Mrs. Stokes as a wit ness for the state came as a surprise to the defense. She said she had mar ried Stokes February 11, 1U, but had lived at Stokes' hotel for four or five months prior to that date.

The Kulzer Joint resolution for the termination of the treaty of 1832 between the Unit ed States and Kussla, because of the latter's discrimination against Jewish American clticens, was adopted by the house tonight by a vote of 200 to 1. The negative vote was cast by Rep resentative Malby of New York. A practically identical resolution by Senator Culberson of Texas, is pend ing in the senate and favorable action of both houses will be necessary to make either resolution effective. Hot It the Sulzer and Culberson resolutions direct the president to give Kussla the year's notice necessary for the abro gation of the treaty which has been in force nearly eighty years. An attempt led by Representative (ilmstead of Pennsylvania, to modlly the Hulzer resolution so far as to avoid making the direct charge that Hussia has violated the treaty in refusing to recognize the passports of American Jews, was defeated, 184 to 115. Promi nent republicans declared that the house should not Ko on record us charging a violation of the treaty bo' should adopt language stating that I Russia, had acted In such manner that the I'nited States could no longer be a party to the treaty. Mr. Mann said that If the United Stales assorted thai a discrimination against Jews was a violation of a tiealy. it might weaken its own uttl tiiiie toward the exclusion of .orien tals. The debute In the house bristled with charges that Russia's attitude was an offense agiiins the I'nited Stales; ami that her exclusion of Am erican Jews who bore properly cei'ti licil passports, was an affront to this government. Representative McCo.ll of Massa chusetts; sal, the matter ought not to be acted upon by the house until It had been submitted to arbitration be tween the two countries. Represen tative Long worth of Ohio insisted that the "time for arbitration has gone and the time for action has come." Mr. Mann endeavored to have the joint resolution amended so as to as sert the continued right of the I'nited ! States to distriminate againt t foreign ers on account of race. All amend ments to the resolution were over whelmingly voted down. The resolution adopted by the hottsfc declares that "the government of the I'nited States will not be a party to any treaty which discriminates or which by one of the parties thereto Is so construed as to discriminate, be tween American citizens on the ground of rtto or religion," and il adds: "The government of Kussla has vio lated the treaty between the I'nited States anrl Kucsia concluded at St. Petersburg, December IS, 18,12, re futing to honor American passports duly Ifisued to American citizens on account of race and religion; that In the Judgment of the congress the said treaty, for the reasons aforesaid, ought to bo terminated at the earliest possible time." .1.

Mr. Cummins said that notwith standing the supreme court's decision dissolving the American Tobacco com pany had been bused upon the fact that the tobacco business had been so largely controlled by one company the control of the affairs of the com pany had continued largely In three holding companies the American company, the P. Lorrlllard company and the Liggett and Myers company owning $213,000,0(10 of Ihe entire $223,000,000 of the old American company. '"ihe same men who owned the American Tobacco company own these three companies and own them In the Mime pronortlon that thev owned the old company,'' he said, "so that they will control the business under the new arrangement as they con trolled it under the old. If it was un lawful tor these men to concentrate the buslniss as they did it Is glvhu tlie people a stone Instead of breud under the new urrangenient." The circuit court, he said, has dis regarded and nullified the order of the supreme, court, but if no appeal Is practicable the decree of the lower court must stand as the final rcsull of the litigation against tho tobacco trust.
