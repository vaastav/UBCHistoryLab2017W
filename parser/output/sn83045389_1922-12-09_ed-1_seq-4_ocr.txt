Some Tilings to Think About T3 an unrepresentative and dying Con gress. of whom lew observers now ex pect more than the passage of the cus tomary hatch of appropriation bills, the P re. ill en t yesterday presented a legislative progyim of nntisnal comprehensiveness. His awareness that such a message, under the circumstances, is in the nature of an anomaly is indicated by his opening sen tence: "So many problems are calling for solution that a recital of a 1 i of them, in the fjtce of the known limitations of a short session of Congress, would seem to lack sincerity of purpose," Tlicmgh his own recital of problems may ippear to le;.ve the way open for a charge 3f insincerity?as suggested by himself it s faj'rer, as well as more respectful, to in ter that the President has simply chosen his opportunity for the promulgation of a tew Ijidministration platform, lie cannot, ?f course, expect the present Congress to ' joniQ to any (inal decision concerning the i mpefeing assortment of problems which ho las enumerated; henco his message may airly be regarded as having been addressed argqly to the Congress thnt is yet ron reno- and to tho American people. The j ?Jopt iety of such an exe* utivo discourse ' it any time will hardly be questioned; and. rertainly, it will not he denied that .Mr. j Harding has brought out some questions :oncerning which legislators and public ! ihould be seriously thinking.

January 1 each of them will mature for $G. Tho total of these certificates Issued and purchased t>y the whole country was about *626.000.000. A very considerable volume of these cortill rates remains in the hands of tho original purchasers. Knfortunatoly. many who were nut disinclined to thriftiness have for one reason or another, under stress of aftor-the war necessity, already parted with them. The post-oHlces and the hanks are co-op erating to have these certificates presented for collection at once in order to avV>id the confusion that would result if ail certifi cate holders presented their securities on the same day. The hanks are offering to collect the money for the certificates and give advice relative to Its investment. The post-offices will arrange to have checks mailed to those who wish money or they will exchange the certificates for other gov ernment securities. An attractive Federal issue is now in $25. $100 and $1,000 de nominations. The $L'.r> certificate may he bought for $20.u0. the $100 denomination for $S2. and the $1,000 certificate for $S20. These investments pay out at the rate of ?l per cent compounded twice a year. If tho thrift liahit was good during the stress of war, it is equally good in peace limes. Keep it up. Collect your money and reinvest it in sound interest-hearing securities. "Tinkering Witli tho Constitution" 

PRKSIIHKNT HARDING has picked up the gage of battle thrown to him l?y tho progressive element within his party. The challenge Is accepted. The issue, in volving a sweeping change in the present election system of the nation, is Joined, and the fight between the Old Guard, as typified by the Harding leadership, and the l.a Toilette forward lookers Is on. (in the same day. and at almost the same hour, that a committee of the Senate, headed by the radical Senator Norris, of Nebraska, brought forth a report urging the abolition of the electoral college and urging further that the President and Vice President lie inaugurated in January in stead of in .March, also that Congress con vene Immediately after each election. Pres ident Harding authorized the announce ment that he opposes such institutional changes. The executive believes that well enough should be left alone. Any contest for control. within a party in power is necessarily a matter of national interest, but in the present instance the is sue raised transcends in importance the future of Air. Harding's leadership or the success of that of the progressive bloc. It is now proposed to amend the Constitution In radical respects and to change the me rhanics of the existing electoral system of the country. Such proposals, when serious ly presented and strongly advocated, be come a matter of deep concern entirely apart from party politics. Thero is. of course, substance to the argument that Congress and the govern ment generally are not as responsive to pop ular sentiment as might be the case. A President, elected in November, under th?> present system does not take office until the succeeding March. A Congress elected at the same time goes Into office along ; with tho President, but does not begin to function until the following December? i ! thirteen months after the election?unless ! called together bv special proclamation of (lie President. ??' j Hv this constitutional arrangement a < otigres.s which may have been repudiated at the polls still holds on for four months and may legislate during the whole of that i time. Likewise a President who may have been defeated in November continues in office four months, wielding all the power i vested In his high office. As a matter of i pure democracy, this is all wrong. A re- j gitne which is voted out of power by the i people Should surrender its commission Itn- j mediately. To that extent, the program of the progressives must appeal strongly to j those who believe firmly in majority rule. ' first, last and all the time. At 'li.it. the position taken by the Presl- ! dent upon the pending proposals has more j to support it than the fact that the "found- I ing fathers" were guided by great wisdom in their labors or that they were great and good patriots. Succeeding generations should revere thes'e strong men and ap praise carefully their work, but it is not to be assumed that they were infallible or that they could look ISO years into the future and legislate with certainty for 100, iift0."00 men and women then unborn. When Mr. Harding insists that a Con rress should not rush from the heat of an election to Washington and begin making laws for the country. |,e is on solid ground I he blunders that might be made, under , ?" 'II ' U ? irrtinist.'incw, would h<> almost ir I >? parable. It is far safer for a new Con gre?ss to cool off and take a year to con I s!(ler the needs of the nation, if there is ; any emergency to be met. th? President al I ways has the power to summon an extra J r.sslon, a power that has I exercised so j often in recent years as t? make a sped'-,I ? session, following an election, almost a no j lit ion 1 certainty. ri?o I>ul?tin orroufM nriiK execution early yesterday of Uorv j 1 O Connor.

This, briefly, was the government's reply. "Timid creaklngs." as Professor MncNcill described the protests against the executions, would not lie permitted to stay the hand of the government in its purpose to crush tho re hellion and establish peace ki Ireland. The cnlv way to meet the situation, declared President Cosgrave, is "to strike terror to those responsible." The sternness with which the new Irish leaders have taken up thoir task has never been made clearer. The course they have set for themselves is not without grave hazards, but it may not bo forgotten that upon them rests tho duty of crushing an outlaw organization. America's Influence 41s Lausanne AS the American attitude toward prob lems under discussion at the Lausanne conference is elaborated with fuller dellnite ness as to details by Mr. Child, oiiicial ob server for the United States, it finds in creasing respect from the principal powers represented there. In so far as ihsistenco upon the safeguarding of American rights and interests of every kind is concerned, that attitude may not be described as en tirely unselfish, but what it demands for itself in the way of "open door" opportuni ties is 11?> more than it would have accorded to all other countries. Otherwise, it holds true to its traditional humanitarian policy as of most vital concern in any plan of set tlement which it seeks to have effected. In support of this policy, Mr. Child read a statement to the conference Thursday strongly protesting against expulsion of the Creek population from Constantinople. "Wo will not hesitate," he warned the confer ence, "to express, in pursuance of our legit imate humanitarian interests, our protest I at any such dislodgment of human beings." The protest made a deep impression on the conference and. subsequently, the rep resentatives ?>f France, KnglautI and Italy joined in the discussion and strongly ad vised the Turkish dele??Ates to change thoir minds about sending the Greeks away from Constantinople, pointing out that Turkish insistence on such deportation would en danger the entire negotiations relative to the exchange of populations and prisoners of war. j This reflects only one phase of the no- j goliations in which the soundness of Amer- 1 ienn contentions has received recognition and has exerted a strong moral influence in bringing the principal allied powers Into accord on a unified plan of settlement of ; vital issues to which eventually the Turks j must accede, or else accept the consequences | of a breakdown of negotiations. In this j connection, no little credit is due to Mus solini, the Italian Premier, for frank ex- j pressions and wholesomeliess of attitude 'hat have contributed 110 little to, the allied accord that has been attained In presenting a solid front to the sirrogancy of the Turks. "Italy, in tho negotiations at Lausanne, i-? in full agreement with allies," said tho ; Italian Premier upon the eve of his de- , parture for Paris Thursday night. "What | we propose to the Turks is perfectly reason- j able. 1 hope the negotiations are success ful; otherwise there will be war." That Is the kind of talk that will make | the Turks sit up and lake notice. Whtl". as previously indicated-, the moral influence that America is able to exert at the confer ence has proven to be valuable, its position ii> determining its successful outcome is substantially weakened by refusal to ac cept its share of responsibility for carry- , ;ng the plans which i'> advises into effort.

Kepnrts from Athens arid Dublin indicate that it was never more dangerous to monkey with those who control the Idg stick. Mr. Harding talks to our "lame duck" Con- i press as if it had a great distance to go ami knew exactly how to get there. 1 if course, for some of us the number of days left for Christmas shopping Is much less of a hother than the numlier of dollars re maining for the same purpose.
