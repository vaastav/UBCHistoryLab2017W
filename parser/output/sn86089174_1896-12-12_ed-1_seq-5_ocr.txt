WASHINGTON He Has Opened Headquarters There From lieed the Next Speaker From Our Regular Correspondent Washington Dec 7th 189U The reigu of MarkHanna has opened in Washington He is attracting more attention from Repnblican Senators and Rep resentatives than the opening of Congress and the Presidents message combined and he seems to be greatly enjoying it Congress has no favois to dis tribute at this seasiou while Hanna has been by the bar rel The republicans who have been reelected to congress want 0 work Hauna for their friends aud those who will cease to draw Congressional salaries 011 the 3rd of March are auxious to make connection with other public salaries at the earliest possible moment thereafterand they racognize the necessity of getting on good terms with Hanna in order to do so Han na has no particular respect or reveience for anything except monpy He went through the pretense of listening to protects by the local republicans against the selection of a gold democrat for

inliuiiitce the expendi ture of the district of Columbia funds in a waj to ben iit their investments If I wanted any thing from Hanna I sfiould hunt up the millionaire who had contiibuted to his commit tee for a backer instead of bothering with political in flence MarK regards politics as simply a question of money and not of principles and 1 make the prediction right now now that the millionaires of the country will be far more in fluential with the McKinley ad ministration than the politic ians N How to do nothing while pretending to be trying to do something will be the motto of
