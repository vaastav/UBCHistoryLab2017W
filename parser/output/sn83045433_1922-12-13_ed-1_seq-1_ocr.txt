Aid In Indemnity Crisis Today John Wanamaker. Russia's Vast Army. Which Was Guiltier? Great Wine Crop. ?By ARTHUR BRISBANE? (Copyright. 1122.) JOHN WANAMAKER, w|io died yesterday, takes his place among the great merchants and good Americans that have developed the United States. A great merchant is one that de Totes his life to distribution of the earth's products, thus em ploying laoor, developing and improving manufactures, and rendering to the public great and necessary service. "BESIDES being a great mer chant, Mr. Wanamaker served his country efficiently as Postmaster General, and did as much as any man, with few words, to make the public under stand the stumbling blocks in the way of public service. He said there were "four reasons" for not establishing the parcels post, and those four reasons were the four great express companies of the United States using their influence against it. TL|R. WANAMAKER'S success * was based on intelligence, energy and CONSIDERATION for others. Some years ago this writer called at the Wanamaker establishment in New York to see Mr. Ogden, local manager. It was a very hot July day. Mr. Ogden was not there, but Mr. Wanamaker was, perspiring over the details of the gigantic b'lainess. "I am here in this weather," said he, "because this is the only way I can persuade Ogden to take a vacation. If I didn't come, he wouldn't leave. So I must come and work in July." Mr. Wanamaker then was more than seventy years old. ! That example is recommended ! to other employers. Consider, your men and they will consider you; appreciate them and they will appreciate you. T?HE ALLIES HAVE TALKED, * WITHOUT RESULT, AND ADJOURNED TO JANUARY 2. BOTH ITALY AND ENG LAND REFUSE TO JOIN FRANCE IN SEEKING TO MAKE GERMANY PAY "BY MILITARY MEASURES." This fives a breathing spell, during which German money will fall lower and settlement will be come more difficult. Meanwhile a German engi neer describes the army of Rus sia as he has seen it. Lenin could summon 6,000,000 men "to go marching through Europe." No wonder, as Lloyd George writes, the French are worried about what Germany may do next. What will happen if the Germans supply the necessary thousands of officers and mili tary skill and join that Russian army of 6,000.000 in an attack upon France and Western Eu rope? The last time the Russian army started out it was led by drunken grand dukes and supplied with cannon and guns that had no ammunition. That wouldn't happen under German leader ship. fNGLAND is excited about a murder case that ends in a - ntence of hanging for a mai: and a woman. The man. Bywaters, was in "love"' with the woman, Mrs. Thompson. She wrote to him concerning her husband: "He has the right, by law, to all that you have the right to by nature and by love." That arrangement did not suit the lady. She suggested to Bywaters that he murder her husband. He did it. Now both are to be hanged. English juries do not allow sentiment to carry them away in such cases. It is likely, however, that higher authorities will de cide to hang the man and send the woman to jail for life. Which would you call more guilty, the man Bywater? that broke into another family, or the wife that welcomed him there? That's an interesting matter for discussion around "the eve ning lamp."

The letters were received by Williams, he stated to the police, during August and October of this year. No direct reference to drugs Is made, but Simons attaches great weight to the mention of "m*' and "spark plugs." One letter was written on a card on the reverse side of which was printed an announcement that Evelyn Nesbit and her entertainers were appearing in Atlantic City. Simons said: "During the past twenty months Williams has been trafficking in drugs, we charge. In a trunk in Williams- room were letters that Williams told us con cerned the drj^| traffic. In many hiding places were packages of drugs SAYS HE HAS PROOF. There is no question regarding the handwriting of the letters signed "Evelyn Nesbit" or "Nes bit." We know who wrote them and we could produce proof in court. Here are the letters written on the back of three cards announcing the appearance in Atlantic City of Evelyn Nesbit and her entertainers: i Dear Mr. Williams: Have been In bed with the worst cold I ever had in all my life and all my affairs have been j at a standstill.

TWO MORE WOMEN SENTENCED TO HANG Same British Judge Imposes Death Penalty for Murder. MRS. THOMPSON APPEALS Daisy Wright, Who Slew Her Child Because of Poverty, Fails to Move Court. By LUTHER A. HUSTON, International New* Service. LONDON, Dec. 12.?An unpar alleled record in the history of modem British courts, and one which created a sensation through 1 out the entire nation, was achieved today when Justice Shearrpan, presiding in the historic Old Bai ley Court, sentenced two 'women to be hanged. Less than twenty-four hours earlier the same judge had sen j tenced another woman to death? Mrs. Edith Thompson. 

SLEW HER CHILD. All three women had been con victed of first degree murder. Th^Se sentenced to death today were Mary Jones and Daisy Wright. Ml three were doomed in the same prisoner's dock and received *he treatment men would have ex pected under the British law. The case that excited the great est pity was that of Daisy Kml'y Wright, who drowned her thirtv months-old child in the Thames River in November because of pov erty. The mother tried to leap into the river after her daughter, but was seized on the bridge rail. Robert Wright, the husband, a gun maker, testified he had been out of work for two years. Louis Holoman testified that he had seen the woman kill her child. APPEAL SOUGHT. Counsel for Mrs. Thompson, who was convicted of inciting her young lover to stab to death her husband, announced today that an appeal I would be taken and an efrort made to have the home secretary grant a reprieve. The fact that three women have been sentenced to be hanged within twenty-four hours aroused a storm of protest among women's organiza tions. No woman has been executed in Britain in more than fifteen years. The last woman hanged was Mrs. Rhoda Willis, owner of a "baby farm" in Wales, who was found guilty of killing babies left in her care and hanged at Cardiff. Wales, on August 14, 1907.

"We are going to stick together, and there is no question but that wa will pass the bonus bill in the House." said Representative Royal Johnson. "Our ?group' will put it over." Representative H. C. Fish de clared the bonus bill would be passed over the Presidents veto. The only question, he said. Is the manner in which the funds will be ! raised. A surplus ta* and a sinking fund from the foreign debt are be-1 ing considered, he said. 

OWSLEY PLANS ACTION. Alvin O. Owsley, national com mander of the Legion, announced that beginning today the Legion leaders would join hands with the new "group" and canvass Congress. Representative Andrews of Massa- i chusetts, declared "we have enough j votes now to pass the bonus bill' over the President's veto, but it may be wise to wait until after March 4 to take action."

Harding and Cabinet Discuss Ex-Premier's Expose of Paris Aims President Deems European Situation Seri ous, Is Admission After Secretary . Hughes and British Ambassador Have Conference. By 

GEORGE W. HINMAN, JR. lalvfrMU Berrlrc. Europe is seeking the direct aid of the United States to reach a satisfactory solution of the reparations wrangle which caused the collapse of the London conference. This was indicated here yesterday after a conference be tween Secretary of State Hughes and 8ir Auckland Geddes, British Ambassador. Secretary Hughes later laid latest official reports from Europe before President Harding and his advisers at the Cabinet meeting, where the situation was seriously con sidered. 

DISCU88 LLOYD OEO&OE. Statements by David Lloyd Oeorgt, former British premier, published in the Hearst newspapers last Sunday, were dis cussed with interest by the President and Cabinet members as throwing further light on Europe. How seriously conditions in Europe are regard*} by the 1 administration was indicated by a reply to a question nkW' the President to e?ntment.?n the Lloyd flwgi artseU. The, answer to Ibis and related questions was given at th?- White ! House as follows: The President read Lloyd George's statement* with the same interest as did others watching European developments. Of course, the President contemplates conditions in Europe from a more intimate viewpoint. Under the circumstances, he does not feel that he can comment with propriety. 

EXPLAINS U. S. STAND. President Harding, it was asserted authoritatively, was sin cere in suggesting through his message to Congress the idea of extending the principle of the Pacific four-power treaty. He feels that the principle can be applied with good results and without trespassing upon the rights of any nation. The President does not, however, consider it necessary that the United States be a party to the suggested "ex tension of principle." Where circumstances do not in volve American interests, he believes, the United States naturally would not be a signatory. In other words, the President is said to feel that, in extending the four-power pact principle to meet other conditions, only those nations involved in each situa tion can properly negotiate. [ 

TRYING TO AID EUROPE. The administration, it was stated at the White House, is not inactive in attempting to assist in solving European troubles. In the reparations problem, however, the State Department adheres closely to the policy that debt cancellation involving the United States cannot be discussed with propriety. Con gressional action providing for debt-funding negotiations is regarded as closing the door to any suggestion of cancellation on the part of America. Thus far, it was announced at the State Department, the United States has not been officially approached for action in connection with the present reparations dispute, nor has there been any mention of debt cancellation.
