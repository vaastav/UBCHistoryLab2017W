I NEEDS OF Mill IS OUTLINED TO THE PRESIDENT Message of Chief Exec utive Read to Na tional Assembly ABLE STATE PAPER Suggestions of Importance Made in Document MOST NEEDED LEGISLATION Control-of Corporations, In the Opinion of President Roosevelt, Should Bo Left to the National Government- Dissertation on the Status of the Wageworker—Action of Labor Lead ers Severely Criticised—Necessity for Respect of Law. Washington, Dec. 8.—The message of President Roosevelt was read In both houses of congress. It was as follows: To the Senate and House of Represen tatives: The financial standing of the .nation at the present time la excellent, and the financial management of the na tion's Interests by the government dur ing the last seven years has shown the most satisfactory results. But our cur rency system Is Imperfect, and It is ear nestly to be hoped that the currency .commission will be able to propone a thoroughly good system which will do away with the existing defects. During the period from July 1, 1901, to September 30, 1908, there was an increase in the amount of money in circulation of 1902,991,399. The increase in the per capita during this period was $7.06. Within this time there, were several occasions when it was necessary for the treasury de partment to come to the relief of the money market by purchases or redemp tions of United States bonds: by increas ing deposits in national banks by stim ulating additional issues of national bank notes, and by facilitating importations from abroad of gold. Our imperfect cur rency system has made these proceedings necessary, and they were effective until the monetary disturbance in the fall of .J.J907 immensely Increased the difficulty of ordinary 'methods of relief. By the mid 1. die of November the available working balance In the treasury had been reduccd to approximately J5.000.000. Clearing .. house associations throughout the coun try had been obliged to resort to the '._ expedient of issuing clearing house cer tificates, to be used as money. In this emergency it was determined to invite subscriptions for $50,000,000 Panama canal bonds, and $100,000,000 three per cent, certificates of indebtedness authorized by the act of June 13, 1898. It was proposed to redeposit in the national banks the proceeds of these issues, and to permit their use as a basis for additional elrcu lating notes of national banks. The moral effect of this procedure was so great that it was necessary to issue only $24,631,980 .of the Panama bonds and $15. "436,500 of the certificates of Indebtedness. During the period from July 1, 1901, to .• September 30, 1908, the balance between the net ordinary receipts and the net ordinary expenses of the government showed a surplus in the four years 1902, 1903, 1906, and 1907, and a deficit in the years 1904, 1905, 1908 and a fractional part of the fiscal year 1909. The net result was a surplus of $99,283,413.54. The finan clal operations of the government during this period, based upon these differences between receipts and expenditures, re sulted in a net reduction of the interest' bearing debt of the United States from $987,141,040 to $897,253,990, notwithstanding that there had been two sales of Panama canal bonds amounting in the aggregate to $54,631,980, and an issue of three per cent, certificates of Indebtedness under the act of June 13, 1898, amounting to $15,436,500. Refunding operations of the treasury department under the act of March 14, 1900, resulted in the conver sion into two per cent, consols of 1930 of $200,309,400 bondB bearing higher rates of interest. A decrease of $8,687,956 in the annual interest charge resulted from these operations. In short, during the seven years and three months there has been a net sur plus of nearly one hundred millions of receipts over expenditures, a reduction of the interest-bearing debt by ninety millions, in spite of the extraordinary ex pense of the Panama canal, and a saving of nearly nine millions on the annual interest charge. This is an exceedingly satisfactory showing, especially in view of the fact that during this period the nation .has never hesitated to undertake any expenditure that it regarded aa nec essary. There have been no new taxes and no Increase of taxes on the con trary some taxes have been taken off there has been a reduction of taxation. 

CONTROL OF CORPORATIONS. National Government the Proper Agent for the Work. As regards the great corporations en gaged In interstate business, and espe cially the railroads, I can only repeat what I have already again and again said in my messages to the congress. I be lieve' that under the interstate clause of the constitution the United States has complete and paramount right to con trol' all agencies of interstate commerce, and I believe that the national govern ment alone can exercise this right with wisdom and effectiveness so as both to secure justice from, and to do justice to, the great corporations which are the most important factors in modern busi Hess. I believe that It is worse than folly to attempt to prohibit all com binations aa. is done by the Sherman anti-trust law, because such a law can be enforced only imperfectly and un equally, and its enforcement works al tnost aa much hardship aa good. strongly advocate that instead of an un wise effort to prohibit all combinations, there shall be substituted a law which fti»n expresaly permit combinations which are in the Interest of the public, but shall at the same time give to soma •ganoy in the national government furi power of control sad supervision over lhe». Oae of the ehle i*twN of Ibll control should be securing entire pub- llclty in all matters which the public has a right to know, and furthermore, the power, not by judicial but by execu tive action, to prevent or put a stop to every form of improper favoritism or other wrongdoing. I The railways of the country should be put completely under the interstate com merce commission and removed from the domain of the anti-trust law. The power of the commission should be made thoroughgoing, BO that it could exercise complete supervision and control over the Issue of securities as well as over the raising and lowering of rates. As regards rates, at least, this power should be summary." The power to investigate the financial operations and accounts of the railways has been one of the most valuable features In recent legislation. 1 Power to make combinations and traflio agreements should be explicitly conferred upon the railroads, the permission of the commission being first gained and the combination or agreement being pub lished In all its details. In the interest of the public the representatives of the public should have complete power to see that the railroads do their duty by I the public, and as a matter of course this power should also be exercised so as to see that no injustice is done to the railroads. The shareholders, the em- I ployes and the shippers all have interests I that muat.be guarded. It ia to the in terest of all of them that no swindling stock speculation should be allowed, and that there should be no improper issu ance of securities. The guiding Intelli gences necessary for the successful build ing and successful management of rail roads should receive ample remunera tion but no man should be allowed to make money in connection with railroads out of. fraudulent over-capitalisation and kindred stock-gambling performances there must be no defrauding of invest ors, oppression of the farmers and busi ness men who ship freight, or callous dlregard of the rights and needs of the employes. In addition to this the inter eata of the ahareholdera, of the employes and of the shippers should all be guarded as against one another. To give any one of them undue and Im proper consideration ia to do Injustice to the others. Rates must be made as low as la compatible with giving proper re turns to all the employes of the rail road, from the highest to the lowest, and proper returns to the shareholders, but they mt»t not, for Instance, be re duced In such fashion a$ to necessitate a cut In the wages of the employes or the abolition of the proper and legitimate profits of honest shareholders. Telegraph and telephone companies en gaged in interstate business should be put under the jurisdiction of the inter state commerce commission. People Urged to Act. It is very earnestly to be wished that our people, through their representatives, should act in this matter. It Is hard to say whether most damage to the coun try at large would come from entire failure on the part of the public to su pervise and control the actions of the great corporations, ar from the exercise of the necessary governmental power, in a way which would do injustice and wrong to the corporations. Both the preachers of unrestricted individualism and the preachers of an oppression which would deny to able men of busi ness the just reward of their Initiative and business Bagaclty, are advocating policies that would be fraught with the gravest harm to the whole country. To permit every lawless capitalist, every law-defying corporation, to take any ac tion, no.matter how iniquitous, In the effort to secure ,an Improper profit and to build up privilege, would be cuinous to the republic and would mark the aban donment of the effort to secure In the In dustrial world the spirit of democratic fair-dealing. On the other hand, to at-' tack these wrongs in that spirit of dem agogy which can see wrong only when committed by the man of wealth, and Is dumb and blind In the presence of wrong committed against men of property or by men of no property, Is exactly as evil as. corruptly to defend the wrongdoing of men of wealth. The war we wage must be waged against misconduct, against wrongdoing wherever it is found and we must standi heartily for the rights of every decent man. whether he be a man of great wealth or a man who earns his livelihood as a wageworker or a tiller of the soil. It is to the Interest of all of us that there should be a premium put upon In dividual Initiative and individual ca pacity. and an ample reward for the great directing intelligences alone com petent to manage the great business op erations of to-day. It is well to keep in mind that exactly as the anarchist is the worst enemy of liberty and the reaction ary the worst enemy of order, so the men who defend the rights of property have most to fear from the wrongdoers of great' wealth, and the men who are championing popular rights have most to fear from the demagogues who in the name of popular rights would do wrong to and oppress honest business men, honest men of wealth for the success of either type of wrongdoer necessarily In vites a violent reaction against the cause the wrongdoer nominally upholds. In point of danger to the nation there la nothing to choose between on the one hand the corruptionlst, the bribe-giver, the bribe-taker, the man who employs his great talent to swindle his fellow citizens on a large scale, and, on the other hand, the preacher of class hatred, the man who, whether from ignorance or from willingness to sacrifice his coon try to his ambition, persuades well meaning but wrong-headed men to' try to destroy the instruments upon which our prosperity mainly rests. Let each group of men beware of and guard against the shortcomings to which that srcup is Itself most liable. Too often we see the business community in a spirit of unhealthy class consciousness deplore the effort to hold to account under-the law the wealthy men who in their man agement of great corporations, whether railroads, atreet railwaya, or other In dustrial enterprises, have behaved in a way that revolts the conscience of the plain, decent people. Such an attitude cannot be condemned too severely, for men of property should recognize that they jeopardise the rights of property when they fall heartily to join in the ef fort to do away with the abuses of wealth. On the other hand, those who advocate proper control on behalf of the public, through the state, of these great corporations, and of the wealth engaged on a giant Bcale in business op erations, must ever keep in mind that unless they do scrupulous justice to the corporation, unless they permit ample profit, and cordially encourage capable men of bualneas so long as they act with honesty, they are striking at the root of our national well-being for In the long run, under the mere pressure of material distress, the people as a whole would probably go back to the reign of an unrestricted individualism rather than submit to a control by the state so drastic and so foolish, conceived In a. spirit of auch unreasonable and narrow hostility to wealth, as to pre vent business operations from being profitable, and therefore to bring ruin upon tbe entire business community, and ultimately upon the entire body of cltl sena. Interstate Commerce Problem. The apposition to government control of these great corporations makes Its moat effective effort 'In the ahape of an appeal to the old doctrine of statea' rights. Of courae there are many sincere men who now believe in unrestricted In dividualism In business, just as there were formerly nany sinccre men who Mtoved la slavery—that la, la the a»- restricted right of an individual to own I another individual. These men do not by themselves have great -weight, how ever. The effective fight against ade quate government control and supervi sion of individual, and especially of cor porate, wealth engaged In Interstate business is chiefly done under cover and especially under cover of an appeal to atates' rights. It is not at all Infre quent to read in the same speech a de nunciation of predatory wealth fostered by special privilege and defiant of both the publio welfare and law of the land, and a denunciation of centralization In the central government of the power to deal with this centralised and organized wealth. Of course the policy set forth In such twin denunciations amounts to absolutely nothing, for the first half is nullified by the second half. The chief reason, among the many sound and- com pelling reasons, that led to the formation of the national government, was the ab solute need that the union, and not the several states, should deal with Inter state and foreign commerce and the power to deal with interstate commerce was granted absolutely and plenarily to the central government and was exer cised completely as regards the only in struments of interstate commerce known In those days—the waterways, the high roads, as well as the partnerships of in dividuals who then conducted all of what business there was. Interstate commerce is now chiefly conducted by railroads and the great corporation has supplanted the mass of small partnerships or indi viduals. The proposal to make the na tional government supreme over, and therefore to give It complete control overi the railroada and other instruments of interstate commerce is merely a propos al to carry out to the letter one of the prime purposes, if not the prime purpose, for which the constitution was founded. It does not represent centralization. It represent merely the acknowledgment of the patent fact that centralization has already come In business. If this irre sponsible outside business power is to be controlled In the Interest of the general public It can only be controlled In one way by giving adequate power of con trol to the one sovereignty capable of ex ercising auch power—the national govern ment. Forty or fifty separate govern ments cannot exercise that power over corporations doing business in most all of them first, because they absolutely lack the authority to deal with inter state business In any form and second, because of the inevitable conflict of au thority sure to arise In the effort to en force different kinds of state regulation, often inconsistent with one another and sometimes oppressive In themselves. PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT'S LAST REGULAR MESSAGE TO CONGRESS 1 Such divided authority cannot regulate commerce with wisdom and effect. The central government is the only power which, without oppression, can never theless thoroughly and adequately con trol arid supervise the large corporations. To abandon the effort for national con trol means to abandon the effort for all adequate control and yet to render likely continual bursts of action by state legis latures, which cannot achieve the pur pose sought for, but which can do a great deal of damage to the corporation without conferring any real benefit on the public. Corporations Learning Wisdom. I believe that the more farsighted cor porations are themselves coming to rec ognize the unwisdom of the violent hos tility they have displayed during the last few years to regulation and control by the national government of combinations engaged In Interstate business. The truth Is that we who believe In this movement of asserting and exercising a genuine control, In the public Interest, over these great- corporations have to contend against two sets of enemies, who, though nominally opposed to one another, are realty .allies in preventing a proper solution of the problem. There are, first, the big corporation men, and the extreme Individualists among busi ness men, who genuinely believe In ut terly unregulated business—that is. in the reign of plutocracy and, second, the men who, being blind to the econom ic movements of the day, believe in a movement of repression rather than of regulation of corporations, and who de nounce both the power of the railroads and the exercise of the federal power which alone can really control the rail roads. Those who believe in efficient na tional control, on the other hand, do not In the least object to combinations do not In the least object to concentration in business administration. On the con trary, they favor both, with the .all-impor tant proviso that there shall be s".ich pub licity about their workings, and such thoroughgoing control over them, as to Insure their being In the int.rest, and not against the Interest, of the general public. We do not object to the concen tration of wealth and administration but we do believe in the distribution of the wealth in profits to the real owners, and In securing to the public the full benefit of the concentrated administration. We believe that with concentration In ad ministration there can come both the advantage of a larger owneship and of a more equitable distribution of profits, and at the same time a better service to the commonwealth. We believe that the administration should be for the benefit of the many and that greed and ras cality, practiced on a' large scale, should be punished as relentlessly as if practiced on a small scale. We do not for a moment believe that the problem will be solved by any short and easy method. The solution will come only by pressing various concurrent' remedies. Some of these remedies must lie outside the domain of all government. Some must lie outside the domain of the federal government. But there Is leg islation which file federal government alone can enact and which is absolutely vital in order to secure the attainment of our purpose. Many laws are needed. There should be regulation by the na tional government of the great Interstate corporations, including simple method of account keeping, publicity, supervision of the Issue of securities, abolition of rebates and of special privileges. There should be short-time franchises for all corporations engaged in public business Including the corporations which get power'from water rights. There ahould be national as well as state guardianship of mines and forests. The labor legisla tion hereinafter referred to should con currently be enacted into law. For Centralized Power. To accomplish this, means a certain In crease in the use of—not the creation of —power, by the central government. The power already exists It does not have to be created the only question ia whether It Bhall be used or left idle— and meanwhile the corporations over which the power ought to be exercised will not remain Idle. Let those who ob ject to this Increase in the use of the only power available, the national pow er, be frank, and admit openly that they propose to abandon any effort to control the great business corporations and to exercise supervision over the accumula tion and distribution of wealth for such supervision and control can only come through this particular kind of Increase of power. We no more believe In that empiricism which demands absolutely unrestrained Individualism than we do In that empiricism which clamors for a deadening socialism which would destroy all Individual Initiative and would ruin the country with a completeness that not even an unrestrained Individualism Itself could achieve. The danger to Americas democracy lies not In the least In the concentration of administrative power In responsible and accountable hands. It lies In having the power Insufficiently eonoentrated, so that no one cin be held responsible to the people for Its use. Ooacoattated power is palpable, rial la responsible, easily reached, quickly held to account Power scattered through many administrators, many legislators, many men who work behind and through legislators and administrators, Is Impal pable, is unseen, is Irresponsible, cannot be reached, cannot be held to account. Democracy is in peril wherever the ad ministration of political power Is scat tered among a variety of men who work in secret, whose very namea are un known to the common people. It Is not in peril from any man who derives au thority from the people, who exercises It in sight of the people, and who la from time to time compelled to give an account of ita exercise to the people. 

STATU8 OF WAGEWORKER. Wis# Action by States Needed to Sup plement That of Nation. There are many matters affecting labor and the status of the wageworker to which I should like to draw your atten tion, but an exhaustive discussion of the problem In all its aapects is not now nec essary. This administration la nearlng Its end and, moreover, under our form of government the solution of the prob lem depends' upon the action of the atates as much as upon the action of the nation. Nevertheless, there are certain considerations which I wish to aet be fore you, because I hope that our people will more and more keep them In mind. A blind and ignorant resistance to every effort for the reform of abuses and for the readjustment of society to modern industrial conditions represents not true conservatism but an Incitement to the wildest radicalism for wise radical ism and wise conservatism go hand in hand, one bent on progress, the other bent on seeing that no change la made unless In the right direction. I believe in a steady effort, or perhaps It would be more accurate to say In steady efforts in many different directions, to bring about a condition of affairs under which the men who work with hand or with brain, the laborers, the superintendents, the men who produce the market and the men who find a market for the articles produced, ahall own a far greater share than at present of the wealth they pro duce, and be enabled to Invest It In the tools and Instruments by which all work Is carried in. As far as possible'I hope to see a frank recognition of the Advan tages conferred by machinery, organiza tion and division of labor, accompanied by an effort to bring about a larger share in the ownership by wage-worker of rail way, mill and factory. In farming, this simply means that we wish to see the farmer own his own land: we do not wish to see the farmsso large that they become the property of absentee land lords who farm them by tenants, nor yet so small that the farmer bccomes like the European peasant. Again, the depositors in our savings banks- now number over one-tenth of our entire pop ulation. These are all capitalists. Who through the savings banks loan their money to the workers—that is, in many cases to themselves—to carry on their various Industries. The more we increase their number, the more we Introduce the principles of co-operation into our indus try. Every increase In the number of small stockholders in corporations Is1 a good thing, for the same reasons and where the employes are the stockholders the result is particularly good. Very much of this movement must be outside of anything that can be accomplished by legislation but legislation can do a good deal. For Postal 8avings Banks. Postal Savings banks will make it easy for the poorest to keep their sav ings in absolute safety. The regulation of the national highways must be such that they shall serve all people with equal justice. Corporate finances must be supervised so as to make It far safer than at present for the man of small means to Invest his money in stocks. There must be prohibition-of child la bor, u.minution of women labor, short ening of hours of all mechanical labor stock watering should be prohibited, and stock gambling so far as is possi ble discouraged. There should be a progressive lnherltrnce tax on large fortunes. Industrial education should be encouraged. As far as possible we should lighten the burden of taxation on the small man. We should put a premium upon thrift, hard work, and business energy but these qualities cease to be the main factors In accu mulating a fortune long before that fortune reaches a point where it would be seriously affected by any Inheri tance tax such as I propose. It is emi nently right that the nation should fix the terms upon which the great for tunes are inherited. They rarely do good and they often do harm to those who Inherit them in their entirety. Protection for Wageworkers. The above is the merest sketch, hard ly even a sketch In outline, of the' re forms for which we should work. But there is one matter with which the congress should deal at this session. There should no longer be any palter ing with the question of taking care of the wageworkers who. under our pres ent industrial system, become killed, crippled, or worn out as part of the regular incidents of a given business. The majority of wageworkers must have their rights secured for them by state action but the national govern ment should legislate In thoroughgoing and far-rejachlng fashion not only for all employes of the national govern ment, but for all persons engaged in interstate commerce. The object sought for could be achieved to a measurable degree, as far as those killed or crip pled are concerned, by proper employ ers' liability laws. As far as concerns those who have been worn out, I call your attention to the fact that definite steps toward providing- old-age pen sions have been taken In many of oar private Industries. These' may be In definitely extended through voluntary association and contributory achemea, or through the agency of aavlnga banks, as' under the Massachusetts plan. To strengthen these practical measures should be our immediate duty It Is not at present necessary to consider the larger and more general governmental schemes that most Euro pean-governments have found them selves obliged to adopt. Our present system, or rather no sys tem, works dreadful wrong, and Is of benefit to only one class of people—the lawyers. When a workman is Injured what he needs is not an expensive and doubtful lawsuit, but the certainty of relief through immediate administra tive action. The numberof accidents which result In the death- or crippling, of wageworkers, in the union at large, is simply appalling In a very few years It runs up a total'far in excess of the aggregate of the dead and wounded In any modern war. No academic theory about "freedom of contract" or "consti tutional liberty to contract" should be permitted to interfere with this an£ similar movements. Progress in civili sation has everywhere meant a limita tion and regulation of contract. I call your especial attention to the bulletin of the bureau of labor which gives a statement of the methoda of treating the unemployed In European oountrlea, aa thla la a subject which in Oermany, for instance. Is treated in connection with making provision for worn oat and orippied workmen. Needed Legislation. Pending a thoroughgoing Investiga tion and action there is certain legis lation which should be enacted at once. The law, passed at the last session of the congress .granting compensation to certain classes of employes of the gov ernment .should be extended to Include all employes of the government and should be made more liberal In its terms. There Is no good ground for the distinction made in the law be tween those engaged In hazardous oc cupations and those not so engaged. If a man is Injured or killed in any line of work. It was hatardous In his case. Whether one per cent, -or ten per cent, of those following a given occupntlon actually suffer injury or death ought not to have any bearing on the ques tion of their receiving compens't'on. It is a grim logic which sRye to an in jured employe or to the dependents of one killed that he or they are entitled to no compensation because very few people other than he have been Injured or killed In that occupation. Perhans one of the most striking omissions in the law Is that it does not embrace peace officers and others whose lives may be sacrificed In enforcing the laws of the United States. The terms of the act providing compensation should be made more liberal than In the present, act. A year's compensation is not ade quate for a wage-earner's family in the event of his death by accident In the course of his employment. And in the event of death occurring, say, ten or eleven months after the accident, the family would only receive as compen sation the equivalent of one or two months' earnings. In this respect the generosity of the United States towards its employes compares most unfavora bly with that of every country in Eu rope—even the poorest. The terms of the act are also a hard ship In prohibiting payment In cases where the accident Is in any way due to the negligence of the employe. It is Inevitable that dally familiarity with danger will lead men to take chances that can be construed into negligence. So well is this recognized that In prac-' tlcally all countries in the civilized world, except the United States, only a great degree of negligence acts as a bar to securing compensation. Proba bly In no other respect is our legisla tion, both state and nauonal, so far be hind practically the entire civilized world aa In the matter of liability and compensation for accidents In Industry. It Is humiliating that at European In ternational congresses on accidents the United States should be singled out as the most belated among the nations in respect to employers' liability legisla tion. This government Is itself a large employer of labor .and in Its dealings With Its employes It should set a stan dard In this country which would place It on a par with the most progressive countries in Europe. The laws of the United Statea in this respect and the laws of European countries have been summarized In a recent bulletin of the bureau of labor, and no American who reads this summary can fall to be struck by the great contrast between our practices and theirs—a contrast not In any sense to our credit. Law for District of Columbia. The congress should without further delay pass a model employers' liability law for the District of Columbia. The employers' liability act recently de clared unconstitutional, on account of apparently including In its provisions employes engaged In Intrastate com merce-as well as those engaged In In terstate commerce, has been held by the local courts to: be still in effect so far as Its provisions apply to the District of Columbia. There should be no am biguity on this point. If there le any doubt on the subject, the law should be re-enacted with special reference to the District of Columbia This act, how ever, .applies only to employes of com mon carriers. In all other occupations the liability law of the district is the old common law. The severity and in justice of the common law In this mat ter has been in some decree or another -modified In the: majority of our states, and the only jurisdiction under the ex clusive control of the congress should be ahead and not behind tne states of the union In this resnect. A compre hensive employers' liability law should be passed for the District of Columbia. I renew my recommendation made in a previous message that half-holidays be Granted during summer to all wage workers in government employ I also renew my recommendation that the principle of the eight-hour day should as rapidly and as far as practi cable be extended to the entire work being carried on by the government the present law should be amended to embrace contracts on those publio works which the present wording of the act seems to exclude. 

JUDGES POORLY COMPENSATED. President Would Double Salaries of Wearers of the Ermine. I most earnestly urge upon the con gress the duty of increasing the totally inadequate salaries now given to our Judges. On the whole there is no body of public servants who do as valuable work, nor whose moneyed reward is so Inadequate compared to their work. Be ginning with the supreme court the judges should have their salaries dou bled. It is not befitting the dignity of the nation that its most honored public servants should be paid sums so small compared to what they would earn in private life that the performance of public service by them Implies an ex ceedingly heavy pecuniary sacrifice. It is earnestly to be desired that some method should be devised for doing away with the long delays which now obtain in the administration of justice, and which operate with peculiar sever ity against persons.of small means, and favor only the very criminals whom it ia moat dealrable to punish. These long delays in the final decisions of eases make In the aggregate a crying evil and a remedy sboujJ be devised. Much, of this Intolerable, delay Is due to Improper regard paid to technicali ties which are a mere hinderance to justice.. In some.noted recent cases this over-regard for technicalities has re sulted. in a striking denial of justice, and flagrant wrong to the body politic.
