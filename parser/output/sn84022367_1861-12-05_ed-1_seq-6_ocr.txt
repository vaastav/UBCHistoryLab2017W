J wyw?ire-'mwiiiranir THELRUTLAND WEEKLY HERALD: THURSDAY, DECEMBER 5, 101 THURSDAY, DECEMBER R. VsF' The Courier not only attacks John Cain's speech as a "wishy washy" thing, but it also alleges that one of the editors of this paper "blowed for Gov. Fairbanks at two dollars per day," and "blowed hira up"when that small pittance was stopp ed. There is no truth in the allegations of the Courier whatever. What have Cain and Dewey done that they should be so abusedby the Courier ? Cain is denounc ed as a "wishy washy" speech maker, and Dewey as a mercenary penny-a-liner, and a straddler of two several and respective Banks! From such abuse "goml Lord deliver us !" The announcement that Senator Wilson is to introduce a bill to abolish the othce of sut- 1 1 1 11 ... . " those army cormorants. It is said that in many instances the colonels of regiments are intereted with the sutlers in the profits, anil already money is being raised among them to defeat the bill. 0T It is stated that every mail which ar rives at Washington, brings from twenty to thirty letters to the War Department, from parties stating that they cin raise regiments, battallions or brigades for the different arms of the service, and asking authority to do so. The answer given is that no further authori ty chii be ".'ranted. Thk Cavalry Rk;imknt. The Free Press of Saturday says that it is not un likely the Cavalry Regiment will remain in Burlington through the winter. 'I he Regiment paraded on foot in the streets Saturday and made a fine appearance. JT The editor of the Courier makes a good point on one of the editors of this paper by saying that he signed a petition for the new Batik, and then went to Mont- j pelitram! did all he could ajrainst the j charter. A- Ai tr-n:a- Ward -av : " That ! is two iron.'" The onlv excue the edi tor ha- to offer is that he -iirned the peti- ; n.j,lT ;u., (iav -.matiziiig the bu-ines- of tion inadvert. ntlv and without reflection, i hi otnee ar.d taking the preliminary steps in i the mi-nig oi the 7th and -th regiments. precisely a- the editor of the Courier em- j v,. beli.-ve the military atlaits of the Stat braced AUditionism a few vear- ago . m future will show that he i- the right man " ! in the right place." Mu. Nichols' Sj-kkch. We publish to- dav the sneech of Mr Nicho's on the Reso- lutiorn introduced into the House by Ex Governor Kyland Fletcher, at the late ses sion ot the Legislature. The important news from the Southern coast during the past week Ims compelled us to defer its publica tion to the present time. We notice with pleasure that the Courier publishes the speech, and gives it a hearty endorsement. This is certainiv magnani- mous, and atlonis renewea evidence that in I'komotioxs in 3d Ukoimkm. - Ser putting down this unjust and wicked rebel geant Charles I'. ChamU-rlain of Companv lion. Republicans and Democrats will stand I shoulder to shoulder like a band of brothers without regard to past political differences animated only by the purpose to save the KeDublic lrom the vio ent hands of traitors r j wlto would destrov it. and al! the blessings of i fw-edom which it secures. Without indor sing in full, all the comments which the Cou rier makes upon the speech, we repeat that its editor has done in act of justiee to Mr. Nichols which does him honor. THE 

ACTION AT IOUT PICKENS. The New York Times -ays: Oi the progress and result of the action we have no details. A defective rehash vi' reports, not at till authenticated, tells of tlie two National steam frigates disa bled : of a breach in the walls of I'icken-: cf l'eu-aco!a fired and Warrington burn cd ; of -i l io.is losses on the side of the s;ide t the iviiels ; and lighting still con tinued. From a 1 this nothing significant can b gathered. We only know that Fort Pickens, after a silence which seem ed imperturbable, ha- at la -t spoken, and that Bragg has replied. Why this c n-ver-ational interchange cf .-hot and shell began no earlier, we shall probably know hereafter. The delay has not been with out important effects. It has furnished Fort Pickens with a more perfect arma ment, with inexhaustible munition- and supplies, with a full complement ot de fenders and these latter with a certain degree of skill in handling, if not in liring, their guns. On the other hand, Bragg has fringed the whole semi-circle which sweeps around the north side of the Fort with guns of the largest calibre, one hun dred and fifty in number, and protected either by bomb-proof forts, or earthworks equally impervious to shell. The com batants are, consequently, in the best pos sible fighting trim, and not likely to aban don the contest until one or the other has been destroyed. Legislature mi HfMera Virjri-ia.

But. at the same time, the latter must be prepar ed to respond to the heavy shot and shell from Barancas and the shore batteries. If by these combiwed forces a breach has been effected in the walls of Pickens, smd the fleet retired more or less disabed, the fall of Pickens may be within the reason able bounds of probability ; but we prefer awai ing further tidings before coming to so sad and unsatisfactory a conclusion.

SOUTH. Five numbers of a neat little paper entitled the Camp Kettle, and " published every oportunity by the field and staff" of the liouridbead regiment, Co!. Leasure commanding," had been issued at Tort Royal, S. C, previous to the -ailing of the Atlantic. The secession papers have report that after Jeff. Thompson's defeat at Fred eriekton, Mo., the Northern Goth- and Vandals burned a portion of the town, pillaged the Catholic church, amted oOtne of the ladies of the place, forcibly tore their ear bobs from their ear- and rings from their lingers, and offered them other indignities too hateful to mention.
