Sacrifice in the home, sends the in cense of joy through the house. Be sure you are right then hole the stakes while the other fellows bet All the -world's a stage and a lo of actors thereon are merely stag horses.

If some people were to think before they speak it would be far more dial cult for them to carry on an animatcc conversation. Harry H. Charles, of Quincy, 111., has 6ubmitted a novel plan to the post office plan for a C. O. D. department it connection with the proposed parce post delivery. His plan would mak the postofiice the agent of the mer chant. Parcels mailed at any postoffict in the country could be delivered anc collected for in any other part of the country. The same rule would applj to the whole country. The postmastei general is greatly taken up with th plan and it may be adopted in the neai future, particularly as the attoruej general sees no constitutional hin drance in its way. There is now much contention in tht navy department over the large bills for pilotage sent in by captains o' nearly every warship in the service, and the authorities frankly admit that naval officers, great as is their skill in battle and in the accurate use of heavj guns, know almost nothing of harbors charts or the art of steering vessels i3 the most open channels. This admis sion, perhaps, explains why the Ameri can navy, acknowledged invincible in actual fight, manned by the finest crews and cleverest officers, has never theless been a standing joke in time oi peace and why so many American ships have run aground or collided with rocks and snags. It is reported that the United States department of agriculture is activelj engaged in originating an orange thai will bear a greater degree of frcst thai; any now grown. At first sight this feat might appear difficult to accom plish, but when we remember that wc have apples that will not stand sever climatic conditions, and that apples have been produced that will stand such conditions, we see that there is hope. To illustrate: The best apples cf the eastern states, such as the Bald win, will not grow at all in some western states. It has taken years tc develop apples like the Wealthy 'thai will stand. We might also mention tht Ben Davis, which grows abundantly all over the west and resists all kinds oJ hard conditions. So the governmenl may succeed in its undertaking. Carbolic acid poisoning cases have become so common in every communi ty as to suggest an investigation of drug-store practice in this direction. It should not be easy to obtain so dead ly an article. But Ella Hyland, a 14 year old Chicago school girl, died from the effects of this poison, which she had little difficulty in obtaining. Such a case is a striking comment on the indis criminate sale of this dangerous drug. In the face of the law prohibiting the eale of poisons without due precaution, it seems astonishing that a young girl ehould have purchased a quantity of this acid sufficient to destroy life. The unfortunate child stated that the acid was to be used for removing stains from a floor. Though cognizant that It could be needed for no such purpose the drug clerk, with a commonplace warning, handed the child the means of destroying her life. Miss Helen Gould is again proving herself "the soldiers' friend." She i? supplying the men at the front with traveling libraries. The United States transport Thomas, which recently sail ed for Manila, carried two of these li braries for the troops in the Philip pines. Within the next few days sim ilar libraries will be sent to the troops in Cuba and Porto Rico. The men at Forts Hamilton and Slocum have al ready received their boxes of books. The libraries are put up in oak cases with room for a hundred or more vol umes in each case. When the men at one army pest have read the books in their library the case is sent to an other post, thus forming a circulating library in America, Cuba, Porto Rico, the Hawaiian Islands, Guam and the Philippines. The books consist c works of travel, biographies, novels, a few hymn books, and Bibles. Alto gether Miss Gould has given more than a thousand new books. No item of lame wrists and bandages, rubber and cotton wrappings, sleep famine or weakened pulse, was omit ted from the published reports of an eight hundred mile bicycle record re cently made in ninety-two hours by a woman. She wore a sweater with broad red and green stripes, a divided skirt of buff color, and a felt hat with a gaudy band and tall feather. Her custom was as ladylike and as worthy of emulation as the motive of the feat Itself, which was "to gratify pique and pride and outdo all other women." GAGE MAKES ESTIMATES.

LONG REPORTS rUlTTriE NAVY. Sampson Chosen for Honors Asks Mach Money for Ills Department. Washington, Dec. 5. John D. Long, secretary of the navy, wants congress to thank Rear-Admiral Sampson for his work during the Spanish-American war. In his annual report the secre tary urges President McKinley to call congress' attention to the valorous deeds of the north Atlantic squadron to the end that Rear-Admiral Sampson and the men under hir may have at least equal honor with Admiral Dewey and his supporters at the battle of Manila. The secretary recommends the building of eighteen new warships and the equipment of them with the best armor obtainable. The secretary gives a table showing naval construction going on abroad, as compared with that in the United States. From this it appears that only Italy and Japan laid down less ton nage than this country during the pres ent year, and that Italy alone had less tonnage under construction. The total tonnage under construction is: Eng land, 331,680; France, 255,533; Ger many, 148,235; Italy, 120.540; Japan, 130,000; Russia, 222.975; United States, 123,226. Secretary Long concludes by giving the cost of the navy during the year. June 30, 1S99, he says, $39,045,113.51 had been drawn out of the $30,576, 42 7.61 appropriated, leaving a balance of $41,531,313.10. He estimates the grand total for the needs of 1901 aa $74,230,309.15, the large increase over this year being due to many improve ments under way.

BONGRESSAGAIH1NSESSI0N. Case of Representative Roberts May Be Dealt With at Once. OPPONENTS ARE DETERMINED. Protest Will Be Made "When the Utah Statesman Attempts to Take tbe Oath. In toe Bouse Rlchardion of Ten nessee to Lead Minority. Washington, Dec. 5. Probably the most interesting incident in the house if representatives today will develop nrhen Representative Roberts of Utah idvances to take the oath of office. Objection will be made by a repub lican, and a motion will be made that Ur. Roberts step aside and that his ase be referred to a special commit tee. Speaker Henderson will entertain Ihe motion, and the republican major ity will support it. The democrats are fcxpected to raise an issue, but nothing has developed to indicate how far they will carry their objection. Some of them will protest against the proceed ings, and should there be a roll call a party vote may be shown. The republicans have no doubt that the house will refuse to seat Mr. Rob erts. Owing to the time which will be con sumed in the disposition of the Rob erts case the drawing of seats, which asually requires several hours, prob ably will be postponed until Tuesday. The announcement of Vice-President Hobart's dearth will be made probably Immediately after the Roberts case is disposed of, and the house will ad journ out of respect to his memory. The drawing of seats and the reading of the president's message will occupy Tuesday. Tuesday night the repub licans will caucus on the financial bill. It is the intention of the republican leaders to make this a caucus meas ure and proceed and pass it before the holiday recess. The caucus will decide, if the present Intention Is followed, not to wait for the appointment of the committee on banking and currency, but to bring the bill into the house forthwith, probably under a special order from the com mittee on rules. The dr-baie may begin on Wednesday. The length of time to be given to debate has not yet b?en determined. By some it is thought that three or four days may su.llce. While the session promises to be upon the whole a busy cne in the sen ate, the first week probably will be marked by considerable lethargy. In deed, it would be exceptional if any actual work should be done. On Mon day the new senators will be sworn In, but beyond this nothing will be done. Ordinarily the president's mes sage is received on the first day of the Bcssicn, but its receipt will be post, poned for a day this session out of respect to the memory of the late Vice President Hobart. Tuesday little will be clone beyond the receipt of the annual message, the present purpose being to adjourn im mediately after the reading of the mes sage to give the republican senators an opportunity to hold a caucus over the reorganization of the committees. Wednesday and Thursday will be de voted largely to the introduction of bills. There probably will be no ses sion either Friday or Saturday. Among the first bills to be introduced will be the financial measure prepared by the republican members of the fi nancial committee. It will be offered by Senator Aldrich and will be referred to the whole finance committee, in cluding the democratic members. 

HOUSE OFFICERS ARE NOMINATED. Democrats Choose lt:chrdon for Sppuher Henderson Named. Washington, Dec. 5. The democrats of the house of representatives at their caucus held in the hall of representa tives Saturday selected Representative James D. Richardson of Tennessee as their candidate for speaker, after a spirited contest which lasted through six ballots. Thi3 carries with it the democratic leadership on the floor. The candidates against Mr. Richardson were Representatives De Arraond of Missouri, Bankhead of Alabama and Sulzer of New York. The following candidates for house officers were se lected: Clerk, James Kerr of Penn sylvania; sergeant-at-arm3, ex-Representative Brookshire of Indiana; door keeper, Henry Moler of Illinois, and postmaster, George I... Browning of Virginia. A resolution was adopted in structing Mr. Richardson to confer with Speaker Henderson and request a larger democratic representation on committees. At the republican caucus Col. David B. Henderson of Iowa was nominated for speaker by acclamation. The offi cers of the last house, except Col. Rus sel, the sergeant-at-arms, were renom inated without opposition. The Reed rules of order were adopted. Transport Sails for Port Said. Gibraltar, Dec. 5.

Cape Town, Dec. 5. Serious new3 comes from the northern sections of Cape Colony. The whole border dis trict between Colesburg and Burgers dorp has declared for the Boers. In Venterstad alone more than 2,000 have joined the rebellion. The farmers have formed a commandeering committee and talk confidently of a triumphant march on Cape Town. Gen. Buller'a proclamation has been torn down and trampled upon, and the loyalists are bidden to hurry to Cape Town to pre pare coffee for the rebels. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. An Outline of the Chief Points In the Doc ument to Congress. Washington, Dec. 5. The chief points in the forthcoming message of the president are: The United States government has acquired sovereignty over the Philip pine islands by treaty with Spain, and that sovereignty should be maintained. The form of government to be applied in the islands is for congress to deter mine. At the present time the largest measure of civil government consistent with the military occupation is now In operation in Manila and towns in the Philippines and in the island of Ne gros. The conduct of affairs in the islands under the military regime is commend ed, and the recent official representa tions as guaranteeing the expectation that the rebellion will soon be crushed are indicated. No special laws are rec ommended. The ultimate form of government in Cuba cannot be established until it has been determined whether Spanish citizens of the. island shall declare whether they prefer to be Cubans or Spanish citizens. By the treaty with Spain the Spanish citizens of the is land have until April next to make that declaration. The form of government recommend ed for Porto Rico is essentially terri torial. It is proposed to nave appoint ed by the executive, subject to the ap proval of the senate, a governor and other officers, as attorney-general, treasurer, etc., these officers, with a minority number of native officers, to form a legislative council. The completion of the Nicaragua ca nal at the earliest possible day con sistent with the public economies is urged. The question of the immediate legislation is not. touched. It is maintained that it is the abuse of trusts which is the cause of the hardship attributed by the people to corporations. No specific remedial leg islation is suggested, but congress is urged to deal with the subject effect ively, in accordance with the equities as between the people and combina tions and corporations which may be shown to be oppressive and a burden to the people. Only indirect reierenee to the'tariS is made, as a largely contributory caus? to what is characterized as the prosperity of the people. The gold standard is openly advo cated and the recommendations pre viously made to protect the gold re serve and provide for larger circulation are renewed. GO 

ARMED TO THE CAPITAL. Kentuckian on the Alert Goob.l lias a rian II Kelieg On. Frankfort, Ky., Dec. 5. The situa tion seems quiet on the surface, but there is a feeling cf unrest which presages trouble. New companies of the state guard haA'e been organized at Pineville, Barbourville, London, Corbin and Paintsville. The members are all mountaineers. At 12 o'clock last night they left for this city. Each man carries a big revolver and on ar riving here will be provided with a uni form and rifle. These men are all re publicans, and are determined, it is said, to see that Taylor is inaugurated governor. The captains and lieuten ants of the companies are said to have the men well in hand, and it is be lieved that they will obey orders. If thej' do this there is no likelihood or trouble from them. It is reported that Allie W. Young, chairman of the democratic state cen tral committee, and his brother, Tay lor Young, jr., have been in Perry and Rowan counties this week enlisting Goebel democrats to come to Frankfort and prevent Taylor's inauguration. This report lacks confirmation. The Goebel men seem to think they can rely on a program like this: The state board of election commissioners meets today. The board will declare that, owing to the large number of partisan republicans present, the mem bers cf the board fear violence, and will adjourn without issuing a certifi cate of election to either Goebel or Taylor. Tney will meet again the night before the day of inauguration, issue a certificate to Goebel, and he will be sworn in by a magistrate cr some member of the Court of Appeals. He will then be the defacto governor, and any attempt to inaugurate Taylor would be revolutionary. Louisville. Ky., Dec. 5. In connec tion with the canvass of the election returns an incident that is considered most significant is contained in three visits paid to Gov. Bradley by Gen. Breckinridge, inspector of the United States army. Gov. Bradley declined to give the objects of the visits. The republicans openly assert that Gen. Breckinridge was sent to Kentucky to take command of the United States troops at i'ort Thomas in the event they are needed hv G-v. Bradley. Msr. Chuppolle Coin? to Manila. San Francisco, Ca1.., Dec. 5. Mgr. Chappelle, archbishop of New Orleans and apostolic delegate to Cuba. Porte Rico and the Philippines, arrived here Sunday en route to Manila, where he goes to arrange church affairs to con form with the change of government in the Philippines. I.oe Trace of I.oals MIlTer. Norfolk, Va., Dec. 5. No trace has been found of the man seen here sup posed to be Louis Miller, the abscond ing head of the swindling "Franklin syndicate" of Brooklyn. Capt. Chris tophersen of the Norwegian steamship Fortuna, to whom he applied for pas sage to Tampico, Mexico, said today a thorough search of the ship so far as possible had been made, but the sup posed Miller had not been found, al though it was not improbable that he is in the bunkers. The ship i3 coal laden and sails tomorrow. OPPOSE 8EATM60F nOBEIR Congressmen Would Expel the Member from Utah. DEKINITE ACTION DELAYED. Committee Will Act on the Matter Today D. It. Henderson Takes His 8e-t as Speaker Keed Itules Adopted Short Session of Senate. Washington, Dec. C. At the open ing of the house Monday the princi pal rnterest centered in the disposition of the case of Mr. Roberts, the Mor mon representative from Utah. The program outlined by the republican leaders at their conference on Friday night was partly curried out. '1 lie objection to the administration of tho oath to Mr. Roberta was entered by Mr. Tayler of Ohio, and, as predicted, Mr. Roberts stepped aside without pro test, except to ask if by doing so he waived any of his rights. To this the speaker responded in the negative. The only voice raised except that of Mr. Tayler's was that of Mr. McRae, a democrat of Arkansas, who joined with Mr. Tayler in his protest. Mr. Tayler offered his resolution to refer the case to a special committee, but L mutual agreement the consid eration cf the resolution was postponed until today in order that the routine business in connection with the or ganization might be transacted. Although Mr. Roberts was not sworn in, he secured a seat. This, however, was by an accident. In the seat-drawing no provision had been made for Mr. Roberts, but when the drawing was completed, two others, as well as himself, had not been provided with seats, and the speaker asked and se cured from the house generc.l permis sion for them to make such selections as they could. ir. Roberts got a scat-ha an obscure portion cf the hall. IIis?daughter sat in the gallery and watched the pro ceedings from beginning to end. Very early in the day a monster peti tion, said to consist of 7,000,030 names, protesting against the seating of Mr. Roberts, was brought into the hall. The election of Speaker Henderson and his induction into office, the ap pointment of the usual committees to wait upon the president, the seat drawing contest, . went; on without a hitch, me only other" feature out of the ordinary was the adaption of the Reed rules for the present congress. They were adopted by a strict part' vote. , After tho invocation the reading clerk began calling the roll. Mr. Rob erts sat listening intently for his name, and when it was called he responded "here" in a loud voice. But he looked nervous and ill at ease. There were ! no demonstrations during the roll call, j When it concluded Clerk McDowell, announced that 252 members had an swered to their names a quorum. Mr. Hepburn of Iowa offered a reso lution, which was adopted viva voce, providing that the house proceed to the election of a speaker for the fifty eixth congress. Thereupon Mr. Gros venor of Ohio, as chairman of the re publican caucus, presented the name of David B. Henderson of Iowa. Mr. Hay of Virginia, chairman of the democratic caucus, nominated James D. Richardson of Tennessee. Mr. Ridgely of Kansas nominated John C. Bell of Colorado as the populist candi date, and Mr. Wilson of Idaho placed Francis G. Newlands of Nevada in nomination as the candidate of the sil ver party. Each party having put forward it? candidate, by the direction of the clerk tne roll was called and each member voted for the candidate of his choice. Mr. Morris of Minnesota, Mr. Over Etreet of Indiana and Mr. Carmack of Tennessee were appointed tellers. The roll call resulted: Henderr-on, 177; Richardson, 153; Bell, 4; Newlands, 2. The clerk thereupon announced the election of Mr. Henderson anim great republican .applause. He designated Mr. Richardson, Mr. Bell and Mr. New lands as n committee to escort the speaker to the chair. Mr. Gardiner (rep., N. J.) announced the death of Vice-President Hojart, re ferring briefly to his career. Later, he said, he would r-sk the house to set aside a day to pay appropriate, tribute to his memory. As a further mark of respect upon his motion the house, at 3:50 p. m., adjourned until today. I.udvwiiiltli If. spiCil .Slit-lied. Frere Camp, Nov. 30. A message from Ladysmith, dated Nov. 2, says: "The chief feature of the last three days has been deliberate shelling of the town, including the hospital. Schalkburgher, in command of the Boers, sent a message that all the wounded must go to Ikombi camp. Gen. White peremptorily refused. The Boers then continued shelling the hospital. There has been much damage to the town recently. The Beers investing the place probably number 10,000. The troops are healthy, but impatient. Itebels rat to Knut Manila. Dec. 6 Capt.
