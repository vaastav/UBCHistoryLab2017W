The American Economfst holds that the Republicans could have won the election if the fight had been made on the tariff Issue. Maybe so. That ts the issue on which the Democrats won in the last two previous elections in which they were successful. President Wilson inherited the Mex ican problem from Taft. Nearly fbur years have elapsed and the problem is no nearer solution than it was on the day of the president's inaugura tion. The situation has not changed materially in any particular. There is no government down there and Villa still is in the saddle. The talk of an embargo on Ameri can food products, hardly seems time ly, in view of the fact that millions across the Atlantic are said to be suf- leritig iruni jctiti ui iuuu. a mi mti -more it seems unnecessary when one takes into account those 72,000,000 eggs stored in Chicago. "There appears to be no dissatis faction in the United States over the government's interference in San Do mingo. The South American republics are yet to be heard from. That which appears to be sauce for the Dominican goose is by no means sauce for thu Mexican gander. Uncle "Sam has taken over the administration of government in the island rather than permit anarchy to prevail. But of course 3,000,000 people are much more easily managed than 15,000,000. Besides the inhabitants of Hayti are mostly negroes and the Democrats know how to handle that class of per sons, as the result of long experience. ...It is proposed to add a 2H cent piece to the coinage. This probably would be followed by a new chain of eLores and a whole outfit of slot ma chines. According to a story in the Decem ber issue of The American Boy, a youth named Oliver Stedman was the first Christmas tree merchant in New York City. More than one hundred years ago it was when Oliver and his friend Mark Carr went out into the ! woods up the Hudson river, and cut a .large wagonload of fir trees. and car ried them down to the corner of Broad way and Vesey streets, where they made their stand. Before that, if a New York resident wanted a Christmas tree, he crossed the river and cut a fir tree for himself and carried it home. Probably, among those who will be Clad if the eight-hour day really be comes universal, are the hired men on the farms. Boston People are contributing money to buy rifles for use in the next Irish rebellion. Boston ought to be a good place to work up sympathy for that Spanish heiress. We don't see how the government could well do less than award a rea sonable amount of naval construction to California yards. . Business has been so good this year that it is hard to tell when the Christ mas shopping began. THE 

AUSTRALIAN W AY. Commissioner P. E. Chinn, of New South Wales. Autralia. now in this country, has been giving the American people some pointers on the regulation of the cost of living. The labor government of Australia has taken drastic steps, he says, to control food prices that, naturally enough, show the same tendency to climb skyward as they do in this coun try. The dealers are complaining bit terly because the vision of big profits has been dissipated. A food commission is regulating prices, much as the Interstate Com merce Commission in this country reg ulates railroad rates. Butter in Sydney costs 36 cents a pound, and cannot jump to 40 tomor row and 4 5 next week at the will of the merchants or the dairymen. If it goes up, it will be only with the au thorization of the commission, follow- ing a hearing at which both dealer and consumer will be represented. Cheese sells at 12. 14 or 18 cents a pound, according: to kind and quality. The commission recently ordered a re duction in price of 5 cents. Eggs the newly laid variety may be had in he big cities, for from 25 to 30 cents a dozen. New South Wales has a state bak ery that sells a two-pound loaf for 7 cents. Sydney owns municipal trawl ers and cold-storage warehouses,, by means of whicht has broken the "fish ring" and reduced the price of fish to the consumer. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Readers of the annual message which President Wilson read to con gress Tuesday, will look in vain for any reference to the relation of the United States to foreign governments. A search for any word in regard to the Mexican problem will be equally futile. The president's utterance is confined almost wholly to a plea for the solu tion of the present and other possible controversies between railroads and their employes. The message contains a carefully worded invitation to congress to be stow upon the executive, in case of a general strike, the power to take over the operation of the railroads on the plea of public necessity. As a further measure of safety against the possible paralysis of the country's business by a railroad strike it is urged that legislation be enacted looking to investigation and arbitra tion. Possibly the president will be heard from later on matters of public con cern which are omitted from the mes sage under consideration. On the other hand he may plan to await the incoming of the new congress before taking up the Mexican situation. 

MORE ZEAL THAN SENSE. The attempt of the members of the Women's Congressional Union to heckle the president, while he was de livering his annual message to con gress shows more zeal than sense. The adoption of their cherished Susan B. Anthony amendment by congress would place them no nearer their goal than they are now. A vote for suf frage by three-fourths of the states in the Union still would be necessary be fore that amendment could become ef fective. The states which already have suf frage could be counted upon, but how about the others? The southern states would almost certainly reject it. In many of the other states favorable ac tion has been sought, in some more than once, but without success. Is it likely that the voters of these states would be any more amenable to ar gument when voting on a national amendment than when voting on a state amendment? When the suffragists can count 36 states in their list, it will be time to ask that the other 12 be forced into line. Their chances of winning would then be almost assured. THE 

RICH MAN'S WAY. The December Woman's Home Companion has an article in which this passage occurs: "The nuisance for the man who has acquired great financial resources usually is that he doesn't know what he wants. Possessing the resources and feeling the moral necessity to have recourse to them, he looks about for something to want, and he selects the most costly thing. The acquisition of this most costly thing always involves, in practice, the separation of the rich man from society. Thus, he will ac quire a large estate, or several large estates, and cut himself off from the world by gates, doors, miles of drive, lodge keepers, menials, and secreta ries. Or he will acquire a two-thousand-ton yacht and cross the Atlantic privately, tho less quickly, less com fortably, and even less privately than on a great liner. Or he will keep a private orchestra, instead of being seen at concerts. All which, though magnificent, is anti-social and silly. and is secretly felt to be so by the rich .man when he happens to wake up in tne middle of the night and cant go to sleep again." TURN OF THE TIDE. A tendency toward a reaction in the riotous condition of prices is noted by Henry Clews in his weekly review of the business situation. Much of the change is attributed to the re volt against the high cost of living. Following is one of the striking state ments in the review: "Natural law is still superior to all human interference, which usually re sults in a new set of ills, worse than those attempted to displace." He says further: For several weeks past reactionary symptoms have been developing in the stuck market. Under the stimu lus of war inflation the situation had become very one-sided, and the danger of too violent . reversal was becoming more and more apparent, unless the brakes could be applied with discre tion. The first check came from a perfectly natural cause the desire to take profits. A great deal of liquida tion has already occurred during the month Just closed, insiders in a posi tion to know being fully aware that it was advisable to lessen their hold ings before the movement had reached a climax. To this extent the technical situation has been improved, espe cially by this week's decline. But other influences have also been at work temporarily favoring a re action. The first of these was the genT eral uprising against high prices, es pecially in commodities. Dear food was breeding serious public discontent and paving the way for further Gov ernment interference with business. Again there were signs that our pros perity wave while 'not ended is ap proaching, if it has not reached, its zenith, and that owing to the greatly increased cost of doing business there will be no such profits in 1917 as in 1916. Labor is securing a liberal pro portion of these profits, and when the increased costs of labor, raw materials and distribution are taken into con sideration, the margin of profits, it will be discovered, has been materially affected. Moreover, high prices are already causing lessened consumption and increased production. Thus does natural law in the form of supply and demand automatically correct abnor mal conditions more surely than any of the fads and nostrums advanced by those who believe in Government reg ulation. Another cause of reaction was the increased tightness of money. The expansion of credit has been enor mous, and in spite of the marvelous growth of banking resources, the de mand for accumulation was growing at a pace that rendered a slowing down Inevitable. The Immense vol ume of business at abnormal profits, the great expansion of credit, the ab sorption of foreign-held securities, the huge amount of money invested In various foreign loans and the demands of new enterprises at tiome, all meant heavy demands upon the local money market. Lenders and investors are consequently asking and securing bet ter rates; in other words, capital, like other things, is rising in value be cause demand is overtaking supply and owners are enabled to hold for more advantageous terms. Off the Coast. (By Susan E. Clagett.) Just why Lavinia Payton was deter mined to carry out her plan in the face of angry opposition she' could not have told. Probably it was due to the opposition. But this last idea, fad, idiosyncrasy, whatever her friends were minded to call it, passed anything tnat naa gone before. Yet it was a very simple thing she proposed to do merely to shun the beaten path that led toward White Sulphur Springs and go anywhere that would take her away from the life her people had led for generations and expected her to live. White Sulphur or Saratoga during the summer, Rich mond and Washington during the win ter months, with frequent trips to New York. When asked where she was going she shook her head with a smile. "I have no definite plan," she t6t plied. But far back ifi the recesses of her brain was a very positive idea. She was going somewhere by water and alone. She longed for Portugal or the fjords of Norway, but she sailed on a steamer for the fjords of New foundland, the Norway of America. The walk to Signal or Cabot's Tow er, is not one to take alone. It is long. It is steep. The road follows the shore until it begins to ascend and is lonely. When steamers come there is always a sprinkling of people, most ly driving toward the tower, where there is a magnificent view of the har bor and ocean. This'and much more was told in the booklet Lavinia had learned by heart. But there was one grave omission. Indeed, two. The first was wind, the other, mist What was fog in the city was a fine rain higher up, and the wind was a gale. She had felt wind before, but never like this. It whipped her wet skirts about her until she thought she would never move again. She tried to loosen them as she stumbled along the rocky path, her breath coming and going in gasps. Ahead was the tower, gray and somber, built to defy the elements. She saw a little group of people stand ing in an angle of the granite mass, one figure apart from the others and nearer to her. Then everything was blank. She was conscious only of blind terror as the wind caught and whirled her about. For a space, eter nity fronted her, then the awfulness of the wind subsided and she found herself clinging desperately to the gray sleeve of an ulster. "What made you attempt that alone?" the man said roughly-, giving her a little shake as he let her go. But Lavinia had no mind to be let go and clung to the arm that was half with drawn. "Don't dare to faint," the voice went on sharply. "Didn't you know Signal Hill was no place for a woman unless she had a man with her?" "I don't know. The book said walk, so I walked." "Why didn't you bring some one with you?" "I am alone." "Surely you made friends coming up on the steamer." "No. That was lust what I didn't wish to do. All my life I have wanted to get away from everybody." "Well, you missed it by the fraction of a second. . Another such truest and you would have got away from ev- erjDoay. t caugnt you just in time." He left her in the angle of the wall and stepped forward, a tall, broad- shouldered, athletic-looking man v.-ith Keen oiue eyes ana a determined mouth. "Come." he said. extending his hand. "You must see the view before we go." She hesitated. "Come." This time the word was im patient. "If we are to make Quidi Vidi we must be off." "But I am not going to Quidi Vidi." "Yes, you are. The village is r-y objective point." "It is not mine." "See here." For the first time she saw his face and it was filled with an ger. "Do you think I am going to give up my trip because you are obstinate ly determined to go back the way, you came?" "What has my determination to do with it?" "Can you cross that strip alone?" He nodded toward the narrow path where the wind had full sweep altho she could not feel it where she sat. "J should think one experience would be sufficient. You and I are alone. The others who were here left some time ago. I am going on. You are coming with me. Hurry. - The climb down the rocks will soon be dangerous." She arose with such evident reluc tance that he threw back his head and laughed. It was a long and rough scramble to the little fishing village, one of the most picturesque- on the Newfound rand coast. It was a glimpse of na ture never to be forgotten and impos sible of description. For a time Lavinia 'stood silent. "To think I might have missed it," she said at last. "Thank you for mak ing me come." "I take it you are not often made to do anything," he said, with a smile. "This is the first time within my memory." She answered his smile. "I imagine you are not often crossed, yourself." , "I pretty generally have my way," he replied carelessly. "Do you see that tiny, whitewashed cottage over yonder? I boarded -there one sum mer. I am glad to remember I was there. The following winter was most severe. There was much suffering, so in a small way I helped my landlady over a perilous time." He glanced at her curiously. "Does it ever occur to you to wonder how the other half lives?" She shook her head. "This is my first escape from the beaten path." "Don't you ever long to get away from it," he asked casually. They were loitering along the two mile stretch of road between the vil lage and St. John's. As he spoke she paused and looked back at the lovely view. "I wouldn't be here if I had not felt I must escape from it." When they parted neither knew the other's name. Lavlna did not think it necessary to mention hers, as they would never meet again, and if there was a purpose behind the keen. amused eyes as the man touched her hand in parting there was no out-' ward sign that he did not acquiesce in her decision. The next morning she left for Labrador. She was a little late in reaching the steamer, and, somewhat breathless from haste, was following the stew ard down the deck when the back of a rough, gray coat, caught and held her attention. There was something familiar about IU so familiar that she moved hastily forward, confronting the owner with blazing eyes. "You!" "Why not?" "You came because you knew I was sailing on this steamer?" "Partly. I intended taking the trip. It made no difference if I came now or later on. Do not misunderstand me. It was not for your charming society, but because I know it is not desirable for a woman, especially a young woman, to take this trip alone." "And how am I to know you will not make yourself as unpleasant as other people. You are as much a stranger as they." He regarded her steadily. "You will take that back," he said at last. "No." She turned from him with out another word. ' They ran into fog that night, de pressing, penetrating fog. There were eleven davs of it, and the trip was lengthened to a fortnight, but long before the fourteen days were up La vinia had offered friendliness. It was one thing to be alone in sunshine, quite another to be alone and weighed down by a heavy gray blanket that allowed no view other than that of the steamer's deck. He accepted her overtures with no degree of eagerness, but under his apparent indifference was a steadfast determination that made itself evident . ; - . . . ,. ,, vA l tner eJ,e""'B T.rf T, er," behave a clear majority of twelve or tit- ended the silence that had fallen be tween them by saying: "You have not yet retracted the words you said to me the morning we left St. John's." "It is not fair that you should hold them against me. I was beginning to regard you as a friend." - y "You had recognized' the possibili ties of friendship even before - you spoke." "You are mistaken. I had given it no thought." "You knew I was to be trusted. She did not answer directly. "For two weeks we have neither of us known who the other was. I do not even know your name, but I am going to ask you to my home. Will you come?" His eyes softened to a wonderful gentleness. "When ?" "And you may ask for " He interrupted. "You need not tell me." "You know me?" "Your picture stood on your broth er's desk at college. He is my very good friend and the picture is a won derful likeness." He did not consider it necessary to tell her he had begged the picture from his friend. That would come later. She was not ready for what he had to say and he coatd wait.

Such a scampering and a scrabbling as there was in the trees after that! Of course. Foxy Squirrel, being inter ested in his own affairs, had supposed that he was the only squirrel who had received the autumn's message. But he soon found out his mistake. All his friends had heard the dropping nuts and every little squirrel in the whole woods was out for food. But, dear me! Mother Nature had prepared for them! There were nuts and plenty for all nobody would have to go hungry this fall, that was sure. For every little breeze showered down nuts and more nuts, and plenty of nice ripe acorns for all. The squirrels didn't even have to hunt far; they only had to store up the goodies that were right close to hand. t'p he ran, clear to the tcJp. After Foxy had carried three loads of nuts up the tree to his private store house, he decided that he would get some few nuts right off the tree. So he raced up the nearest oak, jumped over to the next, and ran up to the topmost branch. Xow Foxy knew very well that he could get all the nuts he could store that djiy, right down on the ground, oh, yes, he knew that. But he also knew that he would like nothing better than a run up to the top of that oak tree. And you know yourself how easy it is to per suade yourself that you ought to do eomething that you wish to do. It wasn't two minutes till Foxy had de cided that he really should look for nuts up that tree; and up he ran, ciear to the top. ' And there he saw Tommy Jay. "Hello there, TommyV' said Foxy, this is a fine autumn day." ("That'll surprise him, I guess," thought Foxy, " cause he don t know that autumn has begun!") "Fine, indeed," replied Tommy, "and It's time you were gettiag to work, seems to me!" Now that didn't please Foxy one bit. He wanted to be the one to tell Tom my what to do, it's lots more fun to tell than to be told. So he spoke up real tartly, "If you know that au tumn's here why don't you fly south? And how do you know it's autumn anyway? You don't have to listen for the fall of nuts!" "No, I know I don't," replied Tom my, good-naturedly, just as tho he didn't hear the crossness of Foxy'a voice, "but I know when autumn comes just the same. Don't you see that the leaves are dry and golden? Don't you see that there are fewer in sects each day for me to eat? I'll be going south very soon very soon!" And then Foxy was sorry for his temper for he knew he would miss Tommy, miss him very much. (Copy- ngnt ciara Ingram Judson.) OUT FORSPEAKER A. 31. Keene of Fort Scott Ex pects to Preside In House. He Claims to Have Enough Votes to Elect Him. Claims of pledges from fifty-six of the eighty-six Republican members of the house of representatives were made today by A. M. Keene of Fort Scott; candidate tor speaker of the 1917 session. Keene expects to win the nomination on the first ballot in the Republican caucus, he told Topeka friends in. a visit to the state house. Pledges claimed by the Fort Scott man are twelve more than the number of votes required to nominate. It is probable that J. M. Gilman of Leavenworth, will be a contender against Keene in the speakership fight. The Fort Scott man, however, ex presses confidence that his election is now assured. In addition to voluntary pledges from fifty-six Republican members. Keene stated that he ex pected to win at least a half dozen ad ditional votes on the first ballot. In addition to the Keene and Gilman can didacies. Frank Travis of lola, has been mentioned as a probable candi date, but has made no announcement. Voluntary Pledges. "Voluntary pledges have been re ceived by me from fifty-six of tiie eighty-six Republican members of the House, saia J.eene. I am sure l snu.u teen votes on the first ballot and may win by an even larger majority than now indicated." Two years ago Keene was a candi date for speaker, but was defeated by Robert Stone of Topeka. During the 1915 session. Keene was chairman of the ways and means committee of the house. He directed the appropriation fight for the administration and was a member of all of the numerous ap propriation conference committees. This year Keene returns for his fourth term in the house and is again a can didate for the speakership. 

SUIT IN BANKRUPTCY Eli Ulamperl Must Answer for Alleged Removal of Goods. ' A petition in bankruptcy against EH Ulamperl, proprietor of the store at 419 and 421 Kansas avenue, has been filed in the federal district court by J. David & Sons. Choen & Casner, Alper, Schultz & Hirschfield and Har ris Weisberg, all of New York City. The petition charges that Ulamperl has removed from the store and ship ped out of the city as baggage and ex cess baggage goods he purchased of the petitioners. It charges that he has been disposiing of goods secretly and at ruinously low prices to local per sons. The petition was filed by the firm of McClintock, Quant & Krauthoff of Kansas City. Subpoenas have been issued for a large number of witnesses to appear before Judge J. G. Slon ecker, referee in bankruptcy. Harry Friedberg of Kansas City, at torney for Mr. Ulamperl, states that the whole matter is a scheme to ruin the business of the Topeka merchant. He states that Ulamperl's purchases have been even lighter than usual this year and that he has shipped less goods out than in previous years. WOMEN DEMAND FLAG Suffs Take Back Banner 'Captured' by Page In Congress. Washington, Dec. 6. Miss Hazel Hunkins, of Billings, Mont., and Mrs. Bessie Fapandre, of San Francisco, two of the congressional union suf frage hecklers, who waved the banner from the house gallery while the pres ident was addressing congress, went to the capitol today to demand the re turn of the captured flag. The flag was turned over to the serjeant-at-arms of the house after Page Jimmy Griffen had torn it down. "The flag is ours and we want it," said the women as they r ached the capitol. "We don't expect c refusal." They refused to cay what tack they would take if they got one. RE-OCCUPY PARRAL Carranza's Soldiers Take City Held by Villa for a Month. El Paso, Dec. 6. Parral.

WANT GARREPORT Utilities Commission Directs Railways to Action. Demand Weekly Statements on Equipment Situation. SOLVE COAL SHORTAGE HERE Question of Delays in Cars Will Be Probed. Operators May Have 'to Share in the Blame. The public utilities commission to day directed all railroads in Kansas to file weekly reports showing the number of cars requested and sup plied Kansas shippers for handling of various commodities. The order of the state commission is fo the filing of reports until February 1 and is is sued in an effort to solve the coal shortage troubles. No positive orders were issued in the car and coal shortage case. But all railroads and coal operators were asked to co-operate with the commis sion in meeting the present situation. A report issued 'by the commission showed that many cars furnished by the railroads were held by operators who delayed their prompt moving. These delays are claimed by the com mission to have -been due to strikes and sundry troubles of the mining companies. With the high prices and shortage of coal, the commission reports that many operators have withdrawn their travelling men from the fi"ld and for some weeks have not solicited sales or contracts.
