K\ * ? News and Courier. Gaffney, December 2.?Tonight will be long remembered bv the Methodists of South Carolina. It was expected that there would bo many changes in the conterenee, but the Bishop handed out a number of surprises. Before reading the appointments the bishop made a talk, setting forth his reason tor making i'linn^os. lie said tliftfc no one whs reduced because of inefficiency, but because lie believed in rotation ot. the ministers both as to place and office, lie thought it right that piesiding elders should go back into the pastorate and make some new sermons and stay with tneir families. The bishop said he had had all the experiences of the pastorate and was not giving any appointments which he himself had not had. Mis talk was well received. The conference was in a spiritual condition, having* just held an experience meeting. There were songs and witnessing, and when the bishop arose to read the appointments the body was in a tender mood. The bishop begged all to hike their work without complaint and do the best work of their lives. The appointments are as follows: Anderson District. Presiding elder, A. J. Oauthcn. St. John's, P. B.

C., Dee. 4.?The State tipreme court in a decision handed own this evening reversed Judge iong of the superior court in the latter of a $30,000 fine imposed on lie Southern Railway company for elling passenger tickets at a rale in xeess of 2 1-4 cents, the state rale. lI the same time the opinion alltrms lie aet of the court and the constiluionalily of the legislative act in reseribing punishment of agents nd oilicials of the road for selling ickets at-an excess rale, the biingig of penalty suits of $500 each by tulividuals against the corporation or violation of the law, and holding lint the federal court has no aulliorty to issue an injunction against ringing suits, criminal or civil, gainst the railroad, as it would in bus enjoying a criminal action be ringing a suit aginsl the stale, k'hicli is forbidden by the United Hates law, as the act of the legislature is self-operating as to passenger fares and reepiired no action on he part of the state. The opinion is of the four justices i| the court and is dissented from by 'hief .Justice Clarke, who holds that 1 an agent be fined or imprisoned hat the railroad can also be fined is punishment for its acts in eausng an agent to sell tickets at illegal ales. In his dissenting opinion he inimates that the legislature should be ailed together in special session si is to make the act so explicit that he railroads can be punished by ines. Extra Sossion Not Needed. Associate 'Justice Brown, in a conurring opinion with the court, say* hat there is no need of an extra session of the legislature, that if tlu id as it stands is enforced the rail nads could not stand a week's violaion of it. Die opinion sets out the following 'our points: First. That there was no error in Uidge Long compelling a trial of the a so. Second. That the federal court njunction was no defense to a crimnal action, no power lying in the fedral court to enjoin u criminal proscution. Third. That the rate law was selfxecuting in etVect and that no suit gainst the sate will hold in defiancc f the 11 Mi amendment to the constiulion. Fourth. That where a civil pen,l!y i> prescribed aginst a corporaion. followed by the creation of a riminnl offense -dgainst the agents if the corporation, the civil penalty irst prescribed relieves the corporaion of punishment by indictment unler the criminal olTense created gainst the age.it. Received Fair Trial. The court holds thai the defendnt received- an absolutely fair trial leforc Judge Long, but that there i'as no criminal offense charged in he bill of indictilienf against the lout hern Railway company, the ofense of selling tickets above the '2 --l-ccnt rate being charged against 'ickel Agent T. 10. CJreen, who was ninished by line. I'lie act of the legislali\"h prohibits charge abovq 2 1-1 cents per mile ml then provides, i.i section I. that nv railroad company violating the irovisions of the act shall be liable i) a penally of $.">()() and the agent lie uilty of a misdemeanor. The docrine is that where an offense is rented by stiitutc and the same staute prescribes the penalty, or the lode of procedure, only that indited by statute shall be followed. But 'here the offense is at common law, tatutorv provisions not directly repugnant to the common law are umulative and either law may be allowed. Where an offense is proibited but the law is silent as to ny penally, an indictment will lie, nt where an offense i-; prohibited nd a penally is imposed, no i;iictment will lie and hence (he .jud"ient' of tho lower court is reversed. ELASTIC CURRENCY NEEDED DECLARES THE PRESIDENT. Thinks Provision Should Bo Made for an Emergency Issue Upon Conditions Carefully Pre- 1 scribed by the Government. I Touching upon (ho <|uestion of cur- * rcucy reform President Roosevelt in J his message to congress says: ' "In m.v message (o (he congress a > year ago 1 spoke as follows of the ^ currency: " 'I especially call your attention 1 to the condition of our currency laws. The national bank act has ably serv- ; ed a great purpose in aiding the enormous business development of the.1 country, and within ton years there has been an increase in circulation per capita from $21.41 to $.1,1.08. For several years evidence has been accumulating that additional legislation i-< needed. The recurrence of each crop season emphasizes the delects of the present laws. There must soon be a revision of them, because lo leave them as they are means to'incur liability of business disaster. Since your body adjourned there has been a fluctuation in the interest o:i call money from 2 per cent, to .'10 per cent., and the . fluctuation was even greater during the preceding six months. The secretary ol the treasury had to step in and'by wise action put a slop to the I most violent period of oscillation. Kven worse than such fluctuation is I the advance in commercial rates and . the uncertainty felt in the sullieioncy , of credit even at high rates. All , commercial interests suffer during each crop period. Kxcessivo rates for call money in New York attract money from the interior banks into the speculative Held. This depletes the fund that would otherwise bo available for commercial uses, and commercial borrowers are forced to i pay abnormal rates, so that, each fall a tax, in the shape of increased interest charges, is placed on the whole commerce of the country. " 'The mere statement of these facts shows tl- our present system is seriously defective. There is need 1 of a change. Unfortunately, however, many of the proposed changes must be ruled from consideration because they are complicated, are not easy of comprehension, and tend to disturb existing rights and interests. We must also rule out any plan which would materially impair the value of the United Stales 2 per cent, bonds now pledged to secure > circulation, the issue of which was made under conditions peculiarly creditable to the treasury. 1 do not press any especial plan. Various plans have recently been propped by expert committees of bankers. Among the plans which are possibly feasible , and which certainly should receive your consideration is that repeatedly brought to y<^v attention by the I present secretary of the treasury, the essential feature:; of which have been approved by many prominent bankers and business men. According to this plan national banks , should be permitted to issue a specified proportion of their capital in , notes of a given kind, the issue to be taxed at so high a rate as to drive , the notes back when not wanted in legitimate trade. This plan would not permit the issue of currency to give banks additional profits, but to meet the emergency presented by , times of s|rinireney. " 'I do not say that this is the ! right system. 1 only advance it to i emphasize my belief that there is i I need for tin* adoption of some system which siiiill be automatic ;iml open to ; all si >u in I banks, so as to avoid all po sihilily of discrimination and favoritism. Such a plan would tend to prevent the spasms of high money and speculation which now obtain in the New York market; for at present there is too much .currency at | certain seasons of the year, and its I accumulation at New York tempts bankers to lend it at low rales for j speculative purposes; whereas at other times when the crops are being] moved there is urgent need for ai larue temporary increase in the cur- ' rency supply. It must never be i toigotten that this question concerns business men generally cfuitu us much as bankers, tannery, and business men in I he west; tor at present at certain seasons <jf the year the ili(Terence in interest rates* between the east and the west is from (i to .10 per cent., whereas in Canada the corresponding difference is but 2 per ivnt. Any plan must, of course, ^uai'd (lie interests of Western and Southern bankers as carefully as it nards (he interests of New York or t hicago bankers, and must be drawn from the standpoints of the farmer and the merchant, no less than from the standpoint of the city banker t?nd the country banker.' "I again urge on congress (he need ?f immediate attention to this matter. Wo need a greater elasticity in our currency; provided, of course, I fiat we recognize the even greater need of a safe and secure currency. I here must always be the most rigid examination by the national au.'horih,s ''revision should be made for an emergency currency. The emergency issue should, of course, be made wii,i an effective guaranty, and upon conditions carefully prescribed by I he government. Such emergency issue must he based on adequate securities approved hv the government, and must be issued ?n,l,,r il h(,;,v.v This would permit currency being issued when the demand for il was urgent, while se<;nring its retirement as the demand ' ' 's worth invest igatin"- to determine whether officers and directors of national banks should ever be allowed to loan to themselves. Trust companies should he subject to the same supervision as banks; legislation to this effect should be enacted lor the District ,,f Columbia and the territories. ^ (,i We must also remember that even the wisest legislation on the subject can only accomplish a certain amount. No legislation can by any possibility guarantee the business community against the results of speculative folly any more than i' can guarantee an individual against the results of bis extravagance. AN hen an individual mortgages his house to buy an automobile he invites disaster; and when wealthy men who pose as such, or are unscrupulously or foolishly eager to become rich, indulge in reckless speculation? especially if it is accompanied by dishonestly?they jeopardize not only their own future but the future o| all their innocent fellow citizens, for thev expose the whole business community to panic and distress.''
