IBS 1 :i". W grt. W. C. BROWN, Publisher. IIURLEY. SOUTH DAKOTA. /. If John James Ingalls desires to re port another pretty fight he will report for duty at Columbus, O. .,, ,.,. ft Editor Pulitzer's crusade for tile "suppression of unnecessary noises" is bearing fruit. The New York Tele gram has suspended. The Governor ot The Dade County (Ala.) News earn estly remarks: "Friends, a little help would be appreciated very much— can't you bring us some sweet po tatoes or corn? An editor once choknd himself to death trying to eat grass." At a recent meeting of the Medleo Legal society of New York the conclu sion was reached that the smoking of cigarettes by adults was not a partic ularly deleterious habit, if the fumes were not inhaled into the lungs, peo ple who dislike cigarettes would not object to them seriously if the inhala tion of the smoke was not followed by Its exhalation. They are not worried over the wreck of the smokers' lungs, but db object to the reek in their own .noses. During the recent mayoralty cam paign in Greater New York the sup porters of Seth Low distributed docu ments as follows: Posters, 751 plac ards, 33,165 handbills, 909,000 cards, 677,783 pamphlets, 436,464 books, 21, 600 lithographs, 91,000, mating a to tal of over 2,000,000. And yet the great nrass of the readers of these document's voted tor somebody else than Mr. Low. The Low literature acted like a boom erang, Inflicting i£s greatest.,injur.les upon its projectors. That the opponents of civil service are not without hope of abolishing that system is evident from the establish ment of a fortnightly periodical in Washington for the purpose of fighting "openly and above board the obnox ious, un-American farce commonly known as civil service reform." The (easiest way to dispose of the publica tion—if It were likely to become for ^jnidable—would be to give the editor a civil service position, when he would at once become an enthusiatic admir er of the system. The monthly statement of the public debt shows that at the*close of busi ness on Oct. 30, 1897, the debt, less catsh in the treasury, amounted to $1,, 020,563,901, an increase for the month of $8,441,188. This increase is prin cipally accounted for by a decrease in the amount of cash on hand. The cash "(In the treasury is classified as fol- Jaws: Gold, $190,387,256 silver, $509, i351,943 paper, $113,441,000 bonds, dis burslng officers' balances, etc., -f18,489,750 total, $831,669,957 against Which there are demand liabilities amounting to $623,913,857 leaving the pet cash balance in the treasury $207, 756,099. Just a week ago the United States -court of appeals at St. Louis held that a boycott by labor against capital is a criminal conspiracy. Now an Illi nois state court at Chicago has decld t, cd that a "blacklisting" by capital against labor is equally unlawful and had awarded. a "blacklisted" laborer $21,666.33 damages. If the boycott were sound in law, then the blacklist would also l)e sound. But these courts, dealing out even justice, have declared the truth that' blacklist and boycott are equally odious, equally hostile to democratic institutions and ideas. It is fortunate that these two decisions came so closely together. The object lesson they present will not be lost upon either labor or cstpital. Of late there is a very noticeable de mand on the part of the American people for a higher standard of litera ture. This is not only evident at the book stalls but on the news stands. Sensational books and journalism shave had their day in the large cities. ^Country papers have never been faulty In this respect. The people are set tling down to the belief that after all the kernel of the nut is really all that there is-to it, In a decade sensation alism and every other dishonest prac tice will have disappeared entirely. Ten years ago it looked as if it would go the other way. Only a few papers remained faithful to the true princi ples of journalism. Of the newspapers the New York Tribune, the Sun and the Philadelphia Ledger for a long time stood'a distinguished and uncorrupted trio. Among story papers the New York Ledger atood proudly alone. These papers have borne aloft the ban ner of purity in journalism and tpday they are the models sought by ambi tious newspaper makers. We hope tb&t tie imitators will succeed.

SLOWLY SINKING MOTHER M'KINLEY VERY NEAR TO DEATH'S DOOR. Surrounded by Devoted and Loving Children Her Llfei Ebba SlOTvly Away—The Prealdent Will Return to Washington In Time for the Opening of Congreaa—Xo Hope That Mra. McKlnley Will Iletnra to Conaclouaneaa. Canton. Ohio, Dec. 4.—President Mc Kinley will be in Washington for the opening of congress next Monday whatever may be the issue of his mother's illness. Although there has never been in the history of the gov ernment a case exactly similar, it is necessary for the president to be at the capital in person for the opening of a session of congress to receive the joint committees from ..the two houses, and, that until this committee has waited Mrn. Nancy A. McKinley. on the president and received his com munication the regular business of congress eannot-proceed. Mother McKinley Is unconscious, aud the attending physician can give the family no hope that she will ever return to consciousness. The presi dent can do absolutely nothing for her by remaining near her. In view of these facts the president feels that it is his duty to return to Washington so as not to delay the proper opening of congress at the regular time. The day was one of great suspense in the McKinley family. The nearness of the messenger of death was realized every moment of the day, and that there could be no other than a fatal ending to the illness with which Moth er McKinley was stricken. The family surrounded the bedside all day, .watching Intently for any rally from the comatose condition in which the patient has bepn almost from the be ginning of the Illness, and at short intervals the doctor called. But the word from the sick room was almost without variation, family and doctor announcing from time to time in creased weakness and sinking away. Only twice was this report varied by the announcement of evidence of par tial consciousness. The first, was when President McKinley entered the sick room. His sister Helen announced his arrival, spying: "Mother, here is William. If you recognize him. hold out your hand." The enfeebled pa tient. seemed to understand and to make an effort to extend her hand, which was immediately grasped by the devoted son. He thought he felt a responsive tightening of her hand about, his own as he did so. but the recognition was so slight as to be al most imperceptible. It was some time later that a second slight rally seemed to occur. A bunch of beautiful flow ers was sent from the conservatory of the White House, aiid when they were taken into the room she noted their arrival and seemed to make an effort to reach for one. The president quickly snatched a beautiful white lily and handed it to her. She took it in her hand and carried it to her bosom, it being apparent that she was conscious of the act and appreciated the flower. Soon after this she quieted down into a rest that seemed to be almost a natural sleep. There has been many callers at the home, aged lady friends of Mother Mc Kinley being numerous among those who called to offer sympathy. The in quiries by telegraph are numerous and messengers are going to. and from the house all the while. Calla Sjx^cinl Sexnlnn. Springfield. 111. Dec. 4.—Gov.
