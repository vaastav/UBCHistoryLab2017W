THE CELINA DEMOCRAT, CELINA, OHIO TO THE CONGRESS Senate and House in Joint Ses sion Hear Address of the President. HE MAKES FEW SUGGESTIONS Further Legislation for Settlement and Regulation of Railway Labor Dis putes Held Imperatively Necea aary by the chief Magistrate. Washington, Dec. 5. Tilt' senate and house in ft In Joint session today and heard President Wilson's message, which was us follow s : Gentlemen of tin' Congress: In fullllling ut this time il l'"y '"Id upon im by llu Constitution of com inunleuting to you from time to time Infornmtion of tht' slate of tin" I'lilon ami recommending to your eoiishleru tlon such legislative measures us may be Judged necessary unci expedient 1 Mm II continue the pruct !. which I hope has lii-en acceptable to yon, of leaving to the reports of the several lieuils of tin- executive departments the elaboration of the detailed needs of the public service mid tontine myself to those mutters of more general pub lic policy with which It si-ems neces sary and feasible, to deal at the pres ent session of the congress. I realize the limitations of time un der which .von will necessarily act at this session and shall make my sug gestions lis lew as possible; but there iwcre some things left undone at the last session which there will now be time to complete and which it seems necessary In the Interest of the public to do at once. In the first place, It seems to me Im peratively necessary that the earliest possible consideration and action should be accorded the renminbi): measures of the program of settle ment ami regulation which I hail occa sion to recommend to you at the close of your last session In view of the pub lic dancers disclosed by the unaccom modated ditliculties which then existed, nnd which still unhappily continue to exist, between the railroads of the country ami their locomotive engineers, conductors, nnd trainmen. Railway Troubles First. I then recommended : First, immediate provision for the enlargement and administrative reor ganization of the interstate commerce commission alum; the lines embodied In the bill recently passed by the house of representatives ami now awaiting fiction by the senate; In order that tlw commission may be enabled to deal .with the many great and various duties 'now devolving upon It with a prompt ness and thoroughness which are. with Its present constitution and means of notion, practically Impossible. Second, the establishment of an eight-hour day as the legal basis alike of work and of wages In the employ ment of all railway employees who are actually engaged In the work of oper ating, trains in interstate transporta jtlon. Third, the authorization of tin- ap pointment by the president of a small body of men to observe the actual re sults in experience of the adoption of the eight-hour day in railway trans portation alike for the men and for the railroads. Fourth, explicit approval by the con gress of the consideration by the in terstate commerce commission of an Increase of freight rates to meet such additional expenditures by the rail roads as may have been rendered nec essary by tin- adoption of the eight hour day nnd which have not been off pet by administrative readjustments and economies, should the facts dis closed justify tin- increase. Fifth, an amendment of the existing federal statute which provides for the mediation, conciliation, and arbitration of such controversies as the present by adding to It a provision that, in case the methods of nceomniodation now provided for should fall, a full public investigation of the merits of every Mich dispute shall be instituted and completed before a strike or lockout may lawfully be attempted. And. sixth, the lodgment in tin hands of the executive of the power. 1n case of military necessity, to take control of such portions and such roll ing stock of the railroads of the coun try as may be required for military use and to operate them for military purposes, with authority to draft Into the military service of the United States such train crews nnd adminis trative ollieials as the circumstances require for their safe nnd efficient use. Renews His Recommendations. The second and third of these rec ommendations the congress Immediate ly acted on: it established the eight hour day as the legal basis of work nnd wages in train service and it au thorized the appointment of u com mission to observe nnd report upon the practical results, deeming these the measures most Immediately needed ; Unusual Experience. "Man." remarked Sandy, "I did a tiling last nlcht what I've no dune this twenty year. I went to ma bed palrr fectiy sober, but I'm rlcht thankful to say I pot up this mornln' none the wnur !"

"You enn't make n bluff with nn umbrella." "Why riot?" "Because you i,i -t tit up or shut up." but It postponed action upon the other miggcslloiiM until mi opportunity should he offered for a more deliberate con sideration of them. The fourth rec ommendation I do not deem It rieces miry to renew. The power of (he In terstate commerce commission to grant an lncrense of rates on the ground re ferred to Is Indisputably clear and n recommendation by the congress with regard to mich n matter might seem to draw In question the scope of the com mission's niithorlty or Its Inclination to do Justice when there Is no reason to doubt either. The other suggestions tin Increase In the Interstate commerce commis sion's membership nnd in its facilities for performing Its manifold duties, the provision for full public Investigation and nssessment of Industrial disputes, mid the grant to the executive of the power to control nnd operate the rail ways when necessary In time of war or other like public necessity I now very earnestly renew. The necessity for such legislation Is manifest and pressing. Those who have Intrusted us with the responsibility nnd duty of serving nnd safeguarding them In such matters would llml It hard, I believe, to excuse n failure to act upon these grave matters or any unnecessary postponement of notion upon thetu. Not only does the Interstate com merce commission now llml It practi cally Impossible, with Its present mem bership and organization, to perform Its great functions promptly nnd thor oughly, but It Is not unlikely that It may presently be found advisable to add to Its duties still others equally heavy and exacting. It must first be perfected as an administrative Instru ment. The country cannot and should not consent to remain any longer exposed to profound industrial disturbances for luck of iiiMltlonal means of arbitra tion ami conciliation which the con gress can easily nnd promptly supply. And all will ngree that there must be no doubt as to the power of the execu tive to make immediate and uninter rupted use of the railroads for the con centration of the military forces of the nation wherever they are needed and whenever they are needed. This Is a program of regulation, pre vention and administrative efficiency which argues its own case In ttie mere statement of It. With regard to one of Its items. the lncrense in the etli- cU-ucy of t lie Interstate commerce com mission, the house of representatives lias already acted ; its action needs onlv the concurrence of the senate. For Control and Operation. I would hesitate to recommend, and I dare say the congress would hesitate to act upon tiie .suggestion should I make it, that any man in any occupa tion should be obliged by law to con tinue In an employment which he de sired to leave. To pass n law which forbade or prevented the individual workman to leave bis work before re ceiving the approval of society in do ing so would be to adopt a new prin ciple into our jurisprudence which I lake it for granted we are not prepared to introduce. Hut the proposal that the operation of the railways of the country shall not be stopped or inter rupted by the concerted action of or ganized bodies of men until a public Investigation shall have been Instituted which shall make the whole question at issue plain for the judgment of the opinion of the nation is not to propose any such principle. It is based upon the very dill'ercnt principle that the con certed action of powerful bodies of men shall not be permitted to stop t lie in dustrial processes of the nation, at any rate before the nation shall have had an opportunity to acquaint itself with the merits of the case as between em ployee and employer, time to form its opinion upon an Impartial statement of the merits, and opportunity to con sider all practicable means of concilia tion or arbitration. I can see nothing in that proposition but tlie justifiable safeguarding by so ciety of the necessary processes of its very life. There is nothing arbi trary or unjust in it unless it be arbi trarily and unjustly done. It can and should be done with a full and scrupu lous regard for the interests and liber ties of till concerned as well as for the permanent interests of society itself. Other Legislation Urged. Three mutters of capital importance await the action of the senate which; have already been acted upon by the house of representatives: the hill which seeks to extend greater freedom of combination to those engaged in pro moting the foreign commerce of the country than Is now thought by some to be legal under the terms of the laws against monopoly; the bilf amending the present orguuic law of Porto liico ; and the bill proposing a more thor ough und systematic regulation of the expenditure of money in elections, com monly called the Corrupt I'ructices Act. I need not labor my advice that these measures be enacted into law. Their urgency lies in the manifest circum stances which render their adoption at tills time not only opportune but neces sary. Even delay would seriously jeopard the Interests of the country and of the government. Immediate passage of the bill to reg- Most Fishermen Have Done It. "Simple Simon went it-fishing In his mother's pail." "Not so simple, at that," declared the amateur sportsman. "I've spent time and money getting to a place where the likelihood of catching fish was no whit greater." Nothing New. "I see some scientific-sharp has dis covered a substitute for bread."

I shall not argue lit length the desir ability of giving n freer hand In the matter of combined and concerted ef fort to those who shall undertake tho essential enterprise of building up our export trade. That enterpiisu will presently, will Immediately assume, has Indeed already assumed, n magni tude unprecedented In our experience. We have not the necessary Instrumen talities for Its prosecution; It Is deemed to be doubtful whether they could be created upon an adequate scale under our present laws. We should clour away all legal obstacles ami create a basis of undoubted law for It which will give freedom without permitting unregulated license. The thing must be done now, because the opportunity Is here nnd may escape us If we hesitate or delay. Porto Rico's Needs. The Argument for the proposed amendments of the organic law of Tor to Itlco Is brief and conclusive. The present laws governing the Island and regulating the rights and privileges of its people are not Just. We have cre ated expectations of extended privi lege which we have not satisfied. There Is uneasiness among the people of the Island and even a suspicious doubt with regard to our Intentions concerning them which the adoption of the pending measure would happily re move, we do not (toutit w nat we wish to do In any essential particular. We ought to do It at once. There are other matters already ad vanced to the stage of conference be tween 1he two houses of which It Is not necessary that I should speak. Some practicable basis of agreement concerning them will no doubt be found and action taken upon them. Inasmuch as this is, gentlemen, prob ably the last occasion I shall have to address the Sixty-fourth congress, I hope that you will permit me to say with what genuine pleasure and satis faction I have co-operated with you In the many measures of constructive pol icy with which you have enriched the legislative annals of the country. It has been a privilege to labor In such company. I take the liberty of con gratulating you upon the completion of a record of rare servieenbleiiess and distinction. Cut Trees by Exploding Dynamite. Instead of an ax and saw to remove the tops of trees that are to be used as masts In logging operations, dyna mite is used to shoot off the tops. After the branches have been removed, a rigger climbs the tree, with a set of irons, to the point where It Is neces sary to cut off the top. Here the trunk is usually about 12 inches In diame ter. The rigger ties a string of dyna mite cartridges, fastened end to end like sausages, around the trunk at this point, inserts a blasting cup with about 1!0 feet of fuse In one of these sticks, lights the end of the fuse, and de scends before the explosion takes place. The tree top pumps Into the air with the explosion and the trunk is left ready for attaching the rigging for dragging in and loading the logs. Engineering Itecord. All He Saw of Battle.

He conducted himself with becoming dig nity, and when the foreign-looking gen tleman who had kept silent went out ut a roadside station the audience set tled down to hear the yam.
