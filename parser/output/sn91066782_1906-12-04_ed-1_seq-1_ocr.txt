''DECEMBER 4, 100G, PRICE, ONE CENT IMUCDlTAMr AND INCOM TAX ADVI By President Roosevelt in Atessage to Congress Wants Better Government Control of Corporations But Would Allow Combination For Self-Protection WANTS CRIME OF RAPE . PUNISHED WITH DEATH Urges the Need of a Law Limiting the Hours of Employment of Railroad Employees Would Aid Shipping Industry-Need of Currency Legislation : Washington, Pec. 4. .President Roose velt's message was Tcad in the House and Senate this afternoon. President Roosevelt In his annual message again urges the enactment of o law prohibiting corporations from eoutributlng to campaign funds. He also urges the passage of the measure conferring upon the government the right of appeal lu criminal cases on questions of law. Continuing, the president says: I cannot too strongly urge the pas sage of the bill in question. A failure V to pass It will result in seriously ham pering the government in its etfort to obtain justice, especially against wealthy Individuals or corporations vbo do wrong, and may also prevent 4iu rm-rtTn rn nri f from Alltfllnlrnr 4iiaf1ft for wageworkers who ore not them selves able effectively to contest a case where the judgment of an inferior court hns been against them. I have specifically In view a recent decision by a district judge leaving railway employees without remedy for viola tion of a certain so called labor statute. The Importance of enacting Into law the-particular bill In question is fur ther increased by the fact that the gov ernment has now definitely begun a policy of resorting to the criminal law in those trust ftnd Interstate commerco cases where such a course offers a rea sonable chance of success. Proper lee of Injunction. In my last message I suggested the eoiactment of a law in connection with the Issuance of Injunctions, attention having been sharply drawn to the mat ter by the demand that the right of ap plying Injunctions in labor cases should be wholly abolished. It is at least doubtful whether a law abolish ing altogether the use of injunctions In such cssjs would stand the test of the courts, in which case, of course, the leglrlatlon would be ineffective. More over, I believe it would be wrong alto gether to prohibit the use of injunc tion?. It is criminal to pormlt sym pathy for criminals to weaken our hands In upholding the law, and If men seek to destroy. life or property by mob violence there should be no Im pairment of the power of the court" to deal with them in the most summary and effective wny possible. But so far ns possible the abuse of the power should , be provided against by some such law ss I advocated Inst year. Against Ly-arklng, I call your attention nnd the atten tion of tiia nation to the prevalence of crime auiou.; us and, abore all, to the epidemic of lynching and mo?) violence that spring up now in one part of our Anutry, now lu another. Each sec tion, north, south, cast or west, bns Its own faults. No section can with wisdom spend Its tlmo Jeering at the faults of another section. It should bo busy trying to amend Its own short comings. To deal with the crime of corruption It Is necessary to have an awakened public conscience and to upplement this by whatever legisla tion will add speed and certainty In the execution of the law. When wo deal with lynching even more is neces sary. A great many white men are lynched, but the crime Is peculiarly frequent In respect to black rr.en. The greatest existing cnuo of lynching is the perpetration, especially by black men, of the hideous crime of rape, the most abominable In all the category of crimes, even worse than murder. Lawlessness grows by what it feeds upou, and when mobs bcln to lynch for rape they speedily extend the f.phero of their operations and lynch for many other kinds of crimes, so that two-thirds of the lynching are not for rape at nil, while a considerable proportion of the Individuals lynched ore innocent of nil crime. .There Is but one safe rule In dealing with black men as with white men. It Is the same rule that must be up filed "in. dealing, with, rich men , and Continued on Third Tup. 5ED

The Cabinet which was formed last week has resigned. The change in the ministry displeased the public and caused angry ferment. Prime Minister Moret and his colleagues were hostilely received in both cham bers, Saturday, and they were also hoot ed in the streets. Ex-Prime Minister Rominguez was fondly cheered. It is slated that the latter's speech in the Senate explaining the Tanses of his re signation, which reflected adversely on Senior Moret, greatly impressed King Alfonso.' The popular dissatisfaction sought an outlet in a demonstration in front of the royal palace yesterday. The project, which was initiated by stu dents of the University, was prevented by the precautions taken by the gover nor of the city, who posted numefous police to guard against disorder. In political circles it was declared that un less Scnor Moret dissolved the Cortes he could not govern. There are rumors of the probability of the Conservatives coming into power under Senor Maura. The pending troubles with the church and with Morocco make the position extremely dillicult. PORTLAND DEMOCRATIC. City Went to the Dogs as the Result of Yesterday's Election. Portland, Me., Dec. 4.

UNDER THE GLITTER OF THE GILDED DOME. That the Vermont Improvement so ciety, whose life was practically assured by the House today, lies a field for use fulness is shown by a letter received by its secretary, R. W. Mi'Cucn of Yer cennes. The letter reads: "If you knoir of nnv of the abandoned farms, will you write me about one or more? I would like to buy one. I have a fam ily of growing children and I want a f:irm near to a villace where my children can attend school and I can get a living from the furm."
