Corrade Oinl, professor of Mutlstlcs in the University of Padua, te whom was Intrusted tin inquiry as te whether Hermnnv enn nav retinrntiens. hew much nnd In whnt form, has decided the lirst question in the nflirmntive. of. (Hnl makes several proposals concern ing the best systems for the liquidation of the debt. One of his principal suggestions is compulsory service for reparations, similar te the military service in nor mally before the war. That compul sory service would embrace all youths of twenty years of nge for one or two years. Surh youths would serve either In reconstructing devastated regions or In creditor nations, where they might be fed ut the expense of the Herman Government. In the latter ease the total value of their work would go toward reparations. If fed nt the expente of a creditor nation only the difference be tween the value of their feed and t lie value of their work would be credited te repnrntlens. Prof. Glnl nlse proposes taMiic a census of all precious metals, jewels nnd foreign currency in Germany, nnd making compulsory their sale te the state or te foreigners. Nobody would be allowed te keep any of these things, except by paying a sum In geld far greater than their intrinsic value. SENATE COMMITTEE BEGINS HEARINGS ON FARM CREDITS Bills Sponsored by Lenroot and Cap per Explained by Authers Washington, Dec. H.'. (Ity A. P.l -Proponents of various farm credit bills appeared today lielere the Senate iiatiu llig Committee at the opening of hear ings en credit legislation. Senater Capper, chairman of the Senate farm bloc, opened the hearings with an explanation of his bill and xvus followed by Senater Lenroot. who outlined the Lenroot-Andersen bill con taining previsions indorsed by Admin istration officials. Among these present nt the hearing were Eugene Meyer, director of the War Flounce Corporation, and mem bers of the Federal I'm in 1auii Beard. Senater Cupper snid his livestock lean bill would meet the needs of betn large and small livestetk growers, butl did net deil with the credit require ments of the general lauacr. The bill provides for co-operative associations with $".r0,000 capital, whose paper would have discount privileges with federal reserve banks. The small live stock growers, lie said, teiild secure leans through such associations, and he did net believe the bulk of capital for the associations would come from tlie industry, but from banking and business intete.sts of the community.
