PAGE FIVE. REVOLUTION HOW IS BEING FACED BY STANDPATTERS Big Cigar Specials For Saturday and Sunday: . ?. JENKINS&CO Rebellion Impends in Congress In Connection With the Pos tal Savings Bill, Soon to Be Presented. RICHMOND'S THE KICU3IOXD PAIJUADIU3I AND SUX-TELEG R A3I, SUNDAY, DECE3IBER 12, 1909. CONSERVATIVES WILL FIGHT FOR A DELAY Men Who Rank in That Class Will Join With the Tariff Re visionists in a Demand for Some Action. Washington, D. C, Dec. 11. The fctandpat leaders in congress are fac ing an insurrection in connection vnth tbe proposed postal savings bank leg islation, which promises to be more serious than that which developed against the Aldrich tariff law. In both senate and house ir.en who rank as conservatives have joined wfth the tariff insurgents in demand ing action. The movement is so strong that the standpat leaders now tre fighting only for delay iintil after the report of the national monetary reform commission shall be made. This report will recommend a cen tral bank and, it is believed, the gen eral scheme of which that Institution will be the basis will be so compre hensive as to demonstrate that postal savings banks are unnecessary. Influences for Proposition. It is not probable, however, these men will have their way. In his an nual message President Taft asserted lie saw no reason why the establish ment of postal savings banks should be "tied up" with the general plan of currency reform. Undoubtedly this Is the view of a large proportion of the members of the senate and house. The Influences working in favor of the pro position are: Party politics which justify the de mand that the pledge in the republi can platform of last fall be carried out. The desire of the president, as ex pressed in his annual message. The Importance to the republican party of uniting the two factions upon at least one issue of popular interest. The single force which is working against the proposed . legislation is made up almost entirely of the bank ing interests. It has its agents in Washington who are conducting a de termined campaign in favor of delay. These agents have their spokesmen in both senate and house and they are devising various ways along which to shunt the proposition, and the end of which is the abyss of inaction. Subcommittee is Significant. As an Indication of the methods pur sued, attention 1b called to the per sonnel of the subcommittee on post of fices and post roads, which was ap pointed today, to consider all bills with reference to the postal savings banks. This subcommittee is made up of four republicans. Representatives Gar dner of New Jersey, Huff of Pennsyl vania, Fassett and Durey of New York and two democrats, Representatives Moon of Tennessee and Small of North Carolina. It will be noted there is not a mid dle western or western man on this committee. It is made up of repre sentatives of the east and south, where there is comparatively languid interest in postal savings banks. Gardner believes there should be no postal legislation of this character un til after the national monetary com mission has made its report. Huff is a banker. Fassett is vice president of the Second National bank of Elmi ra. New York. Durey is president of a lumber company and has many capi talistic connections. The two demo crats do not count. Plan to Hold Hearings. It is proposed, after the post office appropriation bill is out of the way, that this subcommittee shall grant hearings. It is true the subject has been discussed exhaustively, but it is insisted there are so many features connected with the distribution of the money which would be deposited that it is necessary to proceed in the pre paration of such a measure with the greatest caution and consideration, after the subcommittee completes its inquiry it will make a report to the full committee, and that committee will determine whether or not to sub mit a favorable report to the house. This is the ordinary routine and it furnishes ample opportunity for delay. There are many members who have been friendly to the speaker who as sert they will not stand for any such tactics. One of these Is Representa tive Martin B. Madden of Chicago, who for years has favored postal savings banks. Madden last summer mailed 30,000 letters to his constituents asking them to express their views upon the postal savings bank bill which he had intro duced. He received 11,500 replies, and only one of these opposed the scheme. Fortified by this backing Mr. Madden went to Representative Weeks, chair man of the committee on post offices and post roads, and in blunt language declared he did. not propose to coun tenance Inaction. Madden Stirs Up Weeks. Madden told Weeks that whether or not he favored the legislation he was responsible to the house as chairman of one of its committees and he must act In accordance with the will of the majority. . The Chicagoan pointed out also that every member of congress must act, EL
