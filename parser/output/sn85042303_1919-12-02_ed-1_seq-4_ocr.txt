As to the conimantK'erin"; of coal, somehow it strikes us that Ardmore possibly mijfht let the coal cars po right along southward, to i supply those asless and woodless areas of the pampas plains of Titanic .Texas, for instance, where no other In el is available. Up here we are surrounded by a considerable supply of the raw material for fuel trees. Why not take the axe to the tree and chop the tree up into stovewood lengths and feed the lengths to the wood-stove? If you are not reasonably sure that the gas supply is going to hold out, the purchase of a wood-burning, stove might be a wi.e action. ' o Unfortunately, President Wilson for this once has found it necessary to break a prece dent set up by himself. For the first time since j he assumed the presidency he is unable to! deliver in person his message to congress.

This time his illness made that impossible. l!ut no doubt the members of each body under the gilded dome will masti cate this message as thoroughly as thev have masticated former Wilsonian utterances, for surely it has the substantial meat this time.
