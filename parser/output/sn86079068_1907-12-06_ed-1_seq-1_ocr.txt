E 'The motor car will seat 40 people A and on occasion can carry 100 by p crowding so that the one car will no doubt be fully sufficient to meet all requirements for some time to come, especially as the al distance is short and frequent na trips can easily be made if the 9i traMc should demand it.

Youngsvslle Items "The Youngsville Louisiana Cane Syrup Co." began its op eration last week and is now put rhe ting out a very nice grade of syrup. Although the mill is new it has made a good start, and if a good start counts for anything, of and some say it does, this plant 6ny which is guaranteed to roll off ce, between a hundred and a hun go dred and twenty-five tons of ler cane per day, is going to be a er, good addition to the industries (ht of our little town. _x- Last Friday night at half past ºse seven o'clock, one of the largest 1 on gatherings of patrons of the par mt ish schools took place at the!: gn- school house. The meeting was ?r, called to order by Prof. J. L. 4 ry Cook and after stating the o(b. ue ject of the meeting very briefly-, he and stating along what lines helE wished them to help him and his n- teachers to build up the school, J m the patrons took it out of his to hands by going to work at once y.a wrgntsing. Mf. P. A. Do al, plelx was selected pres., Mr. E. I as G.Landry, vice pres: Mr. P. R'r of Duplex. sec. and Mr. 0. Dyer, I ed treasurer. Ie After Mr. Duplex had made a, few remarks as to the good to be; gotten from such an organise- a ation the following committees b were appointed; Fence Commi h n stee Messrs P. R. Duplex, Eu- , )r gsne Landry and Alice Fabre, 1 r Leveling Committee Messrs 0. * Blanchette, E. David, and A. sI le Reanx. Drainage Committee,Mr. £ Y P. A. Dupleix and 0. Langlinais. a 11 After the committees were d , appointed and lastrncted as to tr 0 what was needed to be done ai e about the school the time for the v st next meeting was fixed for the IN o first Friday of every month. So The Youngaville School Improve- o1 ment Association then adjourned its first meeting with a member- bi ship of thirty-three of our good in e parents and friends, ha º Every one who is interested in or school work is invited to attend these regular meetings and offer tic S suggestions as to the work that pr . we can do to improve our school. e From the earnestness and seal as with which the committees have as gone to work we predict great pr things for Yomngsville education. in r This we believe is an experiment e in the small towns of the parish pu - but from all accounts it has al- In t ready proven a thing of real ph I worth and good. ah A VrstroR. I pa PRINCIPAL POINTS OF PRESIDENTS' MESSAGE. The following are the principal points of President Roosevelt's message as compiled by the N. O. Item: When dishonest men exploit the re sources of the country by criminal methods it is inevitable that tie in nocent must suffer some share of the penalty that the guilty finally pay in such panics as that just passed. There should be an extension of Federal activity to check the methods of the dishonest men who cause these disturbances. No more Federal au thority is needed. enough exists in the Constitution and the laws. The anti-trust law should he moditied to compel the full publication of cor porate accounts: to prohibit selling under cost as a means of cripplirg comi etitlon; to prevent the inflation of values in the watering of stock. and t o0 stop the hump-ring of competition by contracts providing for exclusive trade. There is no adequate protection against wild-cat recklessness in specu lation and manipulation. But greater elasticity of currency should be pro vided. A graded income tax should be sought by Congress notwithstanding that other efforts in the same direction have failed in the Supreme Court. An inheritance tax is a better means of reducing unhealthy swollen for tunes. This should take \into consid eration the size of the bequest, the distance of the relationship or other connection under which it is made, whether on not beneficiary is a citizen C or a foreigner. ( Sentimentality and technicality are the two bars to the proper enforcement of sanitary laws for the correction of economic and industrial evils. The abuse of judicial power of in- t junction should be res iewed by the t national law-making body Railroads, killing thousands of vicsims every year. should be subject a to the same supervision as steam- T boats. This should come into effect t .gradually. The liability for industrial accidents should fall upon employers, by whots it will ultimasly be distributed to the 'whole community. where it belongs. As the community receives the benefits G of industry, it should also share its burdens. A general working day of eight hotrs is not advisiable. Strong laws should be enacted prohibiting child labor. ). A board of compulsory arbitration should be appointed to deal with strike sittations such as occurred durin if the recent telegraph affair. Crime is crime. The frenzied finan e alms who have exploited our indus O trial securities to their advantage, e and to the ruination of thousands, are e worse crimials than forgers and em e bezzlers. The government should take measures to deal with such finan cial situations as that just passsd I The deep waterway movement must be fathered, purticularly that for the I improvement of the Mississippi river had the building of levees on its low s er courses. I Postmaster General Myer's sugges-. tion for a National Postal Bank is C presented with approval. In order to avoid the solicitation of Li money for campaign purposes from dorporations, Congress should appro priate a certain specific sum to be used , in this way. The number of deaths in industrial pursuits is greater than those incurred, In war. Accident liailit' should be placed upop employers and thiough them upon the hole public. He wants, fger army, with more pay for both officers and men, four more warship this year, and more next with more money for the navy. ! Our foreign policy 'he President designates as "neighborly," neither giving nor taking offense. We should admit all Chinese stud ents, he believes. Mouton Sisters' have a very select stock of dress and walk sing hats for winter wear. Also bats trimmed to order. When you want any kind of feed stuff, just ring up P. Guidry 1 flemllg and Almond Lotion p ewrvs the skite and spe it *nlng. 25e a bottle at 11srma.

A Stitch in Time. The alley near Bill Lewis' could be fixed now at a very small cost and made passable and servica ble all the time. This alley is a much used throughfare as it saves considerable distance to those from the northern portion of the town and people from the cffuntry who pass that way in coming down town, As a matter of fact the Council should at some early time make arrange ments to do away with the alley and extend Monroe street c through to join the street along I the side of the Felix Voorhies * property, because this would be , a great convenience to that large j portion of the public who And it the shortest way to the business part of town.

Camqbell, national organizer and lecturer for the -1W. C. T. U.. will lecture at the - Methodist church in this city Wednesday, Dec. 11, at 7:30 p, m. She com-s very bighlyrecom. I ended as a fluent and earnest speaker, some claim she is a sft. ond Francis Williard. As the prohibition questipn is fast he. coming a live issue in this State, Mrs. Campbell's lecture should draw a large audience. The public is cordially invited to at. tend.

The Push and Pull Dramatic Company filled their engagement at Tanner and Landry's rink last night to a packed house and much to the satisfaction of their audience. The. little play was rendered very creditably and the ,.various musical numbers on the program proved quite entertain. ing.
