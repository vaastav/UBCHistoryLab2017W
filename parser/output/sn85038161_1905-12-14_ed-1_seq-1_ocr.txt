WASHINGTON, D. C., Dec. "8, 1005. Now that the President's message has pone through Congress, the way is declared for the ffrcat legislative fight that Is sure to ensue. There have been something over 5,000 bills already Introduced, but there arc few of them that either stand any show of passing or that arc of general In terest to the conntry. The Panama Canal Bill has already been taken up in the House by unanimous consent and will be In shape to go to the Sen ate In a week or more. After that the rate bill will be the most prcsolng bus iness of the House. The President was wise enough not to raise an Issue over this In his message. There have already been no less than six rate bills Introduced and there will be more. The President has declared for none of them. He has pointed out what "rate control" ought to ac complish and this influence will be thrown to the measures that comes nearest to his standard. In all pro bability this would have been the bill already sent by request to the Senate by the Interstate Commerce Commis sion. But the Senate Commission has amended this bill In several Impor tant particulars and It Is a question whether the commission would have recognized Its own creation had not the Senate been kind enough to have it printed with its amendments put In black type. As It Is the President may favor the Townscnd Bill which Is the Bucccseor of the Esch Townsend bill or some of the other numerous measures. He has not yet said which It will be. One of the very Important minor bills which as yet has had very little attention paid to It Is the Hepburn Pure Pood BUI. Five or six of the In dividual status have passed pure food laws and they have proved valuable so far as those particular states were concerned, but they have failed to reach many of the big corporations and manufacturers engaged in Inter state commerce. For several years Congress has been asked for a federal measure of this sort and It looks now as though It would be passed. The enforcement of the bill will lay be tween the Department of Justice and the Agricultural Department, but the Department of Commerce and Labor and the Treasury Department will also be represented In the federal board thus created and will deal par ticularly with pure food In Interstate transactions and with the Importa tion of foodstuffs from abroad. The measure is one that the Department of Agriculture has been anxious to see In force for a long time and one that will make for the health of every community and will assure the aver age citizen of getting what he pays lor when he puts down ills money In the market or the grocery store. The bill for the creation of a parcel ipost will also come up strongly at the present session. It is pointed out that this country alone of all the great powers, has no parcel post sys tern and that this leaves the private citizen practically at the mercy of the express companies, postage rates being prohibitive on parcels over a very small weight. The big depart ment stores are of course In favor of the measure because it will immense ly aid their mall order business, but the small retailers are solidly against it as they declare It will drive many of them out of business. The express companies naturally will fight it and there is a strong lobby already at the Capitol hoping to either kill the bill In committee or on the floor. One of the bills that Is of great in terest all over the country Is for the establishment of a postal savings bank. Thlsmeasure, of course, meets the antagonism of all the banking In terests of the country from the start. It Is somewhat in line, nevertheless, with a recommendation In Secretary Shaw's annual message for the crea tion of a Departmental Savings Bank, especially for the benefit of govern ment clerks all over the country. This matter of caring for the old clerks or those disable? while in the service, has been growing greatly of late. It has been the subject of a chapter In every report of the Civil Service Commission for ten years past and there Is now a national Civil Service Retirement Association whose object is the creation of a civil pension list. Secretary Shaw's Idea is not to burden the government with a pension list of this sort, but to cre ate a bank with an assistant secre tary from each department on the board of directors and have the sav ings of the clerks entirely voluntary. He thinks some such provision Is nec essary as government clerks, of whom there are 25,000 in Washington alone, are not a very provident lot and the time is approaching when the govern ment must paake tone provlsloa to care for them or have them care for themselves in their old age. The Senate Committee on foreign relations has taken up the states of the Isle of Pines with a view to prop erly Interpreting the treaty with Cuba which some think gave the Island to this country. Nothing definite has been accomplished so far, but the aim is to fully protect American interests in the island without unnecessarily giving offense to Cuba. Elton School House Servloe. Rev. W. B.

"The Swan" by Saint- Saens, was rendered with delicate finish and Bhading,and the "Perpctuo Mobile" was very effective. Mrs Jes sie Baldwln-Broekhoven, the director, may well feel proud of her achieve ment with these young ladles. Chicago Chronicle Mr. Mlddleton Is a talented basso and the possessor of a voice that warrants the predic tion of great success in a musical way. He was repeatedly encored, Address of F. B. Brady. The following address delivered by F. B. Brady at the Barrett reunion August 29, 1005, is published by re quest : "Recognizing the fact that short speeches arc more greatly apprecia ted than long oncB, I promise to de tain you only a few minutes, Besides, It would be very prcsumptlous on my part to even try to tell you something new, for I see uefere me many old persons who could teach me for many months. They are the educated per sons In this gathering. They have been educated In the greatest institu tion ever founded the school of ex perience, and they do not know in part. "Science tells us of three great laws of love. Namely; self love, love for others, and the love of Ood. vVe are taught by some that at one time all space was filled with particles of dust, but by the law of self love they were consolidated Into masses called planets. These planets arc held In position by the love of one for the other, called gravitation, and back of it all wc can see the power of an all- wise and merciful God. We find these laws-yery marked In the human fam ily. A man may by the law of self love become a lawyer, a doctor, a merchant, a farmer or anything he may choose. Hcmay by the second law, love others until the world will call frhn a benefactor or a philan thropist and so on, and back of it all we sec the love he bears to Ood. It Is in accordance with this second law that wc have met here to-day In this Barrett reunion. "For nations and organizations and men to have a day when they can lay aside the selfish and the unworthy things of life and meet In a gather lng like this is surely a beautiful cue torn. ''I am truly glad that this reunion has been founded. Its Influence upon this community wlllbe more than can be estimated In dollars and cents, and yet It has a money value. Man Is by nature a social being. He lives for happiness and happiness Is a depend cnt plant which when plucked up from other plants withers and dies. Every man leads a dual life ; a social life and a business life, each depending upon the other. A business man who Is not a sociable man Is a failure. A social man who is not a business man is likewise a failure. In this age of progress when men arc money-mad In money making the social side of our natures are neglected and In some It has withered and died. To-day we arc meeting together as neighbors, relatives; visiting, rubbing shoulder to shoulder with friends and enemies alike, working in a common cause for a common good, and when wc get home wc will be better men and bet ter women because we have met our neighbors and friends. Wc will have a kindlier feeling for our brothers and this same feeling we will Infuse Into our business and to this end wc may safely say that this reunion has a money value. "A man cannot make a success of anything without the aid of his friends. The hill of success Is long and In places very Btecp, and unless wc have friends to chock our wheels, wc must sooner or later expect our wagon to rush pell-mell to the bottom of the hill. A man must have the sanction and sympathy of other men or he cannot work. The man without friends is to be pitied. The saddest thought that ever entered the mind of man Is, "That no one cares for me." That one thought has driven thous ands to a suicidal death and has stop ped the career of many a brilliant mind. Can you imagine a sadder sight thau a man who thinks and says "No one caros for me." It is in ban ishment of this thought and these words that .causes men to meet to gether in such gatherings as this Bar rett reunion, and we earnestly hope that no one will leave here without a feeling that the world loves me and I will love It. Let us all put our shoul ders to the wheel and make this one of the greatest visiting days this country has ever seen. Let us keep this reunion going so that It will be a day of soul communion looked for ward to from year to year. "Had this reunion been htld a few years ago there would have been many present who are not here to day. They have been called home. To many thisj day is a memorial day. It Is a day of retrospection. Past events a. past associations pour out from our memories only to remind us that the years of life are moving in upon us like the billows of the sea shore, and cast their deposits on the sands at our feet; perchance of pearls, perchance a kelp of wreckage. We walk along this shore like children making bargains with the sea for what It will toss at our feet. The tldt a.us swiftly, and In a little while we, with our tine treasures, are swal lowed up, and the hungry sea moves on. We hope that he who holds the earth in the hollow of his hand, he who holds the planets In their courses and can change them by an Infant touch, will stay this tide of years so that ev -ryone here present may meet with u In many more reunion dayB. "It l - d that an elderly person lives his life over three times ; one in himself, another In his children, and till another in his grand-children. I un look over this crowd and single out many who are living all three of these lives to-day. The happiness of these older persons Is governed by a ratio existing between the success of the younger generations and himself. Let us, the younger ones here assem bled, strive our very best to make our lives successful and happy and In so doing make the lives of these older men and women sweeter as the days go swiftly by. "To these older ones we humble our selves. We should approach them with uncovered heads. I like to talk to them. They are the educated ones. They arc the salt of the earth. They are the chosen few. Wc owe them a debt of gratitude that wc will never be ablo to pay. They have sacrificed, we have not. They have had to wres tle with poverty, wc have not. They bulldcd a foundation better than knew In settling this country and Im proving It, and it is a shame before God that some do not respect them as they should. Harsh as It may sound and disgraceful as It is, yet It Is a la. mcntable fact that the rising genera tion has not manners enough to even respect their own parents. It was not so, my older brother, In your young days. In the name of all that Is good and pure, I plead for the old time hospitality, I plead for the old time soclalablllty. I plead for the old time honesty. It Is an old saying 'That the heart grown strangely sen sitive when age has dimmed the eye.' Let us then be more careful In our respect to these older men and wo men. "In the harbor of New York stands a magnlflclent statute holding with uplifted hand a flaming torch. This statute was presented to the Rcpub lie of the United States by the Re public of France and Is called 'Liber ty Enllghtnlng the World.' Uncount cd thousands as they have left their native shores have beheld this statute with delight. Its flaming torch was to them a symbol of new life. In the old world they left darkness, pcrsecu tlon and Ignorance; In the new they found light, liberty and hope. What pen can describe the thrttl of annl xnatlon that bouyed up those hearts as they beheld this statute of 'Liber ty Enllghtnlng the World.1 'This Is only emblematic of a few men lu history who have Illuminated the way for civilization. These men have held the torch until the end of their lives when It was handed down to others who have planted It still farther on. This statute Is also em blematic of a few of the older settlers of this country who came forth on the frontier to battle with life and 11 lumlne the way for us and the others who are following. "I cannot proceed without giving a glance at the one thing that has made the name of Barrett a house-word. It Is their hospitality. The latch string has always hung out on the front doors and Is hanging out to-day. Hospitali ty has been a great force In the mak ing of this grc.it commonwealth. Looking back over history through the great pint all seems wreck and ruin. Wc see kingdoms rise and fall like bubbles on the ocean. Governments appear and disappear like shaddows on a canvass. We see strife and war light the sky with an awful glare of man's terrible hate and pass away like a receding storm leaving silence and darkness to brood over his wrongs and oppressions, only to break forth and commit greater wrongs In trying to right these. It Is at this moment that we sec hospitality, friendship and love rise like a bright morning wrapped in golden garments of bur nished and celestial light, spreading its wings of inedible and divine glory over the children of men, and then go out like a calcium -light In a cavo, and the Dark Ages came like a long Siberian night and men groped and wandered back towards the light, to ward the Revival of Learning and the Rcnlssance. "In al the past hospitality, frater nity and love were man's guide. For gotten were they at Slnall, remem bered on Calvary. Forgotten on the battle-field, remembered In the home, then home was placed upon home and heated to a white heat and welded Into a tribe, Tribe rubbed against tribe until they were cemented Into a nation and the thread now as shown by the great Peace Conference now in eceslon, Is toward a great family of nations dwelling together under this same hospitality, fraternity and love the same that has always been In the Barrett homes, "If some bright angel were to come from the paradise of Ood and say that whatever thou dost ask for shall be given thee, I would quickly say, 'Bright Spirit from a brighter world, go Thou back to the city of Jasper walls and the city of everlasting day, and say to the holy Father that I only ask for but one thing, and that Is that the children of men shall dwell to gether here In earth with hospitality, fraternity and love. ''America Is great because It has great homes. American homes arc great because they have great fire sides. American firesides are great because they are presided over by great mothers. These mothers are the hope of the country. I wish I had adjec tives strong enough and could weave them Into garlands of rhetoric beau tiful enough, I should like to paint a picture of a happy home, I would have the mother at the table with her work, On one side I would have the little boy with his book. Ontthe other Bide I would have the little girl with her book, and at the side a little farth er back a cradle. I hear tbc boy say as he turns from his book, 'Mother, what Is this word?' The mother re plies, 'That word, my son, Is duty. Observe It my boy and the world will honor you asayoung man and father. Robert E. Lee says It is the subllmcst word in the English language.' The girl turns to hcr mother and says, 'Mother, what Is this word?' The mother replies, 'That word, my daugb. ter, Is chastity. It Is a woman's robe of unfading beauty. Observe It my daughter and the world will always love you.' I then see the mother turn and rock the cradle singing that old familiar song, 'Be It ever so hum ble there's no place like home.' Do you wonder that the old saying Is too true, 'That the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world.' "If I could walk through the floral gardens of the world and pluck the flowers of rarest beauty and sweetest perfume, and could then select from the crowns of kings and queens the rarest jewels that glisten there, I would sit me down and weave all these Into a more glorious crown and with the hand of love turn and place that crown on the brows of our mothers, for they arc the uncrowned queens of earth." "But I must close. I hope that the Barrett Reunion as born today may continue to be held eachycar. To me it is a beautiful sentiment. It Is a holy one. I have seen the gleaming l.ght of a giant locomotive as It rushed on through the darkness heed less of danger and uncertainty, and I have thought the spectacle grand. I have seen the light come over the eastern hills In glory and drive away the lazy darkness like mist before a sea-born gale till leaf and tree and blade of grass sparkled like myriad diamonds In the morning rays, and I have thought the spectacle grand. I have seen the lightning leep across a storm-swept sky.sblvcrlng o'er chaotic clouds mid howling winds, till cloud and darkness and the shadow haunted eirth Hashed Into midday splendor, and I have known it was grand. 1 have seen a mountain, that stupen dous uplift of a rock strata upon rock strata, whose skUs were gashed with chasms, gorges and canyons, through which rush the snow born streams, whose crags and peaks were adorned with everlasting green and dotted here and there with columbines and cnenoncs, twin sisters of grace, and 1 have bowed my uncovered head in the presence of such grandeur. But all these fade Into nothingness like the dew drops before the morning sunbeams when I behold men meeting as we are today. Shoulder to shoulder, soul communing with soul, working under divine guidance for One God, one law, one clement, Ami one far olf Ulvlnu cent To w bleu tlie whole creation moves. "
