■g&utte SBeeftfo 38 i««. TUESDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1879. Chief Just ice Waite is reported to be at the point of death, though there are some slight hopes of his recovery. Many railway employés have been arrested at Moscow on suspicion of complicity in the plot to assassinate the Czar. A dispatch from Alexandria, states that the embarkation of the obelisk presented by Egypt to the United States will take place in a few days. The last attempt to assassinate the Czar has thoroughly frightened that despotic potentate, and it is likely hereafter that he will be very careful in making railroad excursions. Congressman Bingham yesterday introduced iu the House, a joint resolution providing for an equestrian statue to the late General Custer which it is estimated will cost $30,000. It will bo. erected on some suitable reservation ^ irtb the capital. Apostle-Delegate Cannon is full of virtuous indignation at President Hayes for the latter's outspoken views on the polygamy question. Cannon vehemently claims that the Mormons have in no way instigated or encouraged the recent Ute outbreak, but from this very fact their complicity is fully established, for Can non is, perhaps, the most accomplished falsi fier in the universe. Miss Amy Hostetter, daughter of the dealer in the bitters which bear his name, was mar eied in Pittsburg, Pa., recently, to Mr. Her bert Dupuv, of Philadelphia. The presents from the bride's father alone were worth more than $100,000, and he is said to have given her besides, as a marriage portion, $1,000,000 in United States bonds. Thus is the married existence sometimes sweetened with bitterness. There seems to be a general desire on the part of the leaders of both parties in the pres ent Congress to leave the financial question severely alone. They seem to undeistand that the people are satisfied with the money in present circulation, and that however many " improved measures " they could bring up, the result of making their schemes public would be the instant loss of their popularity. It is deemed wise therefore to let well enough alone, as further experiments would be dan gerous to our prosperity. From the fact that we hear no more con eerning the stupendous Democratic fraud in Ma'ne, it is presumable that the great Repub lican outcry was indulged in for moral effect. It is necessary in order to preserve a solid North that great Democratic frauds shall be periodically unearthed, just as it is necessary for the pieservation of a solid South that Re publican corruption shall be discovered. The mere fact that the Southern complaints are based on notorious facts anil that the Northern agi ion is ,a throng >hiisgfeHl tended tob« tost sight of iu the excitement! In his charge to the Grand Jury on the opening of the District Court, last Monday, Judge Galbraith took strong grounds against the organization of vigilance committees. His Honor admitted the usnsual prevalence of crime in this Territory and district, but deprecated in emphatic language a resort to lynch law and wliat he was pleased to designate mob violence, which terms he eveidently considers synonymous. His honor said : '-The experience of ages has demonstrated that the strict administration of the statutory laws, and a due support to the constituted authorities, is the most effica cious, as well jis the only proper, means for the prevention of crime, whether in enforcing or defending the true interests of society." ASELIISH CONGRESSMAN. The bill just introduced in Congress by Belford for the removal of the Utes provides that all laws establishing a reservation for the Utes in Colorado shall be repealed and that lands constituting such reservation shall be come public domain. It further provides that the President, with the consent of the Senate, shall appoint five commissioners to select in some one of the Territories, a reservation for the Utes and arrange with them for a peaceful removal. The bill proposes an appropriation of $200,000 to meet the expenses of removal. Representative Belford may be an able pol itician, and is, perhaps, very desirous of pro moting the interests of his constituents, but the above extract from our dispatches of Wed nesday proves that he is narrow minded, sel fish and dishonorable. The mere fact that a man is elected to Congress from one State does not justify him in endeavoring to secure legislation inimical to the interest of any other section of the country. No statesman will consider that he performs his duty simply by attending to the private wants of his few con stituents. No patriotic Congressman will regard the particular district in which he happens to be elected as the only part of the country possessing a claim on his time and ability. If a representative from California were to bring up a bill providing for the removal of the Chinese to Colorado, the gentleman from the Centennial State would be very apt to characterize the proposed measure as a grossly unfair and villainous imposition, and would in all probability stigmatize lbe proposer as a senseless and corrupt political demagogue, whose sole aim was to make money by engi neering disreputable jobs through Congress. It may be urged that in using the words "one of Lhe Territories," he Intended more partic ular reference fo Indian Territory, to which we contend all the aborigines in the West should be removed, bat if "iat was the idea of the gentleman wby was it not so expressed? The presence of the Utes in Colorado Is a great drawback to civilization. They o.cupy perhaps, the best mineral and agricultural land in that State, and their removal there flom is sincerely to be desired provided they can be placed where they will not retard pro gress to an erual extent in some other State or Territory. This proviso, however, does not enter into the calculations of Mr. Belford. As long as the Utes are removed from Colo rado, he cares not what other section of the country they afflict, and doubtless thinks that Idaho or Montaua, being far from his little world in Colorado, would be a most desirable place for the establishment of the new reser vation. are the THE RENO TRIAL. The tenor of the dispatches from Fort Meade, renders it quite evident that the in vestigation now being conducted by the court martial in relation to the very serious charg es preferred against Major Reno, will result in the acquittal of that officer. The preponder ance of testimony in his behalf seems to be based on the fact that the prisoner is not the only officer of the post who gets drank, boist erous and warlike. Other military gentle men of Fort Meade, it appears, have been on many occasions fully as much intoxicated as was Major Reno. The testimony elicited shows that gambling, drinking and other vices are very common at the officers' quarters, and to punish Reno for indiscrétions of which many of his brother officers are occasionally, if not frequently guilty, would be so mani festly unjust that his dismissal from service, which it was generally thought would be his seuteuce, is not likely to be recommended by the court. However, the investigation has already had <gie good effect. It has opened the eyes of Congress to the fact as brought out in the testimony that the young officers of the army, the men on whose nerve, endurance and brains the country would he dependent in case of war, are weakening their bodies, ruin ing their morals and destroying their intel lects by midnight carouses, excessive drink ing and indulgence in a dozen other forms of enervating dissipation. Accordingly, on the 4th instant, Senator Plumb, of Kansas, in troduced a bill in Congress providing for an additional article of war which shall prohibit all gambling by the officers ami soldiers of the regular army. There is little doubt that the measure will receive favorable action at the hands of the national law makers. HOW TO MINE. Some Important Lawn Affecting: tine Oc currence and tile Richness of Metal llferons Teins. X. Y. Mining Record. 1. Metalliferous reins occur mostly in dis turbedand highly-metamorphic regions, where the strata are tilted, and followed, and meta morphosed. The tilting and folding are nec essary to the formation of fissures ; and the conditions under which metamorphism takes place seem necessary for the subsequent filling with mineral matter. Mineral veins, therefore, occur mostly in mountain regions, and in the vicinity of more or less obvious evidence of igneous ageucy. Dead veins seem_to be an exception to this rule. They ad in undisturbed regions, where _J entirely unchanged. The rich i of Illinois, Iowa and Missouri are nGabl.. examples, the country rock being horizontal, fossilifcrous limestone of the Pal aeozoic era. 2. Metall irerous veins occur mostly in the older rocks. In Great Britain, for example, no profitable veins occur above the Trias. This rule, which was regarded as one of great importance by the older geologists, is not so regarded now. There seems to be no close connection between the occurrence of metalliferous veins and simple age alone ; the connection is rather with metamorphism. Metamorphism is most common in older rocks, and becomes more and more excep tional as we pass upward. The occurrence of metallilerous veins follows the same law. But when the newer rocks are metamorphic, they are as likely to contain veins as are rocks of the older series. The metalliferous veins of California occur in Jurassic, Cretaceous, aud even Tertiary strata ; but these strata are there highly metamorphic, and strongly folded. In Bohemia, also, and elsewhere, metalliferous veins occur iu the higher series. (Phillips 10,549). 3. Parallel veins are apt to have similar metalic contents, while veins running in dif ferent directions (unless at right angles), are apt to contain different metalic contents. * * * The auriferous veins of California are parallel to each other and to the Sierras, ex cept a few smaller ones, which are at right angles to these. The reason of tills rale is, that parallel fissures belong to the same sys tem, and were therefore formed at the same time, broke through the same strata, and were filled under similar conditions, and, tbefore, with the same materials ; while fis sures running in difierent directions, unless in some cases at right angles, were probably formed at different times, broke through dif ferent strata, and were filled under different conditions. Thus, the east and west veins of Cornwall break only through the Trias, while the north and south veins break through the Cretaceous. The auriferous veins of Califor nia ail break through the Jurassic; they, or their fissures, were all produced at the same time, viz: at the time oi the pushing up of the Sierras. 4. A change of country rock of outcropping veins is apt to determine some cliange, either in the contents or in the richness of the vein. Nevertheless, there is not that close connec tion between the nature of the country rock and the vein contents which obtains in infil trative veins. The reason is, that infiltrative veins derive their conteuts entirely from the wall rock on either side, while fissure veins derive their contents from all the strata through which they break, even to great depths, and especially from the deeper strata. The nature of the surface or country rock is, therefore, only one factor determining the vein contents. 5. Metallic veins are usually richer near their points of intersection with granite or with an igneous dyke, especially if the strata ! have suffered metamorphism. This shows the influence of such heat as is present in metamorphism, in determining the metallic contents. 0. If two veins cross each other, especially if at small angles, one or both are apt to be richer at the point of crossing. No sufficient reason has been given for this law. It is probably due to the reaction of water bearing difierent materials circulating in the two fis sures. 7. Since the veins are the filling of fissures, they are often slipped by each other or by dykes by simple unfilled fissures. If a metal liferous vein is thus slipped, according to the law of slips the footwall of the vein has usu ally gone upward, and the hanging wall dropped downward. The great importance of this law iupiactical mining is sufficiently obvious. Extracts from the President's Message. Fellow citizens of the Smote and House of Bepresentativcs : The members of the Forty-sixth Congress have assembled in their first regular session under circumstances calling for mutual con gratulations and grateful acknowledgment to the Giver of all good for the large and un usual measure of national prosperity which we now enjoy. The most interesting events which have occurred in our public affaire since my last annual message to Congress are connected with the financial operations of the government, directly affecting the business interests of the country. I congratulate Congress on the successful execution of the Resumption act. The increasing foreign demand for our manufactures and agricultural products has caused a large balance of trade in our favor, which has been paid in gold from the first of July last to November 15th, to the amount of about $59,000,000. Since the resumption of specie payments there lias beeil a marked and gratifying improvement of the public credit. The bonds ot the government, bearing only four per cent, interest, have been sold at or. above par, sufficient in amount to pay off all of the national debt which was redeemable under the present laws. The amount of interest saved annually by the process of re funding the debt since March 1st, 1877, is $14,297,177. The bonds sold were largely in small sums, and the number of our citizens now holding the public securities is much greater than ever before. The amount of national debt which matures within less than two years, is $792,121,700 of which $500,000, 000 bears interest at. the rate of five per centum. It is believed that this part of the public debt can be refunded by tlie issue of four per cent, bonds and by the reduction of interest which will thus be effected, about $11,000,000 can be atiuually saved to the Treasury. To secure ibis important reduc tion of interest to be paid by the United States, further legislation is required, which it is hoped will be provided by Congress during its present session. 

COINAGE. The coinage of gold by the mints of the United Slates during the last fiscal year was, $40,986,922. The coinage of silver dollars since the passage of the act for that purpose, up to November 1st, 1879, was $45,000,850, of which $12,700,344 have been issued from the Treasury and are now in circulation, and $32,400,500 aie still in the possession oi the government. CURRENCY. The retirement l'rom circulation of United States notes with the capacity of legal tender in private contracts, is a step to be taken in our progress toward a safe and stable currency which should be accepted as the policy and duty of the government, and the interest and security of the people. It is my firm convic tion that the issue of legal tender paper money, based wholly upon the authority and credit of the government, except in extreme urgency, is without warrant in the Constitu tion and a violation of sound financial princi ples. The issue of United States notes during the late civil, war, with the capacity ot legal tender, between private individuals, was not authorized except as a means of rescuing the country from imminent peril. T1IE SUPPRESSION OP POLYGAMY. The continued deliberate violation by a large number of the prominent and influen tial citizens of the Territory of Utah of the laws of the United States for the prosecution and punishment of polygamy, demands the at tention of every department of the govern ment. This Territory lias a population suffi cient to entitle it to admission as a State. This important change, will, however, never be approved by the country, while the citi zeusjof Uteh, in very considerable number, uphold a practice which is condemned as a crime by the laws of all civilized communi ties throughout the world. The law for the suppression of the offense was enacted with great unanimity by Congress more than sev enteen years ago, but lias remained until re cently a dead letter in the Territory of Utah, because of the peculiar difficulties attending its enforcement. It should be firmly and effectively executed. If not sufficiently stringent iu its provisions, it should be amended, aud, in aid of the pur pose in view, I recommend that more compre hensive and more searching methods for pre venting, as well as punishing this crime, be provided. TUE ELECTIONS. I earnestly appeal to the intelligence and patriotism of all good citizens of every part of the country, however much they may be di vided in opinion on other political subjects, to unite in compelling obedience to existing laws aimed at the protection of the right of suffrage. I respectfully urge upon Congress to supply any defects in these laws which ex perience has shown, and which it is in its power to remedy. I again invoke 'lie co-op eration of the executive and legislative au thorities of the States in this great purpose. 1 am fully convinced that it the public mind can be set at rest on this paramount question of popular rights, no serious object will thwart or delay the complete pacification of the country, or retard the general diffusion of prosperity. CIVIL SERVICE. Iu a former message I invited the attention of Congress to the subject of tlie reformation of the civil service of the Government and expressed the intention of transmitting to Congress, as early as practicable, a report on the subject by the chairman of the Civil Ser vice Commission, on the subject of compet itive examinations. I think the economy, pu rity aud efficiency of the public service would be greatly promoted by their systematic in troduction, whenever practicable, throughout the entire civil service of the Gevernment, together with ample provision for their gene ral supervision, in order to secure consistency and uniform justice. I am convinced that if a just and definite test of merit is enforced for admission to tlie public service, and in making promotions, such abuses as removing without good cause, and partisan and official interference with the proper exercise of the appointing power, will, in a large measure, disappear. It may not be easy, and it may never, perhaps, be necessary to define with precision the proper limit of political action on the part of Federal officers. But while their right to hold and freely express their opinions cannot be questioned, it is very plain that they should neither be allowed to ejevote to other subjects the time needed for the ! proper discharge of their official duties, nor to use the authority of their office to enforce their own opinions, and to coerce the political action of these who hold different opinions. Reasons of justice and public policy quite analagous to those which forbid the ase of po litical power for the oppression of the private citizeu impose upon the Government the duty of protecting its officers and agents from arbi trary exactions. In whatever aspect consid ered, the practice of making levies for party purposes upon salaries of officers is highly de moralizing to Ute public service and discred itable to the country. Though an officer should be as free as any other citizen to give his own money in aid of his own opinions or his party, he should also be as free as any other citizen to refuse to make such gifts. OUR RELATIONS WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES Have continued peaceful. With Great Brit ain there are still unsettled questions grow ing ont of the local laws of (he maritime provinces, and the action of provincial au thorities deemed to be in derogation of rights secured to American fishermen. The United Scales Minister in London has been Instructed to present a demand for $105,305.02 in view of the damages received by American citizens of Fortuna Bay on the 6tli day of January, 1878 . THE CUBAN QUESTION. Questions of grave importance wi'h Spain, growing out of the incidents of the Cuban in surrection, have been for tlie most part hap pilv and honorably settled. THE CHINESE QUESTION. The Government of China has signified its willingness to consider the question of the emigration of its subjects to the United States with a dispassionate fairness, and to co-oper ate in such measures as may tend to prevent injurious consequences to tlie United Stales. The negotiations are still proceeding, and will be pushed with diligence. THE INTER-OCEANIC CANAL Has recently assumed a new and important aspect, and is now under discussion with the Central American countries through whose territories the canal by the Nicaraguan route would have to pass. It is trusted that enlight ened statesmanship on their part will settle the early prosecution of such woik, which will largely inure to the benefit not only of their own citizens and those of the United States, but of the commerce of the civilized world. It is not doubted that should tlie work be undertaken under tlie protective au spices of the United States, and upon satis factory concessions- for tlie right of way, and its security by the Central American govern ments, the ^capital for its completion would rapidly he furnished from this country and Europe, which might, failing such guarantees, prove iuaccessable. THE ARMY AND NAVY. The Secretary ot War reports that the War Department estimates for tlie fiscal year elid ing June 30,1881, are $40,380,428.93, the same being for a less sum of money than tlie annual estimate rendered to Congress from that de partment during a period of at least twelve years. He concurs with the General of the army in recommending such legislation as will authorize the enlistment of the full num ber of 25,000 men required for detached duty and therefore not available for service in the field. The report of the Secretary of tlie Navy shows continued improvements In that branch of the service during the last fiscal year. Ex tensive repairs have been made upon vessels, and two new ships have been completed anil made ready for sea. Tlie total expenditures for the year ending June 30, 1870, were $13, 555,710.09 ; the expenses chargeable to tlie year were $13,343,315.79, but this is subject to a reduction of $283,725.99, that amount having been drawn upon warrants, but not paid out during the year. The amount of approptiation applicable to the last fiscal year was $14,000,000 ; there was, there fore, a balance of $1,479,054.37 remaining in and to the credit of she Department on June 30, 1879. THE 

BUSINESS OF THE SUPREME COURT Is at present largely iu arrears. It cannot be expected that more gage* can be decided than are now disposed annual session; that by any assiduitjj_ti ~ - ~ ' can acéom] trates wlio compose tb# more tlian is now fitn Ê-IM ■ eourti-'bf 8 many ot the circuits, also,' tlie business litis increased to such an extent that the delay of justice will call the attention of Congress to an appropriate remedy. It is believed that all is done in such circuits which can fairly be expected from its judicial force. The evils arising from delay are loss heavily felt by the United States than by private suitors, as its causes are advanced by tlie courts when it is seen they involve the decision of questions of a public character. The remedy suggested by the Attorney General is tlie appointment of additional circuit judges, and the creation of an intermediate Court of Errors aud Ap peals, which shall release tlie Supreme Court of a part of its jurisdiction, while a larger force is also obtained for the performance of circuit duties. I commend this suggestion to the consideration of Congress. It would seem to afford a complete remedy, and would involve, if ten additional judges were appoint ed, an expenditure at the present rate of sala ries of not more than $6,000 a year, which would certainly be small in comparison with the objects to be attained. 

TRANSFER OF THE INDIANS. The question whether a change In the control of the Indian service sliouid be made was, In the Forty-fifth Congres,!', referred to a Joint com In my last annual message, 1 expressed tlie nope that the decision of that question then in pros pect, would arrest further ugltalion of this euL ject. such agitation being apt to produce a dis turbing effect upon the service as well as the Indians themselves. Since the committee hav ing reported, the question has been decided in the negative by a vote m the House of Repre sentatives, for tlie reasons here stated ; and In view of the fact that further uncertainty on this point will be calculated to obstruct other much needed legislation, to weaken the discipline of tlie service and to unsettle salutary measures now in progress for the government of the Indi ans, I respectfully recommend that the decision arrived ut by Congress, at its last session, be permitted to stand. 

TIMBER LANDS. Interior to arrest the lands of the United States have been continued and have met with considerable success. have been settled, the trespassers offering to make payment to the Government for the value of the timber taken by them. The proceeds of these prosecutions and settlements turned into the Treasury far exceed In amount the sums ap propriated by Congress for the purpose. A more important result, however, consists In the fact that the destruction of our public forests by dep redation, although such cases still occur, has been greatly reduced In extent, and it Is prob able that If the present policy is vigorously pur sued and efficient provision to that end Is made by a It pi Congress, such trespasses, af least those on arge scale, can be entirely suppressed, except the Territories where timber for the daily quireinont of tlie population cannot, under the present state of law, be otherwise obtained. AGRICULTURE. My recommendations In former messages are renewed, In favor of enlarging the facilities ot the Department of Agriculture. Agriculture is the leading Interest and the prominent industry ot our people. It Is to the abundance of agri cultural production as compared with our home consumption, and the largely^ increased^ and routable market abroad which we have enjoyed in recent vears, that we are mainly In debted for our présent prosperity as a people. We must look for Its continued maintenance to the same substantial resources. There is no branch of industry In which labor directed by ductlon in comparison with unskilled labor, and no brandi of the public service to which the en couragement of liberal appropriations can ' more appropriately extended. The omission render such aid is not a wise economy; but on the contrary, undoubtedly results tn losses of immense sums annually that might be saved through well directed efforts by the Government to promote this vital interest, The results al ready accomplished with the very limited means heretofore placed at the command of the Department of Agriculture. Is an ernest of what may be expected with increased appropri ations for the several purposes Indicated In the report {of the Commissioner. With a view to placing the Department upon a footing whim will enable tt to prosecute more effectively tlie objects for which it Is established, appropria tions are needed for a more complete laboratory for the establishment of a veterinary division amt a division of forestry and for thlg increase of force.
