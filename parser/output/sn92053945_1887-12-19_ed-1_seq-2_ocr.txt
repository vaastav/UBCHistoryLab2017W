THE HOCK0ISLAND ARGUS, MONDAY, DECEMJ3ER 19, 1887. THE DAILY AliGUS JOHN W- POTTER. Monday, December 19, 1887. SUNDAY'S MEETINGS. NwwcMtal Krtil Meetlni r the Trl-Clty MUr - Rearianliatloa of the . A very interesting meeting of the Tri Oily Labor Congress was held at Hillier's hall yesterday afternoon. Deputy Sheriff J. W. Cavanaugh, chairman of the com mittee on arrangement of the tn-city. congress, presided. The topic of dis cussion was the tariff question, the re marks being confined more strictly, how ever, to the president's attitude, and the general sentiment favored the presi dent's course, as far as the reduction of the tariff on the necessities of life is concerned at least. The speak ers were City Attorney McEnirv, L. C. Blanding, H. Boetock of this city, .and Hagistrate L. S. O'Neil and C. C. Wat ers of Moline. It was one of the best meetings tlic tri-city congress has ever held. THE 

LAND LEAGUE The Rock Island branch of the Irish National Leai;ue was revived at Norris' ball last evening. There was a good at tendance present, and the old time spirit of enthusiasm for the cause of Ireland was manifested. President McEniry presided. Alter considerable discussion as to the provision of ways and means to carry on the meetings the coming wiuler, the election of officers took place result ing as follows: Preiident W J Browne. Vice President- Z W Cavanaugh. Recording Secretary John Mulqueen. Corresponding Secretary Frank Mc Donald. Treasurer Thomas F Cary. Adjournment was taken until uext Wednesday evening at the same place, when tbe new offlcees will be installed and the plan of tbe winter's campaign mapped out. The friends of Ireland have always had support and sympathy in Rock Island, and this winter will bring no exception to the rule. It is a cause that is just; the voice of humanity calls, and the voice of humanity responds. 

CHRISTMAS COMES. Oar Week From Today Will a the Day Observed. It is only one week until Christmas, that paradoxical holiday, which is old and yet ever new. Old to those who have stored away in tbe recesses of their memories, the recollections of many a Christmas past; new to those who have seen but one or two, and who are wait' ing with eager anticipations for tbe presence of another. Tbe fact that Christmas falls on Sun day this year has led to somethiog of an uncertainty in regard to what day should be actually celebrated Saturday or Monday. As far as the Argus can . ascertain, the general sentiment seems to favor Monday, and it will in all proba bilities be tbe day observed from a busi ness standpoint It will suit business men the best, and it will certainly be more accommodating to the people in general. There are numerous reasons in fact why Monday should be the day observed. First, there is not much genuine pleasure de rived from celebrating an occasion before it arrives. Again, there are many people who put off their holiday purchasing, or a portion of it at least, until the last day before Christmas Christmas eye and they expect the stores to be open then for their accommodation. Merchants natur ally desire the beneSl of trade np to the last minute, and there are many who would not close Saturday if some would. It is the opinion of the Auucs, therefore that Monaay is the day to observe, and it is the object of this article to bring about a mutual agreement between public offl cials and business men to fix upon some day and have the celebration general. Monday will doubtless be Christmas day this year, as far as festivities are eon cerned, and tbe same will be true of New Year's next year. Poller Point. Stella Foster, hailing from the sinful , village whse church spires mark ill la cation, on the other side of the ' 'Father at Waters," was in Rock Island yesterday. She came over to see what a city looked like and she made a day of it all by her selfhad a little celebration of her own She mast have brought the tanglefoot with her in a little jug, for it had a pro faibition flavor, if actions go to show any thing. Officer Wichman played gallant to the Davenport fairy and escorted her to the station. This morning ahe was taxed only 15 and coats for her lodging and Officer Wichman's services thrown in. The police picked up a horse and bug' try on Second avenue Saturday night and left it at Tindall's barn on Third avenue. Tbe horse is bay with three while feet and the outfit quite a respectable one. One of the simplest barometers is a spider's web. When there is a prospect of rain or wind the spider shortens the filaments from which its web is suspend ed and leaves things in this state as long as the weather is variable. If tbe insect elongates its thread it is a sign of line calm weather, the duration of which may be judged of by the length to which the threads are let out. If the spider re mains inactive It is a sign of rain; but if, on the contrary, it keeps at work during the ram the latter will not last long, and will be followed by fine weather. Other observations have taught that the spider makes changes in its web every twenty- four hours, and that if such changes are made in the evening, just before sunset, the night win he clear and beautiful.

Inflammatory Orations at the Entombing ; of tli Executed A pot tie of Social Bar olatlon at Chicago Th Dead Men AgstaNTonipared with the Saviour ud the Cense Declared "March.- On.' i Chicago, Dec 1ft The last scene, so far, In tbe tragedy that was begun at tbe Hay market in May, lost, was enacted Sunday at Waldhetm cemetery, the bodies of tbe five Anarchists being deposited is their final rest-: ing place in a lot purchased for that purpose, Tbe weather was cloudy and chilly, and i snow lay all over tbe ground, bat over 2,000 men, women and children wire present, promi nent among the women were Mrs. Van Zandt, Nina Van Zindt-Spies and Mrs. Parson The committee baring tbe affair in charge had chartered cars for LOW people, but tbe railway had to put on a couple more trains to carry the crowd. There was no demon stration in the city. It was just one o'clock when the members ' the committee, who have been c Barged with the duty of providing for tbe families of the executed men, passed under tbe stone archway of tbe cemetery entrance, two and two. There a halt was made, and a score of weeping women, all of tbem attired in the habiliments of woe, ' with long black veils coveringthem from bead to foot emerged from the lodge and and joined the proces sion. A more tbem were Mrs. Van Zandt and Nina Van Zandt-Spies, Mrs. Spies, Oretcben Spies and her sister, Mrs. Parsons who held her two children tightly, one on either band, Mrs. Engle and her daughter, Mrs. Fischer, and Elsie Friedel, Loais Iingg's sweetheart As tbe bead of the procession reached the platform tbe last of she five black-covered comas that containing tbe remains of Adolph Fischer which was covered with a red flag bearing the printed inscription, "Hurrah for An archy'1 was carried from the vault and placed in a row with the others. Then there was a alight delay, during which the caskets were covered with floral tributes. The largest ot these, a pillow with the inscription in blue violets, "Our Papa," was placed on Parson's coffin. On that of Lingg weie laid two wreaths of flowers and immortelles, contrib uted by the Central Labor union and the Brewers1 anion, of Cieveland, together with bunch of roses from his sweetheart. Wreaths were also laid on the other caskets by relatives and members of the committee. Then the lids of the caskets were removed. leaving the remains exposed below the glass. and it was announced that every one present would be afforded a final opportunity of cas ing Upon the features of the -dead. Tuere was an instantaneous crush toward the plat form, but order was quickly restored, ;and for an hour or more the people passed by the caskets m single file. There were grey-headed men and white-haired women, with totter ing footsteps; girls and boys not out of their teens, and mothers and fathers with babes in their arms. Nearly every one displayed a red ribbon a piece of crape, or a black rosette, raw of the women could control thair emotion, and their tears fell copiously, while many of the men wept freely. The faces of the dead were calm and placid. Indications of decomposition, how ever, bad made themselves manifest, not only in the sallow discoloration, but in the purple spots which stood out upon tbe cheeks and foreheads of the dead men. The casket containing the remains of Louis Lingg was placed at the end of the platform, and as the file of people passed by and looked down upon the features, which in spite of the skill of surgeons and embalmers still remained most horribly disfigured, few could repress a cry of horror. About two thirds of the gathering had viewed tbe re mams when tbe rapid approach of dusk gave warning to the committee that the formal ceremonies should be hastened. Tbe members of the Socialistic Manmrcaor were massed at the head of the platform and sung the solemn uerman hymn, Am Urn be Latter r retinae At the lrave of Our Friends." When the funeral chant bad concluded Joseph R. Buchanan stepped upon the plat form inuned lately beside the casket contain ing the body of Lingg, and a deep bush at once fell upon the assemblage. He said that they had met together to pay a last token of respect to their deceased comrades, to gaze upon their faces, and bid them a final fare- ell. They were met there as common people, as people whose cause the dead men had championed, whose rights they had es- poused, and for whom they had given tbe lives. I bey had gathered moreover to bury all differences, if any existed, in the ranks of tbeir sympathizers, and to start afresh that movement in behalf of the people for which they had forfeited their lives. The uead men before them re presented different nationalities. The bodies before them were those of martyrs martyrs in the cause of labor, martyrs in the cause for which those around them would struggle and in years to come the entire world would recognize the fact, and the journals that to day denounced them and their cause would yet be found singing the praises of the men who died- lor Ereetluin, luere were no dem onstrations during thedelivery of the opening address. , CapL W. P. Black, the counsel for tbe Anarchists throughout the memorable trial, was next introduced, and he devoted a long address to a comparison between tbe dead men. and tbe Savior. He said that it was nearly nineteen centuries since there came into tbe world one whose name was a house hold word wherever the civilization of Onrimt bad shed its light Whatever personal views they might entertain in relation to religion. two things must be admitted. The first, that Christ bad brought connection between tbe world and the eternal gwod: and, second, -Chat He had established the principle of uni versal brotherhood. His cause was the cause of the poor and oppressed, and for it they cast Him out, but the cross upon which they crucified Him became the synonymn of honor and glory. "Hm tbe world reached its ultimate of progress, of honor, , and of development' said the speaker as he reached one of his im passioned periods. ' "Look upon those dead and answer. Their purpose was tbe eleva tion of mankind, the amelioration of the condition of those about them. They sought to bring about the day of universal brotherhood and the world bad nothing bet ter for these men than the gibbet. The speaker paused for breath. Almost as tbe same moment a long, wild, due pairing cry broke upon tbe still air and chilled sua blood of nearly every man and woman is) the throng, sirs. Parsons bad for tbe first time been led to the casket which contained the. remains of her bus baud and permitted tc gaze upon bis features. The ordeal was tec much for her strength. The air was filled with tbe most heartrending cries and walls. which reached to the most remote bouadtfltf of the cemetery. Women away on tbe out skirts of the crowd, who knew nothing of what had "'opened in front, sobbed and wrung their l ids convulsively, and even many men fount, impossible -to force tbe hot tears. Finally the grief-stricTen woman swooned and faH back into the arms Of her friends, and was gently conveyed away. Before order had been restored (tretoben Spies also fell in a faint, and was taken to toe lodge. "Ah welL"'said Cant Black, wbea be finally er a bled to resume his address, "we win take these lessons to tmr hearts, EH tbe memory of those who died for tbe ai of tbe common people be buried in oblivion. Pi 01 we do not despair. Underneath the snow at our feet the invisible flowers are growing ripe for the bloom, and the cause for which these men died is growing Id human hearts. It can not be destroyed. We most all die. What matter it whan tbe moment comes, so lone so it is in the service of the peonla. But tbe eternal father, faith- iui to n teachings, can not deny Himself to those who bave passed out of life in His service, and we live in the certain hope that amongst those who will be called to the life again by the great and noble God will be our dead our dead. Paul Orottkau, who is awaitine sentence in tbe Wisconsin courts for delivering an As archist address, next took Die platform and was greeted with cries af "Bravo." His ad dress was one of tbe most inflammatory of the style lor which he has become notorious. At one moment . fats lung bony forefingers would be pointed at the coffins, the next his fists would be high In the air and bis frame snaking with passion. At nearly every sen tence he was iutrrupteel wyj loud cries of "bravo" or groans. He declared that tbe men before, bun had bean murdered by the ruling classes. He could read in the eves of his bearers, in the dumb, eloquent language of their souls, and they had assembled to ac cuse the umnlerars, to declare that the crimes of the ruling classes were the sole evidence adduced against the tyra They had been murdered baeanse they worked for the libertv, enlight enment and welfare of alL That was their crime.

Ibe names of the martyrs would be emblazoned upon the banner of tbe proletarians when there came what could not be prevented the grat alarm which called upon the Anarch istic battalions to march. The death of theee men would have the effect which a whirl wind has upon a spark of fire in fanning it into a mighty holocaust, and like a devas tating flood it would spread over every land. "They did their duty ; let us do ours," said the speaker. Shouts of "bravo" rent tbe air. "Swear by these bodies that yon will con tinue the work so fiendishly begun by tbe min ions of the law," ehouted the speaker. "We will, we willT came from a thousand throats. Then there was an ominous growl and Qrottkan stepped down. Albert Currlin, of St. Louis, waa the hut speaker. Ha followed closely in tbe vein in augurates: by wottkau, and at one period of his address, stretching his arms toward the skies, he exclaimed: MVow it here before your dead that the work of Anarchy shall go on. Vow it, 1 say, if you are not cowards r "We vow I we vow I" came from tbe throng. The voices of the women seemed to rise above those of the men. There was a tempest of applause wheu Currlin concluded. Then while the Mannercbor sang a final dirge and tbe relatives of the dead men wept and moaned tbe lids of tbe casket were replaced and screwed down, A lane was formed through tbe crowd and the coffins gently borne to tbe grave and lowered one by one. When the last of the five had been deposited they were covered by three huge slabs of granite, weighing tn the aggregate over a ton, and which were lowered by means of a derrick. Then tbe earth was shoveled in by two sturdy grave-diggers. Tan minutes later a newly made mound marked tbe last resting place of tbe Anarch ists, and the cemetery was deserted. S. P.

He closed the message with a promise to do bis share of the work in another way. The New Yorkers had met again and nominated James P.

Lowden Snowden, of Pennsylvania William H. Beveridga, of Virginia, spoke for onow- Leonidas Houk, of Tennessee, spoke for Foster, and Judge Brown, of Ohio, said be would second the nomination ot Mr. Foster for tbe Ohio delegation. At this point a great laugh was raised at the expense of W. T. Yardley, ot Tennessee, who had got an erroneous impression as to who New York's nominee was. He referred to the great states of Tennessee and Ohio, Then in coming to the point, be said: "I came here to vote for the best man for the bead of tbe league. In my opinion Governor Foster, of Ohio, is the " and then the roar of laughter drowned his voice, and it was some time before be understood that tbe Foster named was not ex-Goyernor Foster, of Oh mx Mr. Snowden withdrew his name and the ball resounded with cries of Question I "Question!" while Gardner, of Wisconsin, moved Foster's election by acclamation. which was carried with a tremendous burst ot "Aye," and not a solitary "Nay," and Foster was declared elected president of the national league.

He extolled Mayor How land, of Toronto, and the text which was above his office door, thus: "Ex cept the Lord keep the city, the watchmen wake in vain." St John excited derisive laughter by inquiring bow that text would look over tbe office door of Mayor Hewitt in this city.

Blaine's great cheers from the au dience reputation has been vindicated by his greatest blunder. " He then discuss Blaine's interview upon the president's message, and ridiculed his ex pressions relative to the whisky and tobacco tax.

Indianapolis, Dec. 19. Senator Voor hees, in the course of an interview Saturday, said be should not favor any reduction of tbe tax on spirits. He might, however, be willing to repeal tbe tax on tobacco, except oa cigars and cigarettes. In alludiug to free crade, the senator said: "A great many people use the term free trade witbout knowing or caring what it means. Free trade means no tsnff sax; it means the abandment of eastern bouses and resort to direct taxation of states. Under such system Indiana's proportion would be nine or ten millions a year. I don't think any body wants to to the experiment in this ot any other state." Merman Men Ie pressed. Columbus, O., Dec 19.

Frances Driver said she was willing to offer nersell a s a sacrifice, and laid her bead on the table. Jordan thereupon took a sword and struck her several blows on the neck and stabbed her a number of times, killing her instantly. Tbe body was then dragged out into the street by the other two women. A white woman witnessed tbe sfTair and gave the alarm. Police Officer Payne, after a terrible struggle, succeeded in overpowering Jordan, and, with tbe aid of several other officers, conveyed him to the city prison.
