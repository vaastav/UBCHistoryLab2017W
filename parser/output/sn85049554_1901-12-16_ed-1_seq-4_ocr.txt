Iowa, assecond-class tnaOl matter. A GENIUS WANTED. The recent cold snap has demonstrated conclusively that with all the wonders of modern mechanical achievement we are still very far from perfection In our methods of heating: our buildings. A Marshalltown man who happened to spend Saturday in Chicago overheard elegantly-dressed women in the depart ment stores complaining to one another that they couldn't heat their houses above 50 degrees that morning. These women dressed in rich furs and riding in private carriages with liveried servants waiting for them on the curb gave every appearance of never having experienced a hardship in their lives, and yet on that day when the thermometer stood 18 be low aero all day the costly mansions of these well-to-do people were inade Quately heated. In Marshalltown among the middle classes, people who could and would en Joy all of the comforts of modern life, many and many a major domo fired up in the small hours of the night and still failed to heat his house comfortably. In the first place modern houses are not built as warmly as they should be. A Marshalltown furnace manufacturer says he has less trouble heating houses In Minneapolis with bis furnaces than he has in Marshalltown for the simple reason that in the northern city people expect to encounter extremely cold weather and build accordingly. The walls are more tightly boarded. Resi dents no more think of entering a winter season without storm windows, doors and closets than they do of having shingles on their roofs. Pipes and all plumbing are carefully kept on inside walls and much less inconvenience is experienced from zero weather than here in this city where people thoughtlessly take no account of the cold waves we often have. But aside -from these shortcomings the methods and systems used in heat ing buildings now-a-days are very crude and even primitive in comparison to the advances made in other branches of mechanical science. The hot atr fur nace can not help but impress one with the waste pf heat constantly going on. Few are the'householders who haven't experimented to prevent the heat go ing up the chimney. As a rule hot air furnaces are all too small for .the houses they are expected to heat Ex perienced men have learned that a very large furnace with a large fuel capac ity will do the heating with much lesB fuel cost than a smaller furnace but at best a furnace Is extravagant, dirty and an all-around nuisance. Hot water and steam heating are considered superior to furnaces aiyl stoves but both are crude and unsatis factory. What is needed and the won der is that modern, science has not dis covered it long ago, Is a heating sys tem that will conceal its radiators within the wails, heat without dust or dirt and utilize all the 'heat generated without the waste now necessary. The writer is experimenting with a gasoline gas machine which manufac ture gat with which all the cooking and lighting in a house can be done. It faas seemed to him that some genius ought long ago to have devised a heat ing system, hot water, steam or hot air, that could be operated with gas. With a winter's fuel bill of from $50 to $100 for a modern dwelling almost an un limited- amount of gas could be provid ed for the amount. And the there is the possibility ofdevisinga heat storing '.apparatus whereby the heat energy ex traced from, the .rooms of a,building in summer could be stored to be released J1y radiation back into the rooms again Id winter.-. }'Jqjne of these suggestions •may seem dreamlike but while Marconi footing around trying to send mes sages across the seas without cables or »wires some of us poor fellows who nev ".er have messages for foreign rrans fmission but who do have houses to heat •and small salaries to spend for coal 'would like to see a brother genius of -Marconi tackle the problem next to our "dally life. We have heard of the fellow who'would feed us with con densed pellets but we don't welcome lilm, there Is too much Joy in good eat ing but the fellow who can keep us warm in winter and coot in summer at small cost and without the dirt, dust and annoyance of coal hods, aah pans and the like can't come to our town any too soon. A NEIGHBOR'S EFFORT AT DISTRICTING. W. O. Payne, of the Nevada Repre sentative, has Journeyed down to Des Moines with a measure to reapportion the state Into new congressional dis tricts In such a way aB to give his neighbors immediately east of him twinges of his own name. Without going over his whole scheme the Times-Re gtubllcan will present two of his districts "In this Immediate neighborhood. When Editor Payne was carving them out he fwaa sot studying the mottoes on the wfU, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself," and "love thyself last cherish those heart* that 1tate thee," but he ev idently kept in mind ambitions for con gressional honor* not yet satisfied. Here are two of hie districts: Fifth district Franklig, Wright, "Humboldt, Calhoun, Webster, Hamil­ ton, Hardin, Grundy, Boone, Story. Population, 203,640 republican majority, 18,139. Population present Fifth district, 190,857 republican majority, 8,858. Sixth district—Tama, Marshall, Jas per, Poweshiek, Iowa, Johnson, Mahas ka, Keokuk. Population, 204,579 repub lican majority, 6,692. Present popula tion Sixth district, 174,673 republican majority, 3,144. I- He carved out for his home district one that looks like a square and BOlid fort, with bastions on each side and with 18,139 republican majority. None of the present members of congress are in it to disturb the author's ambitious dreams. He puts Marshall in a new Sixth district, throws in Congressman Lacey and his home county, and as a little joker puts in Johnson county, where there are numerous democrats who figured "befor' de wah," when the state was admitted, and who have not yet learned there is such a thing as pro gressive politics. He figures a republl can majority of 6,692, or about a third of his new home-made and hand-made dls trict, presumably on the ground that Lacey don'i: need a strong majority be hind him. Editor Payne should try again, after studying the generous mottoes on the wall. 

CUSTOMS IN THE PHILIPPINES. Many oft he Iowa teachers and others who have gone to the Philippine Islands from Iowa are writing entertaining let ters to home friends giving Interesting views of the new and strange scenes they meet with. Mrs. C. H. Maxson writes entertainingly to the Outlook Club of Maquoketa, and the Excelsior prints her letter. She is located in the town of Molo, on the island of Paney, the town being near Iloilo, which is said to be the second city of importance in the Philippines. In the course of her ter she says Some of the things that have inter ested me most are the little customs which differ from what we have known at home. When you meet teams in driv ing your driver turns to the left, in stead of the right. The hour for calling is from 5 o'clock till 7, and the evening meal is served at 8 o'clock. At the table everything is served in courses, and at your place you will find a pile of piates. One thing is served at a time and as soon as that eaten the top plate is re moved. Then too if we go in to call the first thing ithey bring in Is a plate of cookies, cakes, sweet potatoes, bananas or something and offer us wine to drink. It is hard sometimes to make them un derstand that- we do not use wine ,and especially are they astonished when we refuse tobacco in any form. The women of the poiser class nearly all amoke cigars, and the cigars are often twice the length of the ordinary American manufacture. Even small children, both girls and boys smoke these cigars or cigarettes. It is often said that It does not cost much to live in the Philippines, but it is owing to how we live. Rice, bananas and a variety of sweet potatoes are cheap. The nicest bananas are eaten when they are green in co or. One va riety we buy are not more than three inches long, but are fine. One very odd custom is the tolling of a bell at night. At first we wondered what 1p was. for, but we learned that near by there is a native policeman who is supposed to patrol a certain section of the town. Each time he passes the bell he rings it to let it be known that he is on duty. The native oranges hero are very large, a sort of pear shaped fruit, and are quite unlike anything he have seen. They are eaten while the skin is green, and are rather sour, with sometimes a little bitter taste. There are other na tive fruits but we have Keen nothing choice. The chickens are itmall and fly like birds, especially the young. As a consequence they are tfll light meat, figgs are small and cost SO cents gold per dozen. We are surrounded with cocoanut palms. They reach far up above us and the cocoanuts are gotten by the native boys. Steps are cut up the? sides of the tree very far apart but they climb quite ralpdly. The cocoanut milk Is ex cellent for sdlclne—we have not learn ed to relish it yet, however. The streetn are narrow, there are no sidewalks, and rubbers are unheard of, while in lieu of street lamps each house is requested to hang a lantern outside. Only the upper story of the houses are used for living rooms and the natives use the lower rooms for their family of live stocks We have a good room below but raised a few- feet from the floor where our muchacho (servant) lives with bis wife. BUSINESS FEATURES The most important feature of the business situation Is the great tide of holiday trade. In other rcspects there Is not much change. Dun states that conditions in the leading industries are still most strikingly promising. Tight money in some of the big centers is a temporary condition. Chicago reports that money has some what unexpectedly worked into a very close position. Bankers anticipate no easing, in view of large current demands for mercantile purposes and heavy in terest disbursements running thru next month. It is noted that altho the people are liberal Christmas spenders deposits at most banlcs show but little increase. In the opinion of bankers, however, the mercantile situation is sound, and gen eral conditions are without Indications of financal disturbance. Navigation closed with the largest freight move ment recorded, the greatest, gains being in iron ore, lumber and grain. Collec tions are good and retail trade In all di rections maintains an unparalleled vol ume. There Is enormous consumption of merchandise of all kinds. In Boston reports from the retailers are very encouraging. Weather condi tions have continued perfect, and a large business in holiday novelties and staple merchandise is the result. One of the best seasons on record is reported In Jewelry and fancy goods, with but little to chooiie between the size of bus iness in low priced and high coBt goods. The demand seems to bo general from all classes of buyers. At Pittsburg there ha? boen a notice-1 able improvement in the transportation conditions of the iron and steel market during the past few days. There are more cars to handle freight, and the stock of finished material which has been piling up has been somewhat re duced. The blast furnaces have been able to move their products more promptly, and conditions in general are much improved. At New Orleans wholesale grocer? and hardware dealers report a fair volume of business. In dry goods and kindred lines only a moderate volume is being transacted. In Cincinnati there Is an active move ment in holiday trade, which bids fair to exceed that of last year. Memphis reports that general trade with jobbers and retailers is fair, tho volume in holiday goods comparatively light. Collections show Improvement, and money in good demand, with ample supply. At Minneapolis, with the snow and drop in temperature there is a more active demand for heavy goods in all lines. The demand for holiday goods is Increasing and the situation is very active. Manufacturers of clothing, and shoes are steadily employed, and jobbers of dry goods are obtaining quite a number of spring orders. In groceries a steady volume of business is reported and the price situation in these lines continues steady. Collections are re ported fair. Notwithstanding the fact that logs are frozen up, Bome mills are in operation and business is exceeding ly active. Shipments of lumber are 8, 055,000 feet. Receipts, 2,655,000. The lumber cut of the local mills for the sea son just past 1b about 559,000,000 feet. This record is surpassed only by that of 1892, when the cut was 698,000,000 feet. The flour mills last week ran somewhat lighter than In the preceding week. St. Louis reports that the feature of th^ past week's business has been the excessive retail holiday trade. People of all classes seem to have money, and to be in theispirlt of spending It. The same report comes from the country towns thru almost all of this tributary belt of country. Retailers have almost without exception had to renew their stocks, so that the jobbers as well have felt the increased activity of trade. At San Francisco cold, dry weather prevailed last week, with slight frost in central and northern parts of the state. This has permitted renewed activity in all kinds of farm work with much en couragement for good crops next season. ORlclal report of grain stocks in the state on the 1st shows 600,000 short tons of wheat, 223,000 tons barley, 150,000 tons oats, 84,000 tons rye, and 477,000 bags ynni The wheat on hand shows that the crop was not much over 900,000 tons. Wheat Is now going into the ships at pretty good rate, and the clearing will average a cargo for every business day of the month. IOWA OPINIONS AND NOTES. The Traer Star-Clipper notices that "one of the first bills Introduced in con gress was a measure to repeal the bank rupt law, by our Cousins." It declares that "this law is becoming unpopular and the indications are that it will go this winter." Spirit Lake Beacon: It is singular that the republican delegations from Iowa, Minnesota and Illinois should so tamely yield in the matter of tariff and reci procity legislation. The sentiment of their states i^ strongly in evidence. It is the opinion of most intelligent think ing men in every community in these states that the interests of the country are being neglected and a serious party miBtake is made in TOPICS bootB congressional insist­ ence upon a continuance of certain fea tures of the tariff schedules and a policy of silence upon reciprocity propositions. The Iowa republican convention with out division spoke definitely upon this point, yet up to date no Iowa congress man has manifested in public the slight est concern over this plain injunction and the common conviction of the peo ple of the state. Is it unreasonable to assume that representatives should rep resent? The Davenport Republican is not in favor of making changes In congression al districts at present. It says, however: "The day is coming, because of the in crease in population, when Iowa will be entitled to another congressman, and the new district will be located In north western Iowa. Southeastern Iowa will be let alone in district boundaries for some years to come." It looks to the Council Bluffs Nonpa reil "as tho some one might as well move to make unanimous the Chinese exclusion act." In noticing the Phillips-Moore kicking incident, the Anamosa Eureka is led to exclaim: "Think of a democratic can didate for governor going round after election and kicking a member of his own party because of a passing remark or comment in his paper that did not quite please him! Phillips is a big, over grown baby." Of Iowa's senior senator the Audubon Republican declares: "Allison today exercises more influence than any other personage In American politics outside of the president. Long-continued serv ice together with good ability and good character have won him his position." The Sioux City Journal thinks the edi tor of the Dubuque Telegraph-Herald "might have waited to see if some one else would not enter the first objection to the proposal to make it unanimous for Senator Allison." "Bought It yet? If not, why not?" are seasonable interrogations of the Keo kuk Gate City. City Treasurer Philip Gerst of Buffalo admits hiB accounts were short, but says the amount has been made good. He will accept an order from the mayor removing him from office. gBEmttg Timss-'WimMfam, TOarsJralliimn: ^ouro, Tthmdag, JteembeK IB, 1901 

TIMES or THE That studious expression of the coun tenance is merely a spasm of Christ mas thought. George Alfred Henty, the writer of stories for boys, is at present writing at the rate of three books a year. He has eighty stories to his credit now. He reported for "The London Standard," the Austro-Itallan, Franco-Prussian and Turko-Servian wars, and the Abys sinian and Ashantee expeditions. General George H. Steuart, confeder ate brigadier general, has just had re turned to him by Abram Smith, of Long Bach, Cal., a bible which he carried thru the civil war, and which the latter took from a confederate wagon, a few days before the surrender of Lee's army. Reports received' in Pekin from the court say that the dowager empress is in noticeably failing health. But it added that her physical weakness does not affect her paramount Influence. The emperor's health is improving. They got on the car together the sec ond day of the session—Senator Lodge and Senator Hanna—bound for the down-down hotel district. They were a strikingly different type and yet the wealth of each has often been envied rnd frequently commented upon. Per haps Senator Lodge has never known from what source the money he spends comes. When he was a youth he was wealthy. Discreet Investments have given him sufficient means from his boyhood days so that he has never been obliged to ask a question as to where the current dollar came from or where he was to get the next one. Senator Han na, tho not born to opulence, is ac counted one of the wealthiest men in the senate. The two chatted about the events of the day, commented upon the message of the president and seemed oblivious of the fact that the conductor of the car waB standing patiently in front of them waiting for his fare. Lodge waB first to realize it. He started to feel first in one pocket, then, in an other. Senator Hanna pulled back the capaciouB skirts of his Prince Albert and began a search of himself. Hanna found a rough-looking jack-knife and four rubber bands In the pocket where he expected some small change. Sena tor Lodge brought out a gold match safe and a nail file. Then Hanna looked at Lodge. Lodge looked at Hanna, and both continued the search. Eventually, they produced 7 cents between them. The conductor, noting their Bilk tiles and the distinguished appearance of Lodge, hesitated, but finally readied for the 7 cents, with the comment, "I'll re member you, judge, and you can pay me the other three the next time you ride." "There will not be an extravagant river and harbor bill reported at this session," said Representative Burton, ton, chairman of the river and harbor committee. "It is entirely too edJly to even estimate what the total wllj be." The country at least will hope that It may be extremely small. Andrew Carnegie expects to arrange his $10,000,000 gift to the government for educational purposes so that It will be more than a tender of steel trust stock. Scores of people have been frozen to death in the present cold snap. The tenters in Oklahoma had a severe ex perience.

The girls have evident ly been improving in harmony since they ceased practicing on the furniture of the Instittulon." The city of Lisbon, Portugal, has re cently been subjectled to an unprece dented invasion of rats, which has dis ordered the domestic economy of every household and made life miserable. Cats were powerless to check the invaders poison seemed to act as a stimulant to their appetites, and traps only served to demonstrate the helplessness of man's Ingenuity to cope with the pest. At length the aid of the bacillus was In voked, and the municipal doctors were commissioned to inoculate some rats with an infectious disease. A suitable virus, harmless to man, was found, a few rats captured and inoculated, and then let loose. The bacillus triumphed. The rats sickened and died with won derful rapidity, and today Lisbon is celebrating the conquest of the vora cious rodent. W'' The mercury in the government ther mometer in Des Moines Saturday Indi cated 17 degrees below zero—the cold est December weather since 1886. Many people are now convinced that there is no difference between cold and coaled. They lead to the same result. John Higgins, a brakeman, who had both legs cut off in an accident near Emporia, Kas., last September, has made a rather curious settlement /with the railroad company. He is to be taught telegraphy at the company's ex pense, and is to have employment for life. He iB also to be provided with a pair of cork legs. It is probable that congress may try its hand at the Schley controversy.- The Mason City Dally Times-Herald has been transformed from four pages to eight pages and Improved in appear* ance.

"RESTORATION." 1 [New"York Commercial.] "Daniel," queried the portly prophet of a once-great Party, as the two sat at a small table in a secluded and cozy corner of the Princeton Inn's famous tap-room. "I trust, Daniel, that It didn't inconvenience you much to come over here today? There must be many and varied drafts on your time these days, Daniel?" "Yes, sire"—and the Instant effect of this affirmative is a shadow of distress athwart the features of the prophet. "I meant 'no' sire," explains Daniel, "that is, I meant 'no'—that it wasn't inconvenient for me to come: 'yes'— that there are many demands on my time nowadays." The face of the prophet brlfjjitens perceptibly. "Is this Scotch tipple quite to your liking, Daniel?" "Yes, sire." "And the cigar—how about that, Daniel "Out of sight, sire!" "Tell me, Daniel, of this man Roose velt. What think the people of him out in your great world?" "That he's all right, all right—most of "em." "Don't any of them think, Daniel, that he'll make some big blunder bye and bye—some fatal mistake of policy or statement or action—that will arouse a popular revolt against him and like enough break up Mark Hanna's great machine, and the whole party go to pieces with it?" "I've not of late gone up against any of that sort, sire. I do meet promi nent persons now and then who say that Teddy's good for another tetm all right, and who predict that his party will hang on for another twenty years, at least." "You'll be an old man then, Daniel." "Yes, sire, and you'll be a d—d Bight older!"—and the younger of the pair steals an impatient look at his watch while the prophet is relighting his cigar, mumbling meantime: "Tut-tut, Daniel, softly! You didn't use to swear. Yes, we are both 'no longer young.' Tell me, Daniel, did this man Roosevelt coin any phrase In his message quite equal to "innocuous desuetude'?" "No, sire, that was a corker." "Nothing quite up to my "condltion and-not-a-theory,' hey, Daniel?" "Nothing, sire, that was a crack-a Jack, sure!" "I don't quite admire those expres sions—they seem to rpe to lack dignity. But tell me, Daniel, was there aught in that Roosevelt affair that anywhere approached the positlveness of the ulti mata in my famous message of 1887?" "Nothing, sire. Teddy seems some how to have an absurd notion that he's the executive not the legislative branch of the government"—and the prophet thereat squirms a bit, but hides his confusion in a napkin as he resumes with: "I've been reading a good deal of late, Daniel, about the Charleses of England and Cromwell and the Res toration, and then thinking of our old party, Daniel, and its former leaders and principles and victories and all that, and then wondering whether or not—whether, Daniel, It might not be possible, you know, whether, whether— well, Daniel, don't you think this great country of ours is big enough to have a Restoration that would, of course, include you and"— "Hell, no, sire! Is that all? You might have asked me that at the start—and there comes my train!" The prophet finishes his "Scotch high" alone and then toddles over to his favorite alcove in the Princeton library, where anon he gets absorbed In the 'steenth volume of Carlyle's "Charles the second, and How Good He Felt After He Got Back."

The knight, us we know, Dad mado up his mind, and yet for a second he hesitat ed. There were stern, grim faces round him, changcd by tho 6tress of tho moment into the semblance of dark Baldwin's—tho faces of men, who, though they numbored but a dozen, were his men, bound to him by every tie of instinct and breeding and oustom, and he had been a soldier and know tho flerco joy of a desporato struggle against odds. Might it not be better, after ail? But then he remembered his wqmon kind, and, after all, why endanger th^so faithful mon? Ho raised bis voice and cried clearly: "I nccept your good offices, Sir Philip, and I tako your advioe. I will have the drawbridge lowered, only I beg you will keop your men well in hand and do my poor house as little damage aB may be." Giving Baldwin the ordor and bidding bim as soon as it was performed come to him, the knight walked steadily back into the courtyard and took his stand there. He dispatched the women and some of the servants to lay out a meal in the hall, but it was notlceablo that the men went reluctantly, and that all who could And any exause to do so lingered round Six Anthony as if they could not bear to aban don bim, as if, even at the last moment, thoy had some vague notion of protecting their master at all hazards. A score of lan terns shed a gloomy, uncertain light—• only in places re-enforced by the glow from tho hall windows—upon the group. Sel dom had a Coton moon peeped over the gables at a scene stranger than that which met the sheriff's eyes as with his two backers he passed under the gateway. "I surrender to you, Sir Philip," the knight said, with dignity, stepping for ward a pace or two, "and call you to wit nose that I might have made resistance and havo not. My tenants are quiet in their homes, and only my servants aro present Father Carey is not here nor In the house. This Is Baldwin Moor, my steward, but I beg for him your especial offices, since he has done nothing save by my command." "Sir Anthony, believe me that I will do all I can," tho sheriff responded gravely, "but"— "But to set at naught the queen's proc lamation and orderl" struck in a third volqe harshly—it was Sir Thomas Gre ville's—"and sbo but a month on the throne I For shame, Sir Anthony! It •macks to me of high treason. And many a man has suffered for less, lot me tell you." "Had she been longer on the throne," the sheriff put In more gently, "and were the times quiet, the matter would^bave been of less moment, Sir Anthony, and might not have become a state matter. But Just now"— "Things are in a perilous condition," Greville said bluntly, "and you have done your little to make them worse!" Tho knight, by a great effort, swallowed his rage and humiliation. "What will yon do with me, gentlemen?" he askod, spooking with at least the appearanoe of calmness. "That la to be seen," Greville said, roughly overriding hiscompanion. "For tonight yro must make ourselves and our mon comfortable here." "Certainly—with Sir Anthony's leave,' Sir Thomas Greville," quoth a voice from behind. "But only sol" More than one started violently, while the Cludde servants almost to a man spun round at the sound of tho voice—my voice, Francis Cludde's, though in the darkness no one know me. How shall I ever forget the joy and lively gratitude whloh filled my heart as I spoke, which turned the night into day and that fantastio scene of shadows into a festival, as I felt that tho ambition of tbo last four years was about, to be gratified? Sir Anthony, who was one of the first to turn, peered amoug tho servants. "Who spoke?" ho cried, a sud den dlsoompo.sure in his voice and manner. "Why spoko theref" "Aye, Sir Anthony, who did?" Greville said haughtily. "Somo one apparently who does not quite understand his placo or the state of affairs bore. Stand baok, my men, and let me soe bim. Perhaps we may teach bim a useful lesson." The oballenge was weloome, for I feared a scene and to be left face to face with my undo more tban anything. Now, as tho servants with a loud murmur of sur prise and recognition fell back and dis olosod me standing by Martin's side, 1 turned a littlo from Sir Anthony and faced Greville. "Not this time, I think, Sir Thomas,"I said, giving him back glance for glance. "I have learnod my lesson from somo who have fared farther and soen more than you, from men who have stood by their oause in foul weather •s well as fair, and were not for mass one day and a sermon the next." "What 1s this?" he cried angrily. "Who •re you?" "Sir Anthony Cludde's dutiful and lov Ing nephew," I answered, with a cour teous bow. "Come back, I thank heaven, In time to do him a service, Sir Thomas." "Master Franoisl Master Franois!" Clopton exclaimed in remonstrance. He bad known me in old days. My uncle meanwhile gazed at me in the utmost as tonishment, and into the servants' faces there flashed a strange light, while many of them hailed me in a tone which told me that I had but to give tho word, and they would fall on the very sheriff him self. "Master Francis," Sir Philip Clop ton repeatod gravely, "If you would do your undo a service, this is not the way to go about it He haR surrendered and is our prisoner. Brawling will not mend matters." I laughed out loudly and merrily. "Do you know, Sir Philip," I said, with some thing of the old boyish ring in my voioe, "I have been since I saw you last to Bel gium and Germany—aye, and Poland and Hamburg? Do you think I have come baok a fool?" "I do not know what to think of you," he replied dryly, "but you bad best"— "Keep a elvll tongue in your head, my friend," said Greville, with harshness, "and yourself out of this businessl" "It Is just this business I have come to get into, Sir Thomas," I answered with increasing good humor. "Sir Anthony, show them that!" I continued, and I drew out a little packet of parohment with a groat rod seol hanging from it by a green ribbon—just suoh a packet as that which I had stolen from the bishop's apparitor nearly four years baok. "A lantern here!" I cried. "Hold it steady, Martin, that Sir Anthony may read. Master Sheriff wants bis rere supper." I gave the packot Into the knight's band, my own shaking. Aye, shaking, for VjM n£t this t&e fulfillment of that boyish est* vow I bad made in my little room in the gable yonder, so many years ago? A ful fillment strange and timely, such as none but a boy in his teens could have hoped for, nor any but a man who had tried the chances and mishaps of the world could fully on joy as I was enjoying it. I tingled with the rush through my veins of tri umph and gratitudo. Up to the last mo ment I bad feared lest anything should go wrong, lest this crowning happiness should bo withhold from mo. Now I stood there smiling, watching Sir Anthony, as with trembling fingers he fumbled with the paper. And there was only one thing, only one person, wanting to my joy. 1 looked and looked again, but I could not anywhero see Potronilla. "What is it?" Sir Anthony said feebly, turning the packet over and over. "It is for tho shoriff—for the sheriff, is it not?" "He had bettor open It then, sir," I an swered gayly. Sir Philip took the paoket, and after a glance at the address tore it open. "It is an order from Sir William Cecil," he mut tered. Then ho ran bis eye down the brief contents, whllo all savo mysdf pricked their ears and pressed closor, and I looked swiftly from face to face as the wavering light lit up now one and now another— old familiar faces for the most part. "Sir Anthony, show them that!" "Well, Sir Philip, will you stop to sup per?" I cried, with a laugb, when he had had time, as I judged, to reach the signa ture. "Go to!" he grunted, looking at me. "Nice fools you have made of us, young man!" He passed the letter to Greville. "Sir Anthony," he continued, a mixture of pleasuro and chagrin in his voice, "you are free! I congratulate yon on your luck, four nephew has brought an amnesty for all things done up to the present time save for any life taken, In which case the mat ter is to be referred to the secretary. For tunately my dead horse is the worst of the mischief, so free you are and amnestied, though nlcdy Master Cecil has befooled us!" "We will give yon another horse, Sir Philip," I answered. But the words wore wasted on the air. They were drowned In a great shout of joy and triumph whioh rang from a soore of Cludde throats the moment the purport of the paper was understood—a shout which made the old- house shake-again and scared tbe dogs so that they fled away into corners and gazed askance at us, their tails between their legs, a shout that was plainly heard a mile away In half a dozen homesteads where Cludde men lay gloomy in their beds. By this time my nnole'a hand was In mine. With his other ho took off his hat. "Lads," he orled huskily, rearinc his tall form in our midst, "a cheer for the queen! God keep her safe, and long may she reign!" This was universally regarded as tbe end of what they still proudly call in those parts "the Coton Insurrection." When silenoe came again, every dog, even tbe oldest and wisest, had bayed himself hoarse and fled to kennel, thinking the end of tho world was come. My heart, as I joined roundly in, swelled high with pride, and there were tears in my eyes as well as in my nnole'a But there is no tri umph, after all, without its drawback, no fruition equal to the anticipation. Where was Petronilla? I could see her nowhere. I looked from window to window, but she^ was at none. I scanned the knot Of maids, but could not find her. Even tbe obeerlng bad not brought her out. It was wonderful, though, how the cheers oloared the air. Even Sir Thomas Greville regained good humor and deigned to shake me by the band and express him self pleased that the matter had ended so happily. Then the sheriff drew bim and Bridgewater away to look to their men's arrangements, seeing, I think, that my undo and I would fain be alone awhile, and at last I asked with a trembling voice after Petronilla. "To be sure," Sir Anthony answered, furtively wiping his eyes, "I had forgot ten her, dear lad. I wish now that she had staid. But tell me, Francis, how came you back tonight, and how did you manage this?" Something of what ho asked I told him hurriedly, but then—be sure I took ad vantage of tbe first opening—I asked again after Petronilla. "Where has she gono, sir?" I said, trying to conceal my impa tience. "I thought that Martin told me sho was here—indeed that he had seen her after I arrived." "I am not sure, do you know," Sir An tony answered, eying me absently, "that I was wise, but I considered she was safer away, Franois. And she can be fetohed back In tho morning. I feared there might bo some disturbance in the house, as In deed there well might have been, and though Bhe begged very bard to stay with me I sent her off." "This evening, sir?" I stammeced, sud denly ohilled. "Yes an hour ago." "But an hour ago every approach was guarded, Sir Anthony," I cried in sur prise. I had the greatest difficulty In slip ping through from the outside myself, well as I know every field and tree. To escape from within, even for a man, much less a woman, would have been Impossible. Sho will have been stopped." "1 think not," be said, with a smile at onco sage and indulgent, which seemed to add, "You think yourself a clever lad, but you do not know overytblng yet." "I sent her out by tbe secret passage to tbe millbouse, you see," he explained, "aB soon as I hoard the sheriff's party outside. I could havo given them the slip myself had I pleased." "Tho millbouse?" I answered. Tbe mill stood nearly a quarter of a mile from Co ton End, beyond the gardenB and in the direotion of the village. I remembered vaguely that 1 had heard from the serv ants in old days some talk of a secret out let leading from the house to it, but they know no particulars, and Its existence wai only darkly rumored among them. "You did not know of the passage," Sir Anthony said, ohnokllng at my astealsh ment "No I -remember, but tbe girl did. Your father and his wife went with her. Ho qulto agreed in the wisdom of sending her away, and indeed advised it. On reaching the mill, if they found all quiet, they were to walk across to Watncy's farm. There they could get horses and might ride at their leisure to Stratford and wait tho event. I thought it best foi her, and Ferdinand agreed." "And my father—went with her?" I muttered hoarsely, feeling myself growing chill to the heart. Hardly could I restrain my indignation at Sir Anthony's folly or my own angor and disappointment—and fear, for though my head seemed on fire, and there was a tumult in my brain, I was cool enough to trace olearly my fa ther's motives and discern with what a deliberate purpose he had acted. "He went with her?" Yes be and his wife," the knight an* swered, noticing nothing in his obtuse ll ess. "You have been fooled, sir," I said bit terly "My father you should have known, and, for his wife, she is a bad, unscrupu lous woman I Oh, tbe madness of it, to put my cousin into their hands!" "What do you mean?" tbe knight cried, beginning to tremble. "Your father Is a changed man, lad. He has come back to the old faltb, and in a dark hour too. He"— "He is a bypoorite and a villain!" I re torted, stung almost to madness by this wound in my tenderest place—stung In deed beyond enduranoe. Why should I spare bim, when to spare $lm was to sac rifice the Innooent? Why should I pick my words, When my love was in danger? He had had no mercy and no pity. Why should I shrink from exposing bim? Heaven had dealt with him patiently and given Aim life, and ho did but abuse it. could keep silepce no longer and told Sir Anthony all with a stinging tongue and in gibing words, even at last how my fa ther had given me a hint of the very plan he had now carried out of coming down to Coton and goading his brother into some,offense whioh might leave bis estate' at the mercy of the authoritlea. "I did not thiAk be meant it," I said bitterly. "But I might have known that tbe leopard does not change its spots. How you, who knew, bim years ago and knew that he bad plotted against yon since, came to trast him again—to trust your daughter to bim—passes my fancy.!*' "He was my brother," the knight mar mured, leaning white and stricken on mf shoulder.
