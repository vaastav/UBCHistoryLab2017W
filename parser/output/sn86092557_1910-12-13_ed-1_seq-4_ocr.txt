In order to minimize the number of packages (lost during the coming holiday season by the express companies the public has been asked to observe a number of very simple suggestions. If these are followed by the patrons of the express companies it will result in an advantage all-around. The instructions as to packing will apply equaly to the preparation-of mail as express packages and the carrying out of these instructions will injure the prompt delivery of gifts in good condition. . Here are some of the suggestions: First?Ship your packages .early, by the 18th of December If possible. The express company, will give you a small label to paste on. the package-.road|qg "Don't' opeii" until* Chrjstmas.' Thlb will insure .'"the .delivery ,*of the pa'okage before Christmas and give the additional pleasure to the recipient'of having it on Christmas morning. Second?Use wooden boxes for packing. GIbsb. or fragile articles should bo well,protected. It may cos: a few cents more, but the danger ol loss or damage is very much lessened, True, if the shipment is lost or dam aged, the express company will paj for it but that will give your friend no pleasure. Third?Write the address - in full, stating county, city, street and number on the box or pucknge with ink or crayon. Tags^are frequently torn off and lost. J.-uuii.ii?11 j-uu wuut to prepay uie charges, write the worfl "Paid' in large, plain lettqrs on the package. Fifth?Insist upon getting a receipt and see that the amount paid is marked on the receipt and package and the value of the package declared thereon. Sixth?Write your own address in full somewhere on the package follows ng the prefix "From." Inclose a card in each hox or package giving your and the consignee's address. Seventh?If not convenient to ship in wooden boxes, use strong wrapping paper, (not newspaper) and tie with a strong cord. Eighth ?If package contains anything-,of a perishable nature, write the word "Perishable' in large, plain letters on the- box, thus insuring special attention and first delivery. DR. ELIOT STUDIES SOCIALISM. After studying the returns of the recent election in which the Socialists made such a surprising showing, Dr. Charles W. Eliot, president eraorHub of Harvard University, became deeply interested in the subject ol Socialism and commenced a study oi the "cause and effect" as he terms it, In the course of his investigation this eminent scholar made a trip to Milwaukee, where he spent two days studying that city's socialist chiei executive, Mayor Seldel, his methods and the strength of his party. ~ ...1*1. 11-1 1 u.-u?;mct uuc gfelUCQ Willi" lll(? eiUl SS There's Jusit ( K Where I Kn ^ Exactly wh ^K;# When you hear tliat i ^ granted'the -speaker meai Whatever you want I ? 1} l,ad here?we haven't gc SE There's never a fear of <] to? jvhat you ask for or what Ipfe have, or you get nothing? l!jj5 just as good" here, becaus (hLB .

The majority of . citizens; there, ..bow?: ever, were disgusted ^wlfh. the ad^niik lstration of affairs 'in- their city. "No one knows in Milwaukee, for example, whether the Socialists believe in the private ownership of property. Ndthing Is said about It, nor is anything said concerning the weakening of the family ties which would result from the. complete , socialistic I theory.
