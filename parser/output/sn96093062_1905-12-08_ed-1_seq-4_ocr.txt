Telephone No. 71. DURANT, I. T., DEC. 8,' i005 A TERRIBLE .ti NEMESIS. A dispatoh from Ban ifuan Bays that when Nan Paiterdon heard that District Attprnoy Jerome had boon re-oleotod she beoame hysterical and could not bo com forted, . The Florodora girl who figured in throe trials for the murder of 'JCnesarMYoung and ia at lib erty under suspended sentenoo, is4 said to bo a nervous wrook. With her husband sho is in Porto Rico seeking quiet. But time and soolusion fail to bring rest to ono who is tired at BOUl. fn the Bhadow of a oharge of murder there is no peaoe. The fact that any time upon her return to tho United States Jerome may resume his prosecu tion of hor hounds her continu ally. Alienated indeed front hor own land and from peace is bIio who has the law, oven jt bo perverted, againBt her. Restless is one above whose head justice hangs, like tho sword of Damocles, suspended by a slender thread. Comfortless ia the ono whofe own conscience is a ooasoless torment. Poor Nanl She is learning tho old, old lesson that there are things worse than death that the name of liberty is' a mookery when tho soul ia imprisoned for life in the gloom of 'remorse and fear. N Prorti'iont Root-ovHi s mosfago to Confess, as printo I in tho metropolitan papors is a most ox hauBtivo dooument, fillinc- twen ty-seven closoly printod columns. Ho bogins by saying that tho pooplo of this country continue to enjoy Croat prosperity. As to trusts, ho argues that their regu lation oan only be offoctivoly ex ercised by federal superviei n, and in quoting his words: "Un til tho national govornmont ob tains in sumo mannor whioh the wisdom of the congress may sug gest proper control over tho big corporations engaged in inter state commerce that is, over tho great majority of tho big corpo rations it will bo impossible to deal adequately with theso evils." Leaving tho trusts ho takes up tho railroad rate question. ' Ho admits tho difficulties of proposed legislation, but advisoa tho crea tion of an administrative body with power to revise evil charges. "If givon to tho present int'er Btato commorco commission or to a reorganized interstate oota- morco commission, such commis sion should bo mado uneauivb oally administrative."

All other stunts were same aa usual. Tho assertion that tho Italians that are locating in Texas are going to vote the Republican ticket, is another proof that Cecil Lyon has not lived in vin If people looking for a loca tion in Durant cannot find housos for ront it is certain they cannot make their homes hero. Tho only solution to this question is for some ono to construct a num ber of cottages which they can rent at reasonable tates. Doit now. firm ia Vinnrilnrl foorlnaaUr art A comprehensively. Undor tho head, "Problems of Labor," he tiealB with injunc tions, child employment and wo men who work. Ho rocommi-nds a remedy to prevent tho employ ment of ohild labor. Thero are, he says, 5,000,000 American wo men engaged in various ocoupa tions, and he would throw every safeguard possible around them, protecting them in thoir rights to gain an honest livelihood, but in his argument says : "Tho intro duction of women into industry is working change and disturb ance in the domestio and social life of tho nation. The deorease in marriago, and especially in tho birth rate, has been ooin- oident with it." His "square deal" policy cov ers great soope and is worth while reading. In it ho deals with olass spirit, insurance, state supervision, etc As to tho re vision of tho revenues ho points out the need of stability rather than any attempt to attain per fection. Tho. question of poaco ocoupies muoh space, and in this ho points out what should and should not bo done to maintain peace between nations without sacrifice of honor. A ploa for tho ratification of the treaty now pending with San Domingo, the importance of naval training, and Chinese immigration are treated at length, and after ad vising congress to pass legisla tion for the aid of the Pnillip pinos he proceeds to knock the Separate State idea into a cooked hat, by advising immediate state hood fur Oklahoma and Indian Territory jointly. Ho concludes his message with a dissertation upon tho Panama canal, und upon the improvement of our consular service. In some respects thiB is a most lomarkablo message to congroBS, but then it comes from a most remarkable man. ; I recommend that Indian Territory and Okla- homa be admitted'as one state and that New Mexico and Arizona be admitted as one state. There is no obligation upon, us to x treat territorial subdivisions. of convenience only, as binding us on the question of admission to statehood.' Noth ing has taken up more time in the congress during the past few years than the question as to the state hood to be granted to the four territories above 1 mentioned, and after carefui consideration of all that has been developed in the discussion of the question, I recommend that they be immediately admitted as two states. There is no justification 'for further delay, and the advisability of making the four territories into two states has been clearly established. ---Theodore Roosevelt. of all kinds and in all varieties at prices to please. i ' i ' Make this store" your ffl A Gun or Rifle for the small boy.
