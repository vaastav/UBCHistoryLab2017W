PRESIDENT TAFT SENDS !N FINAL MESSAGE President Starts With Discussion of Foreign Relations. WORK DONE OY DIPLOMATS. Recogniton of Merit System Has Been Beneficial — Suggestions Regarding Changes In the Tariff Laws Designed to Aid Commerce —Turkish War and Troubles In China. To the Senate and House of Kepre seutatives: The foreign relations of the United ' States actually and potentially affect , the state of the Union to a degree not widely realized and hardly surpassed f by any other factor In the welfare of j the whole nation. The position of the j United States in the moral. Intellec tual and material relations of tlie fam ily of nations should be a matter of vital interest to every patriotic citi zen. The national prosperity and power impose upon us duties which we cannot shirk if we are to be true to our ideals. The tremeudous growth of the ex- IHjrt trade of the United States has already made that trade a very real factor In the Industrial and commer cial prosperity of the country. With the development of our industries the foreign commerce of the United States must rapidly become a still more essential factor in its economic welfare. The relations of the United States with all foreign powers remain upon a sound basis of peace, harmony and friendship. A greater insistence upon Justice to American citizens or inter ests wherever it may have been denied and a stronger emphasis of the need of mutuality in commercial and other re lations have only served to strengthen our friendship with foreign countries by placing those friendships upon a firm foundation of realities as well as aspirations. Reorganization of State Department. At the beginning of the present ad ministration the United States, having fully entered upon its position as a world power, with the responsibilities thrust upon it by the results of the Spanish-American war and already en gaged In laying the groundwork of n vast foreign trade upon which it should one day become more and more dependent, found Itself without the machinery for giving thorough atten tion to and taking effective action upon a mass of Intricate business vi tal to American Interests in every coun try in the world. The department of state was an archaic and Inadequate machine, lack ing most of the attributes of the for eign office of any great modern power. With an appropriation made upon my recommendation by the congress on ! Aug. 5, 1900, the department of state ' was completely reorganized. There were created divisions of Latin-Ameri can affairs and of far eastern, near eastern and western European affairs. The law offices of the department were greatly strengthened. There were added forelnrn trade advisers to co-op erate villi tlio diplomasic and consular bureaus anil the politico-geographical divisions in the Innumerable matters where commercial diplomacy or con sular work cnlls for such special knowledge. The same officers, together with the rest of the new organization, are able at ail times to give to Ameri can citizens accurate Information as to conditions In'foreign countries with •which they have business and likewise to co-operate more effectively with the congress and also with the other ex ecutive departments. Merit System In Consular and Diplo matic Corps. Expert knowledge and professional training must evidently be the essence cr'; l:lt reorganization. Without a train ed !'<ire!"it serWce there would not be ii ."i » . .i lb!.- for the work in the reor j,! • ! tf'<;i'irtment of state. President i ' t \i: 1 had taken the first step to- v ';>l lii*Ta-.lit:'ii!K the merit system In scrvice. That had been fol t ■' "1 b.- tl.e application of the merit principle, with excellent results to the entire consular branch. Almost noth ing, however, had been done in this di rection with regard to the diplomatic service. In this age of commercial di plomacy it was evidently of the first importance to train an adequate per i sonnel in that branch of the service. Therefore, on Nov. 26, 1900, by an executive order I placed the diplomatic service up to the grade of secretary of embassy, Inclusive, upon exactly the same strict nonpartisan basis of the merit system, rigid examination for ap pointment and promotion only for effi ciency, as bad been maintained with out exception In the consular service. Msrit and Nonpartisan Character of Appointments. How faithful to the merit system and how nonpartisan has been the con duct of the diplomatic and consular services In the last four years may be j Judged from the following: Three am bassadors now serving held their pres ent rank nt the beginning of toy ad ministration. Of the ten ambassadors whom I have appointed five were by promotion from the rank of minister. Nine ministers now serving hold their present rank at the beginning of the administration. Of the thirty ministers whom I have appointed, eleven were promoted from the lower grades'of tfie foreign service or from the department of state. Of the nineteen missions in Latin-America, where our relations are close and our Interest is great, fifteen chiefs of mission are service men, three having entered the service during this administration. The thirty-seven secretaries of em bassy or legation who have received tlieir Initial appointments after passing successfully the required examination were chosen for ascertained fitness, without regard to political affiliations. A dearth of candldotes from southern and westeAi states has alone.made it impossible thus far completely to equal ize all the states' representations In the foreign service. In thg effort to equalize the representation of the va rious states in the consular service I have made sixteen of the twenty-nine new appointments as consul which have occurred during my administra tion from the southern states. This is 55 per cent. Every other consular ap pointment mode. Including the promo tion of eleven young men from the con sular assistant and student Interpreter corps, has been by promotion or trans fer, based solely upon efficiency shown In "the service. Larger Provision For Embassies and Legations Recommended. In connection with legislation for the amelioration of the foreign service, I wish to invite attention to the advisa bility of placing the salary appropria tions upon a better basis. 1 believe that the best results would be obtained by a moderate scale of salaries, with adequate funds for the expenses of proper representation, bused In each ense upon the scale and cost of living ; at each post, controlled by a system of accounting and under the general di rection of the department of state. In line with the object which 1 have sought of placing our foreign service on n basis of permanency, 1 have at various times advocated provision by congress for the acquisition of govern ment owned buildings for the residence and offices of our diplomatic officers, so as to place them more nearly on an equality with similar officers of other uations and to do away with the dis crimination which otherwise must nec essarily be made In some cases In favor of men having large private fortunes. Diplomacy a Handmaid of Commercial Intercourse and Peace. The diplomacy of the present ad ministration has sought to respond to modern ideas of commercial Inter course. This policy has been charac terized as substituting dollars for bul lets. It Is one that appeals alike to Idealistic humanitarian sentiments, to the dictates of sound policy and strat egy and to legitimate commercial aims. It is au effort frauUy directeij 

ABERDKCN, WASHINGTON. THURSDAY, OICIMIt* ft. 1111. :o He InrronSF rtr AmCTTrfflT trade upon the axiomatic principle that the gov ernment of the United States shall ex tend all proper support to every legiti mate and beneficial American enter prise abroad. How great have been the results of tills diplomacy, coupled will the m inimum and minimum pro vision of tHe tariff law, will be seen by some consideration of the wonder ful increase in the export trade of the United States Because modern di plomacy is commercial there has been a disposition in some quarters to at tribute to it none but materialistic aims. How strikingly erroneous is such an impression may lie seen from a study of the results by which the diplomacy of the United States can be judged. Successful Efforts In Promotion of Peace. Jii tin- field of work toward the Ideals of peace this government negotiated, l>nt to my regret was unable to con summate, two arbitration treaties which set the highest mark of the asp'ratlou of nations toward the sub si ianion of arl>itration and reason for war in the settlement of international disputes. Through the efforts of American diplomacy several wars have been prevented or ended. I re fer to the successful tripartite media tion of the Argentine Republic, Bra zil, and the United States between Peru and Ecuador, the bringing of the boundary dispute between Panama and Costa Rica to peaceful arbitra tion; the staying of warlike prepara tions when Haiti and the Dominican Itenublic were on the verge of hostil ities; the stopping of a war in Nicara gua; the halting of internecine strife in Honduras. The government of the United States whs thanked for its influence toward the restoration of amicable re lations between the Argentine Republic and Bolivia, The diplomacy of the United Slates is active in seeking to assuage the remaining ill feeling be tween this country and the republic of Colombia. In the recent civil war in China tliff United States successfully joined with the other interested powers In urging an early cessation of hostili ties. An agreement has been reached between the governments of Chile and Peru whereby the celebrated Tacua- Arica dispute, which has so long em bittered international relations on the west coast of South America, has at List been adjusted. Simultaneously Mine the news that the boundary dis pute between Peru and Ecuador had entered upon a stage of amicable set tlement. In China the policy of encouraging financial investment to enable that country to help itself has had the result of giving new life and practical appli cation to the open door policy. The consistent purpose of the present ad ministration has been to encourage the use of American cupital in the develop ment of China by the promotion of those essential reforms to which China Is pledged by treaties with the United States and other powers. The hypothecation to forelrn bankers fn coflriecilon with certain industrial enterprises, such as the Hukuang rail ways, of the national revenues upon which these reforms depended, led the department of state early in the admin istration to demand for American citi zens participation in such enterprises, In order that the United States might have equal rights and an equal voice in all questions pertaining to the disposi tion of the public revenues concerned. The same policy of promoting inter national accord among the powers hav ing similar treaty rights as ourselves In the matters of reform, which could not be put into practical effect without the common consent of all, was likewise adopted in the case of the loan desired by China for the reform of its cur rency. The principle of international co-operation in matters of common in terest upon which our policy hod al ready been based in all of the above in stances has admittedly been a grent factor in that concert of the powers which has been so happily conspicuous during the perilous period of transition through which the great Chinese nation has been passing. Central America Needs Our Help In Debt Adjustment. In Central America the aim has been to help such countries as Nicaragua and Honduras to help themselves. They are the Immediate beneficiaries. The national benefit to the United States is twofold. First, it is obvious that the Monroe doctrine is more vital in the neighborhood of tlie Panama canal and tiie ■/.0110 of the Caribbean than any where else. There, too, the mainte nance of that doctrine falls most heav ily upon (lie United States. It is there fore essential that the countries within that sphere shall be removed from the jeopardy involved by heavy foreign debt and chaotic national finances and from the ever present danger of inter national complications due to disorder at home. Hence the United States has been glad to encourage and support Ameri can bankers who were willing to lend a helping hand to the financial re habilitation of such countries because this financial rehabilitation and the protection of their custom houses from being the prey of would be dictators would remove at one stroke the men ace of foreign creditors and the men ace of revolutionary disorder. I wish to call your especial attention to the recent occurrences In Nicaragua, for I believe the terrible events re corded there during the revolution of the past summer—the useless loss of life, the devastation of property, the bombardment of defenseless cities, the killing and wounding of women and children, the torturing of noncomlmt ants to exact contributions and the suffering of thousands of human be ings—might have been averted had the department of state, through approval of tlifl loan convention by the senate, been permitted to carry out Its now well developed policy of encouraging the extending of financial aid to weak Central American states with the pri mary objects of avoiding Just such revolutions by assisting those repub lics to rehabilitate their finances, to establish their currency on a stable basis, to remove the custom houses from the danger of revolutions by ar ranging for their secure administra tion, and to establish reliable banks. I wish to congratulate the officers and men of the United States navy and marine corps who took part In re-estab- China. UstrliiT nhtoi Iti "JffctfSjhiA ttpoh their splendid conduct and to record with sorrow the death of seven American marines and bluejackets. Since the re establishment of peace and order elec tions have been held amid conditions of quiet and tranquillity. Nearly all the American marines have now been withdrawn. Our Mexican Policy. For two years revolution and counter revolution have distraught the neigh boring republic of Mexico. Brigandage hns Involved a great deal of depreda tion upon foreign Interests. There have constantly recurred questions of ex treme delicacy. On several occasions very difficult situations have arisen on our frontier. Throughout tills trying period the policy of the United States has been one of patient noninterven tion, steadfast recognition of constitut ed authority in the neighboring na tion and the exerti.nl of every effort to care for American interests. I pro foundly hope that the Mexican nation may soon resume the path of order, prosperity and progress. To that na tion in its sore troubles the sympa thetic friendship of the United States has been demonstrated to a high de gree. There were in Mexico at the begin ning of the revolution some 30,000 or 40,000 American citizens engaged in enterprises contributing greatly to the prosperity of that republic and also benefiting the important trade between the two countries. The Investments of American capital in Mexico has been estimated at $1,000,000,000. The respon sibility of endeavoring to safeguard those Interests and the dangers Insep arable from propinquity to so turbulent a rftnation have been great, but 1 am happy to have been able to adhere to tlie policy above outlined—a policy which I hope may soon be justltted by tlie complete success of the Mexican people in regaining the blessings of peace and good order. Agricultural Credits. A most important work accomplished In the past year by the American dip lomatic officers In Europe Is the inves tigation of Ihe agricultural credit sys tem in the European countries. Both as a means to afford relief to the con sumers of this country through a more thorough development of agricultural resources and as a means of more suffi ciently maintaining the agricultural population, the project to establish credit facilities fur the ''iirmers Is a concern of vital importance to this na tion. No evidence of prosperity among well established farmers should blind us to the fact that lack of capital is prevent ing a development of the nation's agri cultural resources and an adequate in crease of the land under cultivation; that agricultural production Is fast full ing behind the increase lu population and that, in fact, although these well established farmers are maintained In Increasing prosperity because of the natural increase in population, we are not developing the industry of agricul ture. Advantage of Maximum and Minimum Tariff Provision. The importance which our manufac tures have assumed In the commerce of the world In competition with the manufactures of other countries again draws attention to the duty of this .government to use Its utmost endeav ors to se in o Impartial treatment for American i n duels In all markets. Healthy commercial rivalry In Interna tional lnteri ourse Is best assured by the possession of proper means for 'Protecting rial promoting our foreign trade. It is 11 aural that competitive countries sl.nn'd view with some con cern this steady expulsion of our com merce. If in S4i:ve Instances the meas ures taken by them to meet it are not entirely equitable a remedy should be found. In former messages I have described the negotiations of the department of state with foreign governments for the adjustment of the maximum and mini mum tariff as provided In section 2 of the tariff law of 11)01). The advantages secured by the adjustment of our trade relations under this law have contin ued during the last year, and some ad ditional cases of discriminatory treat ment of which we had reason to coin plain have been removed. The depart ment of state lias for the tll'st time in the history of this country obtained substantial most-fa voj'ed nation treat ment from all the countries of the world. There are. however, other Instances which, while apparently not constitut ing undue discrimination In the sense of section 2, are nevertheless excep tions to the complete equity of tariff treatment Cor American products that the department of state consistently has sought to obtain for American commerce abroad. Necessity Fur Supplementary Legisla tion. These developments confirm the opin ion conveyed to you In my annual mes sage of 1011. that while the maximum and minimum provision of the tariff law of 

IDOSI li.-is been fully justified by the success achieved in removing pre viously existing undue discriminations against American products, yet experi ence lias shown ttint this feature of the law should be amended In such way as to provide a fully effective means of meeting the varying degrees of discriminatory treatment of Ameri can commerce In foreign countries still encountered, as well as to protect against Injurious treatment on the part of foreign governments through either legislative or administrative measures the financial Interests abroad of Ameri can citizens whose enterprises enlarge the market for American commodities. I cannot too strongly recommend to the congress the passage of some such enabling measure as the bill which was recommended by the secretary of state In his letter of I»ee. 13. 11)11.' The ob ject of the proposed legislation is. in brief, to enable the executive to apply, as the case may require, to any or all commodities, whether or not on the free list from a country which discrim inates against the United States, a graduated scale of duties up to the maximum of U"> per cent ad valorem provided in the present law. Flat tariffs are out of date. Nations no longer accord equal tariff treatment to all other nations irrespective of the treatment from them received. Such a flexible power at the command of the executive would verve to moderate any A 

WOMAN'S GOOD LOOKS Depend on her general health and freedom from pain. Many a woman 100 l old before her time because of those irregularities which are essentially fem.-.ina. Starting from early womanhood, she suffers from frequently recurring deranges enta that upset her womanly health. If she be beautiful she grows into that m. low age without wrinkles and crowfeet about the eyes or the blue circles underr< ath. It is invariably the rule that such women suffer little, or not at all, from worn -.nly derangements which sap the health and leave in the face the tell-tale story of pcin and suffering. Dr.R.V. Pierce,the famous specialist in the diseases of women, found a prescription in his early practice that soothed the organism peculiar to w -man hood —oiled the machinery, as it were, of the human system—and helped the v nan to pass those painful periods that scar-lined and aged her face. This remedy K ime the well-known Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription, th«. has benefited thousands of women and saved them from m .-ry and suffering at different periods in life. unfavorable tendencies on the part of those countries from which tlie impor tations into the United States are sub stantially confined to articles on the free list as well as of the conn tries which find a lucrative market In the United States for their products under existing custom rates. It is very neces sary that the American government should be equipped with weapons of negotiation adopted to modern econom ic conditions in order that we may at all times be in a position to gain not only technically Just but actually equit able treatment for our trade and also for American enterprises and vested In terests abroad. Business Secured to Our Country by Direct Official Effort. As illustrating the commercial bene fits to the nation derived from the new diplomacy and its effectiveness upon the material as well as the more ideal side, it may be remarked that through direct official efforts alone there have been obtained In the course of this administration contracts from foreign governments involving an expenditure of $50,000,000 in the factories of the United States. It Is germane to these observations to remark that in the two years that have elapsed since the successful negotia tion of our new treaty with Japan, which at the time seemed to present so many practical difficulties, our export trade to that country has increased at the rate of over $1,000,000 a month. Our esports to Japan for the year end ed June 30, 1910, were $21,959,310, while for the year ended June 30, 1912, the exports were $53,478,040, a net In crease in the sale of American prod ucts of nearly 150 per cent. The net adopted at the last session of congress tw give effect to the fur seal convention of July 7, Mil, between Great Britain, Japan, Russia and the United States provided for the sus pension of all land killing of seals on the Pribilof Islands for a period of five years, and an objection has now been presented to this provision by the other parties in Interest, which raises the issue as to whether or not this prohibition of land killing is inconsist ent with the spirit if not the letter of tUe treaty stipulations.
