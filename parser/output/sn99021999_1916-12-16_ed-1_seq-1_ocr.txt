TEUTONS PIERCE ' ROUMANIAN LINE Capture of Town of Buzeu En dangers Russian Defenses in Carpathians and Oalicia. ..... p,W-V.-.l FLANK - MOVES PGSJjrftLfc. (AMw!at4- Pmw War SmsiimtM ;y Possible serious consequences not only for the Roumanians' but for the Russians are implied in today's an nouncement from, Berlin of the cap ture of the Roumanian town of Buzeu. Military writers have largely assumed it to be the Russo-Roumanian inten tion to make a defensive stand along the line of the Buzeu river, running in a general easterly direction not far from the southern border of Moldavia, Roumania's northern province. ' If the taking of Buzeu, as appears, breaks this important defensive line, the whole Russo-Roumanian line along the western Moldavian moun tains seems endangered by flanking. Stress has been laid by military commentators on the importance pf this line to. the Russians, as it has been pointed to as one necessary to be held if the Russian front in the southern Carpathians and even in Ga licia was to be preserved. Moreover, it has been indicated the falling back of the Russian front northward in Moldavia beyond the mouth of the Danube at Galata would open Bessa rabia to possible invasion by the Teu tonic armies. Berlin reports an abortive offensive by the French in the Verdun region. Attacks made in attempts to retake the positions lost by the French on Hill 304, west of the Meuse, were re pulsed, it is declared, as were assaults on German positions pn Pepper, ridge and near Fort llardaumont, east ol he river. 1 Says Villa Ready To Hold Out Olive !

The first regulation provides that a consignee may h&vei the usual two days to unload car.' and that there after demurrage shall be charged at the rate' of $1 for the first day, $2 for the second, $3 for the third, and $5 for the fourth and each succeeding day. ileretofore'the charge has been uniformly $1 day, and many con signees, notably automobile concerns and coal dealers, are declared to have been glad to permit shipments to stand for lonir oeriods because the penalty was so small that it com'' pared lavoranly with warcnouse charges. . ' Car Rental Raised. Another order increases the daily rental paid by railroads to each other for cars from 45 to 75 cents per car, or about 70 per cent. Some eastern roads are said to have from 5,000 to 10,000 foreign can of a single type. The order is expected to make serious difficultie lor some small roads which I never liave had sufficient equipment of their own. ' Foreign cars on congested roads are said to have come almost wholly from southern and western roads. Reports to the Interstate Commerce commis sion show that they glut the railroad yards and sidings of most eastern lines and many in the middle west. The trend of traffic, because of the European demand for American goods, has been overwhelmingly to ward eastern seaports. Further consideration of the prob lem presented by the shortage of cars is the subject of a conference here to day of officials of eastern roads. A Hireling of some of the chief shippers of the country will be held here next week. their coi.ntry, and that it will dry up oncf the sources of national wealth.

Riemain, secretary of the Anti- Alcohol league, says the prom, ltion measure will not injure the saloon keepers, but, on the other hand, will benefit them, as they would get small profit with the doubled taxes on spir its, while the sale ot wine, beer, cider, tea and coffe- will yield handsome re turns.

It is understood to be substantially the same as lie Gcr man and Austrian notes. Washington, Dec. 15. President WTfor. probably will not finally de termine on any formal steps in con nection w.th the peace proposals ot the centra' power;, until after David Lloyd George, the British ,jrime min ister, has f,.okcu in the House of Commons Tuesday. In th m.antime, through the American diplomatic representatives in the capitals of the entente powers, the American government will keep in close touch with the situation. No formal comm.... was forthcom ing today either from the White House or the State departmei.t. It is' known to be the view of most of the cabinet members that the Amer ican government should move cau tiously and do nothing to imperil ' if influence for peace. f. .iWffl Forward Note Todsy.y Secretary Lansing early today held his fust personal conference with President Wilson since the peace pro posals of the central powers were made public. It was saiJ the formal notes from Germany and Austria might go forward before night, and necessarily, in view of the probability that tlie president would take no in dependent action until after Lloyd George has spoken in the Hoi.'.c of Commons, they probably will be ac-companietr- only by formal notes of transmittal.

President Wilson is known to at tach great importance tov the possi 'nility of establishing an association of nations to maintain peace He outlined in definite terms the proce dure he would take in initiating a peace movement in the course of a speech delivered here last May before the League to Enforce Peace. At that Une the president said: ' "If it fthnntrl pvnt hn nur nri,i!r,rr to suggest or initiate the movement for peace among the nations at war, I am sure that the people of the United States would wish their gov ernment to move along these lines: "First, such a settlement with re gard to their own immediate inter ests as the belligerents may agree upon. We have nothing material of any kind to ask for ourselves and are quite aware that we are in 110 sense or degree parties' to the present quar rel. Our interest is only in, peace and its future guarantees. Security of the Sea. "Second, a universal association of the nations to maintain the inviolate security of the highways of the seas for the common and unhindered use of all the nations of the world and to prevent any war begun either con trary to treaty covenants or without warning, and full submission of the causes to the opinion of the world, a virtual guarantee of territorial in tegrity and political independence."
