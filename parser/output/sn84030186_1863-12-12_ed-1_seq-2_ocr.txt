..4 l) t Vinton,. 1 Junction City, Kansas, SA.TTTRr)A.Y, DEC. 12, 1863. THE BIGHT OF VOLUNTEERS TO VOTE. Wc published, two weeks ago, an article on this subject written by Hon. Kobert McBrat ney for the Leavenworth Coiitervathe, and which, wcpiesume, has been read by most of 4he reading men of the State by this time. We have been aware for some time past that Mr. MclJratney held the view of the Constitu tion set forth in the aiticle, and have frequent ly urged him to make public his conviction upon the subject, but inasmuch as the weight of legal opinion, legislative opinion, Guberna torial opinion and newspaper opinion was committed in favor of the necessity of an amendment of the Constitution, he was reluct ant to do so. The aiticlo was finally written at our solicitation, and wc confess that we have marked with no little interest the effect' which its masteily exposition of the true intent and meaning of a rather foggy provision of- our State Constitution is having upon public opinion, so far as such opinion can be gathered by private conversations of patriotic citizens and newspaper discussions; and we confess to no liftlc gratification at the very general ac quiescence in the views expressed in the ai ti de ; and we were beginning to congratulate ourselves upon the prospect of the passage of a law, by the in-coming Legislature, without se rious opposition, -which should remove from our young State the reproach of disfranchising Hie best and most patriotic portion of our fellow-citizens, for no other offence than a mani festation of the most exalted patriotism which it Is in the power of man to put foith, viz: the offer if their lives in defence of their country and her institutions. That the views expressed were unanimously adopted wedonot pretend to say. Copperheads and secession sympathisers those who regard our volunteers as the " mercenary hirelings of Abe Lincoln," and as '' Abolition cut-throats and thieves," those who, in the event of an amendment of the Constitution being proposed, to enable sol diers to Wc, would vote unanimously against it, were disgusted and scandalized at the sug gestion that no amendment was needed, and turned up their indignant noses in sublime contempt at the ' weak logic' with which the suggestion was sustained. The opposition of euch men, however, was expected ; they con stitute of themselves a Xazereth from which aio good or patriotic thing can proceed; and their hostility in no way disturbed the gratifi cation w hich we felt in the general concurrence of tiuly patriotic men. Under these circumstances we hear of dis Fcnt from an influential and undoubtedly pat riotic quarter, with no little surprise and no little regret. That dissent comes from no less a personage than the Executive of the State, Governor Carney himself. "Wc understand that whilst at Manhattan last week, he took occasion to refer (o the article of Mr. McBrat n3', to express his non-concurrence in the views of the aiticle, and to Teitcrate thedoc trinc of his message, that the Constitution must be amended to enable our citizen-soldicjs to exercise the elective franchise. Wc -were fully aware of the position, taken by his Ex--. ccllcncy last winter upon this subject, but we trusted that the position had been taken without much investigation of the subject, to be modified by reason and reflection. In this, it seems, wc wc'R mistaken : it seems the position of his Excellency was deliberately taken, and will be maintained by him. In short, that an amend ment of the Constitution is an Administration uicasuic, and will be urged with all the force and influence of the Governor. And those who know Governor Carney, know with what ligor, energy and ability he urges and enforces measures upon which he sets his hcait. The knowledge of hjs potency in matters of this kind leads us almost to despair of the success of justice to our volunteers. We jcpeat our regret that this measure of justice has to en counter his opposition ; and this regret arises not from any "pride of position ,: which ire foel in the matter, but from the flagrant wrong to our brave volunteers in the field who are cheated and defrauded of their Tights. We can only say that we are satisfied that we are fully convinced that .our State Constitution in terposes no barrier to our State Volunteers exer--cising the right of suffrage, and whilst -we shall accord to others the right to entertain such views as may suit "them upon the subject, we shall exert ourselves, editorially and other wise, to securest the next session of the Leg lature, the passage of an act to enable our Toluntecrs to vote, wherever they may- be. m . . . .

KANSAS GREAT MEN. -. Any one who. should make' up his Bind from what the Leavenworth dailies say, more or lessj echoed by other Kansas -weekly-papers, of oar Kansas great men, could not help but conclude that we are truly hard run for material out of which to fill our highest State, Judicial, and Congressional offices. At the time when our first Senatorial election was pending, the Con servative asserted and attempted to prove that General Pomeroy was a thief, so mean as to steal the generous contributions of the charitable of other States to save from suffering and starvation the men, women, and children of Kansas. At the same time, other; papers of the State were engaged in proving -that General Lane and M. J. -Parrott were still worse, and no more worthy of confidence. But that was child's play in comparison with the "battle of stink pots" now in progress, wherein the Leavenworth Conservative is the champion of one side, and the Leavenworth Times sustains the other. The origin of, the fusa grew out of a suspicion that some one felt, or thought he felt, that somebody else intended this winter to bring on an election to filla vacancy to occur in the office of United States Senator some timo during the jear 16G5. Just who it was who started this moving aud damaging suspicion no one now appears to have the remo test idea. All parties disclaim and seout the suggestion, yet the fuss goes on, and the' fight; the blood .spirts, the fur flies, and the whole air is redolent of a putrescent odorthathasin it none of the savor of brimstone. Jim Lane, Cart. Wil der, Mark Delahay, and Sid Clark, are the vic tims upon whom the blows fall, aimed from the Times ; whilst the men at whom the Conserva tive aims are Tom Carney and John C. Vaughan. Gen. Lane is one of our United States Senators ; Mr. Wilder is our Member of the House of Rep resentatives ; Mr.DelahayisUnited States Judge for the District of Kansas ; Mr. Clark is U. S. Provost Marshal of Kansas, Nebraska, fcc; Mr. Carney is Governor of Kansas; Mr. Vaughan was recently Military Store Keeper at Fort Leav enworth, and holds also, we undei stand, the position of Captain of Ordnance in the United States service. According to the Times, Lane is a murderer, a liar, a libertine, a coward, a bri gand ; Wilder is a weak, imbecile creature, who had to employ others to write his speeches, and is the mere tool and toady of Lane; Delahay is totally unfit by nature and from want of qualifi cations, to discharge the duties of Judge ; Mr. Clark is a mere " lightning rod pedler," who has been guilty of fleecing and robbing soldiers of their hard earnings. According to the Conser vative, Mr. Carney is a " political shyster," who never contributed a dollar of money or an hour of time to the advancement of the Republican cause, till he conceived the idea of getting into office ; a successful speculator in the necessities of refugee loyal Indians ; who owes his position to his money, which he has and is still willing to spend like water to buy his way to positions which he could never reach relying upon his talents, or his intelligence; a mere political jackdaw, strutting and swelling with messages, lectures, and speeches, written for him by John C. Vaughan, whom, with his money, his whisky and segars. he has metamorphosed into a kind of domestic Mephistophiles, to aid him in his low cunning and vaulting ambition ; whilst the said John C. Vaughan is himself a drawer of money from the Government under the false prentense of services which he never rendered, a hypocrit ical mouther of wrtucs and decencies that lie never possessed, u liar, a drunkard, an adulterer, a low mercenary scribbler, who, like the old Swiss trooper, is ready to lend his pen and his abilities to any aspiring demagogue, who will pny him a stipend, and keep him in whisky aud segars. This is the picture of our Kansas public men, as painted by their opponents nay, we bee pardon as limned aud painted by themselves for these men, be it remembered, are all of one patty are all Republicans and no single Cop perhead pencil has given tone or color to a single line of the picture. If we believed them true we should cry out shame! shame' upon the people of Kansas for elevating or even tolerating such things, such miscreants, among them. But we protest that they are not true. The Republican party of Kansas, from its long succession of easy ictories over its old opponent, has become too prolific, especially of great men, and this is the mere labor of the giantess to relieve herself of her redundancy. These charges and allegations must no't be taken by verdant ones in a literal sense thev are mere hvpcrboles. figures of speech, sound and fury, signifying nothing the magic cabalistic phrases by which one great man, or the friends of a great man, seek to head or bother a rival in the race for-those positions always accorded to the competent and virtuous, llow do we know that this is so ? We know it from the fact that our prairie grass has not grown a second time since these same papers were filled with glowing eulogies of the very men to whom thej-now apply these seemingly damagingepithets and adjectives; and the grass will notgrowa second time before these same papers will glow again with eulogies of the very men they now denounce, should these men be candidates, as it is likely some, if not most of thein will be, upon the regular ticket. Against these scandalous vituperations of the Leavenworth dailies we enter our earnest protest There is nothing in the' conduct of the -men assailed to warrant, justify or excuse the use of such language "towards them. As a Senator, General Lane has watched with vigilance the interests of the State Tie represents, and has fail ed on no occasion which "has presented itself to press heir claims for consideration and acknow ledgment. As "Governor, Mr. Carney "has been no less vigilant, watchful, untiring and devoted; to any and everything' that could promote the interests, develop Ihe resources, or enhanee the credit and good name -of Kansas. The powers and capacity of Mr. Wilder.-as Bepresentativ, are as yet -untried, Trat'his constituents are'eonfi dent that he is equal to the full discharge of all the duties .they have laid upon him. That either our Governor 'oronr'llepresentative'are so weak as to resorjt to "the contemptible' dodge 6fthe truant school' boy of employing others to write their com position, their messages or speeches, we shall npt jjredit, until' the allegations are sub sburtiaied .by the most direct ad positive testi mony. Judge TJelanay, 'too? yet compara tively untried; but that "heis quaM'ed'firthe I position to which be is-apppaata we nave tne testimony of President Lincolpwho, of his mo tion, nominated to it, and who has known him. as a Jawyer long enough to form a pretty correct idea 'of his fitness to discharge the duties of District Judge. Mr. Clark we have'known for some time, and, notwithstanding the constamt sneering at his former humble avocation, we believe him to be honest, worthy and capable of discharging the duties of the position which he fills with credit to himself and advantage to the Government. Of Mr. Vaughan we know less than of either of the others, but the fact that for the past quarter of a century he has labored prominently in the cause of freedom, and has Survived airthe envenomed shafts which dorisg that long period have been hurled at him, is some guarantee that he is not the monster he is painted, but on the contrary an earnest, zealous champion of the right. This is a fair statement of the men assailed, as we understand them. They all doubtless have faults and foibles, but as an offset- they have their strong points and redeeming traits, which gives to each the fair average we have assigned them. Is not, then, the efforts of the Leavenworth dailies to paint them devils and brand them fiends, reprehensible, disgusting, disgraceful ? We think so ; and so thinking, we feel like appealing to the good sense and honest manhood of the country to put a- stop to it by Tepudiating the papers engaged in it. The origin of this Tipperary row we have already given : the vacancy to occur in the United States Senate in 18G5. Fortius place the friends of General Lane propose him as a candi date, and the friends of Governor Carney propose him as a candidate. This is all right. The position is an honorable one ; and among honor able men it will be competed for in an honorable way.- We beg leave to suggest that the aspirants named, throngh their friends, are scarcely seek ing the position in that way. But why agitate this question now ? A full year must yet elapse before the question can become, legitimately ,even a debatable one.' And then, provided the person selected is a true and reliable Republican, and an able, honest, and upright man, what matters it to the great mass of the people who the partic ular individual may bo? '-To the man actuated alone by ambitious and selfish motives, the kill ing off of all rival aspirants in advance may be a great point gained. To us, at this distance, it looks as if this was the very work in which these two rivals were encased. In the name of decency, wc admonish them, or their friends, that they may overdo their'work, and in slaugh tering each other they may "not only slaughter but bury themselves under an odium bo deep that no resurrection trump can reach Uiem. Able men are not so scarce in Kansas that the Legis lature, must of absolute necessity ( limit their choice to one or the other of these men. It is a possible thing, that by their bearing towards each other they may produce a conviction that neither is qualified for the dignified position to which they aspire, and. induce the people to look about them for a less selfish and better mannered candidate. We do not say that this will happen, but it may possibly. m 

STATE ITEMS. Topeka was just nino years old last Satur day, the 5th inst. Atchison papers say the sale of goods has doubled in that town within the past year. The distance from Leavenworth to Tucson, the proposed capital of Arizona, is no less than 1,G00 miles. The city and county of Leavenworth each give a hundred thousand dollars to Messrs. llallctt & Co. for the building of a branch road to connect them with the main Pacific trunk. They receive in return an equal amount of the paid stock of the road. Lawrence and Topeka are quivering over the railroad. They are fearful that Ihey arc to be "left out in the cold," and are making strenuous exci lions to secure the road in closer proximity to them than it now appears likely to run. On Sunday night, the 30th ult some boys undertook to steal honey from Peter Groh, near Elwood, Doniphan county. Groh hailed them and was fired at. He returned the compliment and lodged a ball under the left eye of a boy named Gallison, which will doubtless prove fatal. Boys should not steal Jioney. Times. On the 2d inst. five prisoners broke jail in Atchison, and effected their escape. As the keeper was locking up for the night, he was captured and disarmed, while one Gilbcit crawled throtigh a Jhole in the floor into the cellar, oponcd the outside door through which the prisoners scattered in different directions. Their names were Poricr Sterling and Edward Gilbert, indicted for jobbing a Mr. Kel&ey, in May last; Dunn, a Doniphan county horse thief, sentenced to three years hard labor; and Ogdeu and Edwards, horsethieves awaiting the action of- the Grand Jury. Tom. "The " Iron-Skins." Oliver Wendel Holmes pays the follow ing tributo to the black soldiers : " A good soldier, like a good horse, cannot be of a bad color.

The Richmond Whig, of the 3d, talks in the following plnin fashion, with no other motive or thought than to advance the pub lic interests : 41 We would again suggest to the Presi dent the advantage of reconstructing his cabinet, and calling to his aid the very ablest intellects of the country. Wo have a Department of State that has not been able for neaily three years to establish rela tions" with any other State; a Treasury Department that has failed to keep its fiuances from running to ruin ; a War De parttmnt in the hands of a Chief, whose studies anil course of. life have becu purely aud peculiarly civic;. a Navy, Department without a Navy; a Post Office! Department with "a very shocking system of mails ; a Department of Justice vacant. The busi ness of its Departments separately bhow the waut of a tuoro masterly hand and the united, powers 'of their Chiefs t in cabinet council. If councils are ever held they fail to supply the wisdom the country needs. Wo arc getting into deep water, and a feeling of dread is shaking the souls of the people. There is. nothing the Presi dent can do that will so reanimate their hearts and stimulate their confidence in and affection for him, as the calling to his side, as his duty advises, a cabinet of the most experienced men in the country, regardless of what may have been their former political associations." " , The Missouri Iron-Sides. The St. Louis Union is a Conservative paper, but the following paragraph, copied from it shows that even couservatives are now in favor of raising colored regiments : " Accounts received from all parts of the State go to show that the recent order in relation to negro enlistments, is doing more to pacify the State than any other thing The owuers of slaves are forwarding them to the dinerent railroad stations lor me purpose of enlisting them iu the military service. Of course the owner receives the bounty paid recruits, as) a compensation tor his property. Lhe railroads are crowd' ed with this class of passengers. We un dcrstand that some five or six colored reg iraents arc now being organized in the State. It is estimated that at least twenty thousand soldiers can be recruited by this class of recruits ; and as every enlisted ne gro counts for one white man, ic is thought that the quota of Missouri can be filled in this way and save the necessity of a draft. A couple of problems, about which Mis sourians are anxious just now, seem to be iu process of being easily solved. m m The Army of the Potomac. The Army of thc Potomac is encamped on the ground it left on the morning of Thanksgiving. The reasons for this sudden change of programme, without forcing Lee to a general battle are these: At a Council of War the fact was depionstrated that the enemy was entrenched behind very formi dable earthworks, which they were every moment strengthening. The fearful loss it would entail upon u, and ths impossibility of rescuing our wounded before they would perish with culd, in case we attempted to carry the rebel wurks by assault, were some of the considerations which induced subse quent actions- Our ratious and forage had uearly run out, and the roads were too bad to allow of further transportation from our distant base of supplies. These mi'hty considerations, it i3 claimed, "induced the commander to issue an order to fall back to-night. The Army of the Potomac rests on its old line tbe Urange ana Atexanaria n. it.

No wonder that they clamor for alransfer of the war to North ern soil, as was promised them by their leaders it should be: " There is a portion of this State so dev astated by tbe civil war as to be practically abandoned by the foot of man. The men are slumbering at Shiloh, Corinth and Stone River ; the servants have gained their free dom ; the women and children have fled to more remote and quiet precincts.

It was evident that they were doing considera ble damage, as the shells were seen to burst at night. All the inhabitants of Charles ton had been moved to the rear of the city. The firing on Sumter had ceased, aud Gilmore was turuing his attention to The forts inside the harbor. A tcrriffic fire wa. kept up on Fort Johnson. On tbe reception of the news of Grant's victories on Tuesday, our army aud nav fired a grand salute. Soon afterward the rebel batteries opened fire, which was vig orously going on when the Massachusetts left. The rebels have heretofore had a hospital flag flying from the Moultrie House, and of course our forces respected ,it, and avoided firing upon it : but a few days ago the reb els commenced tearing down the Moultrie House, and revealed to our forces a form id able battery, which had been erected while it was under, the protection of the hospital flag. -No flag floats over Sumter, and only an occasional shot from its ruins.
