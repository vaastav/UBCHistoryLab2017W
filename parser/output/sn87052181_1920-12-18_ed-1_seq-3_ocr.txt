FAIR PLAY, STE. GENEVIEVE, MISSOURI, CONGRESS HEARS WILSON MESSAGE President Urges That Our De mocracy Prove Its Purity and Power to Prevail. WORLD'S HOPE RESTS IN US America Must Make and Enforce Laws That Are Unquestionably Just, and Stand for Right and Justice as Toward Individual Nations. Washington, Dec. 7. President Wil son's message to congress was rend In Jjoth houses by the clerics, Mr. Wilson having decided not to deliver It In person. The message In full follows:' Gentlemen of the congress: When I addressed myself to per forming the duty Inld upon the Presi dent by the Constitution to present to you an annual report of the state of the Union, I found my thought domi nated by an Immortal sentence of Abralmrn Lincoln's, "Let us have faith that right makes might, and In that faith let us dnre to do our duty as we understand It;" n sentence Im mortal because It embodies In a form of utter simplicity nnd purity the essen tial faith of the nation, the faith In -which It was conceived, and the faith In which It has grown to glory nnd power. Willi that fnlth nnd the birth of a nation founded upon It came the hope into the world that a new order would prevail throughout the affairs of man kind, an order In which reason and right would take precedence of covet ousness and force, and I believe thnt I express the wish ahd purposo of ev ery thoughtful American when I say that this sentence mnrks for us In the plainest nmnner the part wo should .play alike In the arrangement of our domestic affairs and In our exercise of Influence upon the affairs of the world. By this fnlth, and by this faith alone, can the wo'rld be lifted out of Its present confusion nnd despair. It was tills fnlth which prevailed over .the wicked force of Germany. You will remember that the beginning of the end of the war came when the 5erman people found themselves face rto face with the conscience of the world, nnd realized thnt right was ev erywhere arrayed ngalnst the wrong 6hnt their government was attempting ito perpetrate. I think, therefore, that 'It Is true Jo sny that, this was the 'faith which" won the war. Certainly this Is the faith with which our gal lant men went Into the Held and out uponthe..sens to roal;e sure, of victory. This Is the mission upon which de roocracy camp Into the world. Democ racy Is an assertion of the right of the individual to live and to bo treated justly as ngalnst any attempt on the part of any combination of Individuals to make lnws which will overburden iilm or which will destroy .his equality nmong his fellows In the mntter. of right or privilege, and I think wo all realize that the day has come when democracy Is being put upon Its final test. The old world Is just now suf fering from a wanton rejection of the principle of democracy and a substitu tion of the prlnclplo of autocracy as Asserted In the name but without the authority and sanction of the multi tude. This Is the time of all others when democracy should prove Its puri ty nnd Its spiritual power to prevail. It Is surely the manifest destiny of the tJnlted States to lead In the attempt to make this spirit prevail. Two Things for Us to Do. There are two ways In which the TJnlted Stales enn assist to accomplish this great object. First, by offering the example within her own borders of the will power of democracy to make and enforce laws which nrcunques tlonably Just and which ,are equal In their administration laws which se cure Its full right to lnbor and yet at the same time safeguard tho Integrity of property, and pnrtlculnrly of that property which Is devoted to the de velopment of Industry .and the In crease of the necessary wealth of tho world. Second,, by standing for right nd Justice as towards individual na tions. The law of democracy Is for the protection of tho weak and the In fluence of every democracy In the world should bo for the protection of the weak nation, tho nation which Is struggling toward Its right and to ward Its proper recognition and priv ilege In the family of nations. The United States cannot refuse this rolo of champion without putting the stigma of rejection upon the great nnd devoted men who brought Its gov ernment into exlsfenco and established It In the face of almost universal op position and Intrigue, even In face of wanton force, ns, for example, against tho order in council of Great Britain nnd the arbitrary Napoleonic decrees which Involved us In what we Itnow ns the war of 1812. Sample Democracy of World. I urgo you to consider that tho dis play of an Immedlato disposition on tho pnrt of congress to remedy any In Justices or evils that ,may have shown themselves In onrjmtlonnl llfo will nfford tho rnost 'effectual offset to tho forces of chaos and tyranny which nro playing so disastrous n part In the fortunes of tho free peoples of more than one part of the world. The United States Is of necessity tho t,am plo democracy of tho world, and the triumph of democracy depends upon Its success. Recovery from the disturbing and sometimes disastrous effects of the late war has been exceedingly slow on the other side of the water, and has given promise, I venture to say, of early completion only In our own for tunate country; but even with us the recovery hults nnd Is Impeded at times, and there ure Immedlato serviceable nets of legislation which. It seems to rao, we ought to attempt to assist that recovery and prove the Indestructible recuperative force of a great govern ment of the people. One of these Is to prove that n great democracy can keep hope as successfully and In ns buslness-liko a fashion as any other government. It seems to me that the first step toward proving this Is to supply ourselves with a method of handling our estimates nnd expendi tures, nnd bringing them to the point where they will not be nn unnecessary strain upon our Income or necessitate unroasonable taxation: In other words, a workable budget system, and I sug gest that two elements are essential to such a system namely, not only that tho proposal of appropriations should ho. In tho hands of a single body, such as a single appropriations committee In each house of the con gress, but also that this body should be brought Into such co-operation with" the departments of the government and with the treasury of tho United States as would cnablo It to act upon a complete conspectus of the needs of tho government and the resources from which It must draw Its" Income. I reluctantly vetoed the budget bill passed by the last session of the con gress because of a constitutional objec tion. The house of representatives subsequently modified the bill In order to meet this objection. In the revised form I believe that the bill, coupled .with action already taken by the con gress to revlso Its rules and procedure, furnishes the foundations for an effec tive national budget system. I ear nestly hope, therefore, that one of tho first steps taken by the present session of the congress will be to pass the budget bill. Marked Gain In Finances. Tho nation's finances havo shown marked Improvement during the past year. Tho total ordinary receipts of $6,094,000,000 for the fiscal year 1020 exceeded those for 1919 by fl, 642,000, 000, while the total net ordinary ex penditures decreased from $18,514,000, 000 to $6,403,000,000. Tho gross public debt, which reached Its, highest point on Aug. 31, 1919. when It' was $26,1596, 000,000, had dropped on Nov. 30, 1920, to $24,175,000,000. There also has been a marked decrease In holdings of gov ernment w r securities by the banking Institutions of tho country, ns well as the amount of bills held by the federal reserve banks secured by government war obligations. This fortunate result has relieved tho banks and left them freer to finance the needs of agriculture, Industry and commerce. It has been duo In largo part to the reduction of tho public debt, especially of the floating debt, but moro particularly to the Improved distribution of government securities among permanent investors. The ces sation of the government's borrowings except through short term certificates of indebtedness has been a matter of great consequence to the people of the country at large, as well as to the holders of Liberty bonds and Victory notes, and has had an Important bear ing on tho matter of effective credit control. Tho year has been characterized by the progressive withdrawal of the treasury rrom the domestic credit market and from a position of dominant Influence In that market. The future course will nec essarily depend upon the extent to which economies are practiced one upon the burdens placed upon the treasury, as well as upon Industrial development and the maintenance of tax receipts at a suf ficiently high level. Big Bond Issue to Mature. The fundamental fact which at present dominates the government's financial sit uation Is that $7,500,000,000 of Its war In debtedness matures within the next two and a half years. Of this amount 12,000, 000,000 are floating debt and $3,000,000,000 victory notes and war savings certificates. Tho fiscal program of tho government must be determined ' with reference to these maturities. Sound policy demands that the government expenditures be re duced to the lowest amount which will permit the various services to operate efficiently and that government receipts from taxes and salvage be maintained sufficiently high to provide for current requirements, Including Interest and sink ing fund charges on the public debt, and at the same time retire the floating debt and part of the victory loan before ma turity. With rigid economy, vigorous salvage operations and adequate revenues from taxation, a surplus of current receipts over current expenditures can be realized and should be applied to the floating debt. All branches of the government should co-operate to see that this program is realized. I cannot overemphasize the necessity of economy in government appropriations and expenditures and the avoidance by the congress of practices which take money from the treasury by Indefinite or revolving-fund appropriations. The esti mates for the present year show that over a billion dollars of expenditures were authorized by the last congress in addi tion to the amounts shown In tho usual complied statement of appropriations. Specific Appropriations Urged. This' strikingly illustrates -the Impor tance of making direct and specific ap propriations. The relation between the current receipts and current expenditures of the government during tho present fls. cat yoar.'as well ns during the last half of the last fiscal year, has been disturbed by the extraordinary burdens thrown upon the treasury by the transportation act, in connection with the return of tho railroads to private control. Over $600, 000,000 has already been paid to the rail roads under this act $350,000,000 during the present fiscal year and It Is estimated that further payments aggregating pos sibly $050,000,000 must still bo mado td, the railroads during the current year. It Is obvious that theso largo payments havo already seriously limited the government's progress In retiring the floating debt. Closely connected with this, it seems to me, Is the necessity for an Immediate consideration of the revision of our tax laws. Simplification of the Income nnd profits taxes has become an Immediate necessity. Theso taxce performed an In dispensable service during the war. The need for their simplification, however, Is very great in order to savo tho taxpayer Inconvenience and expense and in order to make his liability moro certain and definite. Other and more detailed recom mendations with regard to taxes will no doubt be laid betoro you by the secretary of tho treasury and tho commissioner of Internal revenue. Would Aid War Heroes. It Is my privilege to draw to the atten tion of congress for every sympathetic consideration the problem of providing adequato facilities for tho care and treat ment of former members of the military and naval fricea who are sick or disabled as the result of their participation in tho war. These herolo men can nevor bo paid In money for the service they patrioti cally" rendered the nation. Their reward will lie rather In realization of the fact that they vindicated the rights of their country and aided In safeguarding civili zation. The nation's gratitude must be effectively revealed to them by the most ample provision for their medical care and treatment as well as for their voca tional training and placement. Tho tlmo has come when a more com plete program can be formulated and more satisfactorily administered for I heir treatment and training, and I earn estly urge that the congress give the matter Its early consideration. The sec retary of the treasury and the board for vocational education will outline In their annual reports proposals covering medi cal care and rehabilitation which I am sure will engage your earnest study and command your most generous support. Permit mo to emphaslzo onco more tho need for action upon certain matters upon which I dwelt at some length In my messago to tho second session of the COth congress: The necessity, for exam ple, of encouraging the manufacture of dyestuffs and related chemicals; the Im portance of ilolng everything possible to promote agricultural production along economic lines, to Improve agricultural marketing and to make rural llfo more aUructtvo and healthful; the need for a law regulating cold storage In such a way as to limit tho time during which goods may bo kept In storage, prescribing the method of disposing of them If kept be yond tho permitted period, and requiring goods released from storage In all cases' to bear tho dato of their receipt. Would Mark Storage Goods. It would also be most serviceable It It wer. provided that all goods reUased from cold storage for Interstate shipment should havo plainly marked upon each packago tho selling or markot prices at which they went Into storage, In order that tho purchaser might bo able to lenrri what profits stood between him and tho producer or tho wholesale dealer. In deed, it would be very serviceable to the public If all goods destined for Inter state commerce wore made to carry upon every package riso whose form made it possible a plain statement of lho prlco at which they left the hands of tho pro ducer. I respectfully call your attention, also, to tho recommendations of the mes sage referred to with -egard to a federal license for all corporations engaged In Interstate commerce. In brief tho immediate legislative need of the tlmo Is tho removal of nil obstacles to tho realization of tho best ambitions of our peoplo In their sev eral classes of employment and the strengthening of all Instrumentalities by which difficulties are to bo met and removed and Justice dealt out, wheth er by law or by somu form of media tion and conciliation. I do not feel it to be my privilege at present to sug gest tho detailed and particular meth ods by which these objects may bo attained, but I have faith that the In quiries of your several committees will discover the waand the method. Asks for Loan to Armenia. In response to what I believe to be the impulse of sympathy nnd opinion throughout tho United States, I ear nestly suggest hat the congress au thorize the treasury of the United States to make to the struggling gov ernment of Armenia such a loan as was made to several of the allied gov ernments during the war, and I would also suggest that It would bo desira ble to provide In the legislation Itself that tho expenditure of the money thus loaned should be under the supervision of a commission, or at least a com missioner, from tho United States, In order that revolutionary tendencies within Armenia itself might not be af forded by tho loan a further tempting opportunity. Allow me to call your attention to the fact that tho people of the Philippine Islands have succeeded In maintaining a stable government since the last action of the congress in their behalf and have thus fulfilled tho condition set by the congress as precedent to a consideration of granting Independence to the islands. 1 respectfully submit that this condition precedent having been fulfilled, It Is now our liberty and our duty to keep our promise to the peoplo of those Islands by granting them the Independence which they so honorably covet. I have not so much laid before you a series of reommendatlons, gentlemen, as sought to utter a confession of faith, of the faith In whlih I was bred and to which It Is my solemn purpose to stand by until my last fighting day. I believe this to be the faith of America, the faith of the nation, and of all the victories which await national action In the days to come, whether in America or elsewhere. Vast Crater on the Moon. The moon, of course, Is pitted nil over with so-called craters, and sev eral of the bigger ones are near the center of the lunar hemisphere which faces the earth. Ono of these, about 100 miles In diameter, might bo de scribed as n huge ring of lofty moun tains surrounding a circular plain. One gets n much moro vivid llnpres slou of the size of this vast amphi theater when It is explained that It would contain nil of the territory be tween Philadelphia and New York city, together with those centers of population. A striking picture Illus trating this fact is presented In tho Popular Science Monthly. It shows Long Island sound, New York bay, Brooklyn and Manhattan Island within ono edge of tho crater, while In tho distance, and within the opposite edge, ono sees Trenton, the Delnwaro river and the City of Brotherly Love.
