Its End Finds the Country Prosperous. History of the Conflict. Praise for Hobson, Dewey and Other Heroes. Exults in Victory. What Peace Brings Us. --Our Finances. "Increase in Military Necessary. At the opening of the scesitm of Con gri' Monday President McKinley sub nutted his annual nu'wiige. It was a very lonr document and reviews the Spanish war and its result thoroughly. It says little as to the future, except as to I'uba. The following is an abstract of the message : Notwithstanding Hie added burdens rendered necessary by war. our people rejoice in a very satisfactory and ty evidenced by the largest volume of misincsB ever recomeii. lauiuaciuies have been productive, agricultural pursuits yielded abundant returns, lalxir in all fields of industry were bet ter rewarded, the revenue legislation passed by the present Congress has in-i-ri!iKi-il tha tri'Hsiirv's receipts to the amount estimated by its authors, the finances of the government, have been successfully administered and its cred it advanced to the first rank, while its currency has been maintained at the world's highest standard. Military service under a common Hag and for a righteous cause baa strengthened the national spirit and served .to cement more closely than ever the fraternal bonds between every section of the country. War M itn Spain. ' In reviewing tha controversy which led up to ho war with Spain the Pres ident takes up the thread of the narra tive where it terminated in his last annual message. He concluded : "It was-honestly due to our friendly rela tions with 'Spain (hat she should be given a reasonable chance to realize her expectations of reform to whU'h she became irrevocably committed." It became evident, however, that the propo&cd plans were barren of good result. No tangible relief was afforded the rcconecntradoes. among whom mortality frightfully Increased, the proffered expedient of zones of cultiva tion proved illusory and it was appar ent that nothing save the physical ex haustion ot Spain or the Cubans and fii.. i.-...r ;.nl vii iii nf the Isliind of Cuba could result from the struggle then in prognvs. ' Destruction of the Maine.

In this connection the President says, "Nor can we be unmindlul of the achievements of our builders, mechan ics ami artisans for their skill in the construction of our war ships." (latitude for Yictorr. As to tho success gained by the Cnited States the President says that the earnest and lasting gratitude of the nation Is unsparingly due.

As soon as we are in possession of Cuba and have pacified the Islands it will be necessary to give aid and di rection to its people to form a govern ment for themselves.

Spanish rule must be replaced by a just, benevolent and home govern ment created by the people of Cuba capable of performing all international obligations and those which shall en courage their thrift, industry and prosperity and promote peace and goodwill among all the inhabitant. V hatever may have been their rela tions in the past, neither revenge nor passion should hav a place in the new government. Until there is com plete tranquility in the island and a stable government inaugurated mili tary occupation will lie continued. Favors Xicararnaa Canal. The President expect that the Niea rania commission will shortly be able to "report finally. "I have not hesitated to express my convictions." says the President, "that considerations of ex pediency and international policy a between the several government in terested in the construction and con trol of an interoeesnic canal by this route require the maintenance of a status quo until the canal commission shUl have reported and tne United States Congress shall have had oppor tunity to pass finally upon the whole matj-er." . . Tie President regards, in view f our (newly acquired interests in the Pacific ocean, the construction of such a maritime highway as now more than ever indispensable. j Tbr Cnatrr'a finance..

The recommendation made by the secretary of war for an increase of the regular military establishment has the President's unqualified approval. lie savs it is his purpose to muster out the entire volunteer army as' soon as Congress shall provide lor an in crease of the regular establishment.
