INSULT TO THE POPE Vatican So Regards Accusation of Precipitating Italian Retreat. London. Dec. 6 Cardinal Bourne, the archbishop of Westminster, has communicated to the Morning Post a statement from Cardinal Gaspaxri, the papal secretary of state, answering the Post's accusation that the Vatican was implicated in . disruptive ' prop aganda in Italy and is unneutral. Cardinal Gasparri declares that the accusation is an atrocious calumny, and says that the hierarchy and clergy in Italy have given the most open and most generous help to the country's cause, and have received unreserved praise from the Italian parliament and government. The cardinal adds that long before the issuance of the papal peace note which is said to have been among the chief causes of the army's lowered morale, the clergy generally and the army chaplains particularly, were laboring against the destructive propaganda which had been begun and was reported to be giving unrest to the ivil authorities. The Vatican, the cardinal declares, is pained and -indignant at the Post charges and regards them as insult ing. Referring to the accusation that the Vatican espoused the Austrian cause. Cardinal Gasperri reaffirms the full and correct neutrality of the Holy See. The Post, in an editorial examining Cardinal Gasparri's statement, virtu ally reiterates its original accusation, and cites Incidents which it regards as proofs.

Advertisement the days when he was at the head of the Russian government, Bolsheviki I prising in July. Kerensky's only fault is that he has been willing to die but he has not been willing to kill. The July uprising of the Bolsheviki, when some 500 men, women and chil dren were killed in the streets of Pet rograd during a reign of terror that lasted three days, was a fine instance of Keren sky's bravery. The first machine gun regiment, for weeks, had been Bolsheviki. It had demanded that all the power of the government be turned over to the council of Workmen and Soldiers Time after time the delegates of the machine gun regiment which had some 1,500 machine guns and .twenty armored cars, came to Kerensky and threatened to go into the streets and make an armed show of power if he would not agree to surrendering the government to the workmen and sol diers. The working men from the great factories, all of whom had arms in their homes, as Kerensky well knew, made similar threats. Keren sky, knowing that much of the army was behind these men, refused. Kerensky Stood Pat. On July 18, the machine-gun men and the workingmen went to the dancer's palace, where Lenine and Trotsky held forth and demanded the right to go into the streets and dem onstrate. AH that day Lenine, who was sick in bed, and Trotsky, pleaded with th soldiers and workingmen not to go into the streets. During the day delegations passed back and forth between the various barracks and the dancer's palace. Lenine and Trotsky were afraid. I have had first hand stories of the terrors that existed in that palace that bloody day. They sent word to Kerensky asking him to temporize with the soldiers. Kerensky stood pat. Unwilling to kill, an adversary of the death sentence, he was brave enough to risk death himself and even brave enough to permit killings in the streets of Pe trograd. At 11 o'clock that night Lenine and Trotsky lost control of the machine gun men. "All right,' they said to them, "march thru the streets and run around with your armored cars if you wish to, but don't shoot and re turn to your barracks at midnight." fen, Women and Children Slain. Within fifteen minutes the sounds of rifle shooting were filling the city aiiu men, wuuirii auu uuuui cu were dying in the streets.

A POCKET OF HELL Bourlon Heights Teems With the Stench of Corpses. Trees and Ground Shell Shat tered; Pools Slimy Red. BY WILlLIAM PH LLP SIMMS. With the British Armies in France, Dec. 6. Bourlon ia a pocket of hell today. " The trees of Bourlon heights are splintered away. The ground is evHly pock-marked by the dread disease of war.' Pools of slimy, suggestively red water stretch everywhere. Corpses are scattered about thickly. The de fenders are too busy to bury them. A horrible stench from these torn and mangled remains rises to mingle with the fumes of exploding shells and with Prussian gas. Over head boche shrapnel bursts in an everlasting barrage. Gas shells monotonously heaved over, spread their vapors about. Defenders must wear their masks practically every minute of the day and night. Scur rying around in " the horrors of the wood, they fit into the picture exactly. They look like some Dante-esque fiends of the Inferno in their goggling masks.' Enemy Holds -Hill. All roads in this hell spot are badly cut up. The German artillery is do ing its best to concentrate on the British engineers, who are working day and night to keep the line of com munications open. - t' Bourlon's hill top is difficult of ac cess. The enemy retains the high ground on both sides. He dominates Anneux and Graincourt valleys. The situation in this particular section is certainly not easy. Bourlon's pocket comes from a sharp curve around the wood, from ' a point, on the Bapaume-Cambral.rpad between the ' Nord canal and the' southwest corner of the woods and j thence west to Fontaine Notre Dame. Enemy machine guns in Folie wood ! have forced back the British line north of Cantaing, further accentuating the salient. . THANK YOU, LADIES I Wilson Owes His Election to Ikng, Beach. Cal., Surf.

Many big food dealers throughout the United States are in eminent danger of being put out of business byvFood Administra tor Hoover because they are violating the federal food regulations under which they are licensed to operate, it was learned today. It was a gentle hint to these dealers, who do not think Hoover means busi ness, that the food administrator re voked the license of the Morris Sin ger Commission company here for al lowing two carloads of potatoes to rot on the track. The revocation order puts that firm completely out of business until such time as Hoover sees fit to grant a. new license. Heavy Penalties Attached. . The same fate and much harsher treatment, including indictments car rying heavy fines and two year prison terms, hover near a number of marked food dealers in various parts of the country if they don't change their tactics, it was authoritatively stated. To give the dealers plenty of warn ing, fifteen of the worst offenses re ported have been investigated by of ficial agents of the food administra tion legal department each case was selected and handled so the dealers of that section would know exactly what had occurred. All were given a recital of their sins and a final warn ing. The case of the Singer company was the first in which public action and revocation of license has been employed. NEW PLEA FROMPOPE Vatican to Issue Another Xote to World, Cardinal Announces. Rome, Dec. 6. As soon as Pope Benedict has perused the authentic text of the secret diplomatic docu ments just published by the Bolshe viki, he proposes to send a joint note to tne nations or the world. Cardinal Gasparri indicated today. The secretary of state of the Vatican declared the pontiff was following de velopments in Russia with eager in terest. Vatican circles are consider ing the possibility of the Russian Catholics recognizing the pope as the head of the church now that there is no emperor claiming that prerogative.
