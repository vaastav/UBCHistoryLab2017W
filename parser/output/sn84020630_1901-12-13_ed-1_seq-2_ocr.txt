And yet there are people at Boston and Lincoln, Neb., who want to give these dear little can nibals complete independence so that they may pursue undisturbed their customs and practices. The Guadalupe county bank with capital stock of $30,000, located at Santa Rosa, Guadalupe county, has been in corporated under the territorial laws and has commenced business. Another instance of how the territorial adminis tration is keeping capital and invest ments out of the territory. Yung Lu, the real author of the Box er rebellion and outrages, has been re warded by the Chinese court, with a two-eyed peacock feather ''for having protected foreigners against the Box ers." Chinese sarcasm and child-like blandness still beat anything of their kind in any other part of the world. The Denver Post publishes quite a lengthy interview with some fellow that calls himself Weston that is chuck full of lies, misrepresentations, mis statements and fake stories. Publish ing that sort of rot is not calculated to make the state of Colorado friends in New Mexico. The management of the Denver Post should have known bet ter. Of course, the Democrats found something to criticise in the Hay Pauncefote treaty. It suits the Repub lican side of the senate however.- If all treaties and legislation would be ar ranged to suit the Democrats, whose main business in congress is to object to everything favored by the Republi cans, this republic would soon be on its downward road. The construction of the Dawson rail road from Tucumcari, on the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific, to the Daw son coal fields in Colfax county, will in the next eight months add 150 miles to the present railroad mileage in the ter- rltory. Despite the assertions of the yellow sheets and soreheads of New Mexico that capital is being driven out of the territory, the building of new railroads keeps on steadily. The Denver Post, in a recent number published a rather readable article on the political situation of New Mexico. The article contained a story on the political fight now on between Govern or Otero and Thomas B. Catron, and as said above, was right readable, al though it contained scarcely a correct or true statement. This goes to show that readable articles can be written without resorting to truth or facts in the case. There Is complaint of rowdyism In the railroad construction camps in Lin coln county. That is not strange how ever, and the law officers of that part of New Mexico succeed fairly well In maintaining law and order under ad verse circumstances. As soon as the railroad is finshed, the rougher and more disorderly men employed in the .construction work will leave the ter ritory and peace and morality will hold sway along the new railroad. The city of Las Vegas having no fear of the consequences that might or might not ensue, Is an applicant for the location of the military post. The board of trade has filed a formal appli cation in this respect with the board of general officers appointed to recom mend sites for new military posts. In addition the towns of Clayton, in Union county, and Gallup, in McKinley coun ty, are applicants. It seems when there Is a good thing around everybody wants It. Chief Justice W. J. Mills and Asso ciate Justices John R. McFie and Frank W. Parker have been reappoin ted to the positions that they have filled to the satisfaction of all concerned dur ing the past four years. The people of New Mexico are greatly gratified at this action of President Roosevelt and approve of It highly. The New Mexi can has supported the three judges' names for reappointment believing that they fully deserved It, and Is con sequently well pleased with the result. The agrarian fight over a proposed tariff to protect agricultural products which Is becoming so bitter in Ger many, Is being extended to Ireland and threatens to split the Irish voters Into still more factions. An Irish labor or ganization recently adopted a resolu tion asking "respectfully that Its pres idents. Maude Gonne and Major Mc- Brlde, petition the American people, for Almighty God's sake, to save the Irish laborer and worklngmen from extermination by the greedy, selfish, purse-proud framers and the United Irish League." The people In America, although they draw partisan lines very sharply, have scarcely any Idea of the bitterness engendered In Germany, Ire land and other countries by political and oonornlcal quMtln. The appointment of ex-Sheriff Pat rick F. Garrett of Las Cruces, Dona Ana county, to be collector of the port of El Paso, will be very acceptable to the people o the district, New Mexico being the greater portion of El Paso's collection district. The New Mexican was of the opinion and-so said in its editorial columns that the appointment should go to a New Mexico Republi can. There is every reason to believe The world thought that the meas ures ndnnted hv the British in South Africa to suppress ths Boers are as harsh as civilization can countenance, but tidings come from Great Britain that they will be made still harsher. Great Britain has succeeded in creat ine; another bleeding Cuba in South Africa, but there is no nation like thej United States near enough to put aj stop to the bloodshed, reconcentration 1 methods and cruelty and besides, If there were, Great Britain is stronger and more tenacious than Spain and could not so easily be conquered. Alamogordo is looking for an addi tional water supply. The town is grow ing so fast that the present fine system of water supply will soon be inade quate, tl is likely that a pipe line will be laid in Alamo canon a few miles further up the mountains than the pre sent pipe line. An effort will be made to increase the flow of water in La Luz canon. The El Paso and Northeastern Railway company will In addition bore test wells as there is a likelihood that artesian water will be struck some where in the vicinity of Alamogordo. The Magic City of the Sacramentoes will not let anything stand in its way of future growth and prosperity. Senator Wellington finds himself to be a nondescript whom neither party desires to have in its ranks. The Re publicans of the senate have notified the Democrats that they must take care of the Maryland senator, and the Democrats have positively refused to do so. Senator McLaurin of South Carolina, is almost in the same boat although the Republicans are disposed to be more friendly to him than are the Democrats to Wellington. It is a pity that so bright a man as Wellington who had a chance to make Maryland permanently a Republican state and thereby gain fame and prestige for himself, should throw all his chances to the wind simply to gratify a mean personal spite. The big railroad systems in order to prevent rate cutting by the weaker lines, have consented to run their fast trains slower between Chicago and western points. The minimum time be tween Denver and Omaha has been placed at 13 hours and 30 minutes, al though the Burlington and Rock Is land had Intended to reduce it to twelve hours, and the time between St. Paul and Denver dare not be less than 12 hours and 55 minutes. In this case, it seems that the community of interests of railroads authorizes a step back ward which will' h.-rVdly meet tho ap proval of the traveling public which, on account of the great and expensive lm provements made lately by several of the transcontinental lines, expected to see the time between coast and coast cut down considerably. But even the community of interests of the railroads will not be able to stop progress for any length of time. More Reasons for Statehood. The Rocky Mountain News gives the following good reasons, a few of many, why New Mexico, Arizona and Okla homa should be admitted to state hood: "Strong pressure Is being brought to bear on congress for the admission of New Mexico, Arizona and Oklahoma into the union. The demand of these territories for statehood is favored by the western press with practical unan imity. No satisfactory reason can be urged why they should not be admit ted. On the other hand, the reasons urged for their admission are unan swerable. According to the census of 1900, New Mexico had a population of 194,000, Arizona of 122,000, and Oklaho ma of 398,000. Very many states were admitted with much less population; not a few states now have less. Since the census was taken all three territor ies have increased largely In popula tion. "In all other respects these territories are fitted for statehood. Their Indus tries are varied and their development will be given a marked Impetus by be ing created into states. They have well established school systems, and their people are enterprising, Intelli gent and patriotic. They are amply able to sustain state governments and are anxious for the time to come when they shall be permitted to govern themselves. Every consideration of fairness and justice entitles them to the favorable action of congress. "There is a historic reason why they should be admitted to the union by this congress. The centennial of the Louisiana purchase will be celebrated in 1903. If the Indian Territory and Oklahoma are united and admitted as a single state (Its population would be 900,000) the entire area purchased by Jefferson would have been carved Into states. The Louisiana purchase paved the way for the Mexican acquisition of which New Mexico and Arizona con stltute the only portions not carved Into states. Under the treaty of Guad alupe Hidalgo, signed In 1848, they are entitled to become states. The "adding of three stars to the national flag In 1903 would be a most appropriate rec ognition of a great anniversary, and significant In the fact that all the ter ritories -within the confines of the Uni ted States proper had been erected Into states. It would mean that just a cen tury from the time that the United States first acquired any territory west of the Mississippi the entire region be tween the great river and the Pacific had so progressed In population, In dustrial development, commerce, trans portation, education and all the arts of civilized life that It had been added to the American union."

SWIFT SPECIFIC CO ATLANTA 0L. EX-GOVERNOR L. B. PRINCE AT WASHINGTON. He Is Working Hard to Have an Army Post Located at Santa Fe. Washington Post. Hon. L. Bradford Prince, ex-chief jus tice and ex-governor of New Mexico, Is at the Ebbitt House, to present to the army board on military posts the claims of Santa Fe. Gov. Prince Is well known in the east from his long service in the New York legislature, where, as far back as 1872, he had charge of the pro secution of Judge Barnard, Cardozo, and McCrum, In the reform from the Tweed regime. It will also bo remem bered that his name was associated with that of the father of the President in the memorablo fight between President Hayes and Senator Conk ing, when the President nominated itooseveit ana Prince as collector and naval officer of New York, in place of Gen. Arthur and Gov. Cornell. In talking of the army post matter, he said: "Santa Fe is the most historic army post in the country, having been established In 1598, before Jamestown and Plymouth were thought of, and always kept there on account of the re markable climate, in which no soldier can die or provisions spoil. The old re servation there is a beautiful spot In the center ot the city, and, in addition, tne local authorities offof any amount of land that may be desired." Gov. Prince Is also chairman ot tne legislative committeo of the Trans Mississiopl Congress, which will soon open headquarters in Washington and advocate some of the Western measures recommended by that congress. The other members are H. E. Whltroore, Missouri: Robert Graham, Colorado; W. M Bunker, California, and J. M. Cole man, Texas. Lincoln County on the Highroad to Prosperity. Capitan Progress. It is conceded by everyone who has been a close observer of the events of the past few months that Lincoln coun ty is on the verge of an era of unpre cedented development. Every Indus try in the county shows greater activ ity than at any time in the history of the county. Especially Is this true of the mining industry. Within the past year more has been done towards de veloping the mineral wealth of the county than in all of the previous his tory of the county. For years the min ing industry has been at a standstill, but now new life is being Infused Into it by the application of capital which Is finding its way into this section. Many valuable prospects which have lain Idle for years are being worked and made to produce, while the entire country Is being prospected with the most satis factory results. There are men in the country who are spending a great deal of money purchasing mining property and in many instances the prices paid for single mining claims have reached up into the thousands of dollars all of which goes to show that the country Is on the upward turn. Concerning a National Lease Law. Pecos Valley Stockman. If the advoctaes of a lease law ever succeed in convincing a majority of the people of this country that this Is the solution of the public land trou bles, they must first present a bill that Is practicable. While there has been lota of talk on the question, thus far no practicable bill has been presented to the country for consideration, and the people must be allowed to consider It and understand the proposition before it can be put through congress. Con gress will not for a moment consider any bill that has not the endorsement of a great majority of the people, both east and west. Thus far. the leasing advocates have only presented the ab stract theory. The people want to see the definite and specific plan. Then they will be able to make up their minds whether leasing Is a grab game or not. New Mexico's Climate. Raton Range. There is good reason for the fact that New Mexico's climate Is becoming far famed. This happy land Is probably blessed with more days of sunshine during the year than any other habi table portion of the globe. The tem perature is remarkably mild and uni form. There is very little moisture In the air, so that the heat of summer Is not so oppressive and the cold of 'win ter not so penetrating as in less fav ored lands. The atmosphere Is at all times possessed of tonlo qualities which rreauy.aia io vicum ui u. ercotn his infirmity and live a new life, Thousands of cases might be oited in which health has been restored j and life made a blessing rather than a I curse by the beneficent effects of New j Mexico's climate alone. j Weston Is a Liar by the Card. Albuquerque Citizen. An alleged lawyer named Weston has published a stereotyped batch of lies in the Denver Post regarding New Mexi co. He rather leads other defamers of the territory, there not being a single grain of truth In his whole batch of falsehoods. Favors Judge McFie's Reappointment. Red River Prospector. Judge J. R. McFie is a judge that be lieves in the enforcement of law tem pered with justice. The Prospector fa vors his reappointment to the position he now honors. Congratulating Postmaster Corry. Red River Prospector. James Corry of the Sentinel, has been appointed postmaster of Springer. Here is congratulations and hope the salary is enough to receompense him for his troubles. One More Link in the Chain. Red River Prospector. It is nothing new these days to hear of a new bank being organized in the territory. It is only one more link to the fact that capital Is looking to New Mexico for investment. It Will be Confirmed. San Marclal Bee. No one in this community is very anxious to put up even money that Governor Otero's vacancy appointment will not be confirmed by the senate. Justice of the Peace Dockets.

They are especially ruled, with printed headings, in either Spanish or English, made of good record paper, strongly and durably bound with leath er back and covers and canvas sides; have a full Index In front and the fees of justices of the peace and constables printed In full on the first page.
