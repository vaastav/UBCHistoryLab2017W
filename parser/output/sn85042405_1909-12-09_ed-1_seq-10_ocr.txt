Washington, Dec. 7.—In bis annual message, read to congress, President Taft said: To the Senate and the House of Rep resentatives: The relations of the United States with all foreign governments have con tinued upon the normal basis of amity and good understanding and are very generally satisfactory. Europe. The American rights [in the fisheries on the north Atlantic coast] under the fisheries article of the treaty of 1818 have been a cause of difference be tween the Upited States and Great 'Britain for nearly seventy years. The Interests involved are of great impor tance to the American fishing industry, and the final settlement of the contro versy [by the permanent court of ar bitration at The Hague]' will remove a source of constant irritation and com plaint. This is the first case involving such great international questions which has been submitted to the per manent court of arbitration at The Hague. Negotiations for an international conference to'consider arid reach" an arrangement irovidinjj for the preser- constant tension or turmoil. The »in«l nwitoAHnn nf Vha' fm» spnls 1'L .- -i... ration and protection of the fur seals in the'north Pacific are in progress with the governments of Grteat Britain, Japan and Russia. The attitude of the governments interested leads me to-hope for a satisfactory settlement of this question as the ultimate outcome of the negotiations. The Near East. The quick transition of the govern ment of the Ottoman empire from one of retrograde tendencies to a consti tutional government with a parlia ment and with progressive modern policies of reform and public improve ment is one of the important phenome na of our'times. Constitutional gov ernment seems also to have made further advance in Persia. These events1 have turned the eyes of the world upon the near east. Iu that quarter the prestige of the United states has^ spread widely through the peaceful influence of American schools, universities and missionaries. There Is every reason why we should obtain a greater share of the commerce of the near east since the conditions are more favorable, now than ever before, 'Latin America. One of the happiest events in recent pan-American diplomacy was the pa cific, Independent settlement by the governments of Bolivia arid Peru of a boundary difference between them, which for some weeks threatened to cause war and even to entrain im bitterments affecting other republics less.directly concerned. 1 Our Citizens Abroad. This administration, through the de partment of state and the foreign serv ice. Is lending all proper support to legitimate and beneflqial American eu- considering whether American enter prise should be encouraged or support fed in a particular country the govern v ment should'give full weight not only to the national as opposed to the Indi vidual benefits to accrue, but also to -jthe fact whether or not the gover^, 'ment of the country in question is In -v Its administration and in its diplomacy faithful to the. principles of modera 'tlon, equity and Justice upon which' Y alone depends diplomacy ip=s|.' Ihe government has long been princiifles and remains With the 1 prehension which gave, rise to the Moiiroe doctilne may be said to have nearly disappeared, and neither the doctrine as it exists nor any other doc triue of American policy should be permitted to operate for the perpetua i tion of irresponsible government, the I escape of just obligations or the insidi ous allegation of dominating ambitions on the part of the United States. My meeting with President Diaz and thg, greeting exchanged on both Amer ican and Mexican soil served. 1 hope. signalize the close and cordial rela tions which so well bind together this republic and -the great republic imme diately to the south, between which there is so vast a network of material Interests. i I am happy to say that all but one of the cases which fot so long vexed our relations with Venezuela have been settled within the past few months and that, under the enlight ened regime now directing the govern ment of Venezuela, provision has been made for arbitration of the remaining case before The Hague tribunal, i On July 30, 1909, the government of terprises in foreign countries, the de- Central Amcrica and to civilization.

This government was obliged to in tervene diplomatically to bring about arbitration or settlement of the claim of ,the Emery company against Nica ragua. which it had long before been agreed should be arbitrated. A settle ment of this troublesome case was reached by the signature of a protocol on Sept. 18. 1909. Many years ago diplomatic interven tion became necessary to the protec tion. of the interests in the American claim of Alsop & Co. against the government of Chile. The govern ment of Chile had frequently admitted obligation in the case and had prom ised this government to settle it. Then? had been two abortive attempts to do so through arbitral commissions, which failed through lack of jurisdiction. Now, happily, as the result of the re cent diplomatic negotiations, the gov ernments of the United States and of Chile, actuated by the sincere desire to free from any strain those cordial and friendly relations upon Which both set such store, have agreed by a proto col to submit the controversy to defin itive settlement by his Britannic majes ty Edward VII. The Nicaragua!* Trouble. Since the Washington conventions of 1907 were communicated to the gov ernment of the United States as a con sulting and advising party this gov ernment has been almost continuously called upon by one or another and in turn by all of the five Central Amer ican republics to exert itself for the maintenance of the conventions. Near ly every complaint has been against the Zelaya government of Nicaragua, whicli has kept Central America in sponses made "to tlie'representations of Central American republics as due from the United States on account of its relation to the Washington conven tions have been at all times conserva tive and have avoided, so far as possi ble, any semblance of interference, al though it is very appareut that the considerations of geographic proximity to the canal zone and of the very sub stantial American interests in Central America give to the United States a special position iu the zoue of these republics aud the Caribbean sea. I need uot rehearse here the patient efforts of this government to promote peace and welfare among these re publics, efforts which are fully appre ciated by the majority of them who are loyal to their true interests. It would be no less unnecessary to re hearse here the sad tale of unspeak able barbarities and oppression alleged to have been committed by the Zelaya government. Recently two Americans were put to death by order of Presi dent Zelaya himself. They were offi cers in the organized forces of a rev olution which had continued many weeks and was in control of about half of the republic, and as such, ac cording to tne modern enlightened practice of civilized nations, they were entitled to be dealt wltb as prisoners of war. At the date when this message is printed this government has termi nated diplomatic relations with the Zelaya government for reasons made public in a communication to the for mer Nicaraguan charge d'affaires and is intending to take such future steps as may be found most consistent with its dignity, its duty to American- in terests and its moral obligations to may later be necessary for me to bring this subject to the attention of the congress in a special message. In the. Far East. In the far east this government pre serves unchanged its policy of support ing the principle of equality of oppor tunity and scrupulous respect for the integrity of the Chinese empire, to which policy are pledged the interest ed powers ofi both east and west. By the treaty of 1903 China has un dertaken the abolition of likin with a moderate and proportionate raising of the customs tariff along with currency reform. These reforms being a mani fest advantage to foreign commterce as -well as to the Interests of China, this government Is endeavoring to facili tate these measures and the needful acquiescence of the treaty powers When it appeared that Chinese likin revenues were to be. hypothecated, to foreign banker* In connection, with a great railway project It was obvious that the governments whose nationals held this loan would have A certain direct Interest In the question of the carryipg out' 'by China of the reforms In question.

JAMESTOWN was as a matter of broad policy hr« Kent that this opportunity should not |e lost, the indispensable Instrumental ity presented Itself 'when a group of American bankers of International reputation and great resources agreed at once to share in the loan upon pre cisely such terms as this government should approve. The chief of those terms was that American railway ma terial should be upon an exact equality with that of the other nationals join ing in the loan in the placing of or ders for this whole railroad system. After months'of negotiation the equal participation of Americans seems at last assured.' In one of the Chinese-Japauese con ventions of Sept. 1 of this year there was a provision which caused consid erable public apprehension in that upon its face it was believed in some quarters to seek to establish a monop oly of mining privileges along the South Manchurian and Antung-Muk den railroads and thus to exclude Americans from a wide field of enter prise. to take part in which they were by treaty with China entitled. After a thorough examination of the conven tions and of the several contextual documents the secretary of state reach ed the conclusion that no such monop oly was intended or accomplished. This government made inquiry of the Imperial Chinese and Japanese gov ernments and received from each offi cial assurance that the provision had no purpose inconsistent with the poli cy of equality of opportunity to which the signatories, in common with the United States, are pledged. Our traditional relations with the Japanese empire continue cordial. ,as usual. The arrangement of 1908 for a co-operative control of the coming of laborers to the United States has proved to work satisfactorily. The matter of a revision of the existing treaty between the United States arid Japan which is terminable in 1912 is already receiving the study of both countries. The Department of State. I earnestly recommend to the favor able action of the congress the esti mates submitted by the department of state and most especially the legisla tion suggested in the secretary of state's letter of this date whereby it will be possible to develop and make permanent the reorganization of the department upon modern lines in a manner to make it a thoroughly ef ficient instrument in the furtherance of our foreign trade and of American interests abroad. Under a provision of the act of Aug. 5, 1909. I have appointed three officials to assist the officers of the government In collecting information necessary to a wise administration of the tariff act of Aug.. 5. 1009. As to questions of customs administration they are co operating with the officials of the treasury department and as to matters of the needs and tlie exigencies of our manufacturers and exporters with the department of commerce and labor in .its relation to the domestic aspect of the subject of foreign commerce. As a consequence of section 2 of the tariff act of Aug. s, 11)0!). it becomes the duty of the secretary of state to con duct as diplomatic business all the negotiations necessary to place him in a positiou to advise me as to whether or not a particular country unduly dis criminates against the United States in the sense of the statute referred to. Government ExpenJitures and Rev enues. Perhaps the most important ques tion presented to this administration is that of economy iu expenditures and sufficiency of revenue. The report of the sgfcretary shows that the ordinary expenditures for the current fiscal year ending June 30. 1910, will exceed the estimated re ceipts by $34,075,020. If to this deficit are added the sura to be disbursed for the Panama canal, amounting to $38, 000,000, and $1,000,000 to be paid on the public debt, the deficit of ordinary receipts aud expenditures will be in creased to, a total deficit of $73.0t5,020. This deficit the secretary proposes to meet by the proceeds of bonds issued to pay the cost of constructing the Panama canal. I approve this pro posal. The Panama Canal. The policy of paying for the con struction of the Panama canal not I out of current revenue, but by bond I issue, was adopted in the Spooner act i of 1902, and there seems to be no good 1 reason for departing from the princi- Jan. 1. 1915, shows that the cost of engineering and construction will be $297,700,000 instead of $139,705,200, as i originally estimated. In addition to engineering and construction, the oth er expenses, including sanitation aud government and the amount paid for the properties, the franchise and the privilege of buildlug the canal, in i crease the cost by $75,435,000 to a i total of $375,201,000. The increase "in the cost of engineering and construc tion is due to a substantial enlarge ment of the plan of construction by widening the canal 100 feet In the Cu iebra cut and by Increasing the di mensions of the locks, to the under estimate of the quantity of the work to be done under the original plan and i to an underestimate^-of- the cost of la bor and materials, both of which have greatly entoanted in price since the original estimate was made.

Happily, when v-i. possible consistent with 1m- peratlve governmental necessity. The brings the total estimates down to an remit has beep. am arivltod by amount forty-five millions leas than the1 ry ofthetreasury, that the estimates of the expenses -of the gov ernment for the' fiscal year ending June 30, 1911—that Is, for the next fiscal year—are less by $55,063,000 than the total of appropriations for the current fiscal year and less by $94,000,000 than the estimates for that year. So far as the secretary of the treasury is able to form a judgment as to future income, there will be no deficit in the year ending June 30, 1911. but a small surplus of $712,000. In the present estimates the needs of the departments aud of the gov ernment have been cut to the quick. For the purpose of securing informa tion which may enable the executive and the legislative branches to unite in a plan for the permanent reduction or the cost of governmental adminis tration the treasury department has instituted an investigation by one off the most skilled expert accountants in the United States. The object of the investigation Is to devise means to in crease the average efficiency of each employee. There is great room for im provement toward this end, not only by the reorganization of bureaus and departments and in the avoidance of duplication, but also in the treatment of the individual employee. Under the present system it constant ly happens that two employees receive the same salary when the work of one is far more difficult and important and exacting than that of the other. Su perior ability is not rewarded or en couraged. Civil Pensions. As the degree of efficiency in all the departments is much lessened by the re tention of old employees who have out lived their energy and usefulness it is Indispensable to any proper system of .economy that provision be made so that their separation from the service shall be easy and inevitable. It is im possible to make such provision unless there is adopted a plan of civil pen sions. We cannot, in view of the ad vancing prices of living, hope to save money by a reduction iu the standard of salaries paid. Indeed. If any change Is' made in that regard an increase rather than a decrease will be neces sary, and the only means of economy will be in reducing the number of employees and iu obtaining a greater average of efficiency from those re tained in the service. Frauds In the Collection of Customs. I regret to refer to the fact of the discovery of extensive frauds in the collection of the customs revenue at New York city, in which a number of the subordinate employees in the weighing and other departments were directly concerned aud in which the beneficiaries were the American Sugar Refining company and others. The frauds consisted in the payment of du ty on underweights of sugar. The gov ernment has recovered from the Amer ican Sugar Refining company all that it is shown to have been defrauded of. The sum was received in full of the amount due which might have been recovered by civil action against the beneficiary of the fraud, but there was an excess reservation in the contract of settlement by which the settlement should not interfere with or prevent the criminal prosecution of every one who was found to be subject to the same. Criminal prosecutions are now pro ceeding against a number of the gov ernment officers. The treasury de partment and the department of jus tice are exerting every effort to dis cover all the wrongdoers, including the officers and employees of the compa nies who may have been privy to the fraud. It would seem to me that an Investigation of the frauds by con gress at present, pending the probiug by the treasury department aud the department of justice, as proposed, might by giving immunity and other wise prove an embarrassment in se curing conviction of the guilty parties. Maximum and Minimum Clause In Tariff Act. Two features of the new tariff act call for special reference. In order that the maximum duty shall be charg-, ed against the imports from a country it is necessary that the executive shall i find on the part of that country not only discriminations in its laws or the I practice under them against the trade of the United States, but that the dis criminations founJ shall be undue— that is. without good and fair reason. No one is seeking a tariff war or a con dition in which the spirit of retaliation shall be aroused. maxlmum clause of the act and also to assist officers of the government in the administration of the entire law. I be lieve that the work of this board will be of prime utility and importance whenever congress shall deem It wise again to readjust the customs duties. If the facts secured by the tariff board are of such a character as to show gen erally that the rates of duties imposed by the present tariff law are excessive under the principles of protection as described in the platform of the suc cessful party at the late election 1 shall not hesitate to invite the atten tion of congress to this fact and to the necessity for action predicated there on. Nothing, however, halts business and Interferes with the course o» pros perity so much as the threatened revi sion of the tariff, and until the facts are at hnnd. after careful and deliber ate Investigation, upon which such re vision can properly be undertaken, it seems to me unwise to attempt it. War Department. In the interest of Immediate econ omy I have required a reduction in the estimates-of the war department for the 'coming fiscal, year which the corresponding estimates fur last year. This could be accomplished only by cutting off new projects and sus pending for the period of one year all progress in military matters. Kor the same reason I have directed that the army shall not he recruited up to its present authorized strength. These measures can hardly be more than temporary, for I am sure that the in terests of the military establishment are seriously In need of careful con sideration by congress. The secretary of war calls attention to a number of heeded changes in the army, in all of which I concur, but the point upon which I place most erii phasis is the need for an elimination bill providing a method by which the merits of officers shall have some ef fect upon their advancement and by which the advancement of all may be accelerated by the effective elimination of a definite proportion of the least efficient. The military and naval joint board have unanimously agreed that it would be unwise to make the large expendi tures which at one time were contem plated In the establishment of a naval base and station in the Philippine Is lands and have expressed their judg ment. in which I fully concur, iu fa vor of making an extensive naval base at Pearl Harbor, near Honolulu, and not in the Philippines. The Navy. The return of the battleship fleet from its voyage around the world in more efficient condition than when it started was a noteworthy event of in terest alike to our citizens and the naval authorities of the world. The marked success of the ships in steam ing around the world in all weathers on schedule time has Increased respect for our navy aud bas added to our na tional prestige. It is a regrettable fact that the higher officers are old for the respon sibilities of the modern navy, and the admirals do not arrive at flag rank young enough to obtain adequate train ing in their duties as flag officers. Owing to the necessity for economy in exp'enditures. I have directed the curtailment of recommendations for naval appropriations so that they are thirty-eight millions less than the cor responding estimates of last year, aud the request for new naval construction is limited to two first class battleships and one repair vessel. The secretary of the navy has inau gurated a tentative plan involving cer tain changes in the organization of the navy department, including the navy yards, all of which have been found by the attorney general to be in ac cordance with law. I have approved the execution of the plan proposed be cause of the greater efficiency and economy it promises. Department of Justice—Expedition In Legal Procedure. The deplorable delays in the admin istration uf civil and criminal law have received the attention of committees of the American Bar association and of many state bar associations as we'.l as the considered thought of judges and I son 1 shall jurists. !n ni.v judgment, a chance in public procedure, with a view to re ducing its expense to private litigants in civil cases and facilitating the dis patch of business and final decision in both civil and criminal cases, consti tutes the greatest need in our Ameri can institutions. 1 do not doubt for one moment that much of the lawless violence and cruelty exhibited in lynch ings are directly due to the uncertain ties and injustice growirig out of the delays in trials, judgments and the exe cutions thereof by our courts. I therefore recommeud legislation providing for the appointment by the president of a commission with author ity to examine the law and equity procedure of the federal courts of first Instance, the law of appeals from those courts to the courts of appeals and to th.e supreme court and the costs Imposed in such procedure upon the private litigants and upon the public treasury and make recommendation with a view to simplifying aud ex pediting the procedure as far as pos sible and making it as inexpensive as may be to the litigant of little means. The platform of the successful party In the' last election contained the fol lowing: Injunctions Without Notice. "We believe that the rules of proce dure in the federal courts with respect to the issuance of the writ of injunc tion should be more accurately defined by statute-and that no injunction or temporary restraining order should be issued without notice, except where irreparable' Injury would result from delay, in which case a speedy hearing thereafter should be granted." I recommend that in compliance with the promise thus made appropriate leg islation be adopted. Moreover, every such injunction or restraining order issued without previous notice and op portunity hv the defendant to be heard should bv force of the statute expire and be of no eftect after seven days from the issuance thereof or within any time less (ban that period which the court may fix unless within such seven days or such less period the in junction or order is extended or re newed after previous notice and op portunity to be heard. Anti-trust and Interstate Commerce Laws. The jurisdiction of the general gov ernment over Interstate commerce bas Postoffice Department 8scend Class Mail Matter. The deficit every year In the post office department Is largely caused by ted to the passage of the so called ther reason. It is well to note that the "Sherman anti-trust law" and the "in terstate commerce law" and its amendments. The developments in the operation of those laws call for a dis cussion and some suggestions as to amendments. .These I prefer to em body in a special messagfe. the low rate of postage of 1 pound charged on second Class matter, which Includes uot only papers, but magaziues and mimdBfc oeous periodicals. The actual loss lng out of the transmission of second class mail matter at 1 mat m. pound amounts fo .about $(53,000,X» year. The average cost of the itr portation of this .matter is inor* 0 cents a pound. 'The statistics of 19KT' Show that second class mall uta£tar constituted 0.5.91 pej^ cent of timt weight of all the mail and yie&M only 5.19 per cent of the revenue. The figures given are startling aaiK s'-ow the payment by the government of an enormous subsidy to the ue*» papers, ir".gnzines and periodicals.

I believe postal savings banks to be necessary in order to offer .a proper inducement to thrift aud saving to a. great many people of small means wb» do not now have banking facilities aadi to whom such a system would offer u opportunity for the accumulation of capital. They will furnish a satisfactory substitute, based on sound principle, and actual successful trial iu neatly! all the countries of the world, for the system of government guaranty mt: deposits now beiug adopted in several western states which, with defereaee to those who advocate it, seems to ne: to have in it the seeds of demoratte tion to conservative banking and cer tain financial disaster. Ship Subsidy. Following the course of my dlstfia guished predecessor, I earnestly rec ommend to congress the considers!!** and passage of a ship subsidy bill. Interior Department—New Mexico aad Arizona. The successful party in the last elec tion in its national platform declared in favor of the admission as separate states of New Mexico and Arizona, and I recommend that legislation ap propriate to this end be adopted. Alaska. With respect to the territory of Alas ka, 1 recommend legislation which shall provide for the appointment by the president of a governor aud also of an executive council, the members of which shall during their term at office reside in the territory and whicb shall have legislative powers suflicient to enable it to give to the territory lo cal laws adapted to its present growth. 1 strongly deprecate legislation looking to the election of a territorial legisla ture in that vast district. Conservation of Natural Resources. In several (icpartrnents there is pre sented the necessity for legislation looking to the further conservation of our national resources, and the sub ject is one of such importance as fit require a more detailed and extended discussion tlian can be entered upon in this communication. I-'or that rea aUe an early r.pporlimii.r to send a special message to cnrigir.'w.' Tlie White Slave Trade. There is urgent necessity (or addi tional legislation aud greater execnihr activity to suppress'the recruiting -of: the ranks of prostitutes from the streams of immigration into this coun try—an evil which, for want of a bet ter name, has been called "the white slave trade."

Conclusion. Speaking generally, the country is in a high state of prosperity. There is every reason to believe that we are the eve of a substantial business ex pansion, and we have just garnered a harvest unexampled in the market val ue of our agricultural products. The high prices which such products bring mean great prosperity for the farming community but. on the other bauiL they mean a ver.y considerably lncr«ia ed burden upon those classes iu this coiuiuuuitv whose vearlv compensation does not expand with the improvement IU business and the general prosperity.
