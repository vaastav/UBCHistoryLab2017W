Recalled "In September, 1915. it was discover ed that Ambassador I'umha and Aus trian consuls in St. Loul and elsewhere were implicated In Instigating strikes in American manufacturing plants en gaged in the production of munition of war. An American citizen named Archbald, traveling under an American passport, had been entrusted with dis patches In regard to this matter from Iiumba and Rernstorff to their govern ments. These act were admitted by Dumba. "Ry reason of the admitted purpose and Intent of Pumba to conspire to cripple business industries In the Unit ed State, and by reason of the flagrant violation of diplomatic propriety In em ploying an American citizen protected by an American pasport as a secret bearer of official dlspatchr through the lines of an enemy of Auatrta-Hungary. the Austro'Hungaiian government was requested to recall I)umhn. 'The Austrian consul at St. Louis and New York were Implicated with Dumba in these transaction, particular ly In the circulation of strike propa ganda.

Regarding International commerce the president contends that the Imme diate object of the warring nations con sists of depriving enemies of all re sources but conserving at the same time their own Interior elements of economic order and establishing differ entials toward or against nations, as regards their relative value and im portance. The ground taken by President Car- ranza Is that although these measures are directed against enemies, neverthe less they hurt neutrals and without lust cause, compelling them to take adequate steps to defend their vitality or on the contrary, sooner or later to succumb.
