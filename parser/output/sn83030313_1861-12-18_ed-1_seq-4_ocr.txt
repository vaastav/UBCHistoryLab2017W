The importance of the question relative to the arrest of Mason and Slidcll and the difficulty with Kngland arising therefrom is further manifested by the fact that the steamer Africa which was to have sailed for Liverpool to-duy has been detained until to morrow afternoon, by order of Lord Lyons, for the purpose of transmitting by her his response to tho despatches which came from the British go vernment by a special Queen's messenger on board the Enropa. Captain Seymour, the Queen's mes senger, and n special messenger from our Minister at London, llr. Adams, left Boston last evening for Washington by the shore route, via this citv. They will probably 'arrive here in time for the morning train to Washington, and thus be enabled to bring back the despatches of Lord Lyons in time for the Africa. It may be, however, that the Africa will not leave this port before Friday morn ing, if the important business engrossing the Bri tish Minister cuunot be accomplished at an-earlier period. In thirty minutes after tho Europa touched n Halifax the British sloop-of-war Rinaldo got up steam and started off with despatches, most j>toba. My for the Admiral of the North American squad ron at Havana. With the exception of a few scouting parties there is nothing of active character going on in General McC'Iellau's army. The report .of General Barnard, Chief Engineer of the Army, which lias just been submitted to Congress by General Cameron, shows lhat tho de fences around Washington consist of forty-eight works, mounting three hundred guns; that the whole defensive perimeter occupied is about thirty five miles?exceeding by several miles the famous tieldworks of Torres Vedas, the most extensive fortification of this kind known in modern times. General Barnard asks theappropr' tion of 1150,000 rrom Congress for the completion of these works, as many of them were thrown up in the racc of the enemy, and therefore require considerable labor to make them perfect. Secretary Cameron has also submitted to Congress a report in favor ol the appropriation of t-1,710,000 for putting our coast defences in order, from the lakes round to Kan Francisco, a large P >rtio.'i of which is to be devoted to defences of New Vork harbor. The Navy Department h ,s received int ' gen.-e that the ship liontmorenci, ol rath,Me., was over hauled on the 28th ultimo by th< pi - -.miter while making for St. Thonuts with u cargo of coals or the British Mail Rtcamshqi Compunv. iti-i said that she was ransomed for f.'0,000 and ullowed to proceed. i nc cxctiaugc or rebel prisoners has commenced. The bark Island City left Boston yesterday for Fortress Monroe with two hundred and fifty of the rebels coptnred fit Hatteres, who have been rc 'eased from captivity at Fort Warren by the government. We publish to-day further details of the great (Ire in Charleston, which prove it to be a mo-t terrific and disastrous conflagration. The news from Kentucky to day is interesting. Our army has reached within a short distance of Bowling Green, towards which point the rebel Ge neral Buckner is also hastening to otter battle. The Union troops have repaired the bridge over Green river, and ure ready to push on towards Nashville, under General Buell, when that officer is ready to take the field in person, which will be in a few duys. Feu thousuud Union troops have been poured iuto Kentucky from Indiana within the past ten days. The rebels were said to bo in hourly expectation of an attack at Columbus, and that they had pre pared a number of heavy anchor cables for the purpose of obstructing the navigation of the river at that point. Among the interesting items from the South, by way of Fortress Monroe, we have the statement of llio Lynchburg Virjinian that a whole Maryland regiment, colonel, stall and all the ofiicers, de serted recently from the Union army and marched into Centrcville with the confederate flag flying. We are not informed, however, what regiment it was, when it deserted, or where it got the rebel Sag so conveniently at the moment of desertion. The ( Uarleston Courier publishes a report from Beaufort that our troops had crossed Port Royal ferry under rover or artillery on Tuesday last, nud destroyed several or the rebel rifle pits on the main land. The Paris Pays of the 1Mb November guys that the war in America is every day increasing the ,uictudc in Kngland in regard to the cott >n question. Ia view of the difiicuiliea and embar rassment* resulting to the industry of tho thrco kingiloma from tide a .ate of tilings, speculators have tinned their attention to India, and although tlm cotton of India may be inferior to that of Ame rica, na important company has jiwt been formed in England, with a capital of ?"00,000 sterling, for an increase of the cultivation of cotton in India A company for the transportation of Indian cotton has also been formed, and by a fusion of their rela tive interests the two companies, operating to gelher witli a common view, will, without doubt, vender eminent service to English manufactures. CONGRESS. In tho United Statt s .Senate yesterday the House hill for raising a volunteer force for the defence oi Kentucky was rcfurred to the Military Committee. Scverui petitions were presented for emancipating the slaves of rebels. A bill was reported to Increase the number of cadcjts at West Point. A resolution requesting the Commissioner of Public Buildings to inform the Senate by what authority a portiou of the Capitol had been con verted into a bakery was agreed to. A resolu tion that the army shall not be employed in the surrender of fugitive slaves was laid over. Reso lutions asking why passengers from New York to San Francisco were required to tako out passports, and that a copy of the correspondence between J Generals Scott and Patterson bo furnished to tho Senate, were agreed to. Mr. Sumner introduced Iiis bill in relation to the French spoliations claims. Mr. Lane called up the resolution respecting the Secretary of War furnishing the Senate with copies ol tho orders for building barracks lor the Kansas troops, and in a Rpcocii criticised the action of the government iu the conduct of the war, animad vert ing severely on the inactivity of our troops, and saying that it was a military necessity our army should occupy the rebel States. Mr. Lane cou teuded that the govcrtuneul should take possession of the slaves in order to force their neuters into submission. He was replied to by Mr. Carlilc, who said he was convinced that the govern ment had made a great mistake in not appoint ing Mr. Lane commander of the army, lie (Mr. Cnrlile) contended that the war was n constitu tional one, and the army could not be turned into negro catchers. After a few remarks from Mr. Me Doug,i II in opposition, on motion of Mr. (Irimes, the resolution wa iuid on the table, 'flic case of the Kansas conte.-ted Senatorial seat was taken up, but action postponed until to-day. The t'liair ap pointed Messrs. Wade, of Ohio: Chandler. o( Michi gan, and Johnson, of Tennessee, as the committee [ to investigate the general conduct of the war. Tho House resolution for an adjournment until January f> was laid on the table. An executive ses sion was held, and tho Senate adjourned. in the House Mr. Bingham, from the Judiciary Committee, reported back the joint resolutions requiring the Provost Court nt Alexandria, Va., to hold the property of rebels until Congress take further action on the subject. The resolution then passed. The resolutions of Mr. Eliot, for the eman cipation of slaves, being the special order, were then resumed. Mr. Harding offered some points in opposition to them-that Congress has no con stitutional power to pass any hills on the subject, that the administration stands pledged against all interference with slavery, that legislation is for bidden on the subject by every principle of sound policy, and t hat tliey would inaugurate a disgraceful war, involving loyal and disloyal in its horrors en motion of Mr. Kellogg, the resolutions ami all Others relating to the subject in the same special order, were referred to the Judiciary Committee by a vote of 77 against A rei~oha'?'i r??' Printing fifteen thousand copies of the report of the special committee to inquire into government contracts was referred to the Committee on Printing. Mr. Van Wyck ' h tirmau of the Investigating Committee, submit ted resolutions against making any further pay ments on account or the charter of the steamboat ( ataline, to iiiljust tlm claim against the govrrn ni-nt lor live thousand Hall carbines purchased by (Jem nil Fremont, and stating that the practice of employing irresponsible parties for the performance' of public duties, and the purchase ol supplies by private contracts, are Injurious to the public sor Wee. ami meet the unqualified disapprobation of the House. Tim consideration of the report was postponed. Bids w-ro passed suspending the ap pointment of asses,..,-- and collectors of the income f'x until the 1st of April next, and for the allyt. inent ol pay certificates among volunteers. Bills were also reported making appropriations for pensions, and to pay consular and diplomatic ex pcuses for the year ending June 30, 18(13 , A 1,m w,ls sported from the Foreign A Hair!

The Cuiuird mail slmimsnip Ruvopa reached Bos. ton from Halifax yesterday afternoon, with the European mails of the 'id of December. The let ters and newspaper tiles were duly forwarded New York, and will arrive in the city for delit . at an early hour this morning. The screw steamer City of Washington, which passed t'ape itace hist Sunday forenoon, will he due at this.port to-mor row (Thursday) evening, with English and French journals of the 4th instant. By these arrivals we will be put in possession of the full details of the progress of the war excitement prevailing in England at the time our telegraphic reports, pub" Malted last Monday morning in the Hkkalo, were compiled, and ihtis be enabled to foira a more ac curate judgment as to its reality, intensity and force.

In the General Sessions yesterday Thomas Par rc!J, charged with passing a $5 counterfeit bill on tiio Farmers' and Mechanics' Bank of Philadelphia, pleeded guilly to forgery in the fourth degree, and was sent to the House of Refuge. George Grisoom, who was indicted for assaulting Kllcn O'Brien, oi 179 Laurens ftreet, on the 91st of July, was acquitted. Tho trial ol James Kilhry, in dicted for the murder of h:s wife, was commenced liofore the Recorder. It is charged that the ac cusod struck her a blow on the abdomen, which caused lh" premature delivery of a child, and sub sequently resulted in her death. The parties lived ut the corner of Eighty-first street and Eighth uve nue. The assault was committed ou tho iat of October, and she died at tho Bellevue Hospital on the 13th of the same month. The case will be finished to day. Th-' cotton markot was Arm yesterday.

Here is tlic American nation embarked in the most gigantic war ever waged, with an array of six hundred and seventy thousand men, and ?i navy of throe or four hundred ships, at an expenditure of about two millions per day Hitherto the war has been carried on by means of loans. The sum of one hundred and fifty millions of dollars has been obtained by the government in that way, parily from the bunk" ers, and partly from the people. In three weeks the balance of that amount will have been ex pended, and not a dollar lie left in the national Treasury, nor any provision made to replenish it. At this critical moment intelligence arrives from Europe, from which it appears wo are menaced with a foreign war in addition to our domestic struggle. The consequence is that Wall stroot is thrown into confusion, stocks of all kinds are affected from five to ten per cent, and foreign exchanges have risen to 112, with few takers. There is suspense, stagnation, pa ralysis. In the midst of this monetary and financial crisis, how do wo find Congress employed ? Is it in devising the wuys and means of sustaining the war? Bo far from it, the halls of Con gress arc turned into bear gardens, and we behold the pitiable spectacle of disgraceful personal altercations and preposterous debates about the everlasting nigger. It is the most horrible exhibition of human folly to be wit nessed on (he face of the earth. There is no necessity lor any legislation about slavery, and all talk about ills out of place. So far as the question has any practical bearing it is not the business of Congress to dispose of it, but of the generals of the army, responsible only to the President, who is commander-in-chief. Let each general in Ids own district adopt such measures in regard to 1hc slaves as seem best calculated to render the campaign successful in that particular section of the countiy. The laws of war and the exigencies of the case will be his surest guide, and-Congrees can ouly do mischief by meddling with the matter. As far as concerns the claims and rights of those slaves who may be employed in the service of the Union army, either by their own voluntary act or by the impressment of the military, the whole subject ought to be postponed till after the war. when it can easily bo disposed of by the existing fundamental laws. The constitu tion will settie it. and the laws of the State Legislatures. Congress has no power over the question, and if it had it ought not to touch it. What is the pressing duly of Congress at this hour.' If is to proude funds to canyon the war for the Union. That is its proper sphere of action, instead of drivelling negro slavery, with which it has as to do as it has with the Koran. Money is the life of war. Without it nothing can be done. The possession of gold is necessary in order to obtain from foreign nations what we w.uit, unless the balance of trade is greatly in our favor. But the balance of trade will soou be against us, and the gold of the country w ill have to go to pay it,end speedily it may be spirited away by t'ue English and other foreign bankers in Wall st reet, whose business it is not to leave us a dol lar in gold or silver. The government would thus be without the means of pur chasing in foreign countries the material it may need for the war. How is this disastrous con dition of tide s to lie prevented? l!y the sus pension of ie payment by the banks, and by the crcat .1 of a paper money by Congress, '?-c-ed upon the credit and property of the nu ^u. and redeemable after the war. This would become a circulating medium of exchange for the internal trade of the country as good as gold, and rendering gold unnecessary, unless for the payment of foreign balances. In all great and sudden wars some such measure as this must be adopted by the bel ligerents; for no machinery of government can raise sufllt ut money iu the brief space of time it is requii I. It is a necessity of State which ea mot be avoided. The example of England in the long continental wars which grew out of the French Revolution, nnd in Which she had to struggle for her own existence, is a lesson to all other nations under the same circumstances At first alio tried to carry ou the war on the specie basis; but she broke down in 1797. and was compelled to fall back on a sysh m of paper money guaranteed I>4- the national faith. This carried her triumphantly through, and at the close of the war she returned to die specie basis, the oniy sound one for ? time of peace; for paper money, without gold or property to back it. is worthless, ami cannot be the basis of commercial transactions. It took England, however, a period of seven years to gradually re. tore iV normal condition and specie paw I meats. In the same war France was com- ' pelted to adopt the ?me course; and nothing else is leit lor the American republic. ^ I.et Congress, therefore, immediately pass an ! act ua hor'/iug the administration to issue notes jf alt denominations on lb- security of the I 'national, credit, b a in unit may be josti -'d b> ? ? exigencies ol wur.

There ia thua the sum of two hundred mil lions of specie, which ought to bo kept in die country for tho purpose of paying foreign balances, and for tho use ol tin government. hicli, in this c ise, is for tho u.u; of the Bttlon. The paper issued by the authority ol'Oongress will serve :ih a safe curreucy lor the purposes of interna! trade, including nil such articles as the government may purchase in the country. What il need.-; from foreign nations it will than have gold in abundance to buy, and our mer chants will always he able to procure specie at a reasonable rate to pay their foreign balances. This is tlio needful business in which (Jou grcss ought to be engaged, instead of specu lating on abstract visionary questions of uo practical bearing ou the momentous issue in volving our existence as a nation. Not a mo ment ought to be lost, especially in view of tho possible contingency of a war with England If the national legislature do uot act promptty not only will the government be without a dol lar to defray its enormous expenditure, but the gold will all find its way out of the country through the agency of the foreign bankers in Wall street, and then the action of Congress will be too lute. The lost gold cannot be re called, and success in the struggle with the do' mestic foe, to say nothing of a foreign eaeiny, may be baffled, not for want of men, or courage( or skill, but for lack of the thews and sinews of GlON'KttAI, I'llKI.Ph' Sll.r.Y AbOI.ITION 1'llOCI.A mation.?General Phelps, in command of the U'ivtmce brigade of otir troops at Ship Hand, Mississippi, belonging to General Butler's ex pedition, sei/.ed the occasion of bis occupation of said island for the production of a very silly abolition proclamation. It is addressed "to the loyal citizens of the Southwest," and it opens with the astounding declaration that his command will bo governed by the absurd idea "that every State tliut has been admitted as a slave Stale into the Union since the adoption of the constitution has been so admitted in direct violation of that constitu tion." Now. we dare say that there are not ten men in the brigade of General ['helps who will subscribe to any such fallacy, and that there is hardly one man in a thousand among our six hundred and fiity thousand Union soldiers .who believes in any such nonsense. He next fells the people of Mississippi, Alabama and Louisi ana that their territory is needed for free labor; that the people of the North want elbow room, and that the people of the Southwest, in sticking to their abominable institution of slavery, arc standing very much in their own light. Not satisfied with all this, he tolls the Catho lie Creoles of Louisiana that it was the in tolerable despotism of the Catholic church of France which brought down upon thut country that horrible, ghastly and sweeping revolution oi 1781), with its lietgn of Teiror. and that the despotism of slavery is quite as grasping and remorseless as the despotism of a corrupt and powerful church. Finally, ho informs those Southwestern people that "all our efforts, how ever small or great, whether directed ugainsl the interference of governments abroad or against rebellious combinations at home, shall be for free labor," including free labor for "the four millions of Africans" held as slaves in our Southern Slates. This beats Fremont all hollow; and if Fie" monl was instructed by President Lincoln to modify his proclamation, bv cutting out its emancipation heresies, there can be no doubt that General Phelps will bo required to take down his enormous abolition standard. General Phelps has the reputation of an excel lent soldier; but he is u poor slick of a politi cian. Among Catholics lie plays the Puritan, uuiong Cavaliers he is a Roundhead, and he appeals to the loyalty of slaveholders by flatly informing them that his mission is to relieve them of their slave property, ami to substitute freeinbor; that (lie war Is for this purpose; that ho expects no favors, and does not ask any. It is a pity that General Phelps was permitted to go tu Ship island without specific instructions from the government. His proclamation, in stead of w nu'ng friends among the people to whom it is addressed, will increase the number an l violence of his enemies. General Butler, General !>ix. General Sherman and General llalleck, in their operations among a slave-hold ing people, have acted like sensible and saga cious men. We presume, too, that General Butler, in assuming ihe supreme command in "the Southwest," will issue an authoritative proclamation to the effect that this war on his part, and on the part of his government, is not a war for the substitution of free labor over the domains of Southern slavery, but that it is a war for Ihe " integrity of the Union," s'.avevy ^md all. as guaranteed in the clear and unutis takeablt' Compromises of the Constitution of die United Suites. Meantime the President, as commander-iti chief or the army and navy, should issue at ouce a genet al proclamation Tor the universal guid ance of our army and naval officers engaged, or who may bo engaged, in this war. This will avoid any such fottxptts for the future as this very pompous, but very silly, abolition procla mation of General Phelps. Gt f.KKff.r.A .Motions r.\ Goxokkss.?Such reso lutions as those offered by Mr. Trumbull in the Senate, and by Mr. Vallandigham in the ftouse of Representatives, on Monday last, can be pre sented with no other object than that of embar rassing tiie administration. No really patriotic man would thus dream of hampering its action. In war times it is the duty of legislators to strengthen the hands of government, and not to weaken them, oven when their views do uot co incide with its policy. When peace is restored they will have an opportunity of holding it to an accountability for the errors it may have committed. To attempt to fetter the conclu sions ot the t abiueton a question so momentous in its consequences us thai now pending between us and I'.iiglaiid is as bad as to impeach acts j which liiive notoriously been performed under | the pressure of .-lute necessity.

Besides this 'Term und figure fit " Ray mond has had u long and extensive connection * ith railroad, stock and other jobs, a?d 1)llH rc. cently displayed considerable ability in otTerine gambling bets. However those considerations ni.iy weigh with others, wo confess that thev seem to us to fit him excellently for the oflhe o Speaker; and, a.i he has failed in editing a newspaper, we siucerely hojre that he will be more success fill in attaining that oftice at Alba ny for which his great talents so peculiarly fit htm. Indeed, his election may be ciphered to a certainty; for not only has be the support of bolh the Seward and Greeley re publicans, but also that of a few shaky demo crats, to whom he intends giving a dinner in this city before long, as a means of securing und clinching their support. In return for the support of the Greeley re publicans, Mr. Raymond will give Greeley every possible aid as chief of the lobby. To this position Greeley seems unanimously chosen He looks the lobbyist to perfection, and years ago bad a littlo practice at lobbying, in connec tion with the Desinoinos Improvement Com pany. Lately ho has been keeping his band in t.y experiments in gold pen lotteries, gambling bets and live hundred dollar wagers on the municipal election with a celebrated Harlem lane cockflghlcr.

Irish relief fund must bo paid?and Greeley's best, now that he lias (bund um true vocation, is by no means to be despised, if he. and Raymond as Speaker, cannot manage the lobby, nobody can. Disappointed in our desire to make Wood Mayor, wc shall certainly succeed in making Raymond Speaker and Greeley ohief of the lobby. There are no better men for the posi tions. and they ought to be appointed. Otw Gain Demon.- -The critical aspect of our present relations with Kngiand imparts a pressing importance to the recommendations contained in Mayor Wood's recent communica tion to the Hoard of Aldermen. So far as the strengthening of our hat I,or defences is con cerned, tbero is no doubt that they will meet with prompt attention from the federal and State authorities. There is much, however, to be ?lone besides mere engineering and field work to render our port secure against the enemy Without men to work our batteries and to dV iend the coast in our vicinity against any at tempt at a landing by a hostile force, all the money thai would be thus expended would be thrown away, it is quite certain that, we shall not be able to withdraw for these purposes any ot our troops from Virginia or the other border States. It we are to have a war with Kngland we shall have to create another army nearly as large as that which we licve now in the field To prevent, (br instance, the enemy landl tng on Long Island and taking possession or the heights opposite New York, we shall re quire at least a force of fifty thousand men For these we shall have to depend on such ex ertions as we can make within the nexj, few months. Not a minute should lie lost in en rolling as Home Guards all the young and able bodied men of our city population, between the ages of eighteen and forty-five, with a view to putting them through the .prolm*I nary drill that will be required for effective militia organiza tion. From llie standing militia regiments ar tillery companies should be selected and cm ployed daily at battery practice, both in the field and harbor fortifications. If this be done, we shall have in a few months a force sufficient to meet any that the Fnglish can land against us. Again let us urge upon our fellow citizens not to lose an hour in enrolling themselves for the public defence.
