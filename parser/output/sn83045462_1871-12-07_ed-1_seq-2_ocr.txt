EVENING STAR T %. ROTI Largest Cirrvlatioiii the District Beading Matter on Every Page. Washington city-. Ull i:*l>AY ntrrmbfr 7, 1*71. Th? Wltfl WMtf. t.en. Pabcoch, as chief engineer of the Wash irgton Ac4u? ilnct. firm notice to the public tha' the wasted aqoednet water most be ?toppe I. He attr?t>u?r# the deficiency of water to the fact that householders and other* allow the water to run to ??.?(*; to pr? Tent the pipes from freesing No doubt there in waste. in thin and other way* by the public,bnt the Water iHpartncent cU.a?> th;?t the gri at and extravagant waste of water is by the guvrniii nt departments and n<?t by the ritiieu (Irtat vigilance ha* been u-edhy th* Water 1>? i artaaent to atop leaks and prevent wa-.tr by the citixens. but at the governm^nt departm. rt>. where the water officers have no control, the naste is excessive, and the aqueduct w atcr i> ?4<l an though it were as free as air. And this waste of water is mainly for running nisrhici ry and to effect a trivial saving in ex pense of motive jower?a saving with a ven gc?ntt n hen it deprives all the upper part of the city ot wat? r and puts ill the city at the merry of a centlagr?..?>n by reducing the water in the miiins to th< minimum ! At the Tn a?ry Department a turbine wheel if ran by water; at the Navy Department a con tlessor is used. and the aqueduct water kept rnnning t<> waste all day long through an inch snd a half pip?* taring to the government by the iw of water ovr the use of coal a pitiful dollar or two a day. At other departments there is similar watfr, either through the use of the water for mechanical purposes, or from the manner in which it is allowed to run perpetually at water clouts and wash basins. Of course the government has the first right to the use of the Potomac water, but It never could hare been contemplated to bring it here at such heavy cost to be used in running machinery to the deprivation of half lite city of water, and at the risk of the sacrifice of valuable government property by tire through inadequacy of water ?apply- mi Henry Ward Beecher deems it necewary to explain his ?? rmoa of last Sunday night, on the agency of spirits in the affairs of this world, and write* to the New York TVt&nne that he did not iliKiu* "spiritualism" as that term is now un derstood, but the scriptural teaching respecting the Divine Spirit. Modern "Spiritualism" waa barely alluded to, but without affirmation or denial. He acknowledges that he looks with profound interest upon all wise efforts to eduoe the scientific truth from that extraordinary class of phenomena which have become so common in c.nr day, and to which, at length?in England at least?the attention of men of the highest scien tific attainment has been serioosly turned; but says he has never yet been convinced that these remarkable nxxlern phenomena originated trom the interposition of spirits outside of the human l>ody. The reporters say that there was no tipping of their table during the sermon of last Sunday night the spirits seeming absorbed i:i the eloqtn nt pastor*s discourse; but several wit nesses testify that during the singing of the last hymn Mr. Beecher's gum shoes became vio lently agitated, and gave every evidence of the frantic attempt* ot some "invisible ag?nt" to try tk(m<m. All at once they were dashed against the partition which separates the platform from the v* stibule behind it, and this the witnewtea declare clearly demonstrates that the "agent" ? a? liable to sudden 5ts of anger, and lost his temper u| on discovering that number eight gum shoes won i go over number nine boots even for a spirit. ^ The d? m<H ratio member* of Congress seem to l?e quite as muih at sea as the democracy at large, in r? t,ard to the course to be pursued on the question of "to be. or not to be"?of commit ting snkuk by the "passive policy," or of making another desperate effort for individual c .isttnc?-. They find, after an interchange of information that there is not a single one of the 1.3 republican m> mhers of the House who Is v illing to ci nit out snuarely in opposition to (?rant. Those who dislike him concede that if 1 e i> nominated they must sup]>ort him. The democrat* cannot, therefore, quite figure out ? hat they will make by surrendering their quar ter ol a million of voters to a mythical anti-Grant republican party that has not a single represen tative in t'ongreaa. The republican voters of Webster, Mass., by an arrangement cmiorsed by the representative ot their district. Mr. Hoar, who will accede to their wish. ? so far as his infiuenre goes, voted yesterday by ballot" Yea" or " No" u|>on the c uc?tion '? Do you think it expedient that there be a charge of postmaster in the town of Web ster If a majority of all ballots received shall l>e in the negative, no other voting wdl be had; but in case snob majority shall be in the affirma tive. a meeting will be held to vote by ballot for a person tn be- recommended as the succemor of the present ncumbent. We have not yet been informed of the result, and so far as the post ma-terslup is concerned it is a matter of little iiu!>ortanci. but a? a hint toward civil service retorm in one dir. ction. at least, the arrange ment is sicr.ilicant. " .lobs In the District legislature," is the lieaehng give n by the New York Herald corre sjondent to bis notice of the report of the com n.ttee recommending the Savage site for a mar ket. He says: " The ne-rthera residents of the capital want a public nixiket, and Mr. Core*oran, the rich m in ot Washington, tenders a vacant square on the main line or traffic for #100,000, and otters to Hive tbe money to the Nation*!

This utter the Commit tee on Markets have refused, ami have bound the city to the purchase of a piece of swamp land on Mtmc of the side streets for fW.iM). thn e tim- ? its value, and with f 15,000 of the I'Urcha*. ns-nev sunk in a dwetling-liouse that I a* to be ]>nil? d down to make room for the m ?r ket. Mr. Corcoran has gone oft angry to Eu IOI*." ? MC ? There is said to be a novel religious movement . n foot, nothing lew than a revival among the ^eniety of Friends, which, commencing in the V tat, has extended to New York. Thia denomi i it.on, a* is well known, has hitherto been noted .< r its conservatism and non-aggressive policy, it a new spirit has taken poeneaeioa 9f the i. embers, and they now propose to take a more :j. five part in evangelical work. This move vent is called a revival by tbe Friends thea - Ives, and is now in blast in Brooklyn, here largely attended meetings have been in l ogress since the 30th ot November. As the Prince of Wales gets better the mon ?'chy gets worse. There is something more in the indifi.rewee of tbe English people to his re cent dangerous condition than the personal un l-opularity of the Pru.ce, and that Is the growth Ot deanocratie sentiment and the decay of loyalty.
