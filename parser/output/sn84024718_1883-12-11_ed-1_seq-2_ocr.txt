TUESDAT, DECEMBER 11, 1883 Mahone's Slander Endorsed by S. Brown Allen and W. E. Craig. Mahone, in his address, says that the crack of the weapon resounded and the Bourbon knife sank deep in Augusta, and S. Brown Allen and W. E. Craig, natives and residents of this county, endorse that ad dress, and thus say that Mahone's outrage ous slander of our county, is not a slander, but the truth. Who could have believed that there was a single man in this county that would do as these men have done? Mahone says; of the blacks, "that they were shot in the back like dogs while they were running away; that no pistol shot was fired by a black man; that no white man was injured, save by his own friends; that for days the poor victims were found dead in alleys, in warehouses, and under houses, like poisoned rats that had crawled away to die; that the negroes fled to the woods, to the State of North Carolina, to the four winds of heaven; that these are a few of the facts of this bloody, wholesale mur der, which was telegraphed far and near by Bourbons as an insolent uprising of the blacks against the whites," and S. Brown Allen and W. E. Craig say that it is a true indictment! This may furnish debating societies with a question for discussion: — "Whether these men should be iv a lunatic asylum or in a house of correction?" Are there any others in this county who endorse Mahone's slander of the citizens of this county? If there be, let them make themselves known and wo will give them the benefit of publication. It may be of service to them, as Mahone may do something for them when he learns what good and loyal citizens of Augusta they are. What We Understand to be Carlisle's View. It seems to be generally understood that Speaker John G. Carlisle is opposed'to the abolition of the internal revenue system. We do not so understand it. He is—as we understand his view to be—in favor of its abolition, but not at this time, for the rea son that the revenue from the present tariff is not sufficient for the necessary expenses of the Government, aud that he is in favor of such a modification of tb t e present tariff as will cause it to increase the revenue from that source sufficiently to meet all the necessary expenses, and theu the internal reveuuo system should be abolished. His theory is, that by a reduction of the tariff duties, the increase of imports will increase the revenue to the amount needed, and theu the internal revenue system of taxa tion can be abolished without crippling the finances of the Government. « * Senate of Virginia.—The Senate on Thursday adopted a joint resolution pro viding for a committee, consisting of five from that body and nine from the House of Delegates, to draft a bill apportioning the State for members of Congress. The reso lution requires that the new districts shall be composed of continguous counties, aud that they shall contain as nearly as possi ble the same population. The coalitionists opposed the suspension of tho rules for the purpose of passing the resolution out of its order. The Senate also passed a resolution pro viding for a joint committee of five from the Sonate and eight from the House to in vestigate tiie charges of mismanagement on the part of the board of managers of the Deaf, Dumb and Blind Institution at Staun ton. General Wickham offered a resolution proposing to amend the constitution so as not to make petit larceny a disfranchising offense: also, a bill providing that all school taxes shall be paid in money. In accordance with the resolution of the democratic ctucU3 recommending members of Senate committees, Gen. Wickham was made chairman of the finance committee of that body. Senator McDonald, of Indiana, a promi nent Democratic aspirant for the Presi dency, expresses hsmself as delighted at the election of Mr. Carlisle to tho Speaker ship. He regards him as a safe, conserva tive mau, being in favor of a tarifi' for rev enue, and iv favor of such protection as that tariff gives to the industries of the country; or, in other words, a tariff for revenue, with incidental protection. Mr. McDonald says this is his posi ion, as well as that of the Western Democracy He says that if the Democrats in 1884 should go into the Presidential campaign upon a platform in harmony with Mr. Carlisle's position on the tariff they will certainly win. Ex-Gov. Hendricks has also been inter viewed. He said that Mir, Carlisle should be judged by the results of his administra tion of Ihe office of Speaker, and not by his location. "I do not think," ho said, "that the sectional cry should be raised against any man, and certainly not against Mr. Carlisle, who was a Unionist where it took splendid courage to be so." •—a>—• 1 Endorsing Mahone's Address.—The Washington Republican gives the names of 90 Coalitionists, —re-published by the Rich. Whig —who met in the Arlington Hotel in Washington, and, ou the motion of Lewis E. Harvie, unanimously endorsed tiia.hone'a address. The names aro given from each of the Congressional districts, and those from this District are the following:— Hon. H. H. Riddleberger, Robert J. Walk er, M. Gary, A. K. Grim, G. M. Zerkle, William E. Craig, and S. Blown Allen. Language is iuadqeuate to express tho enormity of that offense. The Lynchburg Advance says that, "there are cases where impeachment is to be de sired as a means to deter corrupt officials from stepping beyond vested in them. In this State there are men who hive disgraced high positions of honor and trust and should bo summarily dealt with. Any man who slanders his constituency disgraces tho office to which he has been elected by the people—known to be corrupt and unprincipled should be removed from office, and has no right to ask leniency or charity." ■ aa, . Earthquake Shocks in Arkansas.— Seven shocks of earthquake occurred last Wednesday at Rovendeu Springs, Ark.— They lasted forty secondß. and broke glass ware and crockery in stores and houses. Large rocks wore loosened and fell in tho cuts of the Kansas City, Springfield aud Memphis railroad near by. The shocks were accompanied by a loud noise, and there was a violent jar of the earth. ♦—at.— . Death ok a Weather Prophet.—Prof. Tiee, the weather prophet of St. Louis, died on the 30th of November. Like the Canadian weather prophet, Vennor, ho published almanacs containing his predic- i tions of the weather months in advance, i and made money by it, as thousands were ! «o credulous as to have faith in them. Election of Hon. John 6. Carlisle as Speaker. The eleciion as Speaker of the House of Representatives of Hon. John G. Carlisle, of Kentucky, over Hon. Sam'l J. Randall, of Pennsylvania, was a surprise to many, who believed that expediency dictated the choice of Randall. The Democratic mem bers of Congress from all parts of the coun try should be able to judge wisely as to the choice they should make for speaker, and wo think that those who preferred Randall should yield a ready acquiescence in the judgment of the Democratic members of Congress, upon whom the responsibility of making the choice devolved. Carlisle is an able and pure man, is conservative and na tional, and there is nothing sectional in his election. He was a union man before and during "the war, and the cry of "rebel" can not be raised against him in the North. — The "bloody-shirt" cannot be used against him. The capitalists and business men of the North repose confidence in his wisdom, conservatism, and statesmanship, and his election will not produce any scare in that class. Since they see how his election has been received, msny of those who preferred Ran dall are coming to tho conclusion that the election of Carlisle was wise. The Slate says that "while the Demo crats who supported Mr. Randall were at first disgruntled at the result, they are now coming to s«e that the majority was right. The Democratic party represents the peo ple of the country, and the Democratic par ty is becoming more compact every day.— The outlook for 1884 grows brighter and brighter." The New York Herald says:— "This attempt to raise a sectional issue out of the choice for Speaker finds no sup port or color in the facts and oharacter of the contest. On the contrary, the election of a Southern man in the person of Mr. Carlisle is, under the circumstances, to be hailed as one of the most encouraging polit ical signs of the day. Mr. Carlisle was not elected because he is a southern man, nor does ho represent a Southern policy in any sectional sense. His candidacy represented a principle. It meant an affirmative, active, manly policy, not a negative do-nothing, evasive one. It was because he stood for these things, and because he had, in a high degree, all the other qualifications for the offlce that he was the choice of the majority for Speaker. We rejoice that a good Southern man has been elevated to a loading position in the national government by a combined North ern and Southern vote." To this the Norfolk Landmark adds:— "In fact the Democratic party is not the sensitive plant some people thought it; but a good, hardy growth, with its roots deep in the soil from North to South, and from East to West; and the straighter it grows up in the light of day, the better the people will like it." Low or Hion Tariff. —Ex Senator Gordon, of Georgia, says the South is de monstrating its ability to manufacture at a profit both cotton and irou with much less protection than is needed to enable these industries to live in other sections. This being so, it is to the interest of the South to have the tariff reduced. That will have the effect of causing Northern capi talists and manufacturers to invest in the South. The Southern resources would be developed sooner with a low thau with a high tariff. This tho people will understand when the question shall be thoroughly and fairly discussed. In the next canvass the Democratic par ty will be the party of low taxes, aud the Republican the party of high taxes, and the Democratic party will win, audJ"don't you forget it." If tho tariff question shall be a prominent issue, the people will learn to understand it before the election, and they will not vote to tax themselves for the bene fit of wealthy monopolies. The falacies of the protectionists will be exposed. "Serious Aspbct."—The election of Carlisle as Speaker of Congress, and the anticipated policy of the Democratic party in the next canvass, has caused the Valley Virginian to put on its studying cap, and, after giving the subject mature thought, is forced to the conclusion aud frankly con fesses that ' 'it presents a serious aspect for the consideration ofthe Republicans " Our neighbor is right, and the "aspect" will be come more and more "serious" "to the Re publicans" as time advances, for their worst fears will be realized. An Incendiary's Sentence.— Harrison Crews, the colored inceudiary.of Lynchburg, was convicted Thursday ant! sentenced to 2b' years in the penitentiary. After convic tion on the first indictment ho (.'leaded guilty to nine others. The reward of $300 offered for his ap prehension by the city council was appor tioned Saturday by the mayor. Half of the sum was awarded to policemen Johnson and Coombs, and the other half to a citizen named Suter, ho was active in the arrest. . m . Mr. Tilden has made a magnficeut be quest to the people of New York, in giving his palace of Gramercy Park, with his splen did privato library, to be used, after his death, as a public libi ary. It is understood that he will endow it also. Migs Louisa do La Ramee ("Ouida") writes a letter denying that she has become a Roman Catholic. . ♦ a> ♦ John Randolph Tucker and a Manly Critic.—The Editor of the Lynchburg- News signed the dispatch which announced that the constituents of the Hon. John Randolph Tucker did not look with favor on his support of Mr. Carlisle, and now that Editor has come forward in the most creditable manner to acknowledge his error of juogmeHt us to the effect the election of our Speaker would have upon the country. Our brother of the News expresses him self as follows: "But we incline to believe now, and we frankly say it, that we were wrong and Mr. Tucker was right. The responses of hearty approval of the bold and manly stand taken by the representatives of the great National Democracy that have come from all over the country convince us that our fears were born of over-timidity. De fying the howls of sectionalists and the predictions of evil of monopolists, the De mocracy have shown the courage of their convictions; have boldly placed themselves on the side of the people, and wo believe the people will applaud." We copy this partly to show the manly temper of our cotemporary, and, partly to say that Mr. Tucker has shown high intel ligence and courage in voting according to his convictions of right in defiance of neigh borhood opinion. It is of such stuff that great leaders are made, and we hope, as we believe, that there will be a strong reac tion in his favor among the good people of the Lynchburg District. We need reso lute and honest men in high places, and we are proud to see Mr. Tucker carrying himself in a manner worthy the best days of Virginia and the Republic — Norfolk Landmark.

STAUNTON SPECTATOR AND GENERAL ADVEBTISER.— THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE. The President's message was delivered to Congress on last Tuesday. Its length is too great for us to publish, and .if published in full, would be read by few. We publish in lieu of the whole an abstract as furnish ed by the Bait. Sun which is not too long to read, and the reading of which will su persede the necessity of reading the mes sage in extenso. The message opens with the usual refer ence to the foreign relations of the United Slates, which he is able to state are every where peaceful. Of more immediate inter est, however, is the recommendation, made by the Secretary of the Navy and indorsed by the President as an important measure of national defense in case of war with any foreign power, that immediate steps be ta ken for the creation of an interior coast line of water-way across the peninsula of Flori da, along the coast from Florida to Hamp ton Roads, between the Chesapeake bay and the Delaware river, and through Cape Cod, thus recognizing more or less directly tho national character of the projected Chesapeake and Delaware ship-canal. Commercial treaties have been made with Servia, Roumania, Corea and Madagascar; legations have been established in Persia, Corea and Siam, and it is recommended that the interests of American citizens re siding or trading in Bulgaria and the Cen tral American States be cared for by the presence of consular representatives of the United States. Reference is made to the Brazillian export duty on coffee, and to the penalties for technical faults applied to American vessels and cargoes in the Antil les, and the suggestion is made that retali atory measures applied to Spanish vessels and "cargoes from Cuba and Puerto Rico might not be barren of good results. At tention is called to the work of tho Inter national African Association in the Congo valley, and Congress is reminded that it may become advisable for us to co-operate with other commercial powers in promoting the rights of trade iv that region "free from the interference or political control of any one nation." No large reduction of reve nues is advised. Congress is reminded that a tariff bill has been recently passed, the results of which are not yet sufficiently ap parent to warrant a further molification of the tariff or internal revenue laws. He states, however, that the legislation refer red to has cut down the income of the gov ernment some fifty or sixty millions of dol lars—a statement at variance with that made by the Secretary of the Treasury, who puts the net reduction at but $30,000,000. The sulplus of revenue over expenditure, which the President estimates at $60,000,- -000, it is recommended should be spent in rehabilitating our navy and providing coast defenses. The suggestion of the Secretary ofthe Treasury as to the proper method of perpetuating the national bank system is approved. It is accordingly recommended that the tax of 1 per cent, on the circulatiou of the national banks be repealed, and that the amount of the circulation allowed on bonds deposited for security be increased to 90 per cent, on the market value of such bonds. The effect of this would be to make it profitable to the banks lo baso their circulation on 4 per cent, which are not redeemable till 

I'JOT. With respect to tho disposition to be made of trade dollars the President and Secretary of the Treasury, while not favoring exactly the same plan, are in substantial agreement. Tho former recommends that the trade dollar be ac cepted by the treasury and the mints as bullion at a small percentage above tbe cur rent maiket price of silver of like fineness. The Sscretary suggests simply that the standard silver dollar be exchanged, dollar for dollar, for the trade dollar, tie latter to be regarded as so much bullion bought un der the act of 1878. Approval.is given also the Secretary of the Treasury's plan for the consolidation of certain customs districts, and it is added that by the reduction of in ternal revenue districts, recently perfected, their number has been reduced from 123 to 83. Dwelling on the unprotected condi tion of our extended seacoast, the number of large and wealthy cities with which it is dotted, the age and weakness of our works of defense, their inferior armament; aud im perfect torpedo equipment, the President urges the reconstruction of our navy aud the building of plant for the manufacture of heavy ordnance, and points to the over flowing condition of the treasury as a fact that renders tho present the proper time for the inceptio.l of so patriotic a work. Attention is called to the growth of the number of postoffices from 40,231 in 1882 to 47,863 in 1883. The recommendation is made, adversely to the views of the Post master-General, that the rate of postage on drop letters, which at present i. two cents where the carrier system is established aud one cent elsewhere, be made uniform by reducing it everywhere to one cent. Ref erence is made to the long-mooted proposi tion that the government should assume the same control over the telegraph that it has always exercised over tho mail, but the President is unable to accord his approval to tho project. Tho suggestion is mado, however, that the goverument should be author,zed to exercise some sort of super vision over the interstate telegraph com munication. The fees of juiors and wit nesses in the Federal courts, fixed by laws of old date, are insufficient. It is recom mended that they be increased, ami that district attorneys and mauhals be paid by salaries, rather than as at present, by fees —a change which, it \3 suggested, may di minish tho number of prosecutions made merely for tho sake of fees. Congress is invited to consider the important question whether Federal aid may not with perprie ty be extended to public primary education in parts of the country where the precen tage of illiteracy is high. The failure of tbe anti-polygamy legislation of March, 1882, is cited, and the strong recommenda tion is made that Congi ess lepeal the act upon which the existing government of Utah depends, assume control at the Terri tory, and establish iv authority a commis sion with powers fitting it to deal effectively with tho Mormon problem. The question of regulating inteistato commerce is pre sented for consideration. The right of railway corporations to reasonable profit is conceded, but Congress should protect the people from injustice. The effects of the civil-rights act in the short time daring which it has been iv operation are pronoun ced beneficial. The act passed by the Sen ate at its last session regulating the presi dential succession is recommended to the favorable consideration ofthe present Con gress. It is asked that the Executive be empowered to veto particular items of an appropriation without impairing the valid ity of other items which meet hi 3 approval In concluding, the Presided recommends the passage of a new civil-rights bill guar anteeing to the colored citizens the rights secured to him by the fourteenth amend ment.

CAMERON'S MESSAGE. The General Assembly met at noon last Wednesday, and both houses organized by the election of the Democratic caucus nom inees. A joint committee waited on the Governor, and soon thereafter his message was received and read. Not having the the* space to publish the message in full, we publish such portions as are of most interest to our readers. THE PUBLIC DEBT. Iv regard to* the public debt the Governor says: "Now, as for many years past, foremost of importance of the subjects which will de mand your attention stands the public debt, During the last session of the General As sembly the act approved, Feb. 14th, 1882, established a basis upon which the credi tors of the State were invited to fund their claims for principal and interest into new bonds bearing 3 per ceut., and the support ing enactment contained in chapters 7 and 41 of the acts of Assembly, session 1881, have so fulfilled their purpose as to afford relief to the treasury and to make possible the discharge of the floating debt, while meeting promptly all cash demands for the expenses of administration. But these measures in no sense constitute a settlement of the debt. The total amount of old in debtedness of all classes, principal and in terest, funded up to the Ist of October last was $2,492,707.19, and under the act of February 14, 1882, to tho same date, was $1,527,803.30. It is thus apparent that while the new bonds have been ready for delivery during a period covering more than' twelve months the amount funded under the Riddleberger bill has been less than 6 per cent, of tho entire debt, and of the un funded obligation, principal and interest, outstanding against the Commonwealth, there remains the sum of $33,411,086.22. Within a much shorter period, under the McCulloch bill, more than $8,000,000 of bonds were surrendered, and yet that meas ure utterly failed to settle the debt. It is true that the Supreme Court of the United States, in the case of Autoni vs. Greeuhow, sustained the act of January 14, 1882, as furnishing an adequate and constitutional remedy to the holders of tax-receivable coupons. But experience has shown that act to be deficient in several important par ticulars. The enacting clauses omit any reference to the coupons detached from bonds of the Commonwealth under the act of March 28, 1879. The eventual effect of this omission must bo either to exempt the holders of 10-40 coupons from the condi tions imposedjupon persons presenting in payment of taxes coupons produced by the bonds under the act of March 30, 1871, or to force both the State and tho holder of McCulloch coupons to rely ou the act of January 28, 1882, commonly known as "coupon-killer No. 2." That act has not been subject to the construction of auy court of appellate jurisdiction—State or federal. Experience has also proved that the requirements of section 4 of the act of Jan. 14, 1882, are not sufficient to procure proper care of the State's interest in the suits therein authorized to be brought in corporation and couuty courts by persons in whom the claims of coupon-holders and taxpayers conjoined." The message then points out the fact that thousands of dol lars of coupons have passed through the courts without the needful scrutiny contem plated. The Governor says: "Within the official knowledge of tie Executive coupons have passed through the courts upon the sole evidence of persons who could not, by any possibility, testify with kuowledge as to their genuineness and legality. Judg ments have been rendered against the State treasurer on coupons which had no number, and therefore were the legal product of no bond." He says during the past six months, owing to these causes, the funding under the Riddleberger bill has practically caastd. No suitor, he alleges, during the period named has failed to establish his casa against the State, except where the Executive has employed counsol to represent the State. "The measure of duty which seems to apply to the executive in this case is to seek absolute success for the settlement at tempted. It cannot as yet be cilled iv any true souse a settlement. Remaining with the General Assembly is tho duty or privi lege of making to live or to die the scheme of funding known as the Riddleberger act. To be successful it must be forceful. The question now is not whether the General Assembly will give negative support to an attempt which is no settlement, butwheth or tho majority of that body will sustain and advance the present legislation of the debt question. Let the responsibility remain with the power, lt is as true now as it has always been, that readjustment to be suc cessful must be coercive, and that every ultimate power residing under the constitu tion in the Commonwealth of Virginia mu3t be exhausted to protect her from excessive and unjust claims." The Governor then reeommede-d as fol lows: That the act of January 14, 1882, be so amended as to require the servicos of at torneys for Commonwealth; secoud, to de fine the manner and method of verifi-ation of coupons; third, demand witnesses should be summoned from such departments of the State government as would at least be likely to know which coupon was genuine Of which fraudulent: fourth, that the act above referred to should be amended so as to include coupous on the 10-40 issue of bonds; fifth, that in obedience to the consti tution no money be paid out of the treasury under plea of reclamation, except by bills of appropriation. The Governor, in his reference to the basement officers, says: "The second au ditor's office, originally created as a checker b.ilauce upon the offices of auditor of pub lic accounts ami troasuier, has grown to be a dangerous if not use'ess adjunc' of the administration—an officer, with considera ble emoluments and a lie*vy force of assist ants, uuder a bond sufficient for the respon sibilities with which lie is charged, has nothing really to <ro that two clerks, under specific statutory instructions, culd not as well and moro safely perform; that the of fice, from the original inteution of a mere clearing-house, has grown to bo the keeper of all the trus bonds of the Common wealth; that in the past fifteen years overy trust fund that has been invaded has been in vaded through the agency of this piactieal ly irresponsible offlce."
