Vessel Forty-Five or the Jden Saved. Baltimore, December The John atone Line steamship Vedamere, of Liverpool, Captain Robert Bartlett, for whose safety fears were beginning to be felt, as she was several days over doe, arrived this morning at Pier 31, Locust Point, with forty-five ship wrecked mariners, which she had pick ed up at sea. Twenty-five others went - with France, "a thing which is impos down with their ship. ; sible so long as the French pursue a The men landed are the survivors of ; policy of exasperation." the British steamship Londonian, of London, bound from Boston for London with a large general cargo ana cai- tie on deck. She left Boston Novem- ver 15th, and on November 24th, In a violent gale her cargo shifted and she i almost capsized, she finally resting on her beams ends with big seas breaking over her. Her luckless crew were helpless to right her, and for two days she drift ed about at the mercy of the winds and waves. Assistance came at 5 o'clock on the morning of November 25th. The I Vedamere hove in sight five miles dis tant, and as it was still quite dark the Londonian burned signal fires and fired distress rockets. It did not take the "Vedamere long to cover the five miles, that lay between' her and the London ian, and as soon as she arrived along side she was signalled to stand by. At noon, in the teeth of a stiff gale. Second Officer Hobbs and a volunteer crew gallantly launched one of the "Vedamere's boats and attempted to reach the sinking Londonian. For mitre iiuuid kiid sicau uiiiuua uaiucu with wind and wave in a vain attempt three hours the steady Britons battled to reach her, but were finally forced to j return to their ship. Captain Bartlett then steamed to windward of ths doomed steamer and tried to fire rock ets, with lines attached, to the wreck, hoping by that means to establish a connection with her, by which the sea men in peril could be saved. After a number of vain attempts this idea was : abandoned and as night came on sev- ' eral other attempts to rescue the Lon donian's crew were made fruitlessly. As it grew too dark to do anything ! more Captain Bartlett signaled "Will stand by you until morning." The piteous signal: "For God's sake do not leave, us" came back in reply. During the night the wind Increased and by j morning it was blowing very hard. Then it was that another means of res cue was decided upon. For hours life buoys with lines attached, were floated to the Londonian and at last her crew succeeded in getting one aboard. One t of the Vedamere's life boats was im- 1 provised as a life car, to be hauled be tween the two ships. It made a trip successfully and twenty-two half froz and volunteered to launch another life boat to attempt the rescue. For two hours the boat's crew struggled at the oars, but could not 'get closer than six ty yards of the wreck. They were at last forced to give up and return to their ship, and in doing so the boat was smashed against the ship's side and lost. They all came near drown ing, but were hauled aboard with lines. Another fearful night of peril and fear passed. The next morning twenty-three of the men of the Londonian succeeded iri launching one of their own boats and reached the Vedamere in safety. Their boat was also lost and all that day was spent in trying to again establish communication with the wreck. The gale was constantly increasing and all efforts to save oth ers were in vain. Even after night had fallen the Vedamere was kept cruising about in the vicinity, but when day broke next monring the Londonian had vanished. The Vedamere then proceed ed to Baltimore. The wrecked steamer was first sight ed in latitude 48.30, longitude 15.10. On November 29th, the day after the Veda meTe lost sight of her, the steamship King Arthur passed her in latitude 45. longitude 16. She was then abandoned and all her boats were gone. It is supposed the remainder of her crew- at tempted to leave her in their own boats and all hands perished. The Londonian was a fine vessel, built at Glasgow in 1896 and registered 5.532 tons gross. She .belonged to the WIIson-Furnes-Loyland Line. Her original name was Idaho, which was changed to the present name about a year ago. London. December 8. A life boat, apparently belonging to the lost Fur ness "Line steamship Londonian, was seen on December 2nd. in latitude 4S and longitude 14. There were some oars on board, but no sign of life.

Joaenh Chamberlain, secretary of state for the colonies, speaking at a conserv- atlve gathering in Wakefield. York-! shire, this evening, fully discussed ? home and foreign affairs and the gov-j ernment's policy In Egypt, which, he ! said, depended entirely upon the pos- j sihdltir ftf rMrhlnP an itnlKt9nAlnir 1 With repard to the relations between Great Britain 'and Russia, in connec tion with the far east, he said that while hitherto the endeavors to reach an agreement had failed, he believed n:1 "f"! were to be encountered. "I am more sanguine of arriving at a settlement," said Mr. Chamberlain, "because it is not for our interest alone. The objects we have In vie.w are shared also by the United States. Gremany and Japan, all of which have Identical interests. I dare say you have observed the very pregnant passage in tne resent message of President Mc Kinley to the United States congress, the passage referring to the very im portant interests of America In the east in which he declares that these interests shall not be prejudiced by ex clusive treatment. That Is a very noteworthy passage and without being a prophet, I think I shall not be too sanguine if I say that in the future we shall not stand alone as guardians of the 'open door.' ". Mr. Chamberlain then referred to the charge of inconsistency brought against him in boasting of Great Bri tain's "splendkl isolation" and then as to alliances. He said: "When I referred to isolation, I meant the isolation of the British em pire comprising the United Kingdom and our children over seas who are well able to defend their own posses sions and their own exclusive inter ests against all attacks, but surely it Is not unreasonable to "seek an alliance and to expect co-operation where the Interests involved are those of others as weli as ourselves. "In the case of Germany k have ascertained by a friendly and frank interchange of opinion that there are many interests regarding which we can assist one another. "But, if I congratulate you on the development of good feeling between us and a great continental state, still more do I rejoice at the growth of friendly relations ' between ourselves and our colonies, between ourselves and the United States. Already the United States, if regarded from the standpoint of potential resource, is the . greatest of civilized states with its immense population of intelligent citizens, chiefly Anglo-Saxons, and if we are assured of the Anglo-Saxon race, whether it abides under the Stars and Stripes or ; the Union Jack, there is no other combination that can make us afraid.

CAROLINA RACE RIOT No Action Yet Taken by Congress Prltcnard Expected to Make Some Move TIe Negro Congressman White Expresses Himself on the Subject Washington, December 8. The North and South Qarolina members of con gress say no plan has been formulated yet as to congressional action on the recent race troubles in the Carolina?. There had been some talk of a congres sional investigation, but no move in that direction has been made by the Lhouse members and one of them said today that it was probable the matter would be left to Senator Pritchard, of North Carolina, who is said to have in contemplation some kind of inquiry. Representative White, the colored member from North Carolina, arrived here today. H'- severely arraigns the leaders of the recent Carolina mobs and says the race issue has about reached the point where the negro must face either extermination or emigration. In this view he expresses regret that the president's message did not deal with the race question. White has prapared no investigation resolutions and he expresses doubt whether much can be expected from federal inquiry or inter vention. Attorney General Grigss' Report Washington, December 7.

The sentence of the court-martial came before Gen eral Wheeler as a reviewing authority in the usual course and the Case is now In the hands of the president, who alone has the power to grant the com mutation, which, it is not doubted, he MiH do -in view the fact that war was not actually in progress, and the crime, therefore, hould be punished in a measure not too greatly exceeding the civil punishment for like offences.

Dr. Brough ton left the pulpit and coming to the floor said the amendment just offered had been sent in for no other purpose than to prolong the fight which was on in the church over the disposition of the real estate. Dr. Broughton, highly excited, said: "For the sake of peace in the church let's fight the thing out now and settle the question." He was interrupted and called to or der by one of the opposing force and In a moment the church was in an up roar. First came laughter from the female portion of the audience then some one applauded with the feet and then the entire dissatisfied element clapped their hands, rapped their canes and umbrellas on the seats and the church rang with their laughter.

PLEADS GUILTY President 'ITIarsh ' of the Defunct Key stone National Bank of Philadelphia Throws Himself on the Mercy of the Court Philadelphia, December 7. Gideon W. Marsh, former president of the Key stone National bank, the disastrous failure of which institution was pub licly announced March 20, 1891, today pleaded guilty beforeJudge Butler, In the United States district court to in dictments charging him with conspir acy with Cashier Lawrence in mis applying the funds of the bank and making false reports of the bank's con dition to the comptroller of the cur rency. He was remanded for sentence until Tuesday next. f After Marsh had entered his plea of guilty his counsel asked the court's permission to present a statement of his client which would show mitigating circumstances in connection with the commission of the acts to which he had pleaded guilty. Counsel informed the court that this statement would show that after Mr. Marsh had assum ed the presidency of the bank he fouDd that there existed a deficiency in the bank of over $1,000,000. He had no doubt erred in covering this deficit, but the load was too much for the bank to carry and finally resulted in its failure. Counsel said the defendant had never profited one dollar through the bank's losses and that when he fled over seven years ago he had not with him one dollar of the bank's money. Judge Butler, however, informed the counsel that he would receive no state ment except matter pertaining directly to the indictment and the defendant's plea thereon. He would not permit a statement to the court whlcn did not bear directly on the acts of the de fendant and which had no Interest other than the gratification of public curiosity. Wm. Steele, former cashier of the wrecked Chestnut Street National bank, was also arraigned today and pleaded not guilty to an indictment charging him with aiding and abetting President Wm. J. Singerley, (now deceased) in the misappropriation of tne funds of that institution. 4 The Tampa Bay Channel Washington, December 7. The sec retary of war in a report to congress says that an investigation of Tairpa Bay, Fla., from Port Tampa to the motth of the bay on the gulf shows that a channel of contemplated depth of thirty feet over the bar could not be permanently maintained without the constant use of dredges and that there will be places in the bay that will require dredging from time to time to maintain channel depths. The estimat ed cost of such improvement is $3,335, 000. It is not thought advisable to go to this expense, but it is considered as probably advisable to secure a channel of twenty-four feet at mean low water A Vlurder and Sulfide Louisville, Ky., December 7.

Thongh iU offensive features are sometimes almost unbearable, few people are aware of the danger of which Catarrh is the forerun ner. Catarrh invariably leads to Consumption. Growing worse and worse each winter, those who rely upon the usual treatment of sprays, washes and inhaling mix tures find that it is impossible to check the disease with these local applications which only reach the surface. The offensive discharge increases all the while, causing a feeling of personal defilement, and gets deeper and deeper until it is only a question of a short time until the lungs are affected. The importance of the proper treatment can therefore be readily appreciated. But no good what ever can be expected from local applications, as. such treatment never did cure Catarrh, and never will.

Smlthfield Herald. There is no doubt about vthe fact that a large measure of unpopularity attaches to the railroads of this State. In this regard North Carolina may not be singular; we are speaking onfy of North Carolina now. Some of this dislike Is founded on reason and some of it is not; but It exists, and on ac count of It a railroad company can seldom getjustice In the courts and suffers In many other ways. We have told the railroads before of some of the causes of their being In disfavor a prime cause being that In anyraatter of a claim against them they are un compromising, unyielding without regard to the merits of the case, they fight it to a finish losing nearly always because of the character they have es tablished for contesting everything, whether they are right or wrong. Nowwe are going to teU them some thing else; Another reason for their unpopularity is their resistance of the reasonable demands of the public upon them as. regards train and sta tion accommodations and 'kindred matters.
