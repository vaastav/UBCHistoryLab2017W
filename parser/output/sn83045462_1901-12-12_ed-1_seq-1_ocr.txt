CARNEGIE'S GIFT It Was in Bonds of the United States Steel Company. EI AIIG COIPLICITIONS President Consulting With Lead ers as to Solution. SATISFACTORY OUTCOME 0 The important fact was ascertained to day that the $10.000 O0 gift which Andrew Carnegie tendered to President Roosevelt for the founding of a great institution for higher education in this city was not an offer of I10.000.000 In cash, but the par value of that amount in bonds of the United States Steel Corporat'on. The offer of these bonds Is embarrassing to the ad ministration, and that is why so much secrecy has bcen maintained. The ticklish part of the situation is found in the compli cations which might arise from the United States owning and administering bonds of a corporation which sooner or later may be proceeded against by the Attorney Gen eral as violating the anti-trust laws of the country. Assuming that such a serious situation should never arise, the political phases of accepting bonds in a corporation against which there is a great deal of popular discontent will be Immediately ap preciated. To accept the gift of the bonds and then sell them might be open to severe criticism. Intricate Questions Involved. The many intricate questions Involved have caused the most profound secrecy at the White House, and every effort has been put forth to prevent the facts from being made public. That the gift will be accepted in some shape is the belief of those who have con ferred with the President. Just what shape is the subject now under considera tion. The most interesting suggestion yet made Is that the President ask Mr. Car negie to convert the bonds into cash and turn over to the government the money, about the acceptance of which there could be no possible doubt. The whole matter Is being considered by the President. who is talking to trusty republican leaders of Con gress and asking their advice. Mr. Carnegie's large gifts recently have all been In bonds of the steel corporation, It is said. These bonds will sell anywhere at par. So the bonds are easily worth $10.0,0SOO in cash. A Message to Congress. When th solution of the problem is reached In the President's mind he will im mediately send a message to Congress ad vising suca action as he regards proper. The opinion prevails that the knotty prob lems can be solved in a short while without giving a subject for wholesale gossip and criticism. There is considerable surprise that Mr. Carnegie. when tendering the gift. did not think of the complications likely to arise. He could have sold the bonds and turned In the cash. It is suggested that he was thinking that the bonds realized so much more interest than cash put out at interest could do that the gift in the shape of bonds was much more valuable than cash.

Senate Judiciairy Cosmaittee Awaiting Receipit of Charges. The Sentte will not further consider the nomination of Attorney General Knox until a statement of the reasons which have been urged against this action by the Anti-Trust League have been placed4 before the com mittee on the judiciary and considered. Members of the league in conference with a subcommittee of the committee on the judiciary Monday were Informed that they would be given until next Saturday to ie any papers in the case that they might de sire to have the committee consider. It is likely that such papers will be considered by the committee Monday morning, though up to today they had not been received. If they are considered Monday morning it Is likely that either on Monday or shortly thereafter the committee will be enabled to report to the Senate in executive session their views on the charges against the At torney General, which thus far have been of a general character, alleging that he has not exercised his full powers in the execu tion of anti-trust legislation. Until the committee on the judiciary has made its report to the Senate it is not at all likely that the matter wilI be referred to by any senator. A Mane Nemoerial EDay. Representative Henry C.

The Seeretary of War Asks for an Ap propriation of $1,260,000 to Cover the Project. Extensive improvements are contemplated at Washington barracks. The Secretary of War has forwarded to Congress an estimate of $1,200,000 to cover the projected Improve ments. One of these estimates, amounting to $40).000, is to enable the Secretary of War to construct at Washington barracks a main building for the Army War College and the quarters actually needed for the president of the college and his military and academic staff, according to plans submitted by Gen eral Gillespie, chief of engineers, subject to such modifications as may prove to be ex pedient during construction, including all necessary expenses not specifically men tioned. Another estimate, amounting to $80,000, is to enable the Secretary of War to recon struct Washington barracks to serve as an engineer post and engineer school of appli cation. according to plans submitfed-by the chief of engineers, subject to such modifica tions as may prove to be expedient during construction, to include sea walls, grading and filling, paving and sidewalks, sewering and draining, tree planting and provision for lighting and protection against fire, the con struction of new barracks, quarters, .ore houses, school buildings and other necegsary structures, and the moving and alteration of existing buildings and all other work needed for the proper establishment of said engineer post and engineer school of ap plication. In both cases it is provided that the ap propriations shall be available immediately and until expended. It is also provided that the Secretary of War shall be authorized to expend the appropriations, by contract or otherwise, as shall be deemed nkost econom ical and advantageous to the Utilted States. 

COMMANDER YOUNG RELIEVED. His Remarks Regarding the Cubans Regarded With Oleial Disapproval. Lieutenant Commander Lucien Young of the navy has been summarily relieved from duty as captain of the port of Havana and placed on waiting orders. This action was taken by Secretary Long yesterday after noon, and is intended as a mark of official disapproval of the officer's recent public utterances in regard to Cuban affairs. Commander Young recently came to the United States on leave of absence, and on visiting his home in Louisville was given a banquet. On that occasion he made a speech which was telegraphed throughout the country. He was represented as hav ing said that the people of Cuba were un fit for self-government, and that the only salvation of the island was its annexation to the United States. On passing through Washington a few days ago on his way back to Havana he called at the Navy Department and was questioned by Secretary Long in regard to the published interview. He prac tically admitted having made the statements attributed to him, but disclaimed all idea or intention of their becoming public. In other words, he was simply expressing his private views to a party of friends and not talking for pub lication. The matter was submitted to the President, and the conclusion was reached that Lieutenant Commander Young's fur ther usefulness at the Havana capital had been impaired by his criticism of the Cu ban people. Owing to his fine record the officials are disposed to be lenient with Commander Young, and it is said that there will be no further action in his case. Commander Young Is well known as the hero of the ill fated ship Huron, and was voted a sword by the Kentucky legislature for his gal lantry on that occasion. 

AGAINST ANARCHY. Bill to Be Prepared by House Judici ary Committee. Anarchy was discussed this morning by the House committee on the judiciary at its first meeting held today. All of the numerous bills which have been introduced in the House on this subject were tenta tively gone over by the committee, after which it was unanimously decided to refer the whole matter to a subcommittee to be appointed by Chairman Ray. The sub committee will be instructed to prepare a measure embodying the practical provi sons of the various bills into a single measure which the committee can act on and report to the House. In this connection there has developed i little strife exhibited on the part of the corr.mittee on immigration and naturaliza tion, of which Representative Shattuck of Ohio is chairman. It is the belief of this con-mittee that it should be given a part in the work to be done on this legislation. SENATE COMMERCE COMMITTEE. ills Before It Referred to the Proper Subdivisions. The Senate committee on comnmerce held a meeting today for the purpose of organiz ng its subcommittees and referring to them the bills which have reached the commit tee. The most importabt change made in the subcommittees was the substitution of enator Berry, as chairman of the sub committee on bridges, for Senator Vest. This position has been held by Senator Vest for a great many years, but was vol untarily surrendered by him on account of his health. The shipping bill was referred to the subcommittee on ships and s ping, of which Senator Frye. is chairmar nof which Senator Hanna is a member. The measure was not discussed. There are two bills before the committee for the establishment of an executive de' portment of the government, to be Enown as the department of commerce, and these were referred to a special subeaommittee, consisting of Senators Nelson, Hanria and Clay. The bill for the reorganization of the revenue cutter service was given to a special subcommittee, ennuiiting of Sena tors Gallinger, Penrose and Turner. Statue of Longfellow. .A joint resolution has been introduced in the House by Representative Dalzell of Pennsylvania directing the selection of a site for the erection of a bronze statue' in this city in honor of the late Henry Wads worth Longfellow. The itatue Is to be pro vided by the Longfellow Memorial Associa ton, and an appropriation of $5,000 is made to provide for a pedestal on which to place It.

ALDRICH'S BILL Extension of the Charters of Na tional Bank. CONTROLLER RIMU'S VEWS Believes That Many Will Avail of the Extension. VALUE OF STOeK Of great interest .to the banking and busi ness communities is a short and simple bill introduced in the Senate by Mr. Aldrich. It reads: "That the controller of the cur rcncy is hereby authorized, in the manner prosidcd by and under the cohdition and limitations of the act of July 12, 1882, to extend for a furthcr period of twenty years the charter of any national banking asso ciation extended -under said act which shall desire to continue its existence after the expiration of its charter." Such a bill was introduced in the last Congress, and passed the House on Feb ruary 4, 1901, but on account of the short ness of the time before adjournment did not get through the Senate. Everybody realized that with a republican House there would be no trouble In getting it through in this Congress, and that this would be soon enough, although It is equally evident that the matter should now be properly attended to. Many Inquiries are reaching the office of the controller of the currency in regard to the terms of this second extension of bank charters, and un til Congress actually passes this or some similar act he will be unable to reply defi nitely. Moreover, there is a great deal of work to be done by the bureau of engrav ing and printing before July 14, 1902, when the charters will begin to expire. By the terms of the act of July 12, 182, which will probably be re-enacted, every bank desiring to issue circulation will be compelled to Issue notes of a different design from those now outstanding. The law- requires the banks which obtain an extension of charter to clean up their old circulation accounts by the deposit of laivful money to cover that still outstanding, within three years. The present controller has recommended that this period be reduced to six mtonths, in order to get the 'work more promptly through the office. But in any event, whether his recommendation is enacted Into law, or whether the existing three year privilege remains, a rush of work will fall on the bureau of engraving and print ing as soon as legislation for the extension of the charters Is secured. Controller Ridgley's Views. Speaking of these extensions to a Star reporter today, Mr. William Barrett Ridg ley, the new controller of the currency, said: "The whole question of extensions is as clear as any other provision of the banking act. The first charters issued under the act of 1863 were for a period not exceed ing twenty years; in some cases the provi sion was for nineteen years, and in one in stance for eighteen years. In consequence a large number of charters began to ex pire In 1882, and until the act of that year was passed many of these banks had to go Into voluntary liquidation and reorganize. That course will again be necessary unless Congress passes this Aldrich bill or its equivalent, for the extensions of 1882, under the act of July 12, 1882, will on July 14 of the coming year begin to expire, making nearly forty years of national banking his tory. The act of 1882 authorized the ex tension of the corporate existence of any national banking association, which had reached the termination of its corporate ex istence by the consent in writing of share holders, owning not less than two-thirds of the capital stock of the association. The office furnishes on request formal blanks and instruction relating to the amendment of the articles authorizing extension. The law provides that a special examination shall be made Into the condition of the bank prior to approval of the extension, and when found satisfactory the con troller's certificate issues In due course. This, I suppose, will be the plan this time. There would be, of course, no change in the .body corporate by reason of this ex tension." The Dissenting Stockholders. "What becomes of the dissenting stock holders?" was asked. "What experience has the controller's office had with the clause of the old law In regard to appraisal in cases of dissent? Must this appraisal be unanimous?" "Any shareholder may give notice in writing to the directors within thirty days from the date of the certificate of approval of extension of his desire to withdraw. He is entitled in doing so to receive from the association the value of his shares to be ascertained by an appraisal made by a com mittee of three persons; he appoints one, the directors another, and these two men choose a third. In case the value so fixed shall not be satisfactory to him he may appeal to the controller of the currency, who shall cause a reappraisal to be made, which will be final and binding, and if t.his reappraisal exceeds the value fixed by the committee the bank must pay the expenses of It; otherwise the appellant pays the costs." "Does this asppraisal value Include any thing for good-will, or may the majority carry that with them?" "The value of that stock should be based on the bank's -'asets. This has been the position taken in every case in which there has been an appeal to the controller of the currency. Cases of appeal have been very few-not more than half a dosesr. With these exceptions, the question of the value of the stock to be paid to the dissenting stockholder ham been settled betweetn the association and the shareholders or holders interested. The procedure on appeal cages, so far s the controller goes, is to matsa special exmination of the affairs of the bank. The controller would, of cous.i weigh, the evidence of the committee freer which the dissenting shareholder appeaje, whether its verdict was unanimous or merely two to one against him," Will the Banks Extend. "Do you judge that the banks are as a rule going to extend, provided the new legislation is granted?" "Requests are coming in every day for information, which indicates that such will be the case. Between July 14, 1902, and December 81, 1908, the charters of 28C) banking associations will expire for the second time, and can only be extended under provisions of legislation to be en acted by this Congress. The others, which will expire for the first time, are not ma terial to this inquiry, as they can be ex tended under the act of 18wL This whole matter of charter extension is less com plicated than most correspondents seem to think, and I do not anticipate any great difeutties arising under the operation of such a bill as that presented by Snaetor "W113 them~ not be a tmndeney flor the benks of low etng power, ul~o ins goo ssl and high apraisvalnW t out of binsis on the espiratio of "That is. something for the shazig of the banks timasves to determi; they may extend or lMase the writtbeean met of sbasrmuhar owning two-thirds o the stock, pesis the i~x tion is obtained, will estendthIeie; les than that will compel ll Mtan.

Mason, from the compiittee on manu factures, submitted a favorable-report on a bill relating to the adulteration of food products, and addressed the Senate briefly, criticising certain products which had come under the observation of the committee. To Consider Treaty In Open Session. Senator Clapp introduce4 a resolution in favor of considering the Hay-Pauncefote treaty in open session. The senator, from a sense of humor, upon reading the full re ports of the proceedings of the executive session in the newspapers, worded his reso lution as follows: "Whereas, the published reports of the speeches made upon the subjec f the rati fication of the so-called' Ha -Pauncefote treaty, are not as full as they might be; and "Whereas said speeches would -be more fully reported if taken by the official sten ographers of the Senate, therefore be it "Resolved, That hereafter the discussion of the said treaty be made in open session of the Senate." - Senator Clapp and several of his sena torial friends stood together and enjoyed the reading of this resolutton, 'which cre ated considerable amusement. The resolu tion will come up in the Senate Monday, and may then be commented upon if in the meantime the Senate has not already rat ified the treaty. Mr. Money Criticises the Treaty. On motion of Mr. Lodge the Senate at 1 p.m. went into executive session. The Hay-Pauncefote treaty 'as immedi ately taken up, and Senatog Mbiey (Miss.) made a speech giving his viewl u that agreement. He said he would not delay ratification, but that he consid~ered some of the features of the treaty objectionable. His principal criticism ,wr that -this treaty, like the original - Hay-Pauncefote convention, fails to furnish sufficient guar anty of American control eof thie proposed Nicaragua canal.

CHEATHAM INDORSED 0 Gen. Samuel Pearson, who was a commis sary general in the Boer army for some time during the beginning of the war in South Africa, and who is the Boer represen tative in this country, called on President Roosevelt this morning, presenting a letter of introduction from Robert B. Roosevelt of New York, an uncie of the President. Gen eral Pearson had no talk with the President about the condition of affairs in South Afri ca and the President suggested nothing that would lead to a discussion of these matters. It is understood to be the intention of the Boer representatives in this country head ed by General Pearson to some time in the future present a memorial to the President praying that he take cognizance of affairs in South Africa. If possible this will be presented personally; otherwise it will be mailed. The rather faint prospect to the Boers is that the President might let down the official diplomatic bars sufficiently to receive General Pearson or some other prominept Boer and permit a full and free talk about the situation. This course by the. President is so exceedingly doubtful, however, that there is practically little hope among the friends and sympathizers of the Boer cause. The President could probably not afford to for a moment discuss the war even with so unofficial a representative as General Pearson, as that would be con strued as an affront to Great Britain. go the chances are entirely against the Presi dent taking up the South African question in any shape or through any channel, offi cial or otherwise. Wants Light on Alabama. Ex-Governor Oates of Alabama saw the President this morning to ask the appoint ment of Dr. J. T. Swan of Randolph county, Ala., as the physician at the Atlanta federal prison. The President asked Governor Oates about some of the republicans of Alabama. The President is having a lot of trouble about Alabama af fairs. One faction of the republicans rep resents the other as wholly unfit for office and. almost unfit for citizenship, and bad reports are continually getting to the Presi dent. There has been such an utter lack of general confidence in any one or two men that the President is forced to con sult dcmocrats as to the real situation. Qovernor Oates did not go into details as to individual republicans, but to the Pres ident and to others he has expressed the hope that a better and abler republican party can be built up in Alabama. Gov ernor Oates said in conclusion: "Two active parties made up of respecta ble white men- will be of great benefit to Alabama. OnS-Varty ean watch the other and prevent many queer things happening." An Indorsement for Cheatham. A delegation of colored members of the bir of the Supreme Court of the District, among whom were James F. Bundy, Reu ben S. Smith and Prof. Wm. H. H. Hart, waited upon the President to request the reappointment of Recorder Henry P. Cheatham for another term. The mem bers of the delegation entertain the high est opinion of the recorder, and speak in complimentary terms of the management of the office under Recorder Cheatham. They speak as active lawyers of long prac tice, havihg considerable business with the office. The improvements introduced by Rccorder Cheatham, the polite attention given to members of the bar and others having business in the offlee were men tioned to the President. "Pat" Garrett's Nomination. The President, today definitely decided upon the nomination of ex-Sheriff Patrick F. Garrett of Las Cruces, New Mexico, as collector of customs at El Paso, Tex. The President made the statement to a delega tion of New Mexico people who called upon him in the interests of Garrett. This dele gation included Solomon Luna, national committeeman for New Mexico; Delegate Rodey, Frank A. Hubbell, Thomas S. Hub bell and Judge A. B. Fall. The nomination of Garrett was practically decided upon yes terday, as exclusively announced in The Star. Governor Otero Here. Governor Otero of New Mexico is in the city and was at the White House to see the President. He will call again fomor row by appointment. The delegation that spoke to the President- in behalf of Osa rett likewise asserted its desire to see Governor Otero have another four years, The outlook is favorable to a renomina tion for Governor Otero, who is personally popular with the President. Governor Otero -aided considerably in the organiza tion of the Rough Rider Regiment, his territory furnishiug four companies at the beginning, and later contributing another company at the President'g express de sire. Insular Legislation. Representative Cooper of Wisconsin, chairman of the insnlar affairs committee of the House, talked with the President about the insular possessions of the govern ment and laws that should be made for them. It has been decided that nothing will be done in topi way of legislation until Gov ernor General Taft reaches here from the Philippines. He will have a number of con ferences with the President and with repub-. lican party leaders, and put of these confer ences .will grow-legilaton for the Islands that will meet the requirements of the peo ple ad of this country. -Lout an Arma at Aguadores, Cuba. Representative Henry C. Smith of Mich Igan saw the President, with a number of constituents, one of them being Don A. Btark, who was a private soldier In the 33d Michigan Volunteers in the Spanish war. Young Stark lost an arm at Aguadores from the explnsinn of a shell in a fight with the Spaniards. It is desired to find a posi tion for him, and President Roosevelt said be would be glad to see Mr. Stark hatve a The President's Visitors. Amba=sador Ton Holleben of Germany had an intervew with the President in the blue room. Se==tor Perkins of California presented State Seator and .Mrs. Belahaw of his mstt.

PROBABLY A CLUE Garments Found in Sewer Near Home of m. Deani. a OVIOT AIn ouIArs A110 An Examination Being Made by the District Chemist. THE PATIENT'S CONDITION So far as the police are concerned the person who committed the murderous as sault upon Mrs. Ada Gilbert Dennis seems t3 be no nearer prison bare than he or she was an hour after the victim was founa in her room, bathed in her own blood. Thes is absolutely no clue upon which the dp tectives may pursue an investigation w cept the finding of two garments 2K a sewer-a man's overcoat and a womdsa aproq, in a sewer at the corner of 1ith and N streets northwest-arhich may or may not develop into a clue. Some blood stains have been found outside the house, two of them being on the floor of the bal ccny at the K street house, and a number of them were also found on the sidewalk on 11th street just around the corner from the scene of the tragedy. The two stains on the balcony the detectives are certain came from the room in which the crime was com mitted. but the only thing demonstrated by them is that Mrs. Dennis' assailant prob ably stepped over the rail and descended the steps instead of dropping to the parking from the balcony. The finding of the overeoat and apron in the sewer the detectives regard as the first important link in a case which has proved to be a complete mystery. Shortly after the horrible affair was discovered the suggeston was made that the catch basin in the neighborhood be searched. It was thought that a weapon might possibly be found in one of them. Had the woman's assailant carried away with him a bloodstained Instrument, It wan argued, that instrument would probably have found its way to one of the catch basins, In the expectation that the mud and water would efface the blood spots. Yesterday a systematic se"r of the basins was begun, and this afternoon the two gar ments were found in the basin at the corner mentioned. amawnents Belog Ex=mined. The members of the sewer department who found the garments beat the mud and water from them and turned them over to the inspector. Afterward they were'placed Is the care of Detective Miller, who carried them to police headquarters. Capt. Boardman looked over the coat and then sent it to Prof. IHird, the health de partment chemist, with the request that he examine it for blood stains. In one pocket of the coat was found a piece of brown paper. This was removed by one of the members of the sewer cleaning brigade. and it is stated there was nothing in writing on it. The coat is made of dark material, with a gWa stripe through It, and a velvet co . It has a conspicuous plaid lintng and which are turned back from the ends or the sleeves. The strap on which may have been the name of the maker was missing. It is thought the garment was not a custom made affair, and the general appearaneb was that of a storm coat. There are map stains about the front of the coat and on the sleeves, but only a chemical test will prove it they are blood stains. Prof. Hird dried the coat by steam, in or der that he might make the tests as soon as possible. After the garment had been washed and dried a piece of chewing gum was found in one of the fleece-lined pock ets. The gum had been- chewed and evi dently put in the pocket for use a second time. Probably Two Persos invelved. Should the coat prove to be of importance in the case it may develop that a man and woman both were connected with the affair. It is recalled that Policeman Livingston and a special policeman heard a woman scream about 3 o'clock in the morning. They were about a square from where the coat was found today when they heard the outcry. After the one scream all was quiet and nothing more was thought of the affair until after Mrs. Dennis was found beaten almost to death. It is thought by some of the officers that the coat was thrown into the basin br a man and that a woman may possibly have been with him. She may have protested against what he was doing, and while making her protest she gave an Involuntary scream. The apron was found when a second search of the sewer was made. On the pavement at the east side of 11th street between I and K strests many stains were found, but the detectives do not be lieve these have any connection with the crime. A boy has been found who says he saw 4 man leaving the house of Mrs. Dennis about 12 o'clock Monday night, and the mian's presence on the steps attracted his atten tion. This boy is William Lanadale, who lives at 1219 I street. He saw the detee tives last night and told them of the inet, dent. The )y had attended one of the theaters, adon his 'way home he got oE the car at 11th and K neglecting tq get of at the I stre crossing. Frost where he left the car he walked west om K street to the corner of 12th street, and the man he saw coming from the house of lirs. Dennis he thinks was on about the third step and was moving in the directios of the street. He gave the detectives a lescription of the man. This description the omoiers are guarding, and it will prob ably not be made public until a more com plete investigation is made. Judge W. B. Flemming, formerly of Louisville, Ky., once chief of the law and contract division of the supervis ing architect's oince in the treasnurl arrived here from Chicago late yes terday afternoon. He has been a fr'iend of Mrs. Dennis for several years, haw ing occupied apartments in her hoese from time to time. It is Mated that he had attenmded to some of her business a$ lairs for her.

Meeting of Southern Republicans Last Night-Caueuses of Beth Senate and House Likely. The efforts of Representatives Crum packer and Moody for legislation In the di rection of curtailing the representation of the southern states in Congress are con fronted with the possibility of opposition within the republican ranks. It may be necessary to hold republican caucuses in both Senate and House to secure unani mous action on a party policy. Conference Last Night. A conference of southern republieans in Congress was held last night, at which were present Senators McComas of Mary land and Pritchard of North Carolina, and members of the House from West Virginia. Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, Mis souri and Maryland. The chief feature dis cussed related to the apportionment of rep resentation from the south, with particular reference lo Mr. Crumpacker's bill which seeks to reduce the south's representation on the ground that the negro Is deprived of his vote. The disousslon was entirely informal in character, and no action was taken by the conference. The talk showed, however. that the members were not entirely in ac cord on the question of their attitude with respect to the bill. Senator Pritchard de clared his positive opposition to It. Another meeting will be held next Wed nesday night, at which it is expected some agreement will be reached as to what course the republicans from the south will adopt on the measure when it comes up in the republican caucus. The southern re publicans hope soon to perfect an organiza tion for the protection of the interests of that section coming before Congress. Gromnd of Opposition. The opposition developed at last night's meeting Is based mainly upon the ground that the proposed reduction of representa tion will effectually put an end to hopes of building up a republican party from the convervative business interests of the south. There Is no doubt a caucus of republicans of the House will be held immediately after the holiday recess. Mr. Crumpacker has se cured the requisite number of signatures to a petition for a caucus call. and will present it when the full attendance returns after the recess. GEN. 

STERNBERG'S COMMENT. Says That Dr. Reed is Evidently Mis informed. Surgeon General Sternberg of the army says in reference to that part of the speech of Dr. Charles A. L. Reed. the retiring president of the American Medical Associa tion, at Marion. Ohio, Tuesday night which alleged an inability to fill vacancies in the army medical corps: "Dr. Reed Is evidently misinformed with reference to the filling of vacancies In the medical corps of the army. The corps was increased by Congress at its last session by the addition of two colonels, two lieutenant colonels, ten majors and 115 asslstin't'ui g(ons. This Increase was out of proportion -greater In the. lower grades than in the higher-and in the absence of additighet legislation would make promotion very slow for the fifty or sixty assistant our gec-ns at the foot of the list of those ap pointed. But, as a matter of fact, about eighty of the vacancies created by the re organization act have been filled during the present year, and a considerable number of applications are now on file. I do not believe that up to the present time the failure to provide for more officers of the higher grades has deterred young men from seeking admission to the medical corps of the army." The criticisms passed by Dr. Reed upon the commanding officers at military camps find an echo In the medical corps here, but of course they do not care to say anything for publication on that point. It is an old grievance on the part of the surgeons that they are obstructed in carrying out their plans for the sanitation of camps by line officers above them in rank. This sort of complaint was common In the civil war, and the controversy between line and staff broke out again during the Spanish war. to which Dr. Reed has reference in his speech.
