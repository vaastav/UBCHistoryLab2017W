Tb Telf graph intormi ua that President Buchanan "tipliciUy ei pressed hU determi atton to aeod DO mora troopi to lha forts hmt Charleston, and imd ererything possible would be done on his part to avoid a collis ion." This is committing bimwlf to the cause of the secessionists boldly and fully. It Is well understood by him, as it Is by all at Washington, that it is designed to take Fort Moultrie by force, as soon as secession is de clared on the lTth Inst., and yet the President wilfully ignores this fact and declares that he will do ererylhicg in his power to aroiJ a collision. Perhaps, in his thorough devo tion to Southern demands, he will direct the commandant of that Fort to surrender at the first demand, "to avoid a collision." In his lCeemge he says that the resignation of the Federal lUrshals, Judges, Ac, in South Caro lina hns left him powerless to enforce the Uwi ; and now to complete the subjugation ot the General Government, he proposes, coolly and deliberately, to allow the last sign of Federal power in that rebellious State, to be seised by the revolutionists, without raising a hand to sustain that Constitution, and those laws, which he has sworn to support. How much further out base subserviency to the South, and a total lack of moral courage, car ry him T As has been remarked, his white hairs are turning to feathers. Mr. Lincoln's Views. The New York Herald calls upon Mr. Lin coln for a "generous Union speech" to "quiet the troubled waters, and save the ship." But what possible good will that do? South Car olina and the secessionists will not wait to see what Mr. Lincoln will do,' and till procla mations by him would be of no avail to quiet the turbulent waves ot southernanati cism. They will not wait to see what the principles of the incoming administration are to be, lest it should prove so calm and sensi ble as to disarm them of all pretext for dis union. They have reached the crisis for which they have long sought, when they can fulfil their oft repeated threat of disolution; and what they dread net of aU, is such a settlement as will tend to quiet the present agitation. Hence, the South Carolina and Florida representatives refuse to serve on the conciliatory committee, and wish fur nothing 10 much as immediate revolution and bloodshed. Tender of a Maryland Regiment. A dispatch from Columbia, S. C, a few days ago, announced that Gov. Gist bad re ceived an offer from Baltimore of the services of a regiment of Maryland troops, under charge of Philip Henry Lee. The Baltimore Patriot says that no such major or regiment belongs in the City. Failure of Water in New York. On Thursday morning last, two mains of the Croton Aqueduct burst in Fifth Avenue, Kew York city. The street was flooded and torn up, and all the central and lower parts of the city were deprived of their usual al lowance of water. The greatest inconven ience resulted from the stoppage, and great fears were entertained of a destructive confla gration. Factories worked by steam had to suspend operations ; hotels were without ma terials for baths and washing; private fami lies had, for the time, to gather around the breakfast table with unwashed hands and faces, and saloons charged more for a glass of water than for a glass of beer. The few pumps which still exist as old relics of the days of wells, were surrouaded by eager crowds with pails, tubs, barrels and tin pans, who, under the direction of policemen, formed in line, and patiently or impatiently, waited for " turns" at the pump handle. The steam presses of newspapers were kept in operation by water brought from Brooklyn, and proba bly at no former period were so many prayers ant up for rain, as during the two days re quired to repair damages. The entire police fjree was detailed to keep strict watch on all portions sf the city, as a preventative meas ure against fire, and alt New York breathed easier when they again saw the clear stream running from the faucets. The Kansas Troubles. Wyandotte (Kansas) Commercial zette thus comments upon the letter of Jndge Williams, which that worthy wrote when he was flying from Kansas to Missouri : "A more wicked and cowardly string of lies ccnld hardly be crowded into the Bame space, even by the most ingenious falsifier in the whole list of Buchanans omce bonders; and when w. say that, we consider that we have made the case as strong as it can be made. Judge Williams, in Clinton, Missouri, "to inform the citixens of this that place of the following tacts." A pretty Judge, indeed, to inform the people of the "following facta, when the statements which follow are not facts. They are for the most part, if not en tirely, willful, malicious, and cowardly false hoods. Instead of "the Abolitionists under com mand of Montgomery and Dr. Jennison, to the number of from 300 to 500, armed with Sharp's rifles, dragoon sabres, navy revolvers and bowie knives, having commenced a war of extreme ferocity on the law-abiding citiz ens ot Southern Kansas," there has only been a small party of men in the field at all, numbering, we are assured by reliable par ties direct from tee scene of the difficulties, not over thirty at the most, and they have not meddled with "law-abiding citizens," but have only administered merited punish ment to three or four kidnappers and mid night assassins, who would now be commit ting depredations on society for all of any check likely to be put upon them by Judge Williams' Court, or Fort Scott packed juries. And what is more, instead ot" Montgomery being at the head of them, he has been quietly about his business at home all the time. The fact is, Judge Williams ran away from his post of duty, at Ft Scott, over into Mis souri, and there told a terrible story of devas tation and slaughter, which bad little other foundation than his own cowardly imagin ings. And thit story with others of the same baseless foundation, has formed the ground work of most wanton and wicked attacks upon Montgomery, who, for all that be hs yet done, is a far better man than ever Bu chanan had honesty and decency enough to appoint as a Judge in this ruffian -beridden Territory." During the late storm, according to the reports by telegraph and otherwise, thirty-six Teasels hare gone ashore on Lake Ontario, seventeen on Lake Erie, two on Lake Huron, and six or esren cn Lake Michigan. Three propellers have been totally destroyed, and two with a large loss of life. Three or four sail Teasels have also been totally lost ; and the Ion of men is orer Rventy. K , c , Affairs at Washington. The dispatches to the Kew York pajivrs say that only Boyoa of South Jarolina, and Hawkins of Florida, will resign on the Con ciliatory Committee. Pavis, of Mississippi, Love of Georgia, anl Uueston, of Alabama, will serve, although great efforts h.ive been made by people Irom their States to Induce them to resign. An effort will be made to-day to present the People's Pacific Railroad to Congress.. The Republican Representatives and Sen ators are in receipt of anonymous Utters threatening them with personal injury. Such schemes are the hut report of ruffians. The Union sentiments of Cochrane in the House and Saulabury in the Senate, drew hearty applause from the galleries; last year the disunion sentiments were mostly ap plauded. Secretary Cass will shortly give to the pub lic his views of the political conditiou ot the couutry. Two millions of dollars will be wanted January 1st to pay the interest on the public debt There la not that amount iu the Treas ury, and a bill will probably be rejiorted to day, authorizing the issue of ten miliums of Treasury notes. Hope for relief is grounded apon the an ticipated changes in the Cabinet Mr. Holt, P. M. General, will take the place of Secre tary Cobb, and Mr. Fessenden, of the Finance Committee, will succeed Mr. ' Hunter, the present Chairman. The passage of the Mor rell Tariff Bill is expected after these changes, and brighter times are looked tor. The correspondent of the Cincinnati Com mercial, telegraphs that Seward, Cor win, Sherman, Wade, all the Republicans. and Doug las and his friends, assume boldly that the idea of the Right of Secession shall never be admitted in any event, and men of stamini take ground that, it necessary, steel and lead shall be the ultimatum. 

NORTHERN FIRMNESS. Yon would be surprised at Northern stern ness. Many Southern men are deluded with the chimera that, if Government attempt to coerce the South, revolution will ensue in New lork and other Northern cities; but are surprised at the firm demeanor of Republi cans. They begin to manifest serious anxiety to kuow whether the North will meet the shock bravely. There seems yet to be no traitors in the North. BUCHANAN'S COURAGE. It is considered not unlikely that the Presi dent's courage may be terribly tried before New rears, as his intimation in bis Message that revenue laws must be enforced at Charleston, will be pressed home on him by the North. Senator Douglas is bold, and for the Union. JERRY BLACK. Southern men have ruined Jerry Black's prospects for a seat on the Supreme Court Bench. They accuse him of penning offen sive portions of the message, and if the President should appoint him the south will oppose, and rejection would follow. Doug las' friends are in ecstacies. FORT MOULTRIE. Fort Moultrie is garrisoned by ninety men, Eentuckians, and Col. Anderson will die by the flag of the Union sooner than yield to any public enemy. South Carolina members say that their Slate will not assault the Fort Their Commissioners appointed by State Con vention will apply to the Federal Executive for peaceful arrangement and adjustment of financial matters after secession. A 

TENNESSEEAN'S VIEW. Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee Union men were storming about the "insulting ' de meanor of South Carolina and denounced disunion as superlative folly. . "What," said a Tennesseean, "shall Tennessee be dragged into this folly by South Carolina? We are a prosperous and happy people. Our nig gers are under better subjection, and are bap pier than they ever were. We've got a good trade with the North and South, and does South Carolina imagine we are such infernal fools as to impoverish ourselves to gratify her whims? Wkar'i the danger to our niggers? Whose agoing to run 'em off? The most in fernal nonsense ever heard of!" And a Vir ginia planter in a similar state of mind, rav ed up and down Pennsylvania Avenue,swear ing be "would shoulder a musket and march down with Virginia troops and wipe out South Carolina, if she didn't stop her cus sed folly. He went on to say that seces sion has already reduced the value ot nigger fitty percent HOW CONGRESSMAN TALK. Senator Trumbull will not confess that se cession is likely, excepting perhaps in the case of South Carolina, she being lnnatic,and therefore an exception to aU laws. He says there is a flurry, it will blow over. Senator Wade recognizes the facts, is ready to treat them as facts, and Fays the North has nothing to do but proceed as she ever has. 1 Senator Seward's position is in dispute. The logic of his career has a duplex interpre tion. One party says he will yield too much to the Soutbnotwithstanding his "irrepressi ble" speeches. Thurlow Weed's recessive ar ticles confirm this impression, because his in timacy with Seward seems to indicate that they are acting in concert,and that the utterances of the Albany Evening Journal are the echoes of Seward's views. Another party vigorously denies Seward's complicity with Weed's re cession, and contend that he will, as usual, lead the Republicans in the line of rigid prin ciple. But a general impression obtains that he will assume the role of pacificator. Sum ner will remain quiet nntil the Republicans agree generally to define. But all of the Republicans are for the Union as it is. While all ot them would readily consent to the re peal of Northern Personal Liberty laws, if the South will first withdraw her challenge, not one, no t not on of them, flinches from the Republican doctrine against extension of slavery into territories. But mark again they seem unanimout againtt Congreieional legislation on the subject of slavery reelecting the terriioriet. They are content to abide the natural laws of labor, to work out the great anti-slavery principle, and they are falling fiat on Governor Chase's idea of Popular Sovereignty. Now for Southern gentlemen. Senator Hemphill of Texas, is strong for the Union. His colleague, Wigfall, is plump against it Mason of Virginia, is a Secessionist His great colleague, Hunter, is rather for the Union, and tremendous efforts are making by Virginia planters to made bim altogether for the Union, but they are embarrassed by the attitude of the B&ltimoreacs.. ; Here, by-the-bye, I am reminded of a new element which is likely to be brought to bear in behalf of the Union fight. . The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad interests are deeply involved, and at the proper time, it is suggested that corpora tion will engage in the struggle. Johnston of Tennessee, is set down for the Union. ' The position of Senator Powell of Kentucky, has not been the subject of discussion. He will probably be for the Union, while Mr. Breck inridge is. Everybody knows wbera the Mississippi Senators stand. Clingman of N. C, is slightly for secession. Green and Polk, of Missouri, are for the Union, and so are the Representatives from that State. All the Kentucky and Tennessee Representatives, J believe, are on the same side. Hill of Geor gia, talks earnestly for the Union. The po litical and pecuniary salvation of Botteler (of Va.) and his people, place him on the side of the Union. Ji3 Many unsuccessful attempts have been made to obtain a perfect substitute for whale bone, in the manufacture of the ribs ol umbre llas and parasols. An ingenus manufacturer has at last found that white oak timber of the second growth, when selected from the butt end of the tree, and straight and tree from knobs, may, after subjection to a certain curing process, be employed as a substi tute for whalebone. It is even said to be sup erior to whalebone in toughness and tenacity, and the ribs made from it always resume their original straight condition after exposure to the. weather. From the N. Y. Independent. South Carolina and Secession. South ('arulinu fell into a 8l:ilu of lirnuie idiocy on the subject of secession about thir ty years ago, and has continued ever since in a conditiou or hopeless imbecility. Her caw is beyond any other treatment tnan that of a strait-jacket, aud a rigid diet of bread anil walur.. She Is perfectly iu earnest in her ra -Tiug,and is determined t j go into the cold and starve, or to break things lu pieces In a dread ful mai ner if she is prevented. When htr condition is thus rightfully apprcheuded, it will all i be seen that she is only dangerous so long as she is kept iuside, and not permit ted to have her own way. Let her go; a large black m in, bigger than herself, stands ready to receive her with a strait-jacket the moment she crosses the threshold, and tree trade and direct taxation are a diet that will bring the blood anay from he.- brain and re duce her system to that condition that she may by-aud-by, in Uud's good time, recover her reason. If she is determined to rid the rest of the family of her presence, they will be delivered from a very pestilent and noisy member, wh, tor more than a quarter of a ceutury, has done no'hing but break the peace of the whole household. Now if this be a true statement of her case, and it certainly is, why should any threat of the secession of such a State disturb the com merce of tho whole country ? South Caroli na contains about as many white people as the city of Brooklyn, probnbly does not con tain so much wealth, certaiuiy has not so much intelligence, and is not of more conse quence to the Union we mea" no disresect to Brooklyn thuu that ci'y. Undoubtedly she has some foreign commerce and some do mestic trade, but Its penentnse noon the whole trade and commerce ot the country is so small, that its loss would hardly be fell, should she be cut loose from ber sister States, towed out into the Gulf Stream, and anchor ed to a raft, to drift for evermore from zone to zone. We are exaggerating nothing, and setting down naught in malice. The industry ot a Stale coutainingonly about 275,000 white people, supported by 375,000 black people, who are fed upon three pounds of bad bacon and a peck of corn a week, and whose entire clothing does not cost $10 a year each, can not by any possibility, even we had no statis tics to verity the fact, be of any great moment to a great, flourishing, and energetic nation of 40,000,000 of people. She may go, and the great West will produce not a bushel the less of corn and wheat, not a pound the less of pork and beef, not a wisp the less of hay; and our great EasUand-West railroads will have not a pound the less of produce to bring to market; she may go, and not a spindle the It as will whirl in Lowell or Lawrence; she may go, aud not a sad the less will dot the harbors ot the North ; ehe may go, and not a mouth the less will be filled in all the wide Union beside, not a dollar the less be paid to all our millions who labor with their heads or their bands. All this is capable of arithmetical demonstration. In the lu ion she does little, with her sini-ll population, more than half of whom are unwilling pau per laborers, while the other section are de pendent npon these for the few necessaries and the not many luxuries of life they are permitted to enjoy. Out of the Union she will d less, for all of the trade she now does that comes to her from bordering States will find its way to Savannah and Mobile, and the little cotton she raises she will be glad to send to market in the ships thai will take it quick est and cheapest. So little reason have we to fear ol disaster and loss to the commerce and trade of the country from the secession of South Carolina. It is marvelous that the threat of such an event, such "a mere misap prehension of danger," should so blind men to the dictates of common sense." Senator Hale on the Crisis. The telegraph contained a brief abstract of the speech of Senator John P. H t!e iu Con gress. Below will be found one or two ex tracts from his speech : ' 1 "Mr. Hale, of New Hampshire, (Rep.j 1 was very much in hopes that there would have been a Message that would have com mended itself to somebody. I vas not san guine of its pleasing myself, but I did hope it wouid please some one, and that the Presi dent would have looked things iu the face. I have read it somewhat carefully, and if I un derstand it, and I think I do, it is this: First That South Carolina has just cause for se ceding. Second that she has no right to se cede. Third That we have no right to pre vent ber seceding. That is the amount of the Message, substam tally. Then the President goes on to represent this as a great and pow erful country, and that no State has a right to secede from it; and all the power of the country, it 1 understand the President con sist, in what Dickens makes the English Con stitution consist the power to do nothing. Now, sir, I think it was incumbent on the President of the United States to have point ed out and recommended to Congress some rule, and to have told us what he recommend' ed us to do. The only way to escape the danger is to look it in the face; and 1 think the country did expect from the President some exposition of decided policy. I do not wish to say a word that would cause irritation, or add to the feeling of bit terness which really exists in the country. Wot one. 1 would bear and forbear before 1 would say such a word. But I tell you the plain truth, that the way is to look the thing iu the face, aud see where we are. And what is the issue that is presented, but that the constitutional will of tho pnbhc epinion, expressed through the forms of the Constitution, will not be submitted to? And if war is the alternative, let it come in any form or in any shape. The Union is dissolv ed, and it cannot be held together as a Union if that is the alternative upon which we go into an election. If it is pronounced and determined that the vote of the majority ex pressed through the regular constituted forms of the Constitution will not be submitted to, then, sir, this is not a Union of equals. It is a Union of dictatorial oligarchy on the one side, and a herd of slaves and cowards on the other. That is it nothing more or less If this discussion is proceeded with, I shall take occasion to address myselt to that phase of the controversy which is so constantly, per- severingly and continually held up, that the Northern States are the aggressors. We have a set of presses and politicians among us who have perverted the public voice and the pub lic interests, ministering to a depraved appc- tite, and they have lent their interest to as persions and slanders on the people among whom they live, and upon whom they feed ; and I very much fear our friends on the other side have listened too much to their asper sions rather than to their own convictions of what the trouble is. Let me toy further, if theri art those tcho look to the lettlement of thit con troversy by further concetrion front the North, I think they mistake. I think we have con ceded too much, wo have compromised too much, and we have got to that position of things, whenever any fault is found, there is the ever recurring remedy of statesmen, of stin further concessions from the North. I agree, sir, that under the Constitution of tho United States, you are entitled to demand and have an honest and fair discbarge of that obligation which is imposed on all the States in regard to the rendition of fugitive slaves, and I am willing, perfectly willing, that there shall be an honest, and fair, and laithful per formance of that pledge. Sum up every case of injury and suffering and aggression by the whole North, of the free Stall's, upon the right to recapture fugitive slaves, and put them all down in the darkest colors, and draw it as hideous as truth and fancy can make it, and then I can bhow you aggres sions on the constitutional rights ef citizens of the free States that will infinitely out weigh and outnumber every aggression by the free States npon the rights of the South, in regard to their slaves." Senator Hale on the Crisis. Tom Jones, the Sculptor---Bust of Alfred Kelly. By the following from the Columbus Ga zette it will be seen that the celebrated T. D. Jones is about to execute a bust of the late Alfred Kelly: "Ton JoxKS, Till Sctxptoh. The admira ble bust ot the Hon. Thomas Ewing, taken by this distinguished Uhio Sculptor, now graces many of the offices of the lawyers in the State, the love of the beautiful, the en couragement of art, the pride of the profess ion, and shore all, the admiration of the trreat niminal tending to make the work ex ceedingly popular; and it is not at all surprU- iii:' Una it is already uiflicult to procure a copy, the limited supply not being sulfcient to meet the demand. Mr. Jones has succeed ed in giving entire satisfaction to the friends of all the celebrated men of whose linea ments he hns taken duplicates, and few ar tists can boast of having had such an illus trious array of subjects. Clay, Chase, Corwin, Cass, ueneralj 1 ay- lor aud Scott, Breckinridge, Archbishop Hughes, as well as Mr. bwing, have bad their hints taken by Mr. Jones, and all of them have felt flattered as their striking like nesses came finished from the master hand of the sculptor. After Mr. Corwin returns from Uongreas, Mr. Jones will take another copy of that al most inimitable face, that puts a crowd in a roar of pleasure, so as ts consign the "Wagon Boy" to posterity in marble. Mr. Jones has received an order, to exe cute a bust of the late Alfred Kelly, from a posthumus cast, and, we trust it m.iy be as nearly perfect as his other works, for no oth er Ohio man has let! a deeper impression for good, upon the public mind ot the State,than did Mr. Kelly in his day and generation. The bust will be finished next spring. Mr. Jones proceeds to Springfield, Illinois, next week, to execute a model of that face of all faces, ' Old Abe's," in plaster, aud if he suc ceeds in making a good looking likenesi of it, he will give the most indisputable evidence of possessing genius of the most remarkable order." News and Miscellany. Wm. B. Fiske, an old resident of Oswego, died on Tuosday last Sleighing is good in Montreal. The snow is 18 inches deep at Owen Sound. Xnpoleon Bonaparte used to say that " four hostile newspapers are more to be feared than a hundred thonsand bayoneis.'' A lady tourist in America curiously re marks : " Boston, seen from the monument of Bunker Hill, looks like a large spider drop ped into the water, struggling for the land, in order that it may spin its web." The first buffalo ever shot in Michigan was shot a few days ago at St Joseph. It required three bullets to kill the auimal, and all shot into his head. The huge carcass when dressed weighed four hundred and eighty pounds.
