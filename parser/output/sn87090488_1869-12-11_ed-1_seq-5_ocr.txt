THE WEEKLY HEEALD. TUESDAY, DEC. 7, i860. day in Texas. The elections Lave taken place, but the result ii not knowu. It it hoped that act of the Legislature! of these States, when they meet, will be inch m to receive your approval and tbui clcie the work of reconstruction. Among the evlli growiug out of the rebellion, and not yet referred to, ii that of an unredeemable currency. It n an evil which ( hope will receive your moit earnest attention. It is a duty, and one of the highest du ties of the Government to secure to iu citizens a medium of exchange of fixed and unvarying value, This implies a return to a specie bssis, and no substitute for it can be de vised; it should be commenced now, and reached at the earliest practicable moment consistent with a fair regard to the interests of the debtor class. Immediate resump tion, if practicable, would not be desirable ; it would compel debtor clams to pay.bcyoud their contract, premium of gold at date of their purchase, and would bring bank ruptcy and ruin thousands fluctu ations of the paper value, of gold is detrimental to the interests of trade. It makes the men of business au involuntary gambler, for iu all sales, where fu- turo payment is to bo made, both parties speculate as to what will bo the value of currency, be it paid or received. 1 earn nestly recommend to' you, then, such legislation as will insure a gradual return to specie paymonts, and put an immediate stop to fluc tuation in the valuo of currency. Tho method to secure forever these results are as numerous as specula tors on political economy. To se cure the latter, I see but one way, and that is to au thorite the Treasury to redeem iu oM paper at fixed prices when ever presented, and to withhold from circulation all currency so redeemed until sold again for gold. The vast resources of the nation, both developed and undeveloped, ought to make our credit the nest on earth, with loss burden. With the taxation that the citizen has en dured, for six years past, the entire public debt could be paid in ten LlICTZJUHT G-XKBAL ULTS-S 8. Gbait, President of all these United States, has been engaged as editor of the IIieald for this issue. Be llow appears his leader. Hoping it will satisfy the public, with some diffidence aud distrust, he is coin - mendod to the patrous of the Hbbald. . PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. FeUow-cilitent of Ike Senate and Ilotut of lleprutnlativti : Iu coming before you for the first time as Chief Magistrate of this ' great nation, it is with gratitude to the Giver of all good for the raauy benefits that we enjoy, that we are blessed with pence at home, with out entangling alliances abroad to forbode trouble, with territory un surpassed in fertility and area, equal to the abuudaut support of live nundrea minions or people, abounding in every variety of use ful mineral in quuutity sufficient to supply the world for generations yet to come, an exhuberant crop, a variety of climate adapted to the production of every species of the riches of this earth, suited to the Tastes, and habits, aud requirements of every living thing, a population of 40,000,000 of free people, speak ing one languago ; with facilities for every mortal to acquire education in institutions second to none in the avennes of fame ; freedom of pulpit, firess and school ; a revenue flow ng into the National treasury be yond the requiremouts of tho Gov ernment. Happily harmony is being restored within our borders ; manu factures hitherto unkuown in our country art springing up in all sec tions, producing s degree of nation al independence unequalled by auy other power. These blessings and countless others are entrusted to vonr cars and mine for their safe keeping for the brief period of our tenure of office. In short lime we muat cacti ot us return to the ranks of a people who-have eon-ijea but it is not desirable that the Cured these honors upon ns,Fpeople should be taxed to pay it in 'ana sacoans iv mhhu iur vur stewardship. 1 earnestly desire that neither you nor fmay be con- L demned by s free and enlightened constituency ; nor by our own con sciences. Eleven States of the Ubion were, four years ago, left without legal tilate Governments. A NatiouaJ debt had been oontraoted ; Ameri can commerce was almost driven from the seas. The industry of oue ' half the country bad been taken from the control of capitalists aud placed where all labvr rightfully belonss in the keeuin. of the la borers. Work of restoring btate governments, disloyal to the Union, of Drotectiuir aud lostering tree la bor, aud providing means for pay ing the interest on the public debt, . has received ample- attention from Congress. Although your efforts have not met with that success iu all particulars that might have beeu desired, yet ou the whole they have been more tucccsxiui man coum have reasonably been anticipated Of eleven btates which passed ordinances of secession, seven have been fully restored to their former places iu the Union. The 8th, Georgia, held an election, at which she ratified a constitution Hcpubll- cau in form, elected a Govirnor, members of Congress, a btate Leg. islamic, and other officers required Tho Governor was itiMulleil, tho Legislature met and passed nil tho acts required of them by I lie recon struction acts, and biiIim qiiuntly, however, in violation of tho consti tution which tbey had jtut ratified, as since decided by the Supreme Court of the Sttto of Georgia, they unseated the colored members of tho Legislature, and admitted to scats some members who are dis qualified by Uiu ild clause of the 14th Amendment, an article which tbey themselves had contributed to ratify. Under those circumstances I would submit to you whether it would not be wic, without tHay, to enact a law authorizing the Gov ernor of Georgia to conveno the members originally elected to the Legislature, requiring ench to take tbeouth prescribed by I ho i Yourattention is respectfully in vited to the recommendation of the Secretary of tho Treasury for the crtation of the office of Commis sioner of Customs. The Rcvenuo for the Increased salary of certain classes of officials, and substitution of the increased National bank cir culation to replace outstanding three per cent certificates and most especially to his recommendation for the repeal of laws allowiug s share of flues, penalties, for'jitures, Ac. to the officers of the Govern ment or to Informers. The office of Commissioner of Internal Revenue Is one of the most ard uousand. res ponsible under the Government; It falls little short'of'a Cabinet po sition In its importance and res ponsibility. I would ask for It therefore, sorb legislation as in your judgment will place such office upou a footingof dignity com mensurate with its importance aud with a charactor aud qualification of a class of men required to fill it properly. As the United States Is the freest of all nations, so too, do its people sympathize with all peoplo strug gling for free liberty and solf gov erniuout; but whilo so sympathiz ing, it is due to our honor that we should abstain from enforcing our views upon unwilling nations, and from taking an interested part, without Invitation, in quarrels be tween different nations, or between governments aud their subjccU.Otir course should always be iu confor mity with strict justice and law, international and local. 'Such has beeu the policy of the (Administra tion in doallng with these questions for more than a year. A valuable province of Spain, and a near neighbor of ours, in whom all our neonle cannot out reel interested, has beon struggling for Independ ence and freedom. The people and the government of the United States enterlalu some warm feel ing and sympathies for the people of Spain in their pending struggle. That they manifested throughout the previous : struettle between her and formercolouics, in behalf of the latter, but the contest at no time assumed conditions which amounted to war in the sense of international law, or which would show the existence of dufacto po iitical organizations. The insurrec tion is sufficient to justify a recog nition of belligerency. The princl pie is maintained, however, that this nation is its own Judge when to accord the rights ot belligerency, either to a people struggling to free themselves from a government tncy believe to be oppressive, or to In deuendeiit unions at war with each other, rue uuited states havo no disposition to interfere with Spain to deprive her of her colouial possession on this conti nent. They uoiieve mat iu due time, Spaiu and other European nowers will find their lutorest in terininatlnz those relations aud es tablishing their present dependen cies as Independent powers. These dependencies are no longer regard ed as subject to transfer rrom one European power to another. Wheu the preseut relation of colunies ceases, they are to become iude pendent powers, exercising the right of choice uud of self control in determination of their future condition aud rotations with other powers. Tho Uuited States, in or der to puts stop to bloodshed in Cubu, ai.d In tho interest of tho neighboring people, prepared, In good offices, to bring tho existing contest to a termination. Tho offer not being accepted by Spain, the basin which we believed could be received by Culm was withdrawn. It is hoped tho tfood offices of the that time ; year by year the ability to pay increases lu rapid ratio. But the burden of interest ought to be reduced ss rapidly as csn be with out violation of the contract. The public debt is represeuted In a great pan oy oonus naving iron, nvi 10 twenty and from ten to forty years to run. beariug interest at the rate of 0 aud 6 per cent, respectively. It isoptioual with the Government to pay those bauds at any period af ter the expiration of the least time mentioned upon their face. Time bas already expired, when a great part may be taken up, and rapidly approaching whonall may be; it is believed that all of which are now due may be replaced by bonds bear ing a rate of interest uot exceeding 4; per cent, and as rapidly as the remainder becomes due, that they may be reduced iu eanio way. To accomplish this it may be necessary to authorize interest to bo paid at either of three or four of the money centres of Europe, or by any As sistant Treasurer of the Uuited States, at the option of .the holder of bonds. I suggest this subject for thu consideration of Cungress, and also simultaneously with this, the propriety of redeeming our currency, as before suggested, at its market value, at tho tiruo the law goes into effect increasing tho rate at which currency will be bought and sold, from day to day, m- week to week, aud at tho sainu rate of interest as the Government United States may yet prove advan res of the Uuited States to briug about peace between Spain and South American Republics having been accepted by Spain, Peru and Chill, Congress has been invited to be held in Washington during the present wntcr. A grant has been given to Europeans of an exclosive right of transit over the territory of Nica ragua to which Costa Rica bas giv en its assent, which it is slledgod conflicts with the vested rights of the citizens of the United States. The Department of State has now this subject under consideration. The Minister to Peru having mads representations that there was a stato or war between Per a and Spain, and that Spain was oou- iructiu- in. or uear jkcw iorK, jU gun boats, which might be used by Spain to ml love the naval force at Cuba, and to operate against i'eru ; orders were giveu lo prevent their departure. No further steps have been iskou oy wie representa tive of the Peruvian Government to prevent tho departure of these vessels, and not reeling authorized to detain the property of a nation with which wero at peace, ou mere executive order, tho maitcr was re ferred to the courts. 1 he conduct of the war between the allies and the republic of Paraguay has made ntorcourse witu thnt country ami- cult, and it has beeu deemed advi sable to withdraw our representa tive from there. Towards the close of the lost Ad ministration a Convention was signed at tonrion for outstanding claims between ureal nniain aim tho United States, which failed to receive the advice and consent of the Senate, and time and circum stances attending negotiations with that trosly were nufavorabie to its acceptance to the people or the lint' ...1 .....
