VOLUME 96.—N0. 118. THE PRESIDENT IN ALABAMA. Nation's Chief Executive Visits the Town of Tuskegee. Delivers an Address to the Students at the Normal School. Pays a Tribute to the Genins of Booker T. Washington, the Founder of the Industrial In stitute, Which Has Accomplish ed so Much Good for the Colored Race in the South. 

TUSKEGEE (Ala), Dec. 10.—The Presidential train bearing the Alabama Legislature arrived at Tuskegee at 0:15, and was followed by the regular and special trains of the Montgomery and Alabama. They marched through the city on their way to the Normal School. The President's carriage was drawn by four beautiful bays. In the car riage with the President was Governor Johnston, Colonel Foster of Tuskegee and Booker T. Washington. In the other carriages were Mrs. McKinley and other ladies of the President's par ty, members of the Cabinet, General Wheeler, General Shatter and General Lawton. At the entrance to the Normal School grounds was a beautiful arch, and dec orations of bunting, holly, moss and products of the field were in profusion j along the road through the grounds, i The President and party first re viewed more than 000 boys and 300 girls of the Normal School, and L'«« 0 children of the training school. Each : of the boys carried a stalk of sugar vane. The President took much inter- j ;st and pleasure in the review. After the procession of students came j jome thirty floats representing all de partments of the school work. Many of these were by way of contrast, one : representing the old way of doing things, the other the new way. These floats drew forth tremendous applause. After this procession all present fol- ; lowed the President to the beautiful new chapel. Only about 3,000 people gained admission. The meeting began by the- singing of plantation melodies by the students, and was greatly en joyed by the President and the entire audience. Booker T. Washington introduced Governor Johnston, who in turn intro- ( duced President McKinley. The Pres ident said in part: "Teachers and pupils of Tuskegee: To meet you under such pleasant auspices. 1 and to have the opportunity of a per sonal observation of your work, is in deed most gratifying. The Tuskegee ; Normal and Industrial Institute is ideal in conception, and has already a large >and growing reputation in the country and i 9 not unknown abroad. I con gratulate all who are connected with this undertaking for the good work which it is doing in the education of its students to lead lives of honor and use fulness, thus exalting the race for which it was established. Nowhere, I think, could a more de lightful location have been chosen for this unique educational experiment which has attracted attention and won support even of conservative philan thropists in all sections of the country. "To speak of Tuskegee without pay special tribute to Booker T. Washing ton's genius and perseverence would be impossible. The inception of this no ble enterprise was his, and he deserves high credit for it. His was the enthu siasm which made its steady progress possible, and established in the insti tution its present high standard of ac complishment. He has won a worthy reputation as one of the great leadeis of his race, wisely known and much re spected at home and abroad as an ac complished educator, a good orator nnd a true philanthropist. "What steady and gratfying advances have been made here during the past fifteen years a personal inspection of the material equipment strikingly proves. The fundamental plan of the original undertaking has been steadily followed, but new features have been added: gaps in the course of instruc tion have been filled in: the patronage and resources have been largely in creased, until even the legislative de partment of the State of Alabama rec ognizes the worth of the work and of the great opportunity here afforded. "From one small frame house the in stitute has grown until it includes the fine group of dormitories, recitation rooms, lecture halls and workshop which have so surprised and delighted us to-day. A thousand students, lam told, are here cared for by a hundred teachers, together forming with the preparatory department a By metrical scholastic unity which has been well called a model for the colored schools of the South. Certain it is that a pu pil bent on fitting himself or herself for mechanical woik can here have the wid est choice of useful and domestic oc cupations. "One thing I like about this institu tion is that its policy has been generous and progressive. It is not so self-cen tered or interested in its own pursuits and ambitions as to ignore what Is go ing on in the rest of the country, or make it difficult for outsiders to share the local advantages. I allude espe cially to the spirit in which the annual conferences have been held here by leading colored citizens and educators, with the intention of improving the condition of their less fortunate brotfi ers and sisters. Here, we can see, is an immense field, and one which can not too soon or too carefully be util ized. The conferences have grown in popularity, and are well calculated not only to encourage colored men and col ored women in their individual efforts, but to cultivate and promote an ami cable relationship between the two races —a problem whose solution was never more needed than at the present time. Patience, moderation, self-con- j trol, knowledge, character, will surely win your victories and realize the best I (aspirations of your people. • THE 

RECORD-UNION. "An evidence of the soundness of the purpose of this institution is that those in charge of its management evidently do not believe in attempting the unat tainable, and their instruction in self reliance and practical industry is most laudable. In both the day and night schools most of the branches can be taught at small expense, which will give the man and the woman who have mastered them immediate employment, and secure their success afterward, provided they abide by the principles of Industry and morality here inculcated. In common with the Hampton Institute in Virginia, the Tuskegee Institute has been and is to-day of inestimable value in sowing the seeds of good citizenship. Institutions of their standing and wor thy patronage form a steaui' arcl more powerful agency for the good of a!' good concerns than any yet or suggested. The practical is here asso ciated with the academic, which en courages both learning and industry. Here you learn to master yourselves, find the best adaptation of your facul ties for advancement in learning to meet the high duties of life. "No country, epoch or race has a mo nopoly upon knowledge. Some have easier but necessarily better opportuni ties for self-development. What we can obtain here free, most have to pay for, perhaps by hardships, labor, men tal struggles and difficulties. In this country all can have the opportunity for bettering themselves, providing they exercise intelligence and perseverance, and their motives and conduct are wor thy. Nowhere are such facilities for universal education found as in the United States. They are accessible to every boy and girl, white or black. "Integrity and industry are the best possessions which any man can have, and every man can have them. No body can give them to him or take them away from him. He cannot acquire them by inheritance; he cannot buy them or beg them or borrow them. They belong to the individual, and are his unquestioned property. He alone can part with them. They are his to keep. They make happy homes. They achieve success in every walk of life. They have won the greatest triumph for man. kind. No mar. who ha s them ever gets into the police court or before the grand jury, or in the workhouse or the chain gang. They give one moral and mate rial power. They will bring you a com fortable living, make you respect your s If, and command the respect of your fellows. They are indispensable to suc cess. They are invincible. The mer chant requires the clerk whom he em ploys to have them. The railroad cor poration inquires whether the man who seeks employment possesses them. Ev ery avenue of human endeavor wel comes them. They are the only keys to open the door of opportunity to a struggling manhood. Employment waits on them; capital requires them; citi zenship is not good without them. If you do not have them, get them. "To the pupils here assembled I ex tend my congratulations that the facil ities for advancement afforded to them are so numerous and so inviting. Those who are here for the time being have the reputation of the institution in charge, and should therefore be all the more careful to guard it worthily. Oth ers who have gone before you have made great sacrifices to reach the pres ent results. What you do will affect not only those who come after you here, but many men and women whom you may never meet. The result of your training and work here will event ually be felt, either directly or indirect ly, in nearly every part of the country. •Most of you are young, and youth is the best time fitted for the development both of the body and the mind. What ever you do, do with all your might, with will and purpose, not of the selfish kind, but looking to the benefit of your race and your country. In comparing the past with the present you should be especially grateful that it has been your good fortune to come within the good influences of such an institution as Tuskegee, and you are under the guidance of such a strong leader. I thank him most cordially for the pleas ure of visiting this institution, and I bring to all here associated my good will and the best wishes of your coun trymen, wishing you the realization of success in whatever undertakings may hereafter engage you." The train left a few minutes after 1 o'clock for Montgomery, where the party was due to arrive at 2:4."> p. m. 

WELCOMED AT MONTGOMERY. MONTGOMERY (Ala). Dec.""lC~ The President and his party were given a magnificent welcome in the Confeder acy's first Capital to-day. The whole party was taken in carriages through the leading business and residence streets to the old Confederate Capitol. The entire route was ablaze with the national colors, while tremendous crowds lined the streets as far as the eye could reach. Capitol Hill was one mass of humanity when the lines of carriages escorted by the local military companies reached it at 3 o'clock. When Governor Johnston escorted President McKinley to the hall there was a tremendous demonstration. In the course of his speech, Presi dent McKinley said: "To be welcomed here in the city of Montgomery, the first Capital of the Confederate States, warmly and en thusiastically welcomed as the Presi dent of a common country, has filled and thrilled me with emotion. "The Governor says he has nothing to take back. We have nothing to take back for having kept you in the Union; we are glad you did not go out, and you are glad you stayed in. (Tre mendous applause.) "Alabama, like all the States of the Union, and the South, has been loyal to the flag, and steadfastly devoted to the American nation and to American har mony. There never has been in the history of the United States such a demonstration of patriotism from one end of this country to the other as in the year just passing, and never has American valor been more brilliantly illustrated in the battle line on shore and in battles at sea than by the sol diers and sailors of the United States. Everybody is talking of Hobson, and justly so, but I want to thank mother Hobson in this presence. Everybody is talking about General Wheeler, one of the bravest of the brave, but speak I want to of that sweet little daughter that followed him to Santiago (great applause) and ministered to the' sick at Montauk (cheers'). "I have spoken in many place and at many times of the heroism of the American army and the American navy, but in our recent conflict the whole people were patriots. Two hun dred thousand men were called for. and a million rushed to get a place in the ranks (great applause), and mil- (Continued on Seventh Page.) 

SACRAMENTO, SATI T T?PAX MORNING, DECEMBER 17, 1598.-EIGHT PAGES. NO INTERNATIONAL AMERICAN BANK. The House Administers a Death Blow to the Project, Votes Adversely by a Large Majority on the Dii! to Incorporate It. The Measure to Extend the Cus toms and Revenue Laws of the United States Over the Ha waiian Islands Passed in the House Without Opposition— Carries With It the Civil Serv ice Laws Relating to Appoint ments. WASHINGTON, Dec. 10.—The bill to incorporate the International Amer ican Bank was buried by an over whelming adverse majority of the House to-day. The debate upon the measure, which opened yesterday, was concluded to-day at 3 o'clock. Mr. Dingley, the floor leader of the major ity, made an argument in its support, j The other speakers to-day were Mr. Hill of Connecticut in its support, and Messrs. Bell (P.) of Colorado, Sulzer (D.) of New York, Maxwell (P.) of Nebraska, Maddox (D.) of Georgia, and Swanson (D.) of Virginia in opposition. The vote by which the bill was defeated stood 103 ayes to 14S noes. The bill to extend the customs and revenue laws of the United States over the Hawaiian Islands was passed with out opposition. The bill, Mr. Dingley explained, carried with it the civil ser vice laws relating to appointments in the customs and revenue service in Hawaii. Some miscellaneous business, in cluding the passage of several minor private bills, was disposed of at the oiiening of the session of the House to-day. The debate upon the bill to incorpo rate the International Bank was then resumed. Mr. Bell (P.) of Colorado opposed the measure. He took the ground that it was both unconstitutional and against good public policy. Mr. Sulzer (D.) of New Y r ork, also antagonized the bill, claiming that it would create a gigantic monopoly which would in time regulate interest and exchange rates. Mr. Barrett (R.) of Massachusetts of fered an amendment which provided that the powers granted under the bill should be conferred on any national bank which filed an application with the Comptroller of the Currency in conformity with the general require ment: 1 of tftfte^jill. Mr. Ridgeley (P.) of Kansas offered la substitute providing that the United States should establish such a bank as the bill created, and that the bank should have a bank in every city and town exceeding in population 2,500, and in every Central and South American country where the United States had a consular officer such officer to be the bank's representative. The committee amendments were adopted. An amendment to reduce the capital stock of any International Bank au thorized under the provision extending the privilege of the bill to others than those named in the bill from $5,000,000 to $500,000 was defeated—lo(s to 107. .Hill (R.) of Connecticut in charge of the measure, closed the debate. He concluded with a glowing appeal to the | House to pass the bill in the interest lof American commerce and American L . - i industries. |An amendment offered by Crupacher | (R.) of Indiana, providing that the property of the International Bank | should be taxed the same as the prop erty of national banks, was adopted. The Barrett and Tawney amend ments were defeated, as was the Rid- Ideley substitute. The vote on the final passage of the | bill was taken by ayes and noes. The vote resulted in the defeat of the bill — ayes 103, noes 14S. The Senate amendments to the Army and Navy deficiency bill were non-con curred in, and the bill sent to confer ence. Messrs. Cannon. Barney and Snyres were appointed conferees. Dingley then called up the bill unan mously reported by the Ways and Means Committee yesterday to extend the customs and internal revenue laws over the Hawaiian Islands. Dingley explained the necessity for the imme diate passage of the act, in order to protect the revenues of the United States. Bailey (D.) of Texas said that his own idea was that the customs and rev enue laws of the United States were extended over the Hawaiian Islands 'when they were annexed. But the an . nexation act specifically declared not. He thought the declaration in that act ■ was unconstitutional. As this bill ' simply sought to do what he believed ; had in fact been done by the annexa tion act, it was proper that it should ; pass, and pass promptly. Mcßae (D.) of Arkansas offered an I amendment designed to extend all the 'general !av»s of the United States over the Islands. He said there were other laws in Hawaii which should be abro- | gated besides the customs and revenue laws. Among them were the labor | and the land laws. The amendment was ruled out on a point of order. Moody CR.) of Massachusetts offered an amendment to extend the laws of j the United States relating to appoint ments in the customs and revenue ser vice over the islands. The bill was passed without division. The House then, at 4:20 p. m., ad journed until to-morrow. A PRINTER UNDER ARREST. He Made an Attack on the British ■ Embassy at Washington. WASHINGTON. Dec. 10.—The police have under arrest Joseph W. Pearson, a printer. 20 years of age, who last night made a violent attack on the British Embassy with bricks, which he flung into the drawing-room, in which members of the family of Sir Julian Pauncefote were seated. Miss Pauncefote was struck by a brick, but escaped with a slightly injured ankle. Several windows were smashed, and the magnificent cut glass of the main entrance doors was ruined- The total damage, it is estimated, will amount to $700. A telephone call was made for po lice, and the servants rushed out and were engaged in a fight with Pearson when the police arrived and arrested him. He was taken to the police sta tion, where his mother called later and said she had noticed that her son had been acting strangely ever since he graduated last June from studies he had been pursuing diligently for two years past. The Department of State communi cated with Sir Julian Pauncefote to day, and also saw Pearson's sister, Avho called with a lawyer to intercede in his behalf. As a result, a writ of lunatico inquirendo will issue, and if he be adjudged insane Pearson will be sent to the Government Asylum for the Insane. The matter is taken coolly at the British Embassy, where the chief in terest expressed is in the Irjury to Miss Pauncefote, which wae severe enough to keep her in bed tfcis morn ing. As to the prosecution of Pear son, it is understood that no special action will be taken by the It is expected that it will be Appropri ately dealt with by the American au thorities, and that he will be put where he will do no further damage. His offense may be a very serious one, should he be adjudged sane, as special laws govern the case of foreign lega tions and embassies. INTERNATIONAL ALLIANCE. , i Japan's Minister Will No< Commit Himself. WASHINGTON, Dec. 16 — The Japanese Minister, Jutoro Komura, in an interview, said that he could not commit himself in favor of such an alliance as that suggested by Senator Davis in Paris between the United States, England and Japan. "The international alliance question is a great one." he added, "and is ab sorbing the attention of every nation on the earth. I cannot say whether I am in favor of such an alliance as is suggested by Mr. Davis." The Minister spoke of the vast ad vantages of these understandings, and said he has no doubt that sooner or later there would be alliances between the various countries in some form or another. It would make little or no difference in just what form they might be made. The interests of Eng land, the United States and Japan are almost identical, and the understanding between them, the Minister thought, might prove of great benefit to all. The proposition of the Hawaiian Commissioners to disfranchise Japanese residents in the Sandwich Islands is not, the Minister continued, in reply to questions, to be a departure from present conditions. The Japanese in Hawaii were disfranchised by the republican form of government there. The Minister did not care to discuss the question at length at this time, for 'the reason that the subject is. now pending before Congress. There are about 26,000 Japanese in the islands, and they have proved creditable resi dents. 

COTTON SEED OIL. Effort to Have a Prohibitive Duty Placed Upon It in France. WASHINGTON, Dec. 10.—Consul Britton, at Nantes, reports to the State Department that he has been in formed that an influential company has been formed in France, and that strenuous efforts wil be put forth by this company to secure the passage of a measure which will place the import duty on cotton seed' oil at so high a fig ure that it will be practically prohibit ive. The importance of this proposition lies in the fact that nearly all of the oil imported into France comes from the United States. It is said to be the purpose of the French company to undertake the manufacture of cotton seed oil in France, importing the cotton seed for that purpose from Egypt, on the theory that it will then be impossible to dictate the price of oil in the United States. It will necessitate an advance of prices in all commodities into which cotton seed oil is introduced. If the law is enacted, it is suggested by the Consul that the United States place a correspondingly high duty on sardines, which the United States im ports almost exclusively from France. HAWAIIAN BILL. Senate Committee Has Not Com pleted Consideration of Measure. WASHINGTON, Dec. 10.—The Sen ate Committee on Foreign Relations made some progress to-day with the bill reported by the Hawaiian Commis sion for the government of the Hawai ian Islands, but adjourned until next Monday without completing the work. Senator Turpie has suggested a great many verbal technical amendments, which are not generally important, but all will require discussion. Many of the suggestions relate to the gram matical construction of the bill, and others to the details of the law itself, and a number of his suggestions on these line? have been adopted. The most important change adopted to-day is one striking out the provision of the Commission bili which empowers the Supreme Court of the Territory to pass upon the elections of members of the Legislature, and imposing this de mand upon the Territorial Senate and Hcuse. Senators Turpie and Mills both made objections to the provision as reported by the Commission, on the ground that it was contrary to the method and an innovation which should not be encour aged. The supporters of the Commis sion report yielded a controversy to save time and promote the progress of the measure. Judge Frear of the Commission and a member of the Hawaiian Supreme Court, sat with the committee to-day in an advisory capacity. Spain in No Hurry to Ratify. MADRID, Dec. 10.—A semi-official note issued to-day says: "As the American Senate must ratify the treaty of peace before it becomes ef fective, our Government should wait for the ratification, and not hasten to cede territory which the United States Senate may not accept." Boycott Declared Off. ST. PAUL, Dec. 16. — The boycott against the Chicago Great Western Railroad was officially declared off this afternoon. TARIFF FOR THE ISLAND OF CUBA. An Executive Order Signed by Presi dent McKinley Establishing Customs to Go Into Effect on the First of January. Are Based Upon the Report and Recommendations of Special Commissioner Porter, Who Was Sent to the Island Some Months Ago to Make an Investigation of the Subjects of Revenue and Customs. WASHINGTON, Dec. 10.—President McKinley, before leaving for the South last Tuesday, signed an Executive ord er establishing a customs tariff list for Cuba, to go into effect January Ist next. This tariff is based upon the | report and recommendations made by j Hon. Robert P. Porter, Special Com- I missioner of the United States, who was j sent to Cuba some months ago for the I special purpose of making an investiga | tion of the subjects of revenue and cus toms of the islands. The list of articles which may be im ported into Cuba free of duty includes trees and plants in the natural state, trained animals, carriages, theatrical properties and similar objects import ied temporarily for public entertain ! ment; used furniture of persons going Ito settle in the island; wearing apparel, j jewels, portable tools and instruments, j etc., for personal use of travelers enter ing the island; stone for paving pur poses; plows, hoes, hatchets, machetes and other agricultural implements not machinery; quinine and all alkaloids of salts of cinchona bark; hemp, flax and ramie; spun jute for the manufacture of sugar bags; books, maps, etc., for use of schools; coal and coke; mineral, carbonated or seltzer waters, root beer, ginger ale, etc.; also samples of felt, wall paper and tissues, and of trim ming, when in small pieces or of no : commercial value. Export duties on tobacco • are pre ! scribed as follows: Tobacco, cigarettes |in boxes, per 1,000, ninety cents. Should f wrapper and filler leaves be exported in the same package, bale or bundle, the export duty leviable on wrapper to bacco shall be collected when the weight of the latter exceeds ten per cent, of j the total weight. Tobacco, cut, 100 kilos. $3.85; others. $0.30; cigars, per j thousand, 45 cents. In the leaf, or filled tobacco, harvest ed in the province of Santiago de Cuba, and exported through the custom houses of Santiago, Gibara or Manza nillo, 100 kilos, $2.20. Tobacco, in the leaf, for cigar wrappers, shall be liable to the duty leviable on tobacco in the leaf, with a surtax of 100 per cent. The long schedule enumerating the rates of import duty on alimentary sub stances, animals, cotton, machinery, etc., is summarized in a table which Mr. Porter submits, showing the aver age per cent, of reduction in the several classes between old Spanish rate and rate originally adopted by United States for all imports. The table follows: Class 1, stones, earths, ores, etc., 04.1 per cent. Class 2, metals, etc., 02.1 per cent. Class 3, pharmacy and chemicals, substances of, 58,1 per cent. Class 4, cotton, etc., 03.7 per cent. Class 5, hemp, flax, etc., 02.5 per cent. Class 6, wool, etc., 70.4 per cent. Class 7, silk, etc., 50.0 per cent. Class 8, paper, etc., 70.9 per cent. Class 9, wood, etc., 03.1 per cent. Class 10. animals, etc., 01.8 per cent. Class 11, instruments, machinery, etc., 60.6 per cent. Class 12, meat, fish, butter and greases, 61.5 per cent. Class 13, miscellaneous. 01.8 per cent. General average, all class, 02.0 per cent. In commenting upon the* schedules, Mr. Porter says: "In reaching changes of rates in the sevral schedules of the Cuban tariff now in force in Cuban ports in possession of the United States I have been guided by the following considerations: "First—The necessities of obtaining sufficient revenue to administer the af fairs of the island. "Second —A reduction of duties in those cases where Spain retained in the 'minimum rate' column exorbitant rate, because she could not herself sup ply the commodity. "Third—An increase of duty in the schedule relating to spirits, wine and malt liquors, in which the reduction, by the adoption of the 'minimum rate' col umn, is altogether too great. "Fourth —Changes of rates that have been suggested by testimony taken for j the purpose of encouraging local indus try in Cuba. "Fifth—Changes from specific duties to ad valorem in cases where the form er method of levying duties resulted in inequalities, and in some cases injus tice, alike to importer and consignee. (Note: Schedule "instruments, ma i chinery and apparatus employed in ag riculture, etc.) "Sixth—Changes in the line of addi tional reductions, as in the case of 'alimentary substances,' in which many of the rates of duty now in force in ! Cuban ports in the possession of the United States were found to be unnec i essarily burdensome. In this case the j aim has been to make the specific rate of duty average not over 25 per cent, from the present market value of the imported commodity. "Seventh—ln these changes of duty consideration has been given to the fact ! that the Cuban customs under Ameri can administration will be collected in '. United States currency, whereas the I Spanish duties were collected in 80 per ; cent. Spanish gold and 20 per cent. ! Spanish silver. Roundly speaking, therefore, if the old Spanish duties were left unchanged, it would practically mean an increase of 1<) per cent, in the tariff. It should, therefore, be borne in mind that the reductions made are in fact 10 per cent, less than these fig ures indicate. On the other hand, however, the additional duties exacted by the Spanish authorities, levied as 'war tax' since the signing of the pro tocol, more than counteract the differ ence on currency." 

PEACE COMMISSION. American Members Leave Paris, Homeward Bound. PARIS, Dec. It!.—The entire Ameri can Peace Commission left here for the United States via Havre and South ampton to-night, and sails for New York to-morrow on board the Ameri can line steamer St. Louis. It is learned that Agoncillo, the rep resentative of Aguinaldo, the Philip pine leader, has lodged a strongly worded protest with the Commission, which thus becomes! part of the records. It begins with saying that "the very noble and gallant General Aguinaldo, President of the Philippine Republic," has honored him with the post of "offi cial representative to the very honor able President of the United States." Agonoillo then reviews the case at length, saying that at the time of "im ploring armed co-operation Aguinaldo and the other Philippine chiefs, both the commander of the Petrel, Captain Wood in Hongkong, before the declara tion of war and the American Consul General, Prat in Singapore, Wildman at Hongkong and Williams at Cavite, acting as the international agents of the great nation, in the moment of anx iety, offered to recognize the independ ence of the Filipino nation as soon as its triumph was attained." The protests then recite how Admiral Dewey "by numerous acts" is alleged to have "recognized the autonomist sovereignty of the Filipinos," and in picturesque language calls forth the promises and a fulfillment of "the sol emn declaration made by the illustrious William McKinley, that on going to war he was not guided by the intention of an extension of territory, but only jby the principles of humanity, by the ■ duty of liberating tyranized peoples, j and by the desire to proclaim the un alienable rights with their sovereignty, of countries released from the yoke of S^ain." 

FEDERATION OF LABOR. ! Little Doubt That Gompers Will be Re-elected President. KANSAS CITY, Dec. 10—The fight on President Samuel Gompers of the | Federation of Labor, which was talked jof by a majority at the opening of I the convention, has not developed any j strength. The election of officers will i probably be the last business of the convention. There will probably be some changes in the Executive Coun cil, but there is no doubt, so far as can be seen, that Gompers will be re elected. It is generally believed that James O'Connell of Chicago and Thomas Tracey of Bostof? will be selected as j fraternal delegates to the British j Trades Congress next summer. If these selections are made, Donnelly of New York, President of the American Typo • graphical Union, will probably suc j ceed Mr. O'Connell on the Executive Board. This morning's session was taken up by a fight for recognition between the factions of the Painters' Union, result ing in neither being recognized. The faction which broke off from the main body of the Federation of Labor at Buffalo in 1804 is headed by John Barrett. The other faction is headed by J. H. Sullivan of Baltimore of the regular Painters' and Decorators' I Union, which was recognized by the federation. The fight opened to-day with the John Barrett faction asking that the Sullivan contingent be barred from the convention. Barrett was al lowed to present his side of the case, but a recess was taken without action having been taken. The convention adopted a resolution again condemning the tobacco trust. 

TROOPS FOR PHILIPPINES. Five Regiments of Infantry Order ed to Prepare for Departure. WASHINGTON, Dec. 10.-Orders were to-day issued for the immediate preparation of the following named regiments of regular infantry for ser vice in the Philippines: Twelfth, at Jefferson Barracks; [Twenty-second, at Fort Crook. Neb.; Third, at Fort Snelling, Minn.; Seventeenth, at Columbia Barracks, Ohio, and Fourth, at Fort Sheridan. 111. In each case the order states that the date of embarkation and point of sailing have not yet been decided upon, and depend upon the transportation facilities which may become available. "It is impossible," the order reads, "to state the duration of the tour of service of this character at this time, but preparations should be mads with a view to at least two or three years' service before returning to the United States." It is not the intention of the Depart ment to send any wagon transporta tion. LATE CALVIN S. BRICE. Funeral Services Will be Held at Washington To-Day. NEW YORK, Dec. 10—The funeral services of ex-Senator Calvin S. Brice will be held at noon to-morrow in the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church. It is expected that the Rev. Dr. Wallace | Radcliffe of Washington will conduct the services. There will probably be mo pall-bearers. After the services the body will be taken to Lima, 0., where it will be interred in the Brice family plat. Among the messages recejyed by the family were telegrams from President McKinley, Secretaries Hay and Alger, and Senator Hanna and Governor Bushnell of Ohio. • Homicide in Missouri. ST. 

LOUIS. Dec. 10.—A special to I the "Post-Dispatch" from Carthage. Mo., says: John McCrellis, a retired business man, for thirty years a lead ing citizen of Carthage, shot and mor tally wounded W. J. Gilfillan to-day. Gilfillan is charged by McCrellis with ruining his home. Both families stand high. McCrellis gave himself up, and was released on giving bonds. A Murderer Executed. CHAMPAIGN (111.). Dec. 10. — Dick Collier of Danville was hanged in the County Jail at Urbana to-day for the murder of Charles Free Bryant at Sidney in September last. Collier's neck was broken by the fall. John Collier a brother of Dick, is serving a sentence in the penitentiary for com plicity in the murder, which was brutal and unprovoked. WHOLE NO. 17,960. GOVERNORSHIP OF HAWAIIAN ISLANDS. Scramble for the Territorial Execu tive Office in Full Blast. Ex-Minister Harold M. Sewall Would Like to Receive the Appointment. Prominent Men of Honolulu Confi dent That President Dole Will he Chosen—S. M. Damon Among the Available Candidates for the Place—Dole Soon to Leave the Islands for Washington. SAN 

FRANCISCO, Dec. 10. — The steamer Gaelic arrived to-day from Hongkong and Yokohama via Hono lulu, and brings the following news from the latter place, under date of, December 9th: Harold M. Sewall, who is President McKinley's representative at this place, is making a fight for the position of Governor. His strength at "Washington consists of the friendship of Mark Hanna and Senator Frye of Maine. His strength at Honolulu consists of the indorsement of the Central Com mittee of the American Union party, an organization which was originally, formed lor the purpose of aiding the annexation cause. Now that annexa tion is a fact, many members of thei party believe that the organization has ceased to exist, and that the Central Committee, composed of a dozen men, recorded their individual views only, and had no right to bind the rank and file to any future political problem. Ini fact, one prominent member of the party published a statement to this effect, over his own signature. Many prominent men do not believe that Sewall will be given the position- They feel confident that President Dole will be appointed, or some other man who has been a resident of this coun try for years. There is ample material here, and among the available men is S. M. Damon, the present Minister of Finance. In spite of the discouraging condi tions, some of Sewall's friends are hopeful. It is claimed that an effort is being made to secure the indorse ment of a large number of native Ha waiians. A petition is now being cir culated for that purpose. While Se wall's name is not mentioned, the doc ument reads to the effect that the na tive Hawaiians desire President Mc- Kinley not to appoint to the office of Governor any person connected with the recent revolution on the islands. At the same time, the Hawaiians are about to petition France to interfere and' restore the monarchy. President Dole will soon leave for ! Washington to be. present when the Hawaiian Commission presents its re port to Congress. W. A. Kinney will sail on the 27th for Washington, to represent the Ha waiian Planters' Association during the debate upon Territorial matters in Congress. He goes purely as an at torney and not as a lobbyist in any sense. It was deemed best by the planters to have a representative on the grounds when the matter affecting the sugar business or traffic is being discussed. "My mission may have to do with labor," said Mr. Kinney this morning, "but I cannot say that we have any advance proposition to make, ido not understand that the memorial sent by the planters to the Annexation Com mission asks for or contemplates a con tinuation of the penal clause in the contract laws of Hawaii. On the other hand, I understand that the planters are united in the idea and the desire that it be eliminated.. i "I am going to be a representative on the grounds of being familiar with practical conditions. My duties will depend upon the circumstances and the lines Congressional discussion may take." At a meeting of the Planters' Asso ciation held yesterday, an interesting and important labor proposition was read and discussed. It came from a society in England, and the laborers offered compose a colony of religious sect Quakers, natives o£ Russia. The colony, of which 7,*X>o men, wo men and children are available for service in Hawaii, has been practically; hunted to earth by the Russian au thorities for years. An important clause in their religious creed forbids taking of life for any reason whatso ever. This unfits them for duty as soldiers, and the Russian Government has been unable to induce any of them to bear arms. Naturally, they were, in consequence, suspected as opponents of the Government and have been per secuted. The, society which addresses the local people was formed in England for the express purpose of taking the Quakers away from Russia and giving them a start in some other country. A colony sent to Cypress did not succeed. The society wonders if Hawaii would not be a better place for them. It is stated that there is now $23,000 o.n hand to aid the colony of 7,000 souls in reaching a desirable haven. While no action was taken, the prop osition was thought well of, and there is every prospect that it will be fol lowed 1 up. From reports it Is quite evi dent that the people would be very de sirable laborers and citizens. Major Charles E. Davis, surgeon of the First New York Volunteers, ha.s been relieved from duty and has been ordered to join his regiment, now at San Francisco. His place will be taken by Major Marshall W. Wood, surgeon of the United States army. Condition of the Treasury.
