T ) rHE AHGUB. MONDAY, DECEMBER 3. t0O. PEESIDENT M'KINLEY'S MESSAGE IS BEAD IN CONGRESS. Washington, Dec. 3. President McKinley, in his message to congress read in the senate and house this afternoon, fays: ITo the Senate and House of Represen tatives: At the outgoing of the old and the Incoming of the new century you begin the last session of the Fifty-sixth con ?rers with evidences on every hand of inaiviuuai and national prosperity and -wi'.n procr or tne growing strength and increasing power for good of republic- an Institutions. Your countrymen will join witn you in felicitation that Amer ican liberty is more firmly established than ever before, and that love for it end the determination to preserve It are more- universal than at any former jjeriod or our history. The republic was never so strong, be cause never so strongly intrenched in the hearts cf the people as r.ow. The constitution, with few amendments, ex ists as it lelt the hands of its authors. The additions which have been made to ft proclaim larger freedom and more extended citizenship. Popular govern ment has demonstrated in its 121 years cr trial here its stability and security. nd its efficiency as the best instrument of national development and the best cafe-guard to human rights. When the sixth congress assembled In November. 1SC0, tne population of the United States was 5.2C8.4SJ. It is 9iow 76,304.799. Then we had sixteen states. Now we have forty-five. Then ur territory consisted of 9C9.C5Q square yniles. It is row 3.846. '.93 square miles. Education, religion and morality have kept pace with our advancement In oth--r dlrectlors, and while extending its Iower the governmen; has adhered to its foundation principles and abated jione of them In dealing with our new (peoples and possessions. A nation so preserved and Messed gives reverent thanks to ;od and invokeds His guid ance and the continuation of His care and favor. In our foreign Intercourse the domi nant question has be-en the treatment nf the Chinese problem. Apart frcm this our relations with the foreign pow ers have been happy. The recent troubles in China srring from the anti-foreign agitation, which for the past three years has gained fctrer.gth ' in the northern provinces. Their origin lies deep in the character of the Chinese races and in the tradi tions of their government. The Taip Jng rebellion and the opening of Chi nese ports to foreign trade and settle ment disturbed alike the homogeneity and the seclusion of China. Meanwhile foreign activity made It self felt in all quarters, not alone on the coast, but along the great river ar teries and Ir. the remoter districts, car rying new ideas and introducing new fissoriations amor.g a primitive people which had pursued for centuries a na tional policy of Isolation. ritOPOSALS TO Til K 

I'OWKBS. rrIousnes of the Situation In China Ap preciated. The increasing gravity of the condi tions in China and the immir.er.ee of J cril to our own diversified inter, sis In the empire as well as to those of all the other treaty gov t nir.ents. were fcoon appreciated by this government, ausir.g it profound solicit tide. The S'r.ited States from the earliest days of Iforein intercourse with China had fol Jowcd a policy of peace, emitting no oc casions to testify good will, to further the extension of lawful trad?, to respect Hie sovereignty of its government, und So insure by all legitimate and kindly Aut earnest means the fullest measure f protection for the lives and property .f our law-abiding citizens and for the xercise of their bi nefloer.t callings iimnng the Chinese people-. Mindful of this, it was felt to be ap 8ropriate that our purposes should be renounced in favor of such course as !wou!d hasten united action of the pow lers at Pekin to promote the administra tive reforms so greatly needed for Strengthening the imperial government ind maintaining the integrity of China. In which we believe the whole western .world to be alike concerned. To these wnds I caused to be addressed tothesev rral powers occupying territory and maintaining spheres of influence In t'hina the circular proposals of 1S99. Inviting from them declarations cf their Intentions and views as to the desira bility of the adoption of measures in juring the benefits of equality of treat ment of a'.l foreign trade throughout China. With gratifying unanimity the re sponses coincided Ir. this common pol icy, enabling me to see in the successful termination of these negotiations proof nf the friendly spirit which animates the vnrmiH powers interested in the lintrammeled development of commerce ind industry In the Chinese empire as i source of vast benefit to the whole Sommerrlal world. In this cor.clusii n. which I had the gratification to announce as a complet ed engagement to the interested powers n March "0. 1900. I hopefully discerned potential fac tor for the abatement of the distrust of foreign purposes which for a year past had appeared to in spire the policy f the Imperial gov ernment in th northern provinces nost Immediately influenced by the IManrhu sentiment. Peeking to testify ror.flder.ee in the willingness nrd stability of the impe rial administration to redress the wrongs and prevent the evils we suffered and feared, the marine guard, which had Vieen ser.t to p kin in the summer of 2S99 for the protection of the legation, j was withdrawn at the earliest practica ble momert. and all pending questions were remitted, as far as we were con- ferned. to the ordinary resorts of dip lomatic intercourse. I'KINCK H AS THE LEADER. rBtl-Foreign Influences Held Sway I'nrier , Hi Power. I The Chinese government proved, how ever, unable to cheek the risii g strength of the Iloxers and appeared to be a, prey to internal dissensii ns.

A small force of marines were landed at Taku and sent to Pekln for the protection cf the American legation. Other powers took similar action, until some 400 men were the capital as legation assembled in guards. The president here tells cf the siege of the legations at Pekln. the landing of troops and the rescue of the foreign ministers. Taking, as a point of departure, the Imperial edict appointing Earl Li Hung Chang and Prince Ching plenipotentiar ies to arrange a settlement, and the edict of Ser.t "K u-herehv certain hiirh officlals u-oi-o ri'eci cry a I ert for nunish- ment. this eovernmert has moved, in concert with the other cowers, toward! the opening of negotiations, which Mr. Conger, assisted by Mr. Kockhill. has been authorized to conduct on behalf of the United States. Ceneral bases of negotiation formu lated by the government ef the French republic have been accepted with cer tain reservations as to details, made necessary by our own circumstances, but, like similar reservations by other powers, open to discussion in the prog ress of the negotiations. The disposl tlon of the emperor's government to admit liability for wrongs dene to for eign governments and their nationals. and to act upon such additional ciesig nation ef the guilty persons as the for eign ministers at fekm may m a po sitlon to make, gives hope of a complete settlement of all questions involved, as suring foreign rights of residence and Intercourse on terms cf equality for all the world. I regard as one of the essential fac tors of a durable adlustment the se- curement of adequate guarantees for liberty of faith, since insecurity of those natives who may embrace alien creeds is a scarcely less effectual as sault upon the rights of foreign wor ship and teaching than would tie tne ci rect Invasion thereof. The matter of Indemnity for our wronged citizens Is a question of grave concern. Measured In money alone, a sufficient reparation may prove to be bevond the ability cf China to meet. All the powers concur in emphatic dis claimers of any purpose of aggrandize ment through dismemberment or tne empire, i am disposed to tnir.K mat due compensation may be macie in part by Increased guarantees of security lor foreign rights and immunities, and. most irriDortant of all. by the opening e.f Ch'na torhe equal commerce of all the world. These views nave been and will be earnestly advocated by our rep resentatives. The government ef TJussia hrs put forward a suggestion, that in the event cf protracted divergence of views in regard to indemnities the matter may be relegated to the court c f arbitration at The" Hague. I favorably incline to this, believing thnt high trilunal could r.ot fail to reach a solution ro less conducive to the stability and enlarged prosperity of China itself than immedi at"lv beneficial to the rowers. fTho president here tells of our rela tions with other foreign countries, which are verv frie-rdly. He devotes considerable space to our exhibit at the Paris exposition, the Samoan settle ment, boiindarv oncsMnns and other matters in which the l'nited States is interested with o-hcr countries.! THE MCAKAfifA 

CANAL, Overtnre for n Convention to-Effect It Knildlng hy the l'nited State. The all-Important matter of an Inter- occanic car.al has assumed a new phase. Adhering to its refusal to reopen the question of the forfeiture of the con tract of the Maritime Canal company, which was terminated for alleged non execution in October. 1S99, the govern ment e)f Nicaragua has since supple mented that action by declaring the so styled Kyre-Cramln option void for non-payment of the stipulated advance. Protests in relations to these acts have been filed in the state department and are under eonslderation. Deeming it self relieved from existing engage ments, the Nicaraguan government Shows a dispositon to deal freely with the canal eiuestlon cither in the way of negotiations with the l'nited States or by taking measures to promote the wa terway. Overtures for a convention to effect the building of a canal under the aus pices of the l'nited States are under consideration. In the meantime the views of the congress upon the general subject, in the light of the report of the commission appointed to examine the comparative merits of the various Trans-isthmian ship canal projects may be awaited. I commend to the early attention of the senate the convention with Great Hritain to facilitate the construction of such a canal and to remove any objec tion which might arise out of the con vention commonly called the Clayton Hulwer treaty. The long standing contention with Portugal, growing out of the seizure of the Iie'.agoa Hay railway, has been at last determined by a favorable award of the tribunal cf arbitration at Herne. to which It was submitted. The amount of the award which was deposited in Iondon awaitirg arrangements by the governments of the L'rited States and Great Hritain for its disposal, has re cently been paid over to the two gov ernments. SPAIN AND l.MTF.I) STATES. Progre Toward Treaty of General Friend- liip and Intercourse. Satisfactory progress has been made toward the conclusion of a general treaty of friendship and intercourse with Spain, in replacement of the old treaty, which passed into abeyance by reason of the late war. A new conven tion of extradition Is approaching com pletion, and I should be much pleased were a commercial arrargemer.t to fol low. I feel that we should not suffer to pass any opportunity to reaffirm the cordial ties that existed between us and Spain from the time of our earliest in dependence, and to enhance the mutual benefits of that commercial ir.tercouse which is natural between the two coun tries. Iy the terms of the treaty of peace the line bounding the ceded Philippine group in the southwest failed to in duce several small Islands lying west of the Stilus, which have always been recognized as under Spanish control. The occupation ef Stbutu and Cagayan Su'u by our r.aval forces elicited a claim or. the part of Spain, the essen tial equity of which could rot be gain said. In order to cure the defect of the treaty by removing all possible ground of future misunderstanding retpectirg the interpretation of Its third article, I directed the negotiation of a supple mentary treaty, which will be forth with laid before the senate, whereby Spain quits all title ar.d claim cf title to the islands named as well as to any ar.d all islands belonging to the Philip pine archipelago lying outside the lir.es described in said third article, and agrees that ail such islands shall be comprehended in the cession of the srehipelago as fully as if they had been ixrressly included within these lines. Ir." consideration cf this cession the l'nited States is to ray to Spain the sum or ;ioo,goo. COMMERCIAL KELATION'S. I Countries with Which Special Agreement Hitt lieen Proclaimed. .ection of the tariff act have been pro- tiermany. Commercial conventions under the general limitations cf the fourth section of the same act have been concluded with Nicaragua, with Kcuador. with the Dominican republic. with Great Britain on behalf of the Island of Trinidad, and with Denmark on behalf of the Island of Ft. Croix. The will be early communicated to w.ir miaic. .rguiiaiiviiB . . ..... . governments are in progress for the improvement and security of our com mercial relations. The policy of reciprocity so manifest ly rests upon the principles or interna tional equity and has been so repeated ly approved by the people of the l'nit ed States, that there ought to be no negation in eitner brancn or tne con- i gress !n giving to it full effect. This government desires to preserve ln m0!!t Just ar1 amicable commercial relations with all foreign countries, un moved bv the industrial rivalries neces sarily developed in the expansion of International trade. It Is believed tnat the foreign governments generally en tertain the same purpose, although in some Instances there are clamorous de mands upon them for legislation specifi cally hostile to American interests. Should these demands prevail, I shall communicate with the congress with the view of advising such legislation as may be necessary to meet the emer gency. NATIONAL FINANCES. Large Surplus He venues for the FUrnl Year Ending June 30, IOOO. It Is gratifying to be able to state that the surplus revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1900, were $9,- 527,060.18. For the six preceding years we had only deficits, the ag gregate of which from 194 to 1S99, in clusive, amounted to $283,022,991.14. The receipts for the vear from all sources. exclusive of postal revenues, aggregated $567.240.831. S9, and expenditures for all purposes, except for the administration of the postal department, aggregated $4S,. 713.791.71. The receipts from cus toms were $233,164,871.16, an increase over the preceding year of $27.036.3S9.41. The receipts from Internal revenue were $295,327,926.76. an increase of 21.SH0.- 765.25 over 1399. The receipts from mis cellaneous sources were $38,748,053.97. as against $36,394,976.92 for the previ ous vear. It is gratifying to note that during the vear a considerable reduction is shown In the expenditures of the gov ernment. The war department ex penditures for the fiscal year 1900 were $134. 774.i6. .78. a reduction or 59o.Obt. 4S6.69 over those of 1899. In the navy department the expenditures were $S5. 953.077.72 for the year 1900. as against $63,942,104.25 for the preceding year, a decrease of $7.9S9.026.53. In the ex penditures on account of Indians there was a decrease in 1900 over 1899 of 630.604.3S; and in the civil and miscel laneous expenses for 1900 there was a reduction of $13.41S.06j. .4. It will be the duty as I am sure it will be the disposition of the congress to provide whatever further legisla tion is needed to insure the continued parity under all conditions between our two forms of metallic money, silver and gold. FINANCIAL ACT OF IOOO. It Effect a to Modification of National Hanking Act I Apparent. The beneficial effect of the financial act of 1900. so far as it relates to the modification of the national bankir.ir act. is already apparent. ine provision for the incorporation 01 national banks with a capital or not less than $25,000 in places not exceeding J.C00 inhabitants has resulted in the extension of bank ing facilities to many small commun ities hitherto unaoie to rrovlde them selves with banking Institutions under the national system. There were or ganized from the enactment of the law up to and Including Nov. CO. 369 nation al banks, of which 266 were with cap ital less1 man wo.wj, anu iuj witn capi tal of $50.C00 or more. It is worthy of mention that the greater number of banks being organ ized under the new law are In section where the need or banking facilities has been most pronounced. Iowa stands first, with thirty banks of the smaller elnss. while Texas. Oklahoma. Indian Territory, and the middle and western sections or tne country have also availed themselves largely of the priv ileges under the new law. A large increase in national bank note circulation has resulted from the provision of the act which permits na tional banns to issue circulating notes to the par value of the l'nited States bonds deposited as security instead of or.lv 90 per cent, thereof, as heretofore. The increase in circulating notes from March 14 to Nov. 30 is $...889,570. The party in power Is committed to such legislation as will better make the currency responsive to the varying needs of business at nil seasons and in all sections. Our foreign trade shows a remarka ble record of commercial and industrial progress. The total of imports and ex ports for the first time in the his tory of the country exceeded $2,000,000. 000. The exports are greater than they have ever been before, the total for the fiscal year 190 being $1.?94. 483.082. an increase over 1S99 e f $167.4"'.7&0. an increase over 18PS of $163.C00.7.,2. over 1897 of $343.49,526, and greater than 1S96 bv $511,876,144. I recommend that congress at Its present session reduce the internal rev enue taxes imrosd to meet the expenses of the war with Spain in the sum of $30.0CO.hO. This reduction should be secured by the remission of those taxes which experience has shown to be the most burdensome to the industries cf the people. I specially urg that there be In cluded in whatever reduction is made the legacy tax. bequests for public uses of a literary, educational or charitable character. OCR 

MERCHANT MARINE. American Vmeh Carry 9 Per Cent, of Onr Exports and Import. American vessels during the fast three years have carried about 9 per cent, of our exports and imports. For eign ships should carry the least, not the greatest, rart of American trade. The remarkable growth of our steel In dustries, the irogress cf shipbuilding for the domestic trade, and our stead ily maintained expenditures for the ravy have created an opportunity to piace the l'nited States in the first rank c f commercial maritime powers. Hesides realizing a proper national aspiration this will mean the establish ment and healthy growth along ail our coasts of a distinctive national indus try, expanding the field for profitable employment of labor and capital. 1; will increase the transportation facili ties ar.d reduce freight charges on the vast volume of products brought from the Interior to the 6eahoard for export, ar.d will strengthen an arm e.f the na tional defense upon which the founders of the government and their successors have relied. In again urging Immedi ate action by the congress on measures to promote American shipping and for eign trade. I direct attention to the recorr.rr.er.iTiors on the subject In previous messages, end particularly to the opinion expressed In the message of IS99. I am satisfied the Judgment of the country favors the policy of aid to our merchant marine, which will brcaden our commerce and markets and up build our sea-carrying capacity for the products of agriculture ana manufact ure, which, with the increase of our navy, mean more work and wages to our countrymen, as well as a safeguard to American interests in every part of the world. The attention of congress is invited to the recommendation of the secretary of the treasury in his annual report for legislation In behalf of the revenue service, and favorable action Is urged. THE OlESTION OF TRCSTA Every I'haee of It Shonld Be Carefully Studied by Congrr. In my last annual message to the congress I called attention to the neccs sity for early action to remedy such evils as might be found to exist in con nection with combinations of capital organized into trusts, and again invite atteition to my discussion of the sub ject at tnat time, wnicn conciuoea witn these words: "It is apparent that uniformity of legislation upon this subject in the sev eral states is much to be desired. It Is to be hoped that such uniformity founded in a wise and Just discrimina tion between what is injurious and what is useful and necessary in busi ness operations, may be obtained, and that means may be found for the con press, within rhe limitations cf its con stitutional power, so to supplement an effective code of state legislation as to make a complete system of laws throughout the United States adequate to compel a general observance cr tne salutary rules to which I hive re ferred." The whole question is so Important and far-reaching that I am sure no part of it will be lightly considered but every phase of it will have the studied vdeliberation of the congress, resulting in wise and Judicious action. Restraint upon such combinations as are Inlurious. and which are within federal Jurisdiction, should be promptly applied by the congress. AFFAIRS IN THE PHILIPPINES. Our Force Succrnifully Control the Great er Part of the IMandn. In my last annual message I dwelt at some length upon the condition of af fairs in the Philippines. While seek ing to impress upon you that the grave responsibility of the future govern ment of those islands rests with the congress of the United States. I ab stained from recommending at that time a specific and final form of gov ernment for the territory ac tually held by the United States forces and in which as long as insurrection contin ues the military arm must necessarily furrerr.e. I stated my purpose, un Ti the c-ongress shall have made known the formal expression of Its will, to use the authority vested in me by the con ptitution ar.d the statutes to uphold the sovereignty of the United States in those distant islancs as in all other places where our nag rightfully floats placing, to that end. at the disposal of the army ana navy an tne means which the liberality of the congress and the people have provided. Xo con trary expression or the will 01 the con gress having been made. I have stead fastly pursued tne purpos? so declared employing the civil arm as well toward the accomplishment of pacifrcation and the institution or local governments within the lines of authority and law. Progress in the hored-for direction has been favorable. Our forces have successfully controlled the greater part of the islands, overcoming the crgan Ized forces of the insurgents ar.d car rying order and administrative regular Itv to all quarters. What opposition remains is for the most part scattered, obeying no concerted plan of strategic action, operating only Dy tne methods common to the traditions of guerrilla warfare, which, while Ineffective to al ter tlV general control row established, are still sufficient to beget insecurity among the populations that have fell the good results of cur control and thus delay the conferment upon them of the fuller measures of local self-government, of education, and of Industrial and agricultural development which we stand "ready to give them. Bv the spring of this year the effec tive opposition of the dis.satisfied Ta gals to the authority of the United States was virtually ended, thus open ing the door for the extension of a sta the administration over much of the territory of the archipelago. Desiring to bring this about. I appointed in March last a civil commission com posed of the Hon. William H. Taft of Ohio; Professor Dean C. Worcester of Michigan: the Hon. Luke K. Wright of Tennessee; the Hon. Henry C. Ide of Vermont, and Professor Bernard Moses of California. The aims of their mis sion and the scope of their authority are clearly set forth in my instructions of April 7. 1900. addressed to the sec retary of war to be transmitted to them. The president then quotes what he said in regard to the Philippines and the duties of the commission in his mes sage to congress cf December, 1S99. 

PROCLAMATION OF AMNESTY. It Was Taken Advantage of by Many of the Insurgent. Coincidental!- with the entrance of the commission upon its labors I caused to be issued by General Mac-Arthur, the military governor of the Philip pines, on June 21. 1900. a proclamation of amnesty in generous terms, of which many of the insurgents took advantage, amor.g them a number of important leaders. This commission, composed of emi- noi citizens representing the diverse reographlcal and political interests of the country, and bringing to their task the ripe fruit3 of long and intelligent service in educational, administrative and Judicial careers, made great prog ress from the outset. As early as Aug. 21. 1900, it submitted a preliminary re port, which win oe laid oerore the con gress, and from whteh it appears that already the good effects of returning order are felt: that business, interrupt ed by hostilities, is improving as peace extends; that a larger area is under sugar cultivation than ever before; that the customs revenues are greater than at any time during the Spanish rule: that economy ana emcienoy In the military administration have created a surplus fund of $6.0CO.0C. available for i reeded public improvements: that a stringent civil service law is in prepar- 1 atlon: that railroad communications are expanding, opening up rich dis tricts, and that a comprehensive scheme of education is being organized. Later reports trnm the commission show yet more encouraging advance to ward insuring the benefits of liberty and good government to the FiliDinos. in the interest of humanity and with i the aim of bubdirg up an enduring. self-supporting, and self-adminlsterlrg community in those far eastern seas. I would impress upon the congress that whatever legislation may be enacted in reepect to the Philippine island thould be along these generous lines. The fort une of war has thrown upon this na tion an unsought trust which should b? unselfishly discharged, and devolved upon this government a moral as well as material responsibility toward these millions when we have freed from an oppressive yoke. I have upon another oceasion called the Filipinos "the wards of the nation.' lightly assumed: it must rot be other wise than honestly fulfilled, aiming first of all to benefit these who have come urdcr our fostering care. It is our duty to treat them that our flag may be no less beloved in the moun tains of Luzon and the fertile zones of Mindanao and Negros than it is at home, that there as here it shall be the revered symbol of liberty, enlighten men. and progress in every avenue of development. The Filipinos are a race quick to learn and to profit by knowledge. He would be ra?h who, with the teachings would fix a limit to the degree of cul ture and advancement yet within the reach of those people if our duty to ward them be faithfully perrormea. CUBA AND PORTO RICO. What the President Say Concerning Thru Two Island. The civil government of Porto Rico provided for by the act of the congress approved April 12, 1900, is in success ful operation. The courts have been established. The governor and his as sociates, working intelligently and nar moniouslv. are meeting with comenda ble success. On the 6th of November a general election was heid in the isl and for members of the legislature, and the body elected has been called to con vene on the first Monday or DecemDer. I recommend that legislation be en- acted by the congress conferring upon the secretary of the interior supervis ion over the public lands in Porto Rico, and that he be directed to ascer tain the location and quantity of lands the title to which remained in the crown of Spain at the date of cession of Porto Rico to the l'nited States, and that appropriations necessary for sur veys be made, and that the methods of the disposition of such lands De pre scribed bv law. On the"25th of July. 1900. I directed that a call be issued for an election in Cuba for members of a constitutional convention to frame a constitution as a basis for a stable and Independent government in the island. I renew the recommendation made in my special, message of Feb. 10. 1S99, as to the necessity for cable communi cation between the l'nited States and Hawaii, with extension to Manila. Since then circumstances have strikingly em phasized his need. Surveys have shown the entire feasibility of a chain of ca bles which at each stopping place shall touch on American territory, so that the system shall be under our own com plete control. Manila once within tele graphic reath, connection with the sys tems of the Asiatic coast would onen increased and profitable opportunities for a more direct cable route from our shores to the Orient than is now af forded by the' trans-Atlantic, conti nental and trans-Asian lines. I urge attention to this Important matter. 

NATIONAL DEFENSES. Strength of the Army Millions Tor Fort nnd Guns. The present strength of the army is 100, 0C0 men 65.000 regulars und 35.000 volunteers. Under the act of March 2. 1S99, on the 30th of June next the present volunteer force will be dis charged and the regular army will be reduced to 2,447 oflicers und 29,025 en listed men. In 1SSS a board of officers convened by President Cleveland adopted a compre hensive scheme of coast defense forti riaetions, which involved the outlay of something over $100,000,000. This plan received the approval of the congress, and since then regular appropriations have been made and the work of forti fication has steadily progressed. More than $60.OuO.0C0 have been invested in a great number of forts and guns, with all the complicated and scientific ma chinery and electrical appliances neces sary for their use. The proper care of this defensive machinery requires men trained in Its use. The number of men necersary to perform this duty alone is ascertained by the war depart ment at a minimum allowance to be 18.420. There are fifty-eight or more military posts in the United States oth er than the coast defense fortifications. The number of these posts is being constantly Increased by the congress. More than $22,000,000 have been expend ed in building and equipment, and they can only be cared for by the regu lar, army. The posts now in existence and others to be built provide for ac commodations for. and If fully gar-risone-d, require 26,000 troops. Many of these posts are along our frontier or at important strategic tKiints, the occupation of which is necessary. We have in Cuba between o,000 and 6,- 000 troops. For the present our troops in that island cannot be withdrawn or materially diminished, ami certainly not until the conclusion of the labors of the constitutional convention now In session and a government provided bv the new constitution shall have been established and its stability assured. In Porto Rico we have reduced the garrisons to 1,636. which include 896 na tive troops. There Is no reason for further reduction here. We will be re quire'! to keep a considerable force in the Philippine Islanus for some time to come. From the best Information obtainable we shall need there for the immediate future from 50.000 to 60.000 men. I am sure the number may be re duced as the insurgents shall come to acknowledge the authority of the Unit ed States, of which there are assuring indie-ations. It must be apparent thpt we will re quire an army of about 60.000 and that during present conditions in Cuba and the Philirjpines the president should have authority to increase the force to the present number of 100.000. In- luded in this number authority should be given to raise native troops in the Philippines up to Id.000. which the Taft commission believe will be more ef fective in detecting and suppressing guerrillas, assasinations and ladrones than our own soldiers. The full dis cussion of this subje-ot by the secVetary of war in his annual report Is called to your earnest attention. 

GROWTH OF POSTAL SERVICE. Extension of Rural Free Delivery In crM oT the Navy. The continued and rapid growth of postal service is a sure Index of the great and Increasing business activity of the country. Its most striking r.ew development is the extension of rural free delivery. This has come almost wholly within the last year. At the beginning of the fiscal year 1&99-19C0 the number of routes in operation was only 391. ar.d most of these had teen run ning less than twelve months. On the 15th of November. 1900. the number had increased to 2.614. reaching Into forty four states and territories, and pervlr.g a peculation of 1.801.524. The numbe-r of applications now penolr.s and await ing action nearly equals all those granted up to the present time, and ' by the close ejf the eurrvnt fiscal year about 4.000 routes will have teen estab lished, providing for the daily delivery of mails at the scattered homes of about 3.5"'0.0OO of rural population. This service ameliorates the isolation of farm life, conduces te good roads, and ojTlckens and extends thedlssemlna tion 0 general Information. Kxperience thus far has tended to illay the ap prehension that It would be so ex pensive as to forbid Its general adop tion or make it a serious burden. Its actual application has shown that It increases postal reoelpts. and can be accompanied by reductions, in other branches of the service, so that the augmented revenues and the accom plished savlrrs together materially r duc the net cost.

The full development of this fpedal service however, requires such an outlay of money that it should be undertaken only after a careful study and thor ough understanding cf all that it In vofves. Very efficient service has been ren dered by the navy in connection with the insurrection in the Philippines and the recent disturbance in China. A very satisfactory settlement has ""ren made of the long-pending question of the manufacture of armor-plate. A reasonable price has been secured and the necessity for a government armor plant avoided. I approve of the reromendatlon of the secretary of the navy for new vessels and for additional officers and men which the required Increase of the navy makes necessary. I commend to the favorable action of the congress the measure now pending for the erection of a statue to the memory of the late Admiral David Tj. Porter. I commend also the establishment of a national na val reserve and of the grade of vice ad miral. Provision should be made, as recommended by the secretary, for suit able rewards for special merit. Many officers who rendered the most rilstin guished service during the recent war with Spain have received In return no recognition from the congress.
