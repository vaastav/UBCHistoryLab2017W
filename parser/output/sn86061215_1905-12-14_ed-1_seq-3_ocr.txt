Interest in the welfare of the south fs being taken by the country as a whole. As the feeling of sectionalism fs disappearing and as more and more people from the northern states visit the territory across the Mason and Dixon line, it can be seen that there (ret remain many of the scars that Were wounds during the civil war. These scars, while they are not in the minds and fiearts of the people of the south, are still to be seen in the business life of the states that were !»f the confederacy years ago, and the tvhoie country is anxious to aid the touth in its efforts to regain its old prosperity. Congressman Boutell in recent speech in New York, threw father a new light on the condition in Ihe southern states. He stated that ihe commercial and Industrial develop­'!tion ment of that large area lying between ifason and Dixon's line and the gulf, jk nas been greatly retarded because of the sparsely settled rural districts. He points out that the crying need of the #Jjl south is for men. While in Ohio there jijare 102 inhabitants per square mile, WiV^crosB the river to the southward yra' here are only twenty-nine inhabitants M* the square mile. There is a ?v]t nental difference, also, between the rajfr -two peoples. In the south there is a temperamental and inherited inapti­•SSTlJSS tude for the thorough cultivation of 'he south's rich soil for the develop ig of her mines, and for the manu icturing from the abundance of raw laterial the goods to draw from the larkets of the world a flood of wealth lat, like new blood, would further imulate activity and promote growth. The south needs men, but from hence must they come? In answer, r. Boutell recites that between 1820 id 1900 about 20,000,000 immigrants ime to this country and that practic ly all of them made their homes in north and west. It is within the wer and province of this govern-.some ent to aid in diverting this tide of lmigratlon to the southland, there to still its leaven of industry and fru llity among a people who promise a lick response to a strong enlivening fluence. There is no desire on the part of Mr. autell to convey the impression that ie south has -stood still since the |ar. On the contrary, he shows that ie most hopeful signs have been the eakliig up of the large plantations (to small farms and the growing ten-|fu]telephone mcy to more diversified agriculture, ie figures he quotes show that be eeii 1880 and 1890 the south's invest ment in agriculture increased 72 per 'int, while that of the rest of the mntry increased 62 per cent. The ilue of farm properties in the south Ivanced from $2,300,000,000 to $4, 10,000,000 and the annual value of rm products from $660,000,000 to $1, 10,^)00,000. During the same period je/ south's capital invested in manu turing increased from $257,000,000 $1,153,000,000, or 348 per cent, as tainst an increase of 242 per cent in ie rest of the country.

It's well "worth In his message, and one which piay be overlooked for some of the very press ing ones, is that of the immense immi gration into this country from Europe. The alien peril has ceased to be a far off possibility and has become a reality. This fact is made the more plain by the figures included in the report, just filed in Washington, of Commissioner General Sargent. This report says, in part: "The total alien arrivals reported for the year of 1.026,499 represents an in crease over the preceding year of 213,629, of which the continental ports of the United States report 196,940, as compared with arrivals thereat last year, and the Canadian ports 13,840. "At the insular ports the increase was 2,849, although the arrivals at Porto Rico were less by 94 than in 1904. There also was a large increase in arrivals at southern ports, while a decrease is shown for the Pacific ports, which is accounted for in some measure by the Russian-Japanese war. "Of the increased arrivals above re ferred to Austria-Hungary sent. 98,537 more than its quota of 1904 Russia, 39,756 Italy, 28,183 and the united kingdom, 49,544. This Increase from the last mentioned country, says the commissioner, is offset by the de creases from Germany,. Switzerland I and Sweden. Notwithstanding the in crease from Italy that country, says the commissioner, may be regarded as having probably reached the high wv ter mark." When aliens without resources come to America the load upon the country is increased with ^very shipload. Laws I must be enacted to" restrict immigra tion to iome degree. The subject is a vital une and should nofbe' ignored by congress. President Roosevelt, in his message of this year and last, struck t'le key I note to the situation when he said "We cannot have too much Irosnigra of the right kind we should have I none at all of the wrong kind." In other words, laws should by strictly enforced that will keep out the "wrong kind," but will not prohibit the entrance of "the right kind."

Representative John F. Lacey of the cixtli district, has the committee on puolic lands, Col. W. P. Henbvrn is chairman of the committee on interstate and for eign commerce, and J. A. T. l-Iull lieads the committee on military af fairs. These are three of the best ap pointments and Iowa is highly hon ored, indeed. Added to this is the fact that Senator Allison is chairman of the steering committee in the up per house and that Senator Dolliver will be among foremost, workers for the passage of a railroad :ate law that will come up to the requirements laid clown by the Pres. lent in his mes sage. th» Iowa is .vell represented at Wash ington. and Iowans have every reason to be proud of the men who are "the gentlemen from Iowa." At the pres ent session of congress they will be among the most important personages in either house. At the head of alj of them, of course, is Senator Allison, than whom no one in the senate i3 more generally respected nor more highly regarded. There is no place in the nation where his judgment is not considered as good as the best on subjects of legislation and general good. Though he is nearing the age of SO years he is still hale and hearty and gives promise of many more years of usefulness. In this connection the following irom the Kansas City Star Is "bf inter est to Iowa people. "That was a genuine bon mot which Senator Allison, of Iowa, handed to senator Proctor when the septuagena rian froiji lev.-a asked the septuagena rian from Vermont what he was going to do with all the spare time he will have on hand during the tnirty years of life remaining .to him after his re tirement from the senate at the age of 80. "Allison himself is 76. but doesn't near look it. He has ripened in that clear red and white way, which is not only tremendously attractive, but is, likewise, morally significant.

While to the uninitiated this young r man's success might look like it was r, .. inspired "luck," It was in reality the Pi manner. His quick judgment enabled,soon rial for the best account of the con-I^L,^ seasona.nd flagration. Perhaps it was accidental that he went to Buffalo to finish his vacation, but it is just as probable that his trained sense, his "nose for news," taught him that the biggest man in the nation would attract a big crowd to the fair at that very time and that if any news of a peculiar character was liable to be available, it would be at Buffalo that day. So many young men who begin work as newspaper reporters and find it dis tasteful say that they were not "lucky" but they omit to say that they were not alive to their opportunities. It is the same, to some extent in nearly every line of business where success depends upon a man's indi vidual actions and his readiness to as sume responsibility for an act that must be done at once or not at all. Good judgment is as necessary in a reporter, much more so in fact, than the ability to get up a story in good English. Not only reporters but young men in general, can see something more than luck in Foster's success. He doubtless could.

DEMOCRATIC INDORSEMENT ROOSEVELT. OF The New York Sun.—A story has leaked out by the democratic caucus that a member of the Virginia delega tion introduced a resolution indorsing Theodore Roosevelt and urginsr his nomination for the presidency by the democratic party in 1908. The name of the introducer has not been dis closed, but it is said that Represen tative James Hay, of Virginia, made a vigorous protest against the resolution and it was dropped after a brief but heated discussion. It was then decid ed to bind every member present to absolute secrecy—with the usual re sult. The champion of Mr. Roosevelt in the democratic caucus was only re flecting- the popular sentiment In Richmond at the time of and after the President's visit. Eastern Virginia Is very partial to him. If the files of the Richmond papers of about that time are consulted, it will be seen, if our memory serves us, that it was serious ly proposed to make Mr. Roosevelt the democratic candidate In 1908. Never theless, Virginia and the whole south voted very much as usual on election day. The process of converting south ern democrats into republicans Is very slow and toilsome. It might be supposed if southern democrats were not peculiar that there was a genuine movement among them to swing over to Mr. Roosevelt and accept him as their leader iri na- thing for the collie students to do tional affairs.

INTERESTING TALKS BY A. L. URICH OF DES MOINES AND REV. W. H. HORMEL Large Attendance at Open Meeting Under Auspices of Ottumwa Trades and Labor Assembly at Labor Hall Last Evening—The Adresses. Money in itself and of itself can not earn money. Christ has comnnn.1 ed us to take no interest from our brother and every man in thc« world is our brother," said Rev. W. H. Hormel in his address on the solving of the labor problems, given at the open meeting of the Trades and I.abor as sembly Friday evening in Labor hall. Rev. Horme! is pa tor of the East End Presbyterian church. The meeting was also addressed by A. L. Urich of Des Moines, nresident of the State Federation of Lobor. Both speakers dwelt on labor conditions and labor problems. A good sized audience was present. Rev. Hormel was the first speaker, He •said in part "Christ came among the poor, he stayed poor all his lite. He was not ashamed to earn hns way by manual labor and to eat his bread bathed in the sweat of his brow. He went out among the poor and talked to them. Some people seem to think that Christianity is a sort of paid up insurance policy that takes effect at death, but It was not for this that Christ came. He came for the living and not for the dead to teach men how to live and to give them life. "The allegiance of all men should be to him, because he is the only true, just, the only real man. There is a brother workman that stands at the head of this great universe and he it Is who controls all the powers that be, all the nations' in this world, and he stands ready to direct them for the general good of all those who want to be men. Love or Force. "There are just two ways to bring about the conditions that we want. The rights and conditions that civiliza tion stands for. That Is liberty, free dom, education and protection of prop erty, and peace among men. First, there Is Christ's way—the love plan. The bther is the law plan. That is by means of police, armies, navieB, jails, penitentiaries, and all of the weapons used by human law. The latter plan has been tried for thousands of years I and yet look at the result. "Take the condition In some of the foreign countries today, or for that matter in our own. Standing armies they have and have had for years' and years. Civilization has advanced. People should be better if that plan is a success. Do we hear anything of the lessening of the armies? No. There is all the time a cry for larger stand ing armies, greater navies. Who pays for these great armaments? Whose sons are they that fill the ranks? Is it those who sit In the highest places? {Is it the noble, the barons, the great financiers, the rulers? You can answer that question for yourself. Every year the forces of the law are Increased and the Increase is demanded. "It is what Christ said, 'Give hate and ye shall get hate, give love and it shall be returned to you.' I have many relatives In Germany. They are many of them young men. In this country there are many of us who are men. Supposing there' should be a war between this country and Ger many. We of the same blood would be forced by our allegiance to our countries to fight against each other. And so while we both profess to be lieve in Christ, we would sin against his express command, 'Thou shalt not kill.' Banding Together. "In France and in other foreign countries the working men are begin ning to open their eyes. They are banding together and are agreeing that they will not fight with their brothers of other countries. "Christ Is today taking hold of the hearts of men In a greater measure than ever before. If we miss him in the solution of any of these problems' we will find that our solution is wrong. We may find what seems a solution of a problem, but It will only change' the form of the problem and it will still exist as unsolved as before. You must remove the spirit of covetousness from the human race before these problems may bp solved. "Men must first learn that money of! tiself cannot make money. Christ has commanded us to take no interest from our brother. All men are broth ers, according to him. The religion of Christ is a one coat religion. "No man can be truly happy In the possession of great wealth or even of very moderate wealth as long as there is one other'who needs some of the things that he possesds. I would rather go through life like Christ, poor as he was, without even a place to lay myj head, than to go through life like John D. Rockefeller. "The labor problem cannot be solved by steps taken along economic or industrial lines alone. As long as we neglect Christ the problem is still there." Urich Speaks. President Urich was then Introduced and spoke at length on the history of the labor problem and the progress made by organized labor toward the betterment of the conditions of the laborer. He said in part: "I am very glad to be with you on this occasion. I cannot speak to you of the labor' question from as high a plane as the eloquent speaker who has just finished, but it is my Intention to speak of it. from our view point. The labor move ment is as old as the world. "The simplest form of labor was ab solute slavery, where one man owned another, body and soui where the slave was not even allowed the right of worship. After the coming of that greatest of all leaders, the one men tioned by our brother, the doors of the churches were opened to all, even to slaves. Following this there grew ud the feudal system, where the la- 'Jh mumkmmmmsmmm mm borer, whiie possessing some rights to targain for his toll, was yet bound to the soil and could not piove from place to place. "After, the. industrial revolution, labor lieiame free to a certain extent. In this history I am using the history of labor in England as a basis, for it was from England that we got our first laborers, our customs, our conditions and in a great part our laws. "Then came the advent of machin ery. First, before the commercial in troduction of steam, all of the little factories were along rivers away from cities so that water power might be utilized. Until this time labor re quired physique and skill. Now a wo man might do labor in a factory as I well as a man. So women as laborers were first used at this time. "Then it was seen that children might do as well as women, and here was the beginning of the child labor problem. Labor Organizations. "Then though labor was allowed no right of organization it did organize se cretly and by organganlzation was able to break away from some of these des perate conditions. Progress continued until early in the nineteenth century when organized labor compelled parlia ment to recognize the conditions that existed and to take steps for its allevia tion. Of the more recent progress you are informed. But this one thing, ev ery advancing step in the progress of the condition of the laborer has been gained by organization and by organi zation alone." The speaker then spoke pf the em ployers of labor and the differing atti tudes taken toward organized labor by different ones. In this connection he said: "The object of organized labor is not to pull any man down from a pedestal no matter how high, but to lift up all those who work for wages to as high a plane as possible." Mr. Urich then gave a brief sketch of the history of the organization pf capital and then dwelt at length on the history of organized labor, saying that the organization of the working forces had been coincident with and to a great extent caused by the merg ing of capital. In speaking of the child labor prob lem he said: "Men are beginning to realize that the future of a nation de pends upon the condition of the labor ing class ot the future. A child who has worked in the factory from its early childhood is not fit to become a parent. It may still retain the faculty of reproducing Its faculty, but Its off spring must be degenerate both mor ally and physically." The Independent Laborer. Again in speaking of the so-called independent laborer he said: "Liberty in its broadest sense means the right to do anything that one may wish to do. But this is not the Interpretation given to the word by civilization We, all of us who belong to society, have this liberty curtailed to a certain ex tent, possessing what is known as civil liberty giving up some of our own rightB to. advance the rights of others.
