The regular session of congress began to day, with 66 senators and 216 member present in their respective places. The president's annual message was read to both houses. The message begins with a review of foreign relations, referring t the Belgian and Ger man government's restrictions agtlnst Ameri can food products, and to the action of Brazil In giving notice to terminate the commercial arrangements with this country.

The report of the attorioy-general notes the gratifying progress made by the supremo court in overcoming the arrears of Its business and in reaching a condition In which it will bo able to dispose or casos as they arise without any unreasonable delav. This result is of course very largely due to tho successful working of the plan Inaugurating circuit courts of appeals. In respect to theso tribunals the suggestion is made in quarters entitled to tho highest con sideration that an additional circuit judge for each circuit would greatly strengthen these courts and the confidence reposed in their adjudication, anl that such an addition wjuld not create a greator forca or Ju Igos thin tin Inoreasln business of such courts requires. The perma nent solution of what is called the Indian prob lem is probably not to be expected at once, but meanwhile such ameliorations pf present con ditions as the existing system will admit ought not to be neglected. 1 am satisfied there should . be a federal court established for the territory with sufficient Judges and that this court should sit within the territory and have the same jur isdiction as to territorial affairs as is now vested in the federal courts sitting in Arkansas and Texas. Another subject of pressing moment referred to by the attorney-general is the reorganiza tion of the Union Paoiflo Railroad Co. on a basis equitable as regards all private inter ests and as favorable to the government as ex isting conditions will permit The operation of a railroad by a court through a receiver Is an anomalous state of things which should bo terminated on all grounds, pubtlo and private, at the earllost possible moment It is not my purpose at this time to repeat the considerations which make an Inpregnabla case in favor of the ownership and manage ment by the government of the penal institu tions in which federal prisoners are confined. I simply desire to again urge former recom mendations on the subject and to particularly call the attention of the congress to that part of the report of the secretary of war, in whloh he states that tho military prison at Fort Leavenworth. Kan., can be turned over to the government as a prison for federal conviots without the least diffloultyand with an actual laving of money from every point of view. Tost Office Affair. The report of the postmaster-general pre sents a comprehensive statement of the opera tions of the post office department for the last fiscal year. The receipts of the department during the year amounted to $75,080,479.01 and the expenditures of 81.3:4.111.13. The trans actions of the postal service Indicate with barometrlo certainty the fluctuations in busi nesses of the country. Inasmuch, therefore, as business complications continued to exist the last year to an unforeseen extent It Is not surprising that the deflolenoy of revenues' to meet the expenditures of the post o.Uce department, whloh was estimated in advance at about 48,000,003, snould be exoesded by nearly $1,250,000. The ascertained revenues of tlon for the current year, being less thin esti mated, the deficiency for the current year will be correspondingly greater, though the post master-general states mat tne latest indica tions are so favorable that he confidently pre dicts an increase of at least 8 per cent, in the revenues of the current year over those of the last year. The expenditures increase steaaiiy and necessarily with the growth and needs of the country, so that the defi ciency is greater or less in any year depending upon the volume of receipts, une postmaster-general states mat mis aenciency is unnecessary and might be obviated at once if the laws regulating rates upon mall matter of the second class was modified. The rate re ceived for the transmission of this second-class matter Is 1 cent per pound, while the cost of such transportation to the government is eight times that amount In the general terms of the law this rate covers newspapers and peri odicals. The extensions of the meaning of these terms from time to time have admitted to the privileges intended for legitimate news papers and periodicals a surprising range of publication, and created abuses the cost of which amounts in the aggregate to the total deficiency of the post office department. Pre tended newspape-s are started by business houses for the purpose of advertising goods, complying with the law in form only, and dis continuing the publications as soon as the pe riod of advertising is over. Another abuse con sists in the free carriage through the malls of hundreds of tons of seed and grain, uselessly distributed through the department of agriculture. The postmaster-general fpre. diets that if the law is so amended as to eradicate these abuses, not only will the post office department show no deficiency, but he believes that In the near future all legitimate newspapers, periodicals and maga zines might be properly transmitted through the malls to their subscribers, free or cost. I Invite your prompt consideration of this sub ject and fully indorse the views of the postmaster-general. The total number cf post offices in the United States on the 30th day of June, 1891, was 60,803, an increase of 1.403 over the preceding year: of these 8.428 were presiden tial, an Increase of sixty-eight over the preced ing year. Six hundred and ten cities and towns are provided with free delivery, ninety-three other cities and towns entitled to this service under the law have not been accorded It on ac count of Insufficient funds. The expense ol free delivery for the current fiscal year will be more than 12,300.000, and under existing legis lation this Item of expenditure is subject to constant inorease. Tho estimated cost of ru. free delivery generally Is so very large that It nueht not to be considered in the present con dition of affairs. During the year 830 addi tional domestic money order offices were es tablished. Thj total number of these offices at the close of the year was 19,264. There were 11.301,011 money orders Issued during the year, being an increase over the preceding year of 994,306. The value of these ordes amounted to $138,793,379.49, an inorease or 1 1.217,21 .84. There were also issued during the year postal notes amounting to $12,619,091.95. During the year 218 International money order offloes were added to those already established, making a total of 2,625 such offices in operation June 30, 1891. The number of International money or ders issued during the year was 917.828, a de crease In number of 133,176, and their value was $18,792,455.31, a decrease in amount of $2, 849,382.9 . The number of orders paid was 361, 180, an increase over tho preceding year of 60, 293, and their value was t8.i63.l93.78, an In crease of $11,285,118,03. From the foregoing statements it appears that the total issue of money orders and postal notes for the year amounted to 1183,235.129.35. The number of let ters and packages mailed during the year for special delivery was 3,436.970. The special de livery stamps used upon these letters and packages amounted to $313.6)7. The messen gers' fees paid for their delivery amounted to $201,206.70, leaving a balance in favor or the government or 82,437.3). The report shows most gratirylng results In the way or economies In the cost and amount or supplies used In the service, amounting in all to $16,619,017.12. The report also contains a valuable contri bution to the history or the universal postal union, an arrangement which amounts prac tically to the establishment or one postal sys tem for the entire civilized world. There are now conneotei with the post offloe establishment 32,661 employes who are in the classified service. This inoludes many who have been classified upon the suggestion of the postmaster-general He states that an other year's experience at the head or the de partment serves only to strengthen the con viction as to the excellent working or the civil service law in this branch or the publlo serv ice. Onr Navy. Attention la called to the report of the sec tary of the navy, which shows very gratifying progress in the construction of ships for our navy. All the vessels now building, including the three torpedo boats authorized at the last session of congress, and excepting the first class battleship Iowa, will probably be com pleted during the coming flsoal year. The es timates for the Increase of the navy for the year ending June 30, 1806, are large, but they Include praotlcally the entire sum necessary to complete and equip all the new ships now in commission; so that, unless new ships are au thorized, the appropriation for the naval serv ice for the flsoal year ending June 30, 1897, should fall below the estimates for the coming year by at least $12,000,000. The secretary presents with much earnest ness a plea for the authorisation of three ad ditional battleships and twelve torpedo boats. If we ara to have a navy for warlike operations. increase both the number of battleships and torpedo boats. I feel it my Imperative duty to call attention to the recommendation of the secretary in re gard to the personnel of the line of the navy. The. RtJionatlnn nf nromotlon In this the Vital branch of the service Is so great as to seriously impair its efficiency. I consider it of the ut most importance that the young and middle aged officers should before the eve of retire ment be permitted to reach a grade entitling them to active and Important duty. The system adopted a few years ago regu latiig the employment of labor at the navy yards Is rigidly upheld and has fully demonstrated Its usefulness and expediency. It Is within the domain of civil service reform in as much as workmen are employed through a board of labor selected at each navy yard, and are given work without reference to poll tics and in order of their application, prefer ences, however, being given to army and navy veterans and those having former navy yard experience. The Interior Department. The report of the secretary of the Interior exhibits the situation of the numerous and in teresting branches of the publlo service con nected with his department. I recommend this report and the valuable recommendations or the secretary to carerul attention or congress. The publlo land disposed or during the year amounted to 10,450,100.77 aores, including 2,887,605 or Indian lands. It Is estimated that the publlo domain still re maining amounts to a little more than 603,003, 000 acres, excluding, however, about 360,000,003 acres in Alaska as well as military reservations and railroad and other selections of lands un adjudicated. The total cash receipts from sale of land amounted to 12,671,283.79, including t91.982.03 re ceived for Indian lands. Thirty-five thousand patents were Issued for agrlcultnral lands and 3,100 patents were Issued to Indians on allot ments or their holdings in severalty, the land so alloted being Inalienable by the Indian al lottees for a period of twenty-flve years after patent There were certified and patented on account of railroad and wagon road grants dur ing the year, 863,556.45 acres of land, and at the close of the year 29.000.00J acres were embraced In the list of selections made by railroad and wagon road companies and awaited settlement The selections of swamp lands and that taken A4 indamnltv therefor since the passage of the act providing ror the same in 1819 amount to nearly or quite 80,500,000 acres.of which 53,000,000 have been patented to states, about 138.000 acres were patented during last year. Nearly 820.000 acres of school and educational grants were approved during the year and at Its close 1, 250,362,81 acres remained unadjusted. An exceedingly Important recommendation of the secretary relates to the manner In which contests and litigated cases growing out of ef forts to obtain government land are de termined. I concur in the opinion that the commissioner of the general land office should be relieved of this duty of deciding litigated land cases; that a non-partisan court should be created to pass on such cases and that decis ions of thl3 court should be final, at least so far as the decisions of the department are Anal. The registers and receivers who originally hear and decide these disputes should be In vested with authority to compel witnesses to attend and testify before them. Though the condition or the Indians shows a steady and healthy progress, their situation Is not satis factory at all points. Some of them to whom allotments of lands have been made are found to be unable or disciplined to rollow agricultu ral pursuits, or to otherwise beneficially man age their land. I am convinced that the proper solution or the Indian problem and the success or every step taken In that direction depends, to a very large extent, upon the Intelligence and honesty or the reservation agents and the Interest they have In their work. An unfit agent will make no effort to advance the Indians on his reserva tion toward civilization or preparation for al lotment of lands In severalty, and his opinion as to their condition In this and other regards Is heedless and valueless. The Intelligent Indian school management of the past year has been followed by gratify ing results. Efforts have been made to ad vance the work in a sound and practical man 1 ner. The appropriation for the current year ending June 3 J, 1895, applicable to the' ordinary expenses or the Indian service, amounts to $6,733,003.18, being less by $663,240.04 than the sum appropriated on the same account the previous year. At the close of the last fiscal year, on the 39th day of June, 1894. there were 969.514 per cm nn tho Tension rolls, belnir a net increase of 3.531 over the number reported at the end of the previous year. Tnese pensioners may ' be classified as rollows: Soldiers and sailors, survivors or all wars, 753,368; widows and rela tives of deceased soldiers. 215,151; army nurses In war of the rebellion. 414. ur tnese pension ers 32 039 are surviving soldiers of Indian and other wars prior to tha late civil war and the widows and relatives of such soldiers. The remainder, numbering 937,505, are re ceiving pensions on account of the war of the rebellion, and or these 4J9.344 are on the rolls under the authority or the act or June 27. 890. sometimes called the dependent pension law. The total amount expended ror pensions dur ing the vear was $139.8 U.4'l. 05. leading an un expected balance from tho sum appropriated r i23.205.712.6. The sum necessary to inee ension expenditures for the year ending June 30, 1896, Is estimated at $140,000.00). The commissioner of pensions Is of the opinion that the year 1893 being the thirtieth after the close of the war of the ebellloa must, acoording to sensible human calculation f the highast limit jpj the pena'.on roMftjl Coat afterThat year it must "begin to deoline. The claims pending in the bureau have de creased to more than 9,000 during the year. A large proportion of the new claims tiled are for increase of pension by those now on the rolls. The number or certificates issued was b,zi The names dropped from the rolls for all causes during the year numbered 37,951. Among our pensioners are nine widows and three daughters of soldiers of the revolution, and forty-five survivors of the war of 1812. The completion of the eleventh census Is now in charge or the commissioner or labor. The total disbursement on account or the work for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1891, amount ed to $10,365,678.81. At the close of the year the number of persons employed in the census of fice was 679. At present there are about 400. The whole number of volumes necessary to comprehend the eleventh census will be twenty-flve and they will contain 22,270 printed pages. Agricultural Blatters. The secretary of agriculture In his report re views the operations of his department for the last fiscal year, and makes recommen dations for the further extension of Its use fulness. He reports a saving In expenditures during the year or $600,030, which is covered back into the treasury. This sum i3 23 per cent, or the entire appropriation, as special study has been made or the demand for Amer ican farm products in all roreign markets, es pecially In Great Britain. That country received rrom the United States during the nine months ending September 30, 1891,303,901 live beer cattle, valued at $26,500, 000 as against 182.611 cattle, valued at 16,634, 003 during the same period ror 1893. During the first six months or 1891 the United King dom took also 112,000,030 pounds or dressed beer from the United States valued at nearly $10,030,000. Thn rpnnrr. shows that durinsr the nine months immediately preceding September 30,1891, the j United States exported to Great Britain 222, 676,000 pounds of pork, or apples 1.900,000 bushels, valued at 2.500,030 and or horses 2,811 at an average value of $139 per head. There was a falling off In Amer ican wheat exports of 13,500,030 bushels and the secretary is inclined to believe that wheat may not in the future be the staple export cereal product of our country, but that corn will con tinue to advance In importance as an export on account of the new uses to which it is con stantly being appropriated. The exports of agricultural products rrom me unuea iiea for the fiscal year ending June 3u, iyi, amouas pd to M28.381 0J8. bains 72.28 per cent, of Amer ican exports of every description, and the United Kingdom or ureal untain iook more thon 54 per cent, of all farm products finding foreign markets. The amount appropriated ror the weatner bureau was 951.100. Or that sum $138,500, or 14 tier cfint.. has been saved and Is returned to the treasury. The appropriation to the bureau or animal industry was $s o.uju ana me ex penditures for the vear were only $195,429 24, thus leaving unexpended $354,570.76. The in spection or beer animals ror export ana inter state trade has been continued and 12,911,058 hfiad were insnected durinsr the year at a cost or 1 cent per head against 4tf cents ror 1893. The secretary or agrlouiture recommenas that the law providing ror the microscopical Inspection or export and Interstate meat be so amended as to compel owners of the meat in spected to pay the cost or such inspection and I call attention to the arguments presented In his report In support or this recommendation. The live beer cattle exported and tagged dur ing the year numbered 363,333. This is an in crease or 69.533 head over the previous year. The office or experiment stations, which Is a part of the United States department of agri culture, has during the past year engaged Itself almost wholly In preparing ror publication works based upon the reports or the agricult ural experiment stations and other Institutions for agricultural Inquiry In the United States and foreign countries. The department expened in the fiscal year 1892, $2,354,809.56 and out of that sum the total amount expended In sclentilio research was 45.6 per cent But In the year ended June 30. 1894, out of a total expenditure of $1,915,988.38 the department applied 51 per cent, of that sum to scientlflo works and Investigation. It is deemed possible that an agricultural census may be taken each year through the agents of the statistical division or the depart ment Such a course Is commended ror trial bythechler or that division. The work done by the department or agriculture Is very super ficially dealt with In this communication and I commend the report or the secretary and the very Important Interests with which it deals to the carerul attention of the congress. The Civil Service. The advantages to the public service of an adherence to the principles of civil service re nrm or nnstAiitlv more BDDarent and noth- I Ing Is so encouraging to those In official lire , who honestly desire good government as the In creasing appreciation by our people or these 1 advantages. A vast majority or the voters or the land are ready to insist that the time and 1 the attention or those they select to perrorm ror thM imnnrtant Dubllo duties, should not be distributed by doling out minor offices and they are growing to be unanimous In regarding party organization as something that should be used In establishing party principles Instead or dictating the distribution or publlo places as rewards or partisan activity. Numerous addi tional offices and places have lately been brought within civil service rules and regula tions, and some others will probably be in cluded. The report or the commissioners will be submitted to the congress, and I Invite care ful attention to the recommendations It ooa
