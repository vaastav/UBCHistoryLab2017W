There can be no farcwell scene like thir.e. The mind is colored by thy every hut!" Early the next morning 1 was on board the noisy, practical, Yankee-like railway train and the Leman was soon left behind. Prom Lausanne to Yverdon we traverse a fertile and picturesque country, abounding in fine views, and at one point we catch a glimpse of the snow-clad Bummit of Mont Blanc, that mon arch of mountains, as Byron has so well called iL After a ride of a little more than hour, we are at Yverdon, a quiet, little, old town beautifully situated on the Lake of Xeu chateL The town itself, which was founded in the time of the Komans, is not handsome, but its environs are really charming. It was here that was situated the institution of the celebrated pedagogue, Pestalozzi, from 1S05 to 1825, the time of the death of its founder. It was in the ancient fortress of the town, built in the Middle Ages, and which is now occupied as a joung ladies' boarding scbool, vhich, by the way, are very numerous in the French part o! Swnztrland. From Yverdor, wego 0:1-1 few railts to Grandu, where. just three hundred years bsfora tht; bat'Ie o. B'lnker's 11:11, cccuncd t-.e celfl. at 1! .

Finishing now our stroll over the batile firld of Grandsou, we go down to the lake shure to await the clumsy little boat that is to take us over. In comparison with the Alp-encir-cled Leman, we look upon the lake of Neu chatel, with its low shores and dingy water, as quite a common place affair ; and this is very natural. as there are but few lakes which can vie in beauty with the Leman. As it is market day in some neighboring town, the most of our passengers are bare- headed, broad-shouldered, rosy-cheeked, bux om peasant girls with great baskets of eggs, fowls, and vegetables.
