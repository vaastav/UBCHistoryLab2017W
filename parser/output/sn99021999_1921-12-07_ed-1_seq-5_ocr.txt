V ( Text of the President's Message To the Sixt v-Seventh Congress Washington, Dec. 6, Partial text tt President Harding's metsage to tongren ia a follow: Mr. Speal.fr and members of the Congress: It is t very gratifying privilege to tome to the congress with the repub lic at peace with all the nations of the world. More, it Is equally grati fying to report that our country i tiot only free from every impending menace of war, hut there are grow ing assurance of the permanency of the peace which we o dreply cherish. " . Disordered Conditions, , For approximately 10 years, we fiave dwelt amid menaces of war or si participants hi war's actualities, and the inevitable aftermath, with its disordered conditions, has added to the difficulties of government, which adequately cannot -be appraised ex cept by those who are in immediate ' contact and know the responsibilities. d Our tasks would be less difficult if " ive had only ourselves to consider, but ao much of the world was in lawed the disordered conditions are so well, nigh universal, even among rations not engaged in actual war fare, that no permanent readjust ments can be effected without con sideration of our inescapable rela tionship to world affairs in fifiance and trade. Indeed, we yhould be un worthy of our best traditions if we ivere unmindful of social, moral, and political conditions which are not of direct concern to us, but which do appeal to the human sympathies and the very becoming interest ot a peo- le blest with our national good ior inc. j ' Heroic Remedies. It is not my purpose to bring o you a program of world restora tion. In the main such a program tuust be worked out by the nations ?iost directly concerned. They must hemselves turn to the heroic reme flies for the menacing conditions tinder which they are struggling, then we can help, and we mean to help. We shall do so unselfishly be cause there is compensation in the L consciousness of assisting, seltishly , because the commerce and interna- tional exchanges in trade which u. marked our hieh tide of fortunate f advancement, are possible only when natirttic r( oil rrntiti.fiti arA r v stored to stable order and normal , relationship In the main the contribution of this republic to restored normalcy in the world must come through the initia tive of the executive branch of the government but the best of inten tions and most carefully considered purposes would fail utterly if the sanction and the co-operation of con gress were not cheerfully accorded. Greater Security..- 'Granting that we are fundamen tally, a representative popular gov ernment with political parties the governing agencies, I believe the political party in power should as iume responsibility, determine upo:i policies in the conference which supplements conventions and elec tion campaigns and then strive for achievement through adherence to the accepted policy. There is vastly greater security, immensely more of the ' national viewpoint, much larger and prompter fccomplishment where our divisions are along party lines, in the broad . . .' . ' .1 1 geographically, or according to pur suits, or personal followings. For a century and a third parties have been charged with responsibility and held to strict Accounting. When they fail, they are relieved of au thority, and the system has brought tis to a national eminence no less than a world example. It would be ungracious to with hold acknowledgment pf the really . large volume and excellent quality Ot work accomplished by the extra ct ordinary session of congress, which so recently adjourned. I am not un mindful of the very difficult tasks with which you were called to deal, and no one can ignore the insistent Conditions which, during recent years, have called for the continued and almost exclusive attention of Jpur memberships to public work. It would suggest insincerity if I expressed complete accord with every expression recorded in your roll calls, but we are all agreed about the difficulties and the inev itable divergence of opinion in seek ing the reduction, amelioration and readjustment of the burdens of tax ation. Renewed Consideration. Later on, when other problems are solved, 1 snail make some recommendations about renewed consideration of our tax program, but for the immediate time before us we must be content with the bil lion dollars reduction in the tax draft upon the people, and dimin- . , u : 1 J r tfiJnly and improved methods of col lection. By your sustainmcnt of the rigid economies already inau gurated, with hoped for extension of these economies and added effi ciencies in administration, I believe further reductions may be enacted and hindering burdens abolished. Foreign Loans. "There is pending a grant of au thority to the authoritative branch of the government for the funding and settlement of our vast foreign loans growing out of our grant of vrar credits.. With the hands of the executive branch held impotent to deal with these debts, we are hin dering urgent readjustment among our debtors and accomplishing noth- ing for ourselves. I think it is fair for the congress to assume that the executive branch of the government would adopt no major policy m dealing with these matters which Would conflict with the purpose of Congress in authorizing the loans certainly not without asking con gressional approval; but there are minor problems incident to prudent loan transactions and the safeguard ing of our interests which cannot even be attempted without this au thorization. It will be helpful to ovrsclves and it will improve con ditions among our debtors if fund ing and the settlement of defaulted interest may be negotiated. ; Merchant Marine. The previous congress, deeply con cerned in behalf of our merchant marine in 1920 enacted the existing shipping law. designed for the up building of the American merchant I marine. V t Power and ships, without comity ci relationship, will not give us the expanded trade which ! inseparably linked with a great merchant marine. Moreover, the applied reduction of duty, for which the treaty denounce ments were neceiary. encouraged only the carrying of dutiable imports to our shores, while the tonnage which unfurls the flag on the next ij both free and dutiable, and the cargoes which make a nation eminent in trade ire outgoing, rather than in coming. No Protest Made. The executive branch of the gov ernment, uninfluenced by the protest of any nation, for none has been made,, is wtll convinced that your proposal is fraught with difficulties and to marked by tendencies to dis courage trade expansion that I invite your tolerance of noncompliance for a few wrrks until a plan may be pre sented which contemplates no greater draft upon the public treasury, and which, though yet too crude to offer it today, gives such promise of ex panding our merchant marine that it will argue its own approval. It is enough to say today that we are so possessed of ships, and the American intention to establish a merchant ma rine is so unalterable, that a plan of reimbursement at no other cost than is cont iiplated in the existing act will appeal to the pride and encour age the hope of all the American people. There Is before you the comple tion of the enactment of what has been termed a "permanent" tariff law, the word "permanent'' being used to distinguish it from the emergency art which the congress expedited early in the extraordinary session and which is the law today. I can not too strongly urge an early completion of this necessary legis lation. It .s needed to stabilize our industry at home; it is essential to make more definite our trade rela tions -abroad. More, it is vital to the preservation of many of our own industries, which contributes so not ably to the very life blood of our nation. Conflicting Opinion. There is now, and there always will be, a storm of conflicting opin ion about any tariff revision. We can not pro far wrong when we base our tariffs on the .policy of preserv ing the productive activities, which enhance employment and add to our national prosperity. Again comes the reminder that we must not be unmindful of world con ditions, that peoples are struggling for industrial rehabilitation and that we cannot dwell in industrial and commercial exclusion and at the same time do the just thing in aiding world recognition and readjustment. We do not seek a selfish aloofness and we could not profit by it were it possible. We recognize the neces sity of buying wherever we sell, and the permanency of trade lies in its acceptable exchanges. In our pur suit of markets we must give as well as receive. We cannot sell io others who do not produce, nor can we buy unless we produce at home. Sensible of every obligation of humanity, com merce and finance, linked as they are in the present world condition, it is not .to be argued that we need de stroy ourselves to be helpful to others. With all my heart, I wish restoration to the peoples blighted by the awful world war, but the process of restoration does not lie in our ac ceptance of like conditions. It were better to remain on firm ground, strive for ample employment and high standards of wages at home, and point the way to balanced budgets, rigid economy and resolute, efficient work as the necessary remedies to cure disaster. We are a creditor nation, not by normal processes, but made so by war. It is not an unworthy selfish ness to seek to save ourselves when the processes of that salvation are not only not denied to others, but commended to them. We seek to undermine for others no industry by which they subsist; we are obligated to permit the undermining of none of our own which make for employ ment and maintained activities. Necessity Magnified. Every contemplation, it little mat ters in which direction one turns, magnifies the difficulty of tariff leg islation, but the necessity of the re vision is magnified with it. I am not unmindful of the consti tutional difficulties. These can be met by giving authority to the chief executive, who could proclaim addi tional duties to meet conditions which the congress may designate. At this point I must disavow any desire to enlarge the executive's pow ers or add to the responsibilities of the office. They are ' already too large. If there were any other plan I would prefer it. The grant of authority to proclamation would necessarily bring the tariff commission into new and enlarged activities, because no ex ecutive could discharge such a duty except upon the information acquired and recommendations by this com mission. But the plan is feasible and the proper functioning of the board would give us a better administra tion of a defined policy than ever ' : p One never questions the purity of Natures " I -J foods in their perfected state nor is it questioned in Bread of quality Jmm.j:. -THE I could be poi.ible by tariff duties pre icribe4 without flexibility. ' American Valuation, j There l a manifct difference of opinion about the American vatua- tion, Many nations have adopted de livery valuation at the basis for col lecting duties; that i, they take the cost of the imports delivered at the port of entry at the basis for levy ing duty. It it no radical departure in view of the varying conditions and the disordered state of money valuet to provide for American valuation, but there cannot be Ignored the dan ger of such a valuation brought to the level of our own production costs, making our tariffs prohibitive. It might do to in many instance where imports ought to be encouraged. I believe congress ought well to con sider the desirahility of the only promising alternative, namely, a provision authorizing proclaimed American valuation, under prescribed conditions, on any given list of arti cles imported. Knowing the impossibility of modification by art of congress for any one or a score of lines without involving a long array of schedules, I think we shall go a long wayt to ward stabilization if there is resog nition of the tariff commission's fit ness to recommend urgent changes by proclamation. Business Revival. I am sure about public opinion favoring the early determination of our tariff policy. There have been reassuring signs of a business re vival from the deep slump which all the world' has been experiencing. Our unemployment, which gave us deep concern only a few weeks ago. has grown encouragingly less, and new assurances and renewed confi dence will attend the congressional declaration that American industry will be held secure. Something more than tariff pro tect is required by American agri culture. To the farm has come the earlier and the heavier burdens of readjustment. There is actual de pression in our agricultural industry while agricultural prosperity is ab solutely essential to the general prosperity of the country. Congress has sought Very earnest ly to provide relief. It has prompt ly given such temporary relief as has been possible, but the call is in sistent for the permanent solution. There must be some economic solu tion for the excessive variation in returns for agricultural production. Remedy in Market nig. In the main the remedy lies in distribution and marketing. Every proper encouragement snould be given to the co-operative marketing programs. These have proven very helpful to the co-oporating com munities in Europe. In Russia to co-operative community has become a recognized bulwark of law and order, and saved individualism from engulfment in social paralysis. Ul timately they will be accredited with the salvation of the Russian state. 'There is the appeal for this experi ment. Why not try it? None chal lenges the right of the farmer to a larger share of the' consumer's pay for his product, no one can dispute that we can not live without the farmer. He is justified in rebellion against the transportation cost. Given a fair return for his labor, he will have less occasion to appeal for financial aid, and given assur ance that his labors shall not be in vain, we reassure all the people of a production sufficient to meet our national requirement and guard against disaster. -The base of the pyramid of civil ization which rests upon the soil is shrinking through the drift of popu lation from farm to city. For a generation we have been expressing more or less concern about this tendency. Perhaps only grim neces sity will correct it, but we ought to find a less drastic remedy.
