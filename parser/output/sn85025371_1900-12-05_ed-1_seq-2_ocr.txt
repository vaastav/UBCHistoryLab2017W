CLARKE COURIER JOHN O. CROW?, Kdhor and Proprietoi WEDNESDAY, DEC. 5, 1900. We lay before our readsrs today tbe principal features of Preaident McKinley a meaaage, which was read before Coogresa ou Monday when that body convened. The whole mea* sage ia a lengthy document and eua tain's the author's reputation for pro? ducing lengthy state documents. It con*aiua about 18,000 words and deals with a variety of aubjecta. The dominant feature in the message ia the President s trestment of the Chi? nese aitustion. He traces tbe trouble up from its inception to the preeent time, and says he believe tbe Chinese are unable to pay the indemnity ask? ed of them by the Powers for the Boxer outrages. The President would like the Hay Pauncefort treaty ratified, and com tneuds to the Senate the early con? struction of the Xicaraguan canal. KegardiDg the war revenue tax?e he advocates a reduction of about $30,000,000. The lifting of part of this burden from the people will be joyful news for those who are being ground by taxes to carry on a war from which they can never hope to reap any benefit. The Preaident gives us nothing new about the Philippines, and wants a Pacific cable. As to the army he recommends a minimum of 60,000 men and a maximum of 100.000. He -practically leaves the new apportion? ment to Congress. Our condensed account of the message, to be found on this page, will not be as burdensome to read as the message in full. Congress will have little time for debate if they puah through the leg? islation as mapped out by the repub? licans. This means that aome thingi will be hid from the people. We have renewed the advertising contract for the ensuing year wit! the Chamberlain Medicine Co., fo; the runuing of their readers in th? rieh. Our business relationahij with this well established medicine firm ha? been long standing anc most cordial and agreeable, and w< fell assured that what they tell you it their ads. can be relied upon. Theii medicines have a good aale in thii country. Virginia'b Official Vote.

In oar forelfn int?rcoar?a>e the dominant question ha? be?n the treatment of th? Chinea? problem. Apart from thi? ?or relation? ?*ith th? power? bar? been happy. The recent trouble? in ?China ?pria?; from th? ?ntiforeign agitation which for the paat three years has gained strength in the northern province*. Their origin lie? deep in the character of the Chin??? race? and in the traditiona of their gov? ernment. The telegraph and the railway spreading over their land, the ateamer? plying on their waterways, the merchant and the missionary penetrating yaar by year farther to the interior, became t? the Chine?? mind type? of ?n alien in? vasion, changing the <?our?e of their na? tional life and fraught with vague fore? boding? of disaster to their belief? ?ad their ?elf control. Posting of ?ntiforeign placard? became ? a daily occurrence, which the repeated reprobation of the imperial power failed to check or puniah. Tbeee inflammatory appeals to the ignorance and auperstition of the mi???, mendacious ?nd absurd in their accusation? and deeply hostile in their spirit, could not but work cumula? tive harm. They ?Imed ?t no particular closs of foreigners; th?y were impartial in attacking everything foreign. An outbreak in Shangtung in which German missionaries were ?lain wa? th? too natural result of these malevolent ' teachings. The posting of seditious pla- , carda, exhorting to the utter destruction of foreigners and of ?very foreign thing. i continued unrrbuked. Hostil? demonstra- j tions toward th? stranger gained strength ; by organisation. Trae Basar?. The sect commoaly atyled th? Boxer? , developed greatly in the proviace? north ! of the Yang tse and with the collusion of I many notable officials, iacluding some in . th? immediate councils of the throne it ?elf. became alarmingly aggressive. No i foreigner's life, outside of the protected I treaty ports, was safe. No foreign inter- ! est **i? secure from apob?tioa The diplomatic representative? of th? powers in Peking ?trove in vain to che-rk this movement. Protest was followed by demand and demand by renewed protest, to be met with perfunctory edict? from the palace and ?vaslve and futile assur? ances from th? tsung-11-yamea. The increasing gravity of th? condi? tions in Chin? aad th? immineac? of peril to our own diversified interest? in the em? pire, as ?veil as to thcee of all th? other treaty government?, were ?mx?o appreci ated by this government, causing it pro? found ?olicitude. The United State? from the earliest days of foreign inter? course with China had followed a policy of peace, omitting no occasion? to testify good will, to further the extension of law? ful trade, to respect the sovereignty of it? government ?nd to Insure by ?11 legiti? mate and kindly but earnest mean?? the fullest measure of protection for the live? and property of law abiding citisen? ?nd for the exercise of th?ir beneficent call? ings among th? Chia??e people. Mindful of this, it waa fait to be appro? priate that our purposes should be pro? nounced in favor of auch cours? a? would hasten united action of the power? at Pe? king to promot? th? administrative re forma so greatly needed for strengthen? ing the imperial government and main? taining the integrity of China, in which we believed the whole western world to be alike concerned. To the?? eada I ?caused to be ?ddressed to th? several powers occupying territory and maintain? ing apherea of influence in China th? ?cir? cular proposal? of 1899. inviting from them declarations of their intention? ?nd t!?w? as to the desirability of the adop? tion of measures insuring the benefits of equality of treatment of all foreign trade throughout China. With gratifying unanimity th? re? sponses coincided In thi* common policy, enabling me to aee in the successful ter? mination of these negotiation? proof of the friendly spirit which animatea th? various powers interacted in th? uatram meled development of commerce and in? dustry in the Chinese empire as a source of vast benefit to th? whole commercial world. Iu thi? conclusion, which i hsd th? gratification to announce ss a completed engagement to the interested powers on March 20. 1900. I hopefully discerned a potential factor for the abatement of th? distrust of foreign purpose? which for a year paat had appeared to inspire the policy of the imperial government and for the effective exertion by it of power and authority to qu?ll th? critical anti foreign movement in the northern prov? inces most immediately influenced by the Mantchoo sentiment. Marine Guard Withdraws. tSeeking to testify confidence in the will? ingness and ability of th? imperial ad? ministration to redress th? wrong? and prevent the evil? we suffered and feared, the marin? guard, which had been sent to Peking in the autumn of 1?S99 for th? protection of the legation, wa? with? drawn at the earliest practicable mo? ment, and all pending questions were re? mitted, as fsr as we w?re concerned, to th? ordinary resorts of diplomatic inter? course. The president continues by narrating the growth of the Boxer movement, the fighting st Taku and th? siege of th? le? gations in Peking and continues: On July 14 the besieged had their first j communication with the teung-li-yamen. from whom a message came inviting to a conference, which wa? declined. ?Corre? spondence, however, ensned, snd a sort of armistice was agreed upon which ?top? ped the bombardment and lessened the rifle fire for a time. Even then no pro? tection whatever waa afforded or any aid L given save to send to th? legations a ?mall supply of fruit aad three sacks of flour. Indeed th? only communication had with the Chinese government related to the occasional delivery or diapstch of a telegram or to th? demanda of th? t?ung li-yamen for the withdrawal of the lega? tions to th? coaat under escort. Not only ar? the protestations of the Chinese gov? ernment that it protected and succored the legations positively contradicted, but irresistible proof accumulates that the How To Oure Oroup. Mr. R. Gray, who liras near A menia, Dutches* couQtj, N. Y., ?taya: "(Jhamberlein's Cough rsmsdj is the best medicine I have ever used. It ia a fine children*? remedy for croop and never fails to on re."
