Ltd. V. Grosjean editor. A Serious jVivihdw~. On Saturday, Nov. 29, two conven tions were held in the C(ity of New Orleans, each aiming at the im provement of the Miississippi River and the protection of the valley from annual floods. As the issue is vital and as suc cess is dependent on harmony of action, the Caucasian had antici pated a consolidation of the two conventions, at which the best in the Ransdell-Humphries bill and the best in the Newlands bill would have been formulated into one en actment, which would have secured unanimous endorsement. As it is, each faction is insistent in urging on Congress the favorable considera tion of its bill, the end of which is that neither will receive the support essential to recognition. The gist of the Ransdell-Hum phries bill is an all-levee system with a deep channel, which is criti cised as a waste of money, unless the channel's tributaries are main tained at the same depth and are made navigable for commerce dur ing the whole year. The Newlands plan provides a levee and an outlet system with a great reservoir that would restrain the floods from rushing down the valley, inflicting ruin and desola tion in its irresistible sweep. The advocates of the Newlands plan ridicule the all-levee system as be ing impracticable and radically in "$nistent with the natural laws of outlets. This decision is deplorable, and tht victims of contention menaced by the annual floods of the !llissis '44ipi are helpless. :If the advocates of these rival . lans are patriotic and are earnestly S.oaerned in the welfare ofthe peo Sio ft the Mississippi Valley, they fIU subordinate their differences in veaching a compromise that must b.ei tective in providing the means .t. are necessary to the achieve ~ast of this great enterprise, the =0 veient of the Mississippi and .e :protsct ion of the valley from ; i floods.

The infoi ation following is from the Chicago Sunday Tribune, whose. Washington correspondent is John Callan O'Lagghlin: The Senate on Monday will begin active consideration of the currency bill, first debating at considerable length the proposition of the Demo cratic majority for t1aily sessions lasting eleven hours. This subject will be laid aside temporarily while the Hetch 'Hetchy bill relating to the water supply of San Francisco and the bill for the construction by the government of railroads in Alaska are debated and acted upon. In the meantime the House will be turningver to the Senate a number of bills. This promises to create a jam in legislation which is apt to prove embarrassing to the upper house and delay the enactment of principles which form the basis of the Democratic platform. The situation from the executive point of view is radically different from that which prevailed when President Wilson read his first mes sage to Congress eight months ago. Then an era of good feeling existed in Democratic ranks. For the first time in sixteen years the Democratic party was in control of the White House and Congress. There was a single purpose to show the country that the party was one of construction as well as of oppo sition, and to preserve harmony in order that a solid front might be of fered to the Republicans and Pro gressives. Because the country had spoken unmistakably for revision of the tar iff, a bill reducing the Aldrich du ties and imposing a gradual tax on incomes was passed with surpris ingly little objection. Then came the currency bill, to which sixty nine Democrats in the House offered sky-rocket opposition. From this point the way of the President has been beset with pit falls; and the chances are they will greatly increase in niumber and depth. He is making a desperate ef fort to unite his party in the Senate on the currency bill passed by the House. Wilson ikemned to leta.or. The dominance of the President is calculated to prevent independ ence of thought and leadership in either house. Should he ,continue his policy of preparing bills and then turning them over to Congress with instructions to pass- without change, it is.evident there .will be small opportunity for constructive statesmanship to manifest itself. He wilt be successful in his dic tatorship so long as the people ap pear to be behind him. Should his foot slip there will be an uprising against him, especially in the Sen ate. In considering the more or less belligerent attitude of the upper house at this time, the fact must not be forgotten that the constitu tional amendment providing for the direct election of aanators has in fluenced tremndously those who desire to 's~ ;lapIublia life. It is hgaonst their 94tical iatrest to an tagonize the.Pisde nt, .to have even Iis silent hostility. For this reason most of the meimn iers are anxious to do his biddiag, Ind eaoept in a few cases they will refuse ocsly if they believe their ca reers will not be injuriously affected 3threby.

Death of Howard F. Doll. The demise of Howard F. Doll, when announced Monday morning, was a regrettable surprise to his friends who had no intimation of his illness. The deceased was a pa tient at the North Louisiana Sanita rium, where he had been operated upon for appendicitis Wednesday afternoon. Following this operation the indications were favorable, but he failed to rally from complications which led. to his death, which oc curred at 10:45 Sunday morning. The deceased came to Shreveport when a boy. He was born in Adams County, Pa., Nov. 8, 1847. From an humble beginning he gradually pro gressed in the affairs of the world. His fortune is estimated at about half a million dollars. He was the owner of the IXL gro cery, where he accumulated much of his wealth, which he invested ju diciously, and in his later years had greatly,.enhanced in value. He was the first holder of stock in the Com mercial National Bank, which he as sisted in organizing, and had been a member of the School Board for sixteen years. He was a usefutcitizen and was devoted to his home.'. He was not demon.trative, and those who shared his, friendship could always rely on his loyalty to them. At the funeral service held Mon day evening in the Holy Trinity church and at his grave in St. Jo seph's Catholic cemetery, the aggre gate of citizens and his friends at tested the esteem in which he was held. Mr. Doll is survived by his wife and eight children, the children be ing Mrs. W. C. Belcher, Mrs. J. T. Broghan, H. F. Doll Jr, E. T. Doll, Mrs. Lewell C. Butler, John, Loretta and Charles Doll, and three broth ers, James Doll of Riverton, Wyo,, George Doll of Marion, Ind., and Marion Doll of Germantown, Ind. River Stage.

MUCH INTEREST IN LREULAR SESSION Extra Teri of Congress Runs Smack Into the NsHe ANNUAL MESSAGE II PERSON Why Wilson Hae Adopted New Method of Delivering His Message-Vote on e4tch-Hetchy Water Bill - Mang Members to Remain at Their Some Until After the Holidays. * By ARTHUR W. DUNN. Washington, Dec. &--[Special.9-4n terest in the opening of the regular session of congress was lessened on account of the many months the spe cial session has been sitting. Al though the assembling of a regular ses sion is much like all that have gone before, the first Monday in December is sure to bring out a crowd, create a sort of congressional animation and give the impression that the lawmak ers are going to "start something." It has been unusual, and only in one instance has it happened in half a cen tury, for a special session to come right smack up against a regular ses sion, and that in itself made a diver sion worth the attention of the thou sands who thronged the capitol on the opening day. Annual Message In Person. President Wilson decided to deliver his annual message in person. which makes the opening more interesting. Three different times before the presi dent has appeared at the capitol with a message which he called an "ad dress." It is somewhat different this time, because an annual message has always been considered a rather fear some thing of thousands of words of dreary review of the year's work in the federal departments. The annual message this year covers the subjects which the president wants to impress 1non c-nnpe ... "There', a Reason." Perhaps this is the solution of the determination of the president to adopt the personal method of communicat Iag wlt.i clgress. For years it has been a Wk that senators and mem bers slee or desert the chamber when the of the president is being read. It is not only a joke. but a fact. that neither senators nor representa tives would listen to the long winded messages which presidents have been in the habit of sending in to be read at the beginning of a term of congress. They have to listen while the president Beads a message Week's Work Ahead. e The senate lon. ago mapped out a week's workl It heyd a time for a vote on the Hetcb-ic y water bill for Dee. 6, and as therebas developed a desire to debate the mepure the sen ators have been getting red..y to talk about this grant to San imnclsco. Since the time was Axed for taling a vote a great deal of opposition has sprung up, and the opponents have been making considerable headway. Clear Clendar. he house does things differently. When that body passes under the hands at real leadership it stays there. The leaders told the committees not to re part bills. The Democrati caneus con Armed that edict and as a result the louse, although it has been in session since April 7, has not enough business on the -alendars to wad a gun or keep the umebers bq for a day. No doubt the embargo will be raised and the emomittees will now begin to work apon the Important matters that have been eam.lng for a long time. There are bills emough, goodness knows, to make-food for the legsleative hopper until another year rolls around-that is, it afything should- happen to keep con gres.is eaontuos seessio again.

There is a hint that the coming session may be troubled by -ahteelm but the temper of the leaders is sueb as to -indcate that means for eompelling attendance will be take if absent members delay the Another lmvestigation. Beyond question there will be anoth ra tlauesation, this time into the cold storage and high food prices.

Now when the galgy . gonomy comes into power there seems to be no way of curbing the desire for spending the money in the treasury. "It is awful to get into power on a platform of economy," remarked one of the Democratic senators, "foi when the time comes we cane snake .ood on our promises." #10,000,000 4acrase to**e9w rm. Right off the reel there is an increase in the estimates of $10,000,000 for the army, and yet. the secretary of war is not getting all he wants. Even with that he has pruned the estimates. Along comes Secretary Daniels with estimates for more money for the navy, coupled with a demand in con gress for more battleships. Passing to the side of peace, we no tice that many men propose to spend millions for improving the roads of the country. A vocational educational bill or a measure to teach agriculture on a greatly enlarged scale seems certain to pass. There will be no letup in de mand for public buildings and for riv er and harbor appropriations. In fact, all those measures which mean large expenditures seem certain to be pass ed. These will swell the general total above anything in the past Must Make Bryan Smile. It must make Bryan smile when he sees papers which strenuously sup ported the gold standard and denounc-. ed the Nebraska candidate and his party on the free silver question, now saying that perhaps bimetallism is just, what is necessary if the whole world would adopt it. Scarcity of basic mon ey is said to be the cause of the finan cial difficulties the world over. Bryan's smile might be broader if he had not tacitly consented to nailing down the gold standard by direct pro vision in the currency bill which passed the house and is now in the senate. But this talk of restoring silver to its place as a money metal is really inter esting at this time when financial stress hnvra nvePr th w-nliA Good Pocket Money. With Christmas only a short distance away that mileage for members of con gress looks like good pocket money Heretofore when members came tt Washington. for the first regular see sion of congress they had been at home for nine months enjoying themselves and spending as little money as posse ble. They had bee~ drawing salarles all the time, just as if they had beer in Washington. They came here it December and right off the bat theli mileage was available, 20 cents a mikl for the entire distance frotn theit homes to the capital. It made --good pin money with Christmas lookiu, them in the face. "Constitutional- Privilege." The newspaper men many times ask ed the president if congress was to ad journ, taking it for granted that the president controlled congress as to its vacations. One day he was asked if there would be a holiday adjournment after the regular sesseion. "I suppose it would be uneonstitutional not to have a holiday recess,"' replied the president, showing that he knew the cEstom, even if he was a tittle, sarcas tic in his reply. That will be the first congressional vacation. Stone Was Sarcastic. Senator Stone doesn't care much whom he jabs when he is nettled. The other day he referred to Senator Owen as the "nominal chairman" of the bank Ing and currency colmmittee. Then he celled Senator Hitchcock "chairman of one wing of the comtmittee.", In a few lines he "got to" both Owen and Hitch cock. Stone, who is well up on the finance committee, no doubt thinks it would have been just as well to have allowed the money bills to remain with thb finance committee, where they have always been, until the beginning of the present session. A Strange Sight. Senator Thomas of Colorado was reading his speech in the senate a few days ago, which caused surprise, as he is a ready talker. S"What ails Charlie Thomas?" asked one senator.
