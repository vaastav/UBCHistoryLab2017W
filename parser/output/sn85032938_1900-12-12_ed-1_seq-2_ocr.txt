Senator Stewart, who did active work for the party during the late campaign, has had his name put back on the republican caucus list. Senator Hanna says the republican motto at this session of congress is "Do business." Hon. Benjamin Harrison is in Washington, as a lay member of the national committee of Presbyterians now in session there to consider the creed question. Mrs. Theodore Roosevelt scored a scoop when she declined to become a candidate for the presidency of the daughters of the American Revolution Perhaps it was only to convince his new father-in-law that there were no frills on his ducal coronet that the Duke of Manchester went through a "cake walk" in Xew York. If the French are not careful they may find themselves Krugered into trouble with England. Wisconsin proposes to pass a law requiring all applicants for mar riage licenses to pass a medical ex amination before being permitted to marry. The experiment will be watched with interest. Ocm Paul Kruger has decided to take up his residence at The Hague. Congress has made an excellent start toward making this a strictl business session. Senor Degetau, Porto Rial's first delegate to congress, said of his con stituents: "My people want to become root and branch Americans. We can not do it too quickly." If it pleases the sultan of Turkey to pay those American missionary claims in a round about way, this government was not disposed to ob ject. Our demand was that the claims should be paid. The democratic leaders iu congress are showing a very commendable dis position, in their talk, to put no fac tious obstructions in the way of legis lation in line with the mil of the peo ple, as expressed at the polls. President McKinley's message to congress furnishes more proof, if it were needed, of the wisdom of the people in re-electing him. Italy isn't getting its share of pros perity. Its government is wrestling with a deficit, about two-thirds of which its minister of the treasury soys to its participation in the China expedition. The bill for the reduction of the war tax contemplates a lopping joff of about 510,000,000 annually. The list of articles from which the tax is to be removed is quite lengthy and includes conveyances, mortgages, shipping re ceipts, bank checks, money orders and telegraph messages. Chas. A. Towne has been appointed as United States senator from Minne sota, to succeed Senator Davis, de ceased. Congressman Boutelle, of Maine, who has been hovering between life and death for some time has resigned his seat in congress. Dr. 0. L. Geer, of this county, is being talked of for speaker of the house of representatives in the next legislature. Dr. Geer is eminently qualified for the position. Ooin Paul shed renl tears of sor row on account of the snub given him by Emperor William of Ger many. His reception at The Hague was so cordial and enthusiastic that he was moved to tears of joy. A telegram from Washing says that Brigadier-General Chas. P. Eagan, commissary general who was suspend ed during the Spanish war, has xen restored to duty by the president and immediately placed on the retired list. General Egan's many Arizona friends will be rejoiced to learn of this. One of our contemporaries asserts 1 that that western girl who let a kiss on every state carried by McKiuley, has refused to pay up. That will do to tell. Xo girl who bets a kiss where she is dead sure to lose, will refuse to pay, and jMrticularly no western girl. The papers announced the other day that Jones and Bryan had had a long talk over the telephone. LateJ they announced that Jones declared that Bryan wouldn't run again. Evi dently, the wires got crossed. It was Graver that Jones was talking to. Judging from the election returns, the fifteen millions or so increase in the country bince 1S90 were nearly all republicans. South Dakota has just reiKMled its state disixjnsary law. Neither it nor Pettigrew has turned out to Ixj as irood as they were cracked up to be. Th tVuKXjnits are claiming that ..oeut wonderful export trade of the United States, which can no longer be denied, just "hapKmed'' and that tho McKiuloy administration had nothing to do with it. This is a little too thin. Such things come about by, wisdom and management and not by chance. The Sultan of Turkey will find himself dancing a livuty jig to a tuuo whistled by Uncle Sam before he is much older. Senator Pettif jrew has been keeping quiet, but his sou, who was with the Boer army, has bobbed up to say that the Boers will win yet. But he wasn't sure enough of it to stay over there to participate in their trimiipln The mid-road pops, who are to hold a national conference, might make a scoop by nominating Bryan for 1901. Chicago's manufacturing growth may be judged from the fact that it is now consuming 20 per cent more coal than it did one year ago. Congress would do well to follow the recommendation of Fourth As sistant Postmaster General Bristow for additional legislation against green goods and lottery swindlers, which will close the express and tele graph companies to the swindlers. General Jos Wheeler said in a speech the otherday: "I believe that under a good government the Fili pinos will become a race of which we may be proud. I think they are vastly superior to the Mexicans." The country already controls the iron and steel trade of the world, and present indications are that it will soon control the coal trade also. Of course congress will provide for the necessary increase iu the army. While the democrats will probably nearly all vote against the bill, it is not likely that nuy considerable num ber of them will dare to attempt to otherwise obstruct its passage. Miss Helen Gould very modestly said when asked to write an article on "How to Make the Most of Wealth" that she was not well qualified to speak, although willing to tell what she knew. Thousands of tho soldiers of the Spanish war. Who t-hared in her noble benefactions, think that she is living the answer to the question. Dave Hill hasn't been doing any talking for publication since the elec tion; he has been too busy chuckling and shaking hands with himself. Xow that even Hoke Smith has given him a few kicks it looks as though Mr. Bryan is down for keeps. Chairman Jones has recovered the use of his tongue sufficiently to an nounce that the country's prosperity was what re-elected McKinley. His eyesight must also have improved, as he said before election that he could'nt see the prosperity. A bill has been introduced iu con gress providing for the admission of Oklahoma as a state. -Mrs. J2.Ua Jfoot Hurst, the recently by workmen at the United Verde divorced wife of Bishop Hurst, it is I mines on Monday.

Possibly Germany is opposed to the partition of China for the same reason that Russia is. Each of Ihom wants the whole thing; Iu was most unkind of Oom Paul to n -gleet to mention Webster Davis in his speech at Marseilles. But perhaps it would only be throwing bad words after good to do so. Lots of people wait until the wea ther gets threatening or even until it begins to sprinkle before they com mence to lay up money for a rainy day. It is slid that many of the Filipino rebels are armed with guns of Ameri can make, and if Uncle Sam can find out who furnished them there will be trouble for somobodj-. This government's hint pcems to have had a good effect upon the for eign ministers at Pekiu, who are now really trying to agree instead of to disagree, It is their last chance. If they fail, the work will lie put in more capable hands. According to Jones of Arkansas Bryan will henceforth decline nomi nation for the presidency. He has sworn off, says Jones. Xow we kuow beyond a doubt that the Xebraska man has already begun to lay his plans for the next nomination. We knew it would come! As soon as the United States gets prosperous Sarah Bernhardt comes over for an other farewell tour and carries off its surplusage. Tho death of Hoyt, the farce writer, will leave a gap hard to fill. In the words of Shakespeare, the world could have better spared a t tetter man," "letter," of course, being un derstood iu the sense of famous and distinguished. The world seldom re alizes the debt it owes to its fun mak ers. As was to be cxiccted, the United States is getting very restive under the aggresMvene&s of its imterial al lies in China.

At the city election held in Los An geles on Monday the democrats elect ed their mayor but the republicans elected nearly all of the other officers having a majority in the cit3- council and lxxml of education and electing nil the other officers except one. The republican candidate was named Sil ver, and no '"silver" man stands anj show of election in that city.

This, in spite of the desiorate efforts ! oi tne uroKers mere to raise the re- quired sum and the strenuous public . opposition to allowing any part of tho loan to como to tho Yankees. But business is business, and the British government cm got more favorable terms over here. "The Courier does not believe that Govomor Murphy is sincere in his statehood talk," so says our contem porary. Xow really that is too awfully bad, but Governor Murphy will go right along working for state hood just the same as though he had the implicit confidence of the Courier iu his work. Men who are not iu favor of statehood, under present con ditions, and be it known that there are many such, find fault with Gover nor Murphy, being too much in ear nest, and have unbounded confidence in his sincerity, as well as in his abil ity, to secure statehood if any one can. NEW WAR 

SHIPS. The secretary of the navy on Satur day opened bids for tho construction of naval vessels which will cost up ward of $r0,000,000. H. L. Scott, of the Union iron works, San Francisco, and representatives of the Cramps and other ship building concerns were present. The bids call for the con struction of five first class battle ships and six armored cruisers. The battle ships are expected to take front rank iu Uncle Sam's fleet. They will lie known as the Xew Jersey, Penn sylvania, Georgia, Virginia and Rhode Island. They will have a dis placoment of 1G.50G tons each and will equal in xoint of fonnidalrility any war craft afloat. The crusiers will have a total of sixty two guns rouging iu size from 8-ineh breech loaders, of which there will be four, down to machineand auto matic guns. The limit of the cost of three of the cruisers is placed at 000,000 each, and of each of the other three at 51,250,000. The maximum time allowed for completion is thirty six months for each vessel. If the number and amount of the bids justify it. the contracts will probably be dis tributed among the leading ship builders of tho country. AN AZTEC MUMMY. An Alleged Discovery cf a Dried Up Pre-Historic Man at Jerome. The Jerome Xews gives an extend ed account of the alleged finding of a mummy in the United Verde mine. The finding of a mummy is n pos sible thing, but this alleged discovery coining so closely on the heels of the finding of the bogus petrified man will make the story to be received with a large dccoctioil of salt. After giving a very plausible account of the discovery the Xews spoils tho story by claiming it to be that of Montezuma, tho Aztec chief. The plausible story of the find as given in the Xews is a follows: "The finding of a mummified man somewhat similar to the shotgun used ,A lwll I... IK lUL- Ill UOVU I so larire and of such weight that the average man of today could not pose it for shoot ing. Beside the'guu there were found near him working tools all of which were manufactured of tempered cop per, showing that the man must have lxien hurried over 11.000 purs ago during the first age of copper. The body is well preserved but has evi dently shriveled, yet man of the mot important parts have undoubt edly remained their natural size. "The numerous articles found with the body would signify that he was a kiug of some renown. "The find was made in a cave ex ix)sed by the hit1 caving in of the Verde mines. It was with worn! e mules, it was witn wonder and awe that the workmen first en tered the cave and handled the relics that must have lecn laid away cen turies ago." Ml) RAT HALSTEAD RETURNS.

HE TOOK THE CAKE. What Our Society Editor Found on tour of the Railroad Offices. Mrs. Henry Collins made the cake which was in itself a guarantee of its goodness. Its appearance, how ever, as it rested on tho desk of Mr. Sarmiento's charming assistant (Mr. Edwards is not referred to) was elo quent of its merits. Its goodly pro portions, and rich brown coloring car ried most satisfactory suggestions to those who expected to partake of it, and furnished a proposition that soon provided takers for a limited uumler of opportunities to secure possession. The event was called for the noon hour, and Mr. Collins doubled the amount he received for the cake, in fees for privato instructions as to the peculiar turn of the wrist calculated to bring the six, uppermost. All interested were on hand at the appointed time, and the casting be gan.

An Instiution that Reflects Great Credit on the City. Among tho number of good, sub stantial buildings that were destroyed by the July fire was tho Prescott house, a splendid brick structure, that was of recent erection, but there has sprung up from its ruins a new Pres cott hotel that far exceeds tho old in every way, being about twice the size and modem in every particular. Tho new Prescott hotel has just thrown open Its doors to tho public, and the Journal-Miner man was shown ail through the building by its genial and accommodating proprietor, Mur ray Mclnernay. The building is three stories high with a frontage of fifty feet, contain ing in all fif ty-seveu rooms, all new and handsomely furnished, aud each supplied with electric lights and call bells. There are bath andtoilet rooms on each floor, supplied with hot and cold water. Also baggage and store rooms for each floor. Two nicely fur nished parlors front on Cortez street and connect with verandas from which a magnificent view of the city can be had. A metallic fire ecapfl has .been placed at the rear of tho building conveniently connected with the rear verandas, thus insuring the safety of the guests. But the department in which Mr. Mclncrnay takes most pride is the dining room and kitchen. The kitchen is probably the best equipped of any in the territory, while tho din ing room is the very ideal of coziness and shows a master hand in arrange ment. There are twelve tables with a seating rapacity of about seventy five. The tables are provided with everything that tho market affords, and the public is assured that no ex pense or pains will be spared to make this a leading feature of the new Prescott hotel. The new bar and office fixtures which were furnished by the Chicago Store and Office Fixtures company are a marvel of beauty and stability. The' are of high grade mahogany finish, hand carved and decorated with the fiuest French plate glass.
