Washington, Dec. 8. — President Harding, in his annual message, de 1 livered Friday to congress in person, deals with nearly a score of subjects, oliief among them prohibition, farm credits, the transportation problem. child labor and immigration. The executive announced Iiis pur tée to invite the governors of the • vtates and territories to an early con ference with the federal executive authorities with a view to adopting the definite policies of national and state co-operation in administering the pro hibition laws. He says the day is! unlikely to come when the prohibition amendment will be repealed and that"j the nation should adopt its course ac-] he adds, "con cordingly. ,. . , tT j - it 1 resident Harding teds congress that if the statutory provisions for prohibition enforcement are contrary to deliberate public opinion, which he does not believe, the rigorous and literal enforcement will concentrate public attention on any requisite modi ficntion.

Co-ordination of all transportation. facilities is urged by the president, These would include not only inland inoralization." Discusses Transportation With regard to the transportation problem? Mr. Harding proposes that the railroad labor hoard be abolished with the substitution of a labor di vision in -the I. C. O. with ample power to require its rulings-to be ac cepted by both parties to a disputed question. The executive also pro poses that the law require the carriers and their employes to institute means and methods to negotiate between waterways but motor truck trans portation as well. He inveighs against the system of paralleling the railroads with truck roads, thus drawing freight from the steam lines instead of making the motor truck a feeder for them. A<= to the carriers themselves. Mr. Harding suggests as ways of increased economy and efficiency there be a merger of lines into systems, inter change of freight cars, the consolida tion of facilities and the economic use of terminal«. . . He declared that the majority ot tti lines are without that inter-carrier, co-operative relationship, "so highly essential to the most and best eco notnical operation," adding that they could not function in harmony when the recent strike threatened the paralysis of all railway transportation.

His hearers j responded particularly to his discus- ! ! sion of rural credits and the American- j j ization of aliens. ! j Prohibition View Applauded ! These was a craning of necks when j j the president launched into his dis- ; cession of prohibition enforceemnt, and j j SO me of his declarations on the subject f —that suggesting rigorous and literal j ' enforcement of the dry law—was ap- j plauded. j The president began his address bj ; calling the attention ot .. j I general world conditions, which he said, still were seriously ditfwbed "".^1 ! suit of the war..He asserted that^™e; inevitable readjustment of t e^ socia , and economic order is not more tha 111 barely begun," and continued: i "There never again will be precise- j ly the old order.

Manifestly, we have need to begin 1 0 n plans to co-ordinate all transpor ; tation facilities. We should more ef fectively connect up our rail lines with our carriers by sea. We ought to reap some benefit from the hundreds of millions expended on inland water ways, providing our capacity to utilize as we )l as expend. We ought to turn t j )e motor truck into a railway feeder j aU( j distributor instead of a destroy ing competitor. Must Face Rail Problem « '"This transportation problem can not be waived aside. The demand for lowered costs on farm products anil basic materials cannot be ignored Bates horizontally increased to meet increased outlays during the war* in flation are not easily reduced. When some very moderate wage reductions wer( , effected last summer there was a ?» per cent horizontal reduction in rates.

Neither the managers nor the commission saw fit t0 a j 0 pt the suggestion, so we had j the horizontal reduction too slight to ; be felt by the higher class cargoes and light to benefit the heavy tonnage ; calling most loudly for relief, "Railways are not expected to ren j j er ,j le nios t essential service in our !

I culled your attention to h. insufficiency of power to enforce the decisions of the railroad labor^ board. Carriers have ignored its decisions on the one hand; railway workmen have challenged its decisions by a strike on the other hand. "The labor board itself, is not so constituted as best to serve the public interest. 'With six partisan members on a board of nine, three partisans nominated by the employes, and there by the railway managers, it is inev itable that, the partisan viewpoint is maintained throughout hearings and in decisions handed down. I am well con vinced that the functions of this trib unal could be much better carried on For Labor Board Change The substitution of a labor division J 1 in ">* sion, made up from its membership, to hear and decide disputes relatiug to wages and working conditions which have failed of adjustment by proper committees created by the railways and their employes, offers a more ef fective plan. * * * "This suggested substitution will in volve a necessary increase in the mem bership of the commission, probably four, to constitute the labor division. If the suggestion appeals to the con gress., it will be well to specify that the labor division shall he constituted of representatives of the four rate ; making territories, thereby assuring a j tribunal conversant with the conditi which obtain in the different rate mak ing sections of the country. "I wish I could bring to vou the precise recommendations for the pro vision of strikes which threaten the welfare of the people and menace public safety. It is an impotent, civiliza tion and an inadequate government j which lacks the genius and the courage to guard against such a menace to public welfare as we experienced last summer. * * * Public interest de mands that ample power shall be con ferred upon the labor tribunal, whether it is the present board or the suggested substitute. to require its rulings to be accepted by both parties ' to a disputed question Deplores Labor Trouble "Let there be no confusion about: the purpose of the suggested confer ment of the power to make the de isions effective.

Abusing the hospitality of our shores are the advocates of revolution, finding their deluged fol lowers among those who take on the habiliments of an American without knowing the American soul. There is the recrudescence of hyphenated Americanism which we thought to have been stamped out when we com mitted the nation, life and soul to the world war.

"Constitutional prohibition has been adopted by the nation. It is the su preme law of the land. In plain speaking there are conditions relating to its enforcement which savor of na tion-wide scandal. It is the most de moralizing factor in our public life. Most of our people assumed that the adoption of the eighteenth amend ment meant the elimination of the question from our politics. On the contrary, it has been so intensified as nn issue that many voters are dis posed to make all political decisions with reference to this single question. It is distracting the public mind and prejudicing the judgment of tue elec torate. U. S. to Stay Dry? "The day is unlikely to come when the eighteenth amendment would be repealed. The fact may as well be recognized and our course adapted ac cordingly. If the statutory provisions for its enforcement are contrary to deliberate public opinion, which I do not believe, the rigorous and literal attention on any requisite modifica tion. Such a course conforms with the law and saves the humiliation of the government and the humiliation of our people before the world, and chal lenges the destructive forces engaged in widespread violation, official cor ruption, and individual demoralization. "The eighteenth amendment involves the concurrent authority of state and federal governments for the enforce ment of the policy it defines. A cer tain lack of definiteness, through di vision of responsibility, is thus intro duced. In order to bring about full understanding of duties and responsi bilities as thus distributed. ! propose to invite the governors of the states and territories, at an early oppor tunity. to a conference with the fed eral "executive authority. Out of the full and free considerations which will thus be possible it is confidently be lieved will emerge a more adequate comprehension of the whole problem, and definite policies of national and state co -operation in administering the laws.

"Closely related to this problem of education is the abolition of child labor. Twice congress has attempted the correction of the evils incident to child employment. The decision of the supreme court has put this problem outside the proper domain of federal regulation until the constitution is so amended as to give the congress in dubitable authority. I recommend the submission of such an amendment. "We have two schools of thought relating to amendment of the constitu tion. One need not be committed to the belief that amendment is weaken ing the fundamental law or that exces sive amendment is essential to meet every ephemeral whim.

S.—The coro ner's jury called to investigate the death of John C. Marts, who was found dead in his bed Sunday morning with both legs burned off below the knees, re turned a verdict Thursday to the .effect that his demise was caused by a blow on the right temple by some person unknown. The jury consisted of E. L. rhneider. II. W. Sater and W. 15. Hfirdenbrook. Marts was about 60 years old and had lived in this section for the past 25 or .30 years. He was engaged in herding sheep and lived most of the time in a camp wagon or a tepee. When the body was found it was seen The Challenge of the Bootleggers A saturnalia of bootlegging seems to be no exaggerated phrase to describe the startling state of^af fairs to which the Administration calls the nation's attention. Inspired Washington dispatches tell us that the present Prohibition enforcement methods are "debauching and debasing the entire country , that the President is "deeply concerned over a belief that the moral fiber ot the American people is deteriorat ing through the open disrespect shown for the effort to enforce Prohibition;' and that the growth ot bootlegging, the temerity of rum-runners, and the serious insinuations against Federal enforcement o.ti cers have been worrying the Administration for some months," until finally—"With Prohibition enforce ment recognized as on the verge of absolute collapse in four States and in a condition ot serious demorali zation elsewhere in the country. President Harding considered today the issuance of a solemn appeal to all good citizens to discourage bootlegging as a last resort to administer the law. "One way to make Prohibition prohibit," declares the New York Evening Post, "would be to arrest some of the prominent and respectable people who buy what the bootleggers sell.
