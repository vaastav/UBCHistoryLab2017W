€t)icctso tribune. TUESDAY, DECEMBER 16, 1863. THE SEWS. The situation is unchanged before Fred ericksburg. There was no general resump tion of fighting yesterday, though under the present state of things it cannot he long deferred. The report that Banks has laud ed at 'Wanton, on the Chowan river, in 3>orth Carolina, and is to move against Richmond from the South, in cooperation: ■withi&e other Federal forces in that part ■of the field of war, has probably foundation intact. Thom Cairo and helow we hare an inter esting budget of deferred and fresh news. . Among the former, an important budget of river intelligence, comprising acts of steam boat burning and town horning by a Steamboat captain. The condition in Gen. Grant’s department is without change. A . brilliant lithe affair is reported to hare ta ken place at Tuscumhia, led off by Col Sweeney and his Fox Hijcr boys of the SSd Illinois. OID 

BUCK BEBVKED. A measure is before the Senate for the public censure of old J. B. for his winking at treason. It should he put on record against him and his name made infamous on (he same page -with Benedict Arnold, if the latter’s shade does not object to such Contiguity. Or rather it may. adorn that fresh page on ■which will be written down the name and crime and failure of the traitors of the great rebellion. Perhaps the old Pub. Func. will write one of his letters to the Senate. A XBIO OF MPLO3UTS, The New York Tima has a column, de voted to an illustrious trio of diplomats, who may be enumerated as as W. Cornell Jewett of Colorado, George Francis Train of Much Ado, and J. "Wesley Greene Tinker, of do the Chicago Tima. It is astonishing that three such lights are shining at once. Among the three ills difficult to adjust the question of prefee xlence, save that the role of each is differ ent. Jewett is aToots run mad in the line of letter writing. Train considers his mission a verbal one, and Greene is alto gether on the mysterious agent order, pre cisely the variety to charm the susceptible .and innocent Chicago Time*. THE PRESIDENT SUSTAINED, Syadiitct rote of 78 to 57 the House yesterday sustained the President’s forth coming Emancipation Proclamation as a war measure, demanded hy the crisis hud destined to crush out the rebellion. The people will sustain this endorsement, and the President will be strengthened by it. Me did not refer to the Proclamation in his Jate Message, because it must by its own terms come up during the present session of Congress, but that body in advance will meet him with a full and frank acknowl * edgment of the importance and necessity of the measure for which the war has waited. Slavery will be struck down as the bulwark of the rebellion. It will be riddled and destroyed even as houses of Fredericksburg were destroyed because they sheltered rebels. The war can be ended in no other way, and in this way it can be brought to a close when Slavery is extinct. The time draws nigh.

IWWS FROM TfTEXfiCO. £From the New York Tribune, 13th.} The latest news from Mexico received through private channels indicates a disposi tion on the part of the clergy to co-operate with the French in their expedition against that country. A Catholic clergyman is said to have in ms possession £a- letter from Vera Cruz, informing him that five Mexican prelates—the Archbishops of Gnanaxuato, Merida, San Luis, Guadalajara, and Mexico— liad written a letter of welcome to Gen. Torcy, offering him the support of the whole Mexican clergy against Jurez. This letter also says that the priests, who exercise a con trolling influence upon the great mass of the natives, hadbeenim-tructedto prepare them for the reception of the French, and that they were at fulfilling their task with zeal and devotion. This announcement is said to have imparted a great deal of confidence to the Commander in-Chief of the French army, and has canscd him, to some extent, to modify his former plane. Thus. instead of hurrying forward hie march upon Mexico, he has decided to post pone hie departure to the end of •January, so as to giro lime to his allies to effectuate the adhesion promised in hie favor by the letters j&f these Archbishops. It is also staled that the project announced fly the authorities of Mexico, of flooding that City on the approach of the French, has ex cited a great deal of indignation among the xeal estate owners and merchants, who'have entered a protest against such a resolution. The transportation service being yet incom plete, and the surrounding country destitute, account of the guerilla warfare which fol lowed the repulse of the French from Puebla, Cen. Forcy experiencing some difficulty in providing his army with the ncccssarv sup plies of food aufl clothing. It -was, however, thought that the provisions hourly expected from New Tork would put an end to this Slate of things. The report of the burning of the national bridge between Orizaba and Jalap a, by which the Trench garrison of this lasi city would have been cut off from Its line of communica tion, is not confirmed. The only news which has the character of trustworthiness is that relating to the inefficiency of transports and to the want of forage. The horses of the Trench cavalry were at the latest dates living ■on green corn and sugar-cane, a kind of diet not calculated to prepare them for the ardu ous march they are-expeetbd to perform.

No apprehension is felt for the result, except on account of the unfavorable nature of the ground to the at tacking parly. HzADorAUTxr.s l Ventt or the Potomac, I December 15, IS'JS. f The weather to-day has been clear and warm. The roads are in very good condition. The position of the two armies remains nearly the same. There was not much artillery firing Hus afternoon by ehber party. The shots which the rebels did fire were thrown into the city. The enemy, who are in plain view, arc busily cnploycdstrengtliemug their position. Over 700 prisoners have been taken since our army crossed the river. L Washington’, December 15.—0n Wcdncs eveuing our gunboats at Port Koyal, 2r miles from Fredericksburg, were fired into by a rebel bmtery, supposed to number 20 heavy guns. One shot struck a coal schooner ami Killed the captain, named Simmons. Another struck the Currituck, going Into her engine room, killing IL W. Smith, and wounding three others. The firing was very raph 1 *md continued till sundown, when the battery was silenced. Next morning the gunboats again opened on thcbattciy, but rcccivedno answer. Philadelphia Dec. 15.—A Fortress Mon roe Idler of December 14th, says Plymouth, N. C., had been destroyed .by fire, but by ■what division of the Federal army Is not known.

The reb els showed a disposition to move on Frank lin’s forces, but did not. There has been some skirmishing this mor ning, with considerable artillery firing. ■\VASnrabTON, Dee. 12.—Up to midnight no intelligence of importance had been received from the army. There was occasional tiring during the night, but it was of little conse quence in results. The taking of sevend ride pits yesterday evidently gave rise to the re port that the first Hue of rebel entrenchments had been taken. A number of the wounded arrived Inst night and were conveyed to the several hospitals. Another b.oat load is on the way. New Yoke, Dec. 15.—The Ibrrf.d says of Saturday’s battle: It raged fiercely through the entire day and evening. After dark the fighting in our immediate front and right and beyond Fredericksburg was carried on by Sumner's grand division. Shortly after V o’clock the 2d corps, Gen. Couch’s, moved out from the upper part of the city with a strong detachment of skirmishers. The ene my yielded gradually, though they contested our progress with great stubbornness, aud for some time the rattle of musketry was incessant. At the same time this movement commenced, the batteries of the division stationed on the bluffs across the river opened with shell, to cover onr advance. The rebel infantry hiving fallen back to their first line of in trenchmenlß and rifle-pits, their batteries opened with vigorous aud rapid lire upon our columns, which had now come ton temporary halt, awaiting the result of the artillery'fight ing. For some time ourartillery on the bluffs kept up a heavy fire on the rebel batteries, with much better success. The batteries on Taylor’s Hill, nearly opposite Falmouth, were finally silenced. During this time the rebel i artillery was almost entirely devoted to shell i mg our advanced troops. Hancock’s division had the advance, supported by the other divi sion of the corps, while the blh corps. Gen. IVilleox, remained under arms iu the town, in readiness to advance. Soon after, the who l e Cv»rps deployed into line of battle and moved foi ward to attack and storm the rebel right batteries, while from the enemy’s works a terrible shower af shell, irrape and shrapnel tore through tlclr bleeding ranks, notwith standing whichJfhcy steadily pushed on to the rille-pits wrlhxn a short distance of the first line of intrenchracnls. From the former they drove the rebels, making prisoners of some, while the remainder took refuge behind the earthworks. This was accomplished after the most heroic and long-continued efforts, under a galling and murderous lire. Unable to bold out against the tezrihle fire they now encountered, they finally retired in good or der, carrying away their wounded comrades. They fell back to their original line of pickets, thus holding the groqud which they first oc cupied, and which they held until morning, when they were relieved by Stouemau s com mand. Just before the advance of Couch's corps, heavy firing and dense smoke on the left indi cated that Franklin "was advancing upon and had already engaged the enemy’bright flank, and to open communication with him. there fore,‘Willcox detached his division under Gen. I Burns, and sent it to the left by the edge of the river, -with instructions to advance under cover of the river bank until he could place himself in close proximity to Franklin’s right. After hard lighting, ‘Couch's division being unable to cany the rebel works, the tremendous fire from their batteries rendered it necessary for them to retire, which they did, when the order had been given for the third time. It was now dark, and the divi sion fell back to its original position, after being six hours under fire. After severe fighting on Franklin's left, • with varied success, until dark, the relative position of the forces was about the same as in the morning,' except that wc had gained half jv mile or more on the left. | [From the Special the N. T. Times.] Freperickslcko, Va_, Dec. 11,1883. I localize this letter Fredericksburg, but it is assuredly«“living” Fredericksburg, “no more,” Acity soulless, rent by wreck of war, and shooting up in flames athwart night’s sky, is the pretty little antique spot by the Rappa hannock, ercwhile the peculiar scene of dig nified case and retirement. The advance of the right grand division of the army of the Potomac rests here to-night, •after a series of operations whicharc certainly among the most extraordinary of the war. To those who retired to rest, uninformed of what night was destined to bring forth, the spectacle this morning must have seemed strange enough to be the improvisation of the magician's art. One hundred and fifty pieces of cannon covered the circular* sweep of the bights of Fmdnricksbmg; 169,000 men in battle array had sprang from the earth, and lay, ready for the advance, behind those bights. But to the initiated, who spent the night in vigils and knew what work crowded its busy hours, it was ail intelligible ! enough. All night artillery came and came with its ceaseless, heavy rumble, and as each battety arrived from the rear it was posted in the place selected for it by the Chier of Artil lery. All nigbt the perpetual tramp of men moving to the front filled the air. Pontoon trains unwonnd their long, snake-like forms, and were drawn, each boat by its team, down to the river’s brink It had been determined, in council of war, held on‘Wednesday, that, instead of extend ing our lines of operations along th: river from Falmouth to Port Conway, the entire army should be crossed at or near Fredericks burgh. Five pontoon bridges were to be threw a acres* Hie river—the first at the XAcey House, which lies directly opposite the cud of the main street of Fredericksburg, half a mile below Falmouth; the Eeccnd and third within a few hundred yards from the first. The re maining: two were to be thrown over a mile and. a half qr two miles further down the stream,- and on these the grand division of Gen. Franklin—the It'll— - would cross, while Sumner’s and Hooker’s grand divisions—right and centre—would use the three upper ones. ; It was about 3 o’clock this morning when, the boats were unshipped from the teams at the river’s brink. Swiftly and silently the engineer Corps proceeded to their work. A • dense fog filled the valleys and water margin, : through which the bridge builders appeared as spectral forms. The recital of the Tinw? special correspondent with the left, will in form you of the details of the construction of , the two lower—Franklin’ Work • there was performed with perfect success— f the engineers being allowed to complete the first without any interruption whatever, while the construction of the other was but slightly interrupted by the fire of the rebel sharpshooters. • We were not so fortunate with the upper bridges. The artificers had hut got fairly to work, when at 5 o’clock the firing of two guns from one of the enemy’s batteries an nounced that we were discovered. They were signal guns. Rapid volleys of musketry, dis charged at our bridge builders, Immediately followed- This was promptly responded to on our side, by the opening of several bat teries. The fog, however, still hung densely over the river. It was still quite dark, and the practice of the artillerists was necessarily very much at raudom. The engineer corps suffered severely from the fire of the sharp shooters concealed in the town. The little band was being murderously thinned, and presently the work on the bridges slackened, and then ceased. Meanwhile the firing from our batteries, posted about a mile from the river, was kept up vigorously. The eflect was singular enough, and it was difficult to believe that the whole affair was not a pliantasainrgoria. It was still quite dark, the horizon aroundheing lit up only by the flash of projectiles, which reappeared in explosive flame on the other side cf the river. ! Daylight came, but with it came not clear ness of vision for on-lookcrs. The mist and j smoke not only did not lighten, but grew more opaque and heavy, hugging the ground closely. Our gunners, however, still con tinued to launch their missiles at a venture. The rebel batteries hardly returned our lire, and this chariness of their ammunition they preserved nil day—not a-dozen rounds being fired during the whole forenoon. Towards o’clock a largo party of General Officers, among them Gen. Burnside, the Corps Commanders, and many others of high rank, had congregated in front of and on the balcony of .Gen. Sumner’s headquarters, Phil lips’ House, situated about a mile directly back of the Lacy House. The performance . could be heard, but not seen—the was | obstinately hidden from view, and all were ' Impatient that the curtain should rise. Aids and couriers came pad went with messages to hours, and from the batteries and bridges. At P % o'clock official notification # was re ceived that the two bridges on the extreme left were completed, and Gen. Franklin sent to Gen. Burnside to know if he should cross his force at once. The reply was that he should wait until the upper bridges also were completed, Meantime,with the latter but little progress was made. During the next couple of hours half u dozen attempts were made to complete the bridges, but each lime the party was re pulsed with severe loss. On the occasion of one essay, Capt. Brainerd, of the 50th New York Volunteer Engineers, went out on the bridge with eleven men. Capt. Perkins led another party, and was shot through the neck, and the Sixty-sixth and Fifty-seventh New York regiments, which were supporting the Fiftieth and Fifteenth New York Volun teer Engineers—Gen. Woodbury’s brigade— suffered severely. It was a hopeless task,and we made little or no progress. The rebel sharpshooters, posted in the cellars of the houses of the front street, not fifty yards from the river, behind stone walls and rifle pits, were able to pick off with damnable accuracy any party of engineers venturing on the haif ■ completed bridges. The case was perfectly clear. Nothing can be done till they are dislodged from *" their lurking places. There is bufonc wav of do ing this effectually—shell the town.* At 10 o'clock Gen. Burnside gives the order, “Con centrate the fire of all your guns on the city, and batter it down!” You may believe they were not loth to obey. The artillery of the right—eight batteries—was commanded by Col. Hays; Col Tompkins, right centre— eleven batteries—Col. Tyler, left centre — seven batteries —Capt. Deßussy, left —nine batteries. In a few moments those thirty-live batteries, forming a total oj 179 guns, rang ing from ten-pounder Parrotts to four and a half inch siege guns, posted along the convex side of the arc of the circle, formed by the I bend of the river and land opposite Fred- 1 erieksburg, opened on the doomed city. The effect was, of course, terrific, and, regarded merely ns sv phenomenon, was .among the most awfully grand conceivable. Perhaps what will give you the liveliest idea of its effect is a succession, absolutely without in termission, of the very loudest thunder peals. It lasted thus for upward of an hour, fifty rounds being fired from each gun, and I know not how many tons or iron were thrown into the town. The congregated Generals were transfixed. Mingled satisfaction and awe was upon every thee. But- what was tantalizing, was that though a great deal could be heard, nothing could be seen,-the city being still enveloped in fog and mist. Only a denser pillar of smoko defining it self on the back ground of the fog, indicated whore the town had been fired by our shells. Another and another column showed itself, and we presently saw that at at least a dozen houses must be on fire. Toward noon the curtain rolled up, and we saw that it was Indeed so. Fredericksburg was in conflagration. Tremendous though this firing had been, and terrific though its efiect obviously was on the town, it had not accom plished the object intended. It was found by our gunners almost impossible to obtain a sufficient depression of their pieces to shell the front part of the city, and the'rebel sharp shooters were still comparatively safe behind he inick stone walls of the houses. During the thick of the bombardment, a fresh attempt had been made to complete the bridirc. It failed, and evidently nothing could bedonetiUa party could be thrown over to clean out the rebels andcoverthe bridge head. For this mission Gen. Burnside called for vol unteers. and Col. Hall, of Fort Sumter fame, immediately responded that he had a brigade that would do the business. Accordingly, the Seventh Michigan and Nineteenth Massa chusetts, two smalt regiments, numbering in all about four Imudred'mcu, were selected for the purpose. The plan was that they should take the pon toon boats of the first bridge, of which there were ten lying ou tbe bank'bf the river, wait ing to be added to the half-finished bridge, cross over iu them, audlandlng, drive out the rebels. Nothing could be more admirable or more gallant than the execution of this daring feat. Rushing down the steep banks of the river, the party found temporary shelter behind the pontoon boats lying scattered on the bank, and behind the piles of planking destined for the covering of the bridge, behind rocks, &e. In this situation they acted some fifteen or twenty minutes as sliarpshooters, they and the rebels observing each other. Iu the mean time new and vigorous artillery, tiring was commenced ou onr part, and just as soon as this was fully developed, the 7th Michigan rose from their crouching places, rushed "for the pontoon boats, and pushing them Into tbe water, rapidly filled them with twenty-five or thirty each. The first boat pushes off. Now, if ever, is the rebels’ opportunity. Crack! Crack! Crack! from fifty lurking places go rebel ri fles at the gallant fellowsT who, stooping low in the boat, seek to avoid the fire. The mur derous work was wfcH done. Lustily, how ever, pnll the oarsmen, and presently, having passed the middle of the stream, the boat and its gallant freight come under cover of the op posite bluffs. Another and another boat follows. Now is their opportunity. Nothing could be more amusing, in its way, than tbe result. Instantly they saw a new turn of affairs. The rebels pop up by the hundred, like so many rate, from every cellar, rifle-pit and stone wall, and scamper off up the streets of the town. With all their fiectness, however, many of them were mnch 100 slow. With incredible rapidity the Michigan and Massachusetts boys sweep up the hill, making a rush for the lurking places occupied by the rebels, and gaining them, each man capturing his two or three prisoners. The pontoon boats on their return trip took over more than a hundred of these fellows. iou can imagine with what intense interest the crossing er the first boat-load of our men was watched by the numerous spectators on ibe shore, and with wbat enthusiastic shouts their landing on the opposite side was greet ed. It was an authentic piece of human heroism, which moves men as nothing else can. The problem was solved. This dish of bravery bad done what scores of batteries and tons of metal had filled to accomplish. The party once across, and the rebels cleaned out, it took the engineers but a brief period to complete the bridge. They laid hold with a will, plunging waist-deep into the water, and working as men work who are under in spiration. In less than half an hour the bridge was completed, aud the head of the column of the column of the right grand di vision, consisting of Gen. Howard’s com mand, was moving upon it over the Bappa hannock. A feeble attempt from the rebel batteries was made to shell the troops in cross-, ing, but'it failed completely. ___ Tour correspondent found an opportunity to cross the river along with the parly who first went over, in a boat, having been curious to take a closer view of the city which wo have for near a month been observing overthe river, not 300 yards wide, without the power of visitation. As the rebels were in very consid erable force on the hiuhtsbackof the city, one could not extend his w peramhuhilions beyond the street fronting on the river. Everyone of the houses which 1 here entered —a dozen ormore—is torn to pieces by shot aud shell, and the fire still hotly rages m a dozen parts of the city. A few citizens—a score or two, perhaps—male and female, presently made their appearance, emerging out of the cellars, whither they had taken refuge during the bombardment. Three women—white—whom we found In a cellar, told us that they, with a’ nifjori'.y of the Inhabitants, haSmoved gut of CHICAGO, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 16, 1862. Fredericksburg a fortnight or so previously, but that,growing reassured by our long delay, they, ■with a good many others,had comeback tie evening before. T?he former inhabitants they report as now living in various parts of the environs, some in negro huts, ana others in tents made with bedclothes, &c. During the afternoon of the bombardment .we observed a conplc of white hankerchiefs waved ont of the windows of a honse in the city. This was taken by some for a flag of truce, and the Chief of Artillery was on the point of causing the shelling to cease. Gen. Burnside, however, decided that it was proba bly merely only the wonted rebel ruse, and ordered operations to be continued. We found’out that the demonstrations were made by two of the women referred to, with the desire that we would send over a boat and convey themaway from Fredericksburg.- Among other prominent objects during the bombardment was a large British flag flying over the honse of the English Consul. This personage, however, was not found in his house ■when we entered the city, and the flag' was taken passcssion of and brought away. A number of rebel dead were found in vari ous parts of the city, some exhibiting fright ful mutilations from shells, and I took as a trophy a rifle, still loaded, out of the grasp of a hand belonging to a headless trunk. The infantry in the city appear to have been Missippians, South Carolinians and Floridians. Those of them that we took prisoners were wretchedly clad, and mostly without blankets or overcoats, but they gen erally looked stout and healthy, and certainly in far better condition than they could have been were there any truth in the report of some deserters the other day, to the effect that for three weeks they had' nothing to eat but the persimmons they were able to pick up. Although we are not yet fully informed of the present positions of the enemy, there seems to be good ground to claim that Gen. Burnside has succeeded in outgeneraling and outwitting them. His decoys to make them believe that we were about’ to cross at Port Conway, seem to have succeeded admirably. I suppose there is no harm how in my men tioning that among the ruses he employed, was sending down, day before yesterday, to Port Conway, SOO wagons, and bringing them j back by a different road, for the sole purpose of making the rebels believe that we were j about to cross the river at that point. To the same end, workmen were busily em ployed hi laying causeways for supposed pontoon bridges there, while the gun boats wei£. held as bugaboos at the same place. Completely deceived by these feints, the main rebel force, including Jackson! s command, seems to have been two or three days ago transferred twenty or twenty-five miles down the river. It must be remember ed, however, that without theutmost celerity on our part they can readily retrive this blun der by a forced march or two. Signal guns, «l 5 o’clock this morning, gave them the cue to what was going on, and doubtless they hstve not been idle-during the' intervening hours. 

PROCEEDINGS OF CONGRESS. Wasbikgto&, Dec. 13,1662. SENATE. Mr. KING of N.

Mr. FIELD presented a p’etition asking for bounty for sick and wounded soldiers. Mr. FESSENDEN, from the Committee on Finance, reported back thebillconcerning the judgments in the suits brought by the United Slates, with the recommendation that the amendment of the House be disagreed to. Thc recommendation of the committee was PROCEEDINGS OF CONGRESS. adopted. He presented a letter from Mr. Pierce of Met, asking to be excused from further service on the Committee ou Finance. The Vice President appointed Mr Bice of Minnesota, to fill the vacancy. Mr. 

WILSON of 3lass.,from the Committee, on Military Affairs, reported back a bill to abolish the grade of medical officers in the service of the United States, with a recom mendation that it do not pass. Mr. LANE of Kansas, introduced a bill to provide for the extinction of the Indian titles in Kansas, and provide for the removal of the Indians. Referred. Mr. COLLAMER of Vt., offered a resola- lion, requesting the President, if not incon sistent with the public interests, to transmit to the Senate the report and accompanying documents of Hon. Reverdy Johnson, as Com missioner of the United States during the last summer at New Orleans. Adopted. Mr. COLLAMER presented the credentials of Hon. Solomon Foote, re-elected Senator from Vermont. Mr. 

DAVIS of Ky. offered a resolution that after It had become manifest that an insurrec- tion against the United States was about to break out in several States, James Buchanan, then President, from sympathy with the con-_ spirators and their treasonable projects, failed to lake the necessary and proper measures to prevedt it; therefore he should receive the censure and condemnation of the Senate and American people. Laid over. Mr. 

FIELD of N..J. offered a resolution in structing the Committee on Foreign Relations to inquire whether some method cannot be devised to manifest the sympathy of Congress with the suffering Lancashire operatives. Or dered to he printed. The resolution relative to certain citizens of Dclawarc.was taken up and Mr. DAViS of Ky., proceeded to speak at length in favor of the resolution, arguing that the President had not authority under the Constitution to make any such arrests. The President had no .right to suspend a law or define Its execution. Afur some Jargumcnt, Mr. Davis admitted the President was excusable in correcting Gov. Morchcad of Kentucky. It was even commendable. It would not have been inex cusable to have arrested the leaders of the Hartford Convention, or for Buchanan to have arrested Phillips, Cheevcr, and other miserable miscreants. He denied that slavery was the cause of the war. It was because New England and other States had abolished slavery, and commenced a crusade against the Slates which held on to it. He 'thought the people would arise and recon struct this union, and leave Massachusetts out. in the cold and frozen regions. If the war had been curried on according to the princi iles of the Crittenden Compromise, it would i:\ve been finished long ago. The Senate then went"into executive ses sion, and at its conclusion, adjourned. house. Mr.

Passed. Mr. FESSENDEN of Me., offered the fol lowing: Eetolced, That the proclamation of the Presi dent of the date of Sept. 22(1,1862. is warranted by the Constitution. That the policy of emancipa tion's indicated therein, is well adapted to hasten the restoration ot peace, is well chosen as a war measure, and is an exercise of power with proper regard to the rights of citizens aud the perpetuity of a free government. Mr. DOLMAN, of Indiana, moved to lay the resolution on the table. Disagreed to—s3 against to. The resolution was then adopted, by 78 against 57.

The House then went into Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union and the President’s message. Mr. COX spoke about the conduct of the administration, of President Lincoln and the policy of the Republicans in general, arguing that tbe people in the recent elections had. condemned the emancipation edict of the President andlile olliermeasurcs. Mr. Cox said what he asserted he knew to be true, namely; Tint the removal of Gen. McClellan was a eaetlfice to appease the Abolitionists, that officer being in favor of conducting the war by armies, and under not above the constitution, and the administration will be compclk d to resort to Gen. McClellan for car rying on the war and a conservative policy. Unless this he done, a disadvantageous peace may be the result. ’• The Committee rose, and sthe House ad journed. ] from Cairo ahs below Interesting from, the Lower Mississippi. IDE 

SITUATION AT VICKSBURG.'; The- Illicit Trade on the Lower Mississippi. lEEEIS BURH A STEAMER. A Steamboat Captain De stroys Two Towns. LATEST FROM THE HELENA EXPEDITION. Matters ■with G rant’s Army. Gallant SMnmsli at Tuscnmbia. [Note. —The following dispatches should have appeared in our last issue, hut failed to come to hand.—Eos. Teuj.] * • [Special Dispatch to the Chicago Tribune.] Cairo, December 13. ISGi. The steamer DcSoto, late in charge of Act ing Master John R. Nelli, came up to-day. from Helena the 10th. It seems that not pne- half the results of the late capture of steam .crs below Helena charged with contraband trading, have been yet received. I am now enabled to send you a full report. OntheSthiiist., Capt- Neill, under orders from Commander A McGivcn of the gunboat Benton, then lying off Helena, with Acting Master Lord and twenty men of the Benton, got under way at an early hour in the mor ning and proceeded down the river. Accord ing to the log-book of the DeSoto, otherwise the Gen. Lyon, at the foot of Islands No. C 2 and 03 she found the steamer J. R. ‘Williams at anchor. She was placed in charge of Mas- ter’s Mate Johnson, and ordered to Helena. Upon the J. R. Williams it was reported that the steamer Lake City had been burned at Carson Landing, 60 miles below Helena, and her passengers and crew captured. The De Soto proceeded down the river, and at Rod eon’s Landing found the steamer Clarabel- She was put lu charge of acting Master’s ilate Powell, and ordered to follow. When the Len ding was reached, a man was discovered on shore, on horseback, who at once attempted to get away. A shell was fired at him fromonc of two 12-ponnd brass howitzers, with which the De Soto is famished, but he escaped into the woods. At Corcom’s Landing a number of men came to leave, bearing a flag of truce. A gig was mounted, and Capt. Neill, with the First Assistant Engineer, went on shore to confer with them. From these persons was obtain ed the confirmation of the robbery and de struction of the steamer Lake City. It had occurred on the Bth Inst. The ruffians who performed the guilty act were commanded by a CoL Adams, of the Confederate forces. A. negro woman-named Joshua gave Capt. Neill information that the rebels were yet near by, •and that he must be upon his guard. All the pickets that could be spared out of a lorcc of twenty-eight men were stationed about town, within range, and by the aid*of the negro Joshua they discovered the baggage of the crew and passengers of the Lake City In a warehouse. It was removed to the DcSoto. The inhabitants were then notified that they must remove their property, as the town would be burned- Paymaster Steward and Engineer Ince were then .put in command of a company of men, with orders to set fire to every house in the town. This was done, and thereby the bnild- lugs were soon in a blaze, including one warehouse, two dwellings, aud a number of negro quarters. No lime was allowed Capt. Neill and Acting Master Lord to make aclose examination of the buildings, as a regiment of rebel troops were in the vicinity. In fact some said they could see the tents and camp fires from the pilot ho«se. While the work of retaliation, justly merit ed by the burning of the steamer and capture of cargo, officres, crew jmd passengers, was going on, the party on shore was fired upon from the woods. After setting Corcoran’s Landing on fire the Dc Soto drifted down the stream a few miles to Concordia Landing, where were seve ral houses. After throwing several shells through a warehouse, intending to set fire to it, finding it impossible men were landed, pickets thrown out and houses, stores and warehouse destroyed by fire. All had previ ously been deserted by their owners. The contents of the houses were removed to the street. Ou the return from this cruise the DeSoto took on five bales of cotton at McNeil’s Land ing. Some more was seen at various points on the way down,tmt it had been removed. The results of the expedition in thoglory of which Capt. Neill and Acting Master Lord should equally share, are five steamers cap tured, supposed to be In thecontraband trade, five prisoners taken as hostages, nine negroes captured and forty-two buildings destroyed. This for an A 2 dispatch boat, carrying twenty-eight men and two 12-ponnd brass howitzers, is not so bad. When it had gone part of the distance to Concordia Landing, Capt. Neill was importuned by some of his .officers to return, as it was hazardous to ven ture so far from the lines. His repliy was a Hlgoto h— or find the Lake City or her crew, and passengers, provided they are north of Napoleon.” Capt. Neill has, fur lus bravery, been sus pended from the command of his steamer. Passengers late from Lagrange and Oxford report all quiet on Thursday in that vicinity. At Lagrange there were rumore afloat that the rebels meditated a* raid upon them. It was not much feared, and if undertaken will end in a rebel discomfiture. [Special Dispatch to the Chicago Tribune.] Cairo, Dec. 14,1562. The several steamers captured bj the De Solo below Helena arrived here last evening and to-day. The following is the order to special agents of the Treasury Department, under which they were trading at the time arrested. Special Agenct. Trb asuist-Departil* t. ). Mbxtbis, Dec. 12,1863. ' ] In pursuance of instructions and regulations by Hon. Secretary of United States Treasury, August 28,1662, referring to certain acts of Congress, ap-* proved Jnly 13,1661, and Hay SO. 1862, authorizing special agents of departments to temporarily ex pend restrictions to places in their repective dis tricts. and make each local rules to be observed therein as may. Item time to time, become neces sary, promptly reporting their action to the Secre tary of the Treasury, for his sanction or proval; now, in accordance with authoßty, and with the. consent of the military and naval commanding officers, clearance will be granted steamboats to pass down the iCs eisßippiEiver as far as within ten miles of the mourn of 'White Sixer with permitted goods, not- of contraband character, intended only for family supplies, delivery thereof to be supervised by revenue aid, and receipted for on oath by the parties receiving the same that they wiQ noe be used directly or indirectly for any other purpose, and receive in exchange for cotton. In all cases it win be distinctly understood by parties TnaWnp such adventure that no reclama tion will be acknowledged by the government of the United States for any loss of boat, or cargo by persons in insurrection. Furthermore, boats making trips will be required’to giyebonds in double the amount of their value, to BteUna or Memphis, and an additional bond of $20,000 that no goods of any kind shall be lauded from boats not folly set forth on manifests and bills permitted bv proper authorities. . ~r Aids and other loyal- citizens wm report file name of any person. or boats paying out gold or other articles of contraband in exchange for cotton. (Signed,) Taos. H. TEAWtA 2u Special Agent of Treasury Dep\ The steamer Van Phul arrived from Mem phis to-day, bringing dates to the 12th. Thj JlvUeUnhas an account of the return of Gen\ Sherman, from the trip across the country vrith Qen, Smith’s division) and afltatemoat that he is at present organizing a new expe dition of some sort at Memphis. Gen. Sher man arrived at that place on the morning of the 12th. A portion of Admiral Porter’s fleet has al ready arrived at TiptonviUc, the remainder must soon move to overtake it. Wupiavc Southern reports via Memphis, to Monday last The Codfederate army is said to be near or at Canton, Miss., or between Cant on and Jackson. They have no fortifica tions at Jackson of any consequence. Their army is much demoralized, and it is not cer tain they will be able to fight us even at Jackson. At Vicksburg the Confederate force is rep resented as being 7,000 strong. The number at Port Hudson is about 50,000, there are also many sick. Port Hudson is considered a very strong point, much stronger than Vicksburg. The force at the former place is mostly made up of conscripts who are constantly deserting. Some companies cannot muster fifteen men.JJ GemHovey before leaving Helena issued his order congratulating the troops upon the successful accomplishment of their late haz ardous raid into Mississippi. The following bodies of troops should have credit along with Gen. Hovey, for said suc cess ; Ist Indiana, Bth 'Wisconsin, sth Kansas, and 9th Illinois, CoL Brackett’s Illinois cav alry forming the advance under Brig. Gen. Washburn. They were supported by the lith Indiana, Lieut. CoL McCauley, 34th Indiana, Col. Spicely, 43d Illinois, CoL McLean, 46th Indiana, CoL Gonld, 24th lowa, Col. Smith, and 26th lowa and 2d lowa, and' 16th Ohio batteries. The results of the raid sum up the loss of the enemy killed at twenty, wounded forty, prisoners 100. Among them arc some officers. The Federal loss, killed four, wounded twenty, prisoners ten. This, considering the grand effect upon Price’s army, was smalL Cairo, Dee. 15,1862. The oSthlowa, Col. Cummings, arrived last evening. They go south immediately. Col. Sweeney, with the 52d Illinois, 2d lowa and some cavalry and a battery, went ont from Corinth to Tnscumbla Creek, Miss, on Thurs day last, and met CoL Boddy, of the Confede rate army, with a considerable force, and had a brisk little engagement, in which our troops behaved nobly. ' The rebels were driven off, their camp tenle, equipage, &c., and a number of prisoners were captnred. Col. Sweeney got back to camp with Ms .entire command and prisoners In safety. Cairo, Dec. 15.—A Federal force, consist ing of the 52d Illinois, 2d lowa, an independ ent company of Illinois cavalry, one sect on of the Ist Missouri artillery, under command of Col. Sweeny, attacked .the rebel force at Tus cumbia, supposedto number 2,000, under the ! command of CoL Roddy, Last Saturday. The rebels were completely surprised and routed. Their loss in killed and wounded is not known. The Fcderals took seventy prisoners, cap tured a number of horses, burned rebel bag gage. No pursuit was made, the Federal force not being deemed sufficient. They lost four killed, fourteen wounded and had returned to 'Corinth. Col. Dougherty has been ordered to take command of the post at Paducah. Cairo, Dec, 14. —1t was a squad of rebel cavalry under Capt. Wirt Adams, from the interior, that burned the steamer Lake City. Trading for supplies is not sanctioned by thcConfcderate authorities of Arkansas. The steamer Williams was fired at by Adams’ men. The Benton shelled and afterwards burned the entire town.of Concordia. This is the burning referred to yesterday. Gen. Sherman’s army has returned to Mem phis. Admiral Porter has taken the New Uncle Sam for his flag-ship. Grant’s army is yet at Oxford. The grist mills in the vicinity arc run by the Federate. Vast quantities of com is being ground. There Is plenty of com in the neighborhood. The railroad is repaired to Waterford, and will be coraxdeted to Oxford by Tuesday or Wednesday. From Oxford to, Grenada hut slight repairs arc necessary. Wagon roads are iu excellent condition, and Vicksburg must be reached before the army can go into winter quarters. Cairo, Dec. 13. —Guerillas burned the steamer Lake City and took her crew prison ers, at Corcom’s Landing, fifteen miles above the mouth of White River, last Monday. On Tuesday the naval dispatch boat DeSoto went down and burned forty-two houses on the Landing, and took six citizens prisoners, who are held as hostages for the crew of the Luke City. The commander of the DcSoto executed the burning without orders. The citizens say they tried to prevent the burning of the boat, and sent a courier to Gen, Steele to give in formation. The boats that have been arrest ed laid permits to buy cotton, but not to trade provisions for it, which they did. Gen. Grant's army is still at Oxford and an immediate advance is not expected. Gen. Sherman is reportedto be moving back to Memphis, where, it is said, a new move ment is to be organized. Ills not believed hcrcthatGen.McClcmand will have the command of the expedition down the river. Naval officers think, that if the blockade at Vicksburg is run by the gunboats the rebels will evacuate it, as supplies from Red River will be cut off. An Order Rescinded. Washington’, Dec. 15. —The Postmaster General has rescinded all orders heretofore made excluding from the post offices and mails of the United States certain newspapers represented as disloyal to the government. ■Nero TAT
