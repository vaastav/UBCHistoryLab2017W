DARR0WS BETRAYAL OF LABOR. "Jim McNamara did not intend to Iclll anybody. His dynamite broke the irna mains. And that's the plight I found him in. He told me the truth about it all.

Darrow kept the confidence, as too many profes I sional men do. He permitted Gompers and Mitchell and other sincere labor leaders to retain their delusion regard ing the innocence of his clients and ac eepted thousands of dollars in contri butions from the rank and file of union workmen to a defense fund for con fessed murderers. He betrayed thou sands of worthy mechanics with the end of saving the necks of two men unworthy of the aid and sympathy of their fellow toilers—men who had ae- EXTERMINATE THE RATS.

Whether one takes the announce ment that the United States is threat I iened with an epidemic of the beu bonic plague or not the advice is good 1 and should be followed. It is not to be denied that rats and, mice and per haps ground squirrels, are carriers of infectious diseases and their extermi nation would be a blessing to the com munity. Hitherto the central states have had little if any fear that either of these Jread diseases would ever become epi demic or even find a foothold in their midst. Climatic conditions and the spiendid sanitary systems prevailing in most cities, do not aid the propa gation of these scourges.

China has obviously forgotten, if it the maxim, "In time of peace prepare for war." An empire like China without a ple thoric treasury, a large and efficient .standing army and navy, competent I leadersip and cohesion of its citizen ship, is inherently weak by sheer force of numberB as well as for these vital causes. China demonstrated her utter Ina bility to cope with any power of im portance in her war with Japan some years ago. She lost a large slice of exceedingly valuable territory as a re sult of the struggle betweerv'Russla and Japan, her unpreparedness rendering her powerless to prevent it. And now that an internicin« war has broken out the empire quivers on the verge of hopeless disruption and endless strife. The revolutionary element evidently has little advantage over the Imperial party except In point of numbers and an apparently worthy cause. It Is lack at strong leadership, cohesive force and funds Is greater than that of the government, hence tha uncertainty of the result. The situation in China is particular ly deplored among the more civilised nations by reason of the fact that their missionary efforts are so tremendous ly handicapped by the hostile attitude of the country. Safety of the mission aries and other foreigners is promis ed but it Is by no means assured an«l »il va-*:- the Christian world stand* apprehen slve and inactive waiting until peace shall be restored. But the prospects for peace, that will give any Assur ance of permanency seem very remote at this time. There is a momentous lesson for China in the present trouble and its cause, but whether the empire will heed it and benefit by it is an unan swerable question now, for it is a per- verse nation and as changeable as the 1.00 tides. ,, wi j, I that two citv governments are in op complished irreparable injury to the eratlon in that city at the same time, cause they misrepresented. -po the outside observer this would Darrow is defending men whom he seem false pride. If Des Moines had knew to be guilty may have kept with- one citv government that would gov in the ethical bounds of legal practice. but in so doing he sought, with his recognized legal ability and the $195, 000 defense fund contributed by or ganized labor, to bring about a mis carriage of justice and prostitute the very courts which labor has been prone to criticise. His motives, as he admits, may be misunderstood. Wheth er or no. labor is justified in its ex pressed indignation against its be trayal by the McN'amara lawyer. The necks of a dozen dynamiters are not worth the price organized workmen have been compelled to pay in their effort to escape responsibility for the deplorable Los Angeles tragedy. The state board of health has doub less sounded a timely warning to the people of Iowa against the spread of plague by rats, mice ajid ground squir rels and has asked that the little pests be exterminated. The issuance of the bulletin follows a similar action by the state board of California, which has declared that an epidemic of the bubonic plague and of leprosy may be spread by small ani mals. This conclusion was reached following examinations of the ani mals for symptoms of the disease. Topics of the Times John D. has retired from the presi dency of the Standard Oil and has been succeeded by John D. It will make lit tle difference to the consumer wheth er the head of the oil business is an Archbold or a Rockefeller. The women of Los Angeles exercis ed their right of suffrage yesterday. California editors are now puzzled whether to give election assignments to the political reporters or the so ciety editors. "What shall we do with our ex-pres idents?" has become a more perplex ing question than ever. President Taft's message is the trust magnates idea of nothing to read. The Chinese revolutionaries seem *o have split into about as many factions as have the republican and democratic parties. Persia will receive no answers from the powers of the earth to call for as sistance unless Russia should decide not to "divvy" up. The suffragets of America are seek ing a suitable emblem. It probably would be regarded as treasonable to suggest a minature baby carriage. Des Moines is puffed up over the fact orn,. there would celebration. be better cause for Congress has been in session two days without an outburst from Joe Cannon. And some people say the world is not growing better. Missouri judges apparently have a contest to establish a record as champion indictment quasher. If there are any Missouri indictments still unquashed there are several judges ready and willing to perform the job. Fearless Theodore has made it so plain that -Mr. Barker will probably understand without calling for him to repeat. Detective Burns declares the chap ters to come will be even more thrilling than the opening installment, and promises to introduce some new char acters Into his story. 

IOWA OPINION AND NOTES. "The stumbling of J. P. Morgan, the railroad and financial magnate, in church has jarred the newspaper world. Really, what was there so astounding?" asks the Inter-County Journal, "about the fact that the man who has walked over hundreds of railroads and thou sands of other great enterprises with out once tripping should stumble in a church edifice when his only financial ballast was paltry church contribu tion." "According to the count kept by an Indianapolis man. for every newspaper article on edible mushrooms have been five autopsies," says the Indlanola Record. In a a iv or as principal contention was that over the custody of their one child and four bull terriers," says the Inter-County Jour nal. "The wife is sorely grieved over the inhumanity of the judge's decis ion which gave her the child and one dog, the other three dogs being given her husband. If those given her hus band could speak doubtless they would protest at the loss of the wife's tender care." 'Speaking or Standpatters,' as the Knoxville Journal usually does, your Uncle Tama Jim Wilson, secretary of agriculture since the memory of man runneth not to the contrary holds the belt. In spite of the best efforts of the Washington correspondent, the tem perance folk, the pure food fanatics, he ontinues complacently at his post. He has occupied a seat at the cabinet table these destructive rodents should of three presidents in succession and the democrats have grave doubts about their ability to remove his political scalp in the event of their electing the next president. Secretary Wilson our idea of a standpatter." 'What in the world is all this row in Des Moines politics about?" asks the Washington Democrat. "We supposed that the commission plan had made everything lovely and that there would be nothing further but pink teas and money growing on every plant. Des Moines acts very funny for a city." "A member of the lower house of congress from Iowa," says the "Web ster City Freeman-Tribune, "can not well go wrong so long as he hangs with both hands and teeth on the coattall of Senator Cummins. But why not have men who are big enough to help the senator In the light he ia mak ing?" "The editors, who a month ago were saying that Theodore Roosevelt was a dead one and could never again dla tate the politics of the country, are now greatly disturbed by the fear that their former calculations were wrong,'" declares the Knoxville Journal. "They are frantically recalling his pledge af ter the" election in 190* that he would never again be a candidate tor the .'V? -.V •S V- -1 -w presidency. Meanwhile Teddy contin ues to show his teeth occasionally, on the truat question and other adminis tration topics. The Journal can easily foresee a Situation In the republican national convention, which will result in the nomination of Colonel Roose velt unless he specifically refuses the honor, something that has never been done by any man." 

PERPBTUA-L CHRIST MA®. A Olft That Repeats Itself tvery Day to the Extent of Complete Library. The dally Times-Republican makes an Ideal Christmas present to give to anyone because it repeats itself day by day thruout the year. At the end of the year It will have delivered for a few dollars interesting reading equal in volume to 326 ordinary library books such as retail at $1.50 per vol ume: a complete library which would fill Ave book shelves eleven feet long. There would be at least elghten good stories which would fill a book each, and enough other good reading to, com plete a library of 326 standard sized books all In one year's subscription to the Times-Republican. Outside Point of View other people are. The Pharisee said something we can literally repeat with a devout and sincere feeling. It's a pleading for all to realize what they have to be thankful for—In comparing oui1 lot. circumstances and environ ment with that of others. If the whole world would adopt this doctrine the word envy would soon be obsolete. And the idea advanced here, does not in clude pride or Phariseeism. It is to be really and truly thankful we are not so bad off In many ways as we might be, and not in any particular as bad off as some others. Our friends, the Chris tian Scientists, have a good thing in their creed which prevents some from realizing or feeling pains and aches which the human body is heir to. The doctrine preached in this creed. If adopted will prevent many having a mental condition that is harder to hear, than any bodily disease. It Is only when we get in close touch with others that we realize that discontent is the rule and not the exception. Such per sons may not admit their envious thoughts, much less express them, but envy occupies much more time and space in the mental make-up of the average person than thankfulness. Such persons can not be forced to In dulge in a thankful spirit for what they have and enjoy, but they can be forced to admit many are worse off. We can make them say they are thankful they are not as other men are. Now no sermon has any effect unless It is practiced. Illustrations are a nec essary part of all sermons, so let us take up the question of money, which is the god we more, or less worship. Suppose we start with Rockefeller, the richest man In the world. We can all understand why he enjoys his Thanks giving sermon, but today many a sec tion man on many a railroad, has more to be thankful for than John D. Rocke feller. The section man living and supporting a family on $1.40 a day, has many things John D. has not. Things Mr. Rockefeller would give millions for. Is there a sectloi mgg liAhe United States today who~wowld accept a mir aculous change and be John D. Rocke feller tomorrow morning? Unques tionably the section man wonld like some: of the millions/1 but would he trade even, trade the section man Into the multimillionaire, if some fairy was ready to do the act. Xow suppose we look into Mr. Rock feller's case. He has troubles of his own. That stomach,, that bald head, those years bringing him closer every Thanksgiving to th* fljmraon lot of all manhind. those magazine articles, the newspaper squibs, those words "tainted money," and surely the skeleton In every closet, in the rich or poor man's house, what has he to be thankful for? Much In comparison. He's alive, that's cne thing, he knows.qf several rich men who left this world since last Thanksgiving. He can play golf, some his rich friends have the gout and heumatism. He has some children he is proud of, other rich men have dis reputable son." and daughters. He has consciousness he is giving awav mil lions for the benefit of mankind, while some of his rich. is "The Jefferson Bee says that Iowa is indifferent to LaFollette," ar.d the Ce dar Rapids Republican adds, "Why should we tear off any shirts for the little pompadour statesman, or politi cian, of Wisconsin? We have troubles enough politically without borrowin any from that state of socialistic ten dencies." The Waterloo Times-Tribune Is of the opinion that "the fellow who claims he husked 200 bushels of corn per day is a brother to the fellow who catches the big strings of fish." JS? ?q- A"W.

DECEMBER# Unable this year—the first time since 1900—to hear a Thanksgiving sermon, conservativestand as indicated by this scribe is going to preach one. The dispatches. text is. Thanking God we are not as friends are almost misers. If John D. is a wise man, he has much cause for thanksgiving. And It Is more than prcbable that Rocke feller Is thankful his conscience does ot trouble him. There's no end nor beginning to this thankfulness by comparison. None are so low and none too high, too poor or too rich, sick or well, prosperous or the reverse, successful in pursuits or 'allures In life, white or black, man or woman, young or old, unknown or prominent, honest man or criminal, there's not a person on God's green earth but what has some one or more easons to be thankful they are not as other men are. Is this merely a sentimental talk' Make a personal application of this doctrine and own up to yourself If to r.o one else. Iowa Newspapers WANTED A JOB. [Victor Record]. Much time and space Is being used by the magazine writers in con juring what to do with ttoosevelt, now that his dollar-a-word contract with the Outlook is about to expire. Roose velt ia one American who has been very successful in disposing of his hot air for a cash consideration and he will doubtlessly find a mart for it, if from no other source the stump In 1912.

THE POSTAL BANK, [Cedar Rapids Gazette]. Frequent comment is ma0e Vpon the fact that the average postal bank has few deposits.

Chairman Underwood, of the house ways and means committee, kindly an nounces that the president will be giv en a reasonable time in which to sub mit reports of the tariff board." Evi dently Chairman Underwood, an astute politician, realizes that the country Is with the president In his attitude to ward the tariff. The punishment that was to be visited upon the president because of his veto of the "pop gun tarifT bills" of the special session, has dwindled down to the foregoing mild announcement of what the house will do if the president keeps It waiting too long for the recommendations of the tariff board. The president has won out in this matter, and he will In the further events of the regular winter session of congress. But, really, Chair man Underwood has done the party a good turn by taking a respectful and rrnspr\*jitlirp stand as indicated by t»ie THE 

TRAGEDY QUEEN. [.Mason City Times]. It Is now reported that Mrs. Ger trude Patterson, just cleared from the murder charge in Denver, Colorado, will endeavor to go upon the stage. Stating that she had always wished to be an actress and now that she had the opportunity she believed that she would avail herself of the opportunity this alleged beautiful woman, Just out of the shadow of the gallows, with the blood of her husband acknowledged to be upon her hands, hastens to Inform the public that she will entertain it from behind the footlights. Tho cleared by a Jury of murder, the fact remains that this woman shot to death the man that called her wife, and after living with him for years as his life companion, she found it neces sary to seek and obtain a quarrel, and while he was In the act of further abusing her, shot him down. With his blood upon her hands, with the terrible knowledge of the awful tragedy still preying upon her mind, it would seem that this woman would have exjerlenc ed enough of tragedy for the rest of her life. The schemes of such public characters, to profit by notoriety gain ed by escape from the gallows, should be frowned upon by the public, and killed In their Inclplency. Rather than planning on a life on the stage this woman ought to be thanking God, and a sympathizing Jury, for her freedom and liberty to live. NOW IS THE TIME TO DECIDE. [Mason City Times], The policy of silence pursued by so large a number of our congressmen, and political leaders in Iowa, as re gards Taft amd LaFollette, and their aspiration for the presidential nomina tion, Is becoming the more remarked as time progresses. Where, in former years, it was the usual thing for the representatives of the people to whom the people naturally look for opinions upon public matters, and in whom they supposedly hav# great confidence, to speak out plainly upon such topics and show the people that they have ideas, and explain to them where they stand, this year a density of silence pre vails that would rival the stillness of a deaf and dtimb asylum. If a congress man or senator is for President Taft, and the principles he stands for, or if he favors Robert IiaFollette and the governmental policies which he rep esents, Is consistent, has the wellfare his country at heart and Is not thinking of his own selfish affairs, his re-election or the size of federal pie that he will be able to command, he should speak up and let his constit uents know where he stands. He hould make an active, aggressive fight, for the man and policy he approves. Any other course marks him as a pawn. Insincere, and afraid to call his soul his own.
