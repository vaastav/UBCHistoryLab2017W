The train records show that there were received and forwarded at Indianapolis in the week ended Dec. 7 a total of 27,912 cars, 22.557 being loaded, against 20,5o7 In the corresponding week of 1000 and against 21,- 12 in Of this increase the Pennsyl vania lines showed 1,021, the Vandalia 538 and the Big Four 22, and in each case the exhibits would have been more favorable had the lines cars and power to handle business awaiting shipment, the lack of power being as serious a matter as the car shortage. So steadily have locomjtlves bt-en in use for many months that many of them are frequently in the shops, and new locomotives are not arriving in sufficient numbers to offset the engines out of serv ice; especially is this the case with the Big Four and the Vandalia. While the grain movement to the East Is light, shipments of fruits, vegetables, dressed meats, pro visions and four are heavy, which fully offsets the light grain shipments. West bound the tonnage of coal Is heavy beyond precedent both of anthracite and bi tuminous coals, the unprecedented busi ness that the various industries are now doing requiring more fuel than in years past. In the natural gas territory the sup ply of gas Is not sufficient to furnish the mills with that fuel, and thi3 traffic bids fair to be heavy for months to come, as stocks of coal are considerably below the average quantity in store at early winter. Indianapolis lines are handling also large shipments of live stock, it being shipped to the markets, so high Is feed, and in mis cellaneous freights the movement is heavy, including lumber, hides, fertilizers, ma chinery and all products of iron and steel. In the natural gas belt territory the move ment of products of the various industries is large. All conditions . are favorable to the railroad interests, and the demands of shippers are for cars, the question of rates seldom, being mentioned except to ascer tain what they are on certain commodities. The following table shows the number of cars handled at this point for the week ended Dec. 7 and for the corresponding weeks of lyOO and 1S09: Name of Road. 1901. 1900.

The item published in the Journal a few days ago to the effect that the Pennsyl vania Is now loading box cars with 110.000 pounds of grain at Chicago has caused con siderable comment, and the question is asked, has the carload limit yet been reached? Twenty years have wrought a wonderful change in transportation meth ods. In the case mentioned several trains were made up with cars loaded with 110,000 pounds of freight and careful records were taken of the results, and it was demon strated that thirty cars containing llO.OoO pounds each can be as easily hauled as with the usual amount of freight. The modern car, with a capacity of 110,000 pounds, does not occupy any more space on a siding than the car of 1896, when the first expansion of the carload limit was under taken, 60,000 pounds of freight being con sidered the limit, but track and bridge con ditions have been so improved on standard lines that weight seems to cut little figure. Engines weighing 200,000 pounds are con sidered safe, and a car with 110,000 pounds of freight does not trespass at all on the limit of safety. The introduction of such heavy cars and the heavy load will enable the roads that use them to keep them at home. The Pennsylvania realizes this, and in anticipation has done all its work in the most substantial manner. The Lake Shore has done the same, and between Cleveland and Buffalo some of the strongest and most durable bridges in the world have been built. It is thought hardly probable that the Pennsylvania will allow these cars, after they become well limbered up. to carry more than 100,000 pounds of freight. Another Coal Itoad for Indianapoll. A surveying corps, said to be placed at work by the Walsh party, owning the Southern Indiana road, is in the field sur veying a line from Jasonvllle to Indian apolis. The new line will cross the Monon at Cloverdale and build direct over a line surveyed some years ago by parties who contemplated building a coal road. The statement has considerably disturbed the Pennsylvania people. It Is stated, as if built It will come into competition with the In dianapolis & Vlncennes, and will reach the best coal fields of Southwestern Indiana. Exceeded All Records. The Belt Road Company handled over the Belt road last week 21,193 cars, for the stockyards 2,073 carloads of live stock, and for private switches on its line 1,616 loaded cars, in the last two cases exceeding any previous record in any one week of traffic. Personal, Local nnd (ienernl Notes. On Dec. 1 the Northern Pacific discontin ued its north coast limited train service for the winter. The Wabash earned in the last week of November $59,945. a gain over the corre sponding week of ll-Xi of 

JTS.OIS. The Pennsylvania is working at Its shops in Fort Wayne full time, with the largest force in the history of the company. George M. McKinney has been appointed immigration agent for the Southern Pacific for Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and Michigan. The Lake Erie & Western and the Nickel plate will erect an interlocking plant at the crossings of the two lines at Fostorla. The Lake Erie & Western has prepared plans for a new pa?senger station at Find lay. ().. to be constructed of sandstone and tile. The Illinois Central announces it will re store the train known as the "Clipper," which was taken off early this year, to run between Fort Dodg and Sioux City. Chairman McLeod. of the Western Pas senger Association, is sending out copies of the antl-scalplng ordinance passed by the Common Council in Charleston, S. C. William Wickers, of the office of Assist ant General Passenger Agent Bronson, of the Big Four. will, on Dec. 15, go to Peoria as assistant ticket agent and telegrapher. II. W. Sparks. Northwestern passenger agent for the Big Four, is ill. and Travel ing Passenger Agent Lafollette. who repre sents the Big Four at Peoria, has had his territory added to his charge temporarily. Isaac Davis, traveling freight agent of the Chicago & Eastern Illinois, has received- notice that his services would not b? nteled after Jan. 1, owing to the action that the roads have taken on the pass question. W. H. Lewis, who for twenty years was ticket agent of the Missouri. Kansas & Texas at Parsons, Kan., died on Thursday of heart trouble, aged sixty-four. He was formerly connected with the Indianapolis Jc St. Ixniis Hallway. Having at last been given a franchise for the elevation of its tracks in Wilming ton. Del., th Pennsylvania Is enabled to proceed at once with this and other im provements. Including a new station at that point, the whole to cost S5.0oo.ou0. Notwithstanding the large additions to rolling stock of the Toledo. St. Iuls & Western road since Iresldent Norton took control, the company Is hhort of both cars and ilncomotives, and is now doing the largest business in the history of the road. The Baltimore & Ohio Southwestern has arranged for to-day a novel excursion from "initinatt to Washington and return. The train will leave Clnclnantl at 6:10 p. m.. and return Dec. 15. The rate is $50 for all expenses, including fares, board, Pullman service, etc. P. M. Arthur, of Cleveland. O.. grand chief of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, will leave to-day to present the demands of the engineers to James J. Hill, of the Great Northern. Certain changes in the schedule and wages are asked for by both firemen and engineers. Chicago rate clerks will meet on Wednes day night to perfect a plan for organiza tion. It is proposed that the rate clerks give a weekly dinner, at which some prom inent traffic officer will be present and de liver an address, the idea being to broaden the transportation knowledge of clerks. With the completion of the El Paso line the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific will have a route 222 miles shorter between Kan sas City and El Paso than any other line, and will save fifteen hours of time. The latter fact Is largely due to the favorable alignment and the grade of the new Rock Island line. Robert Kelley, general agent of the Wa bash lines, has made an arrangement with the Castle-square Opera Company to fur nish a special train for three months for the service of that company. The train will be composed of six baggage, one chair car and two sleeping cars, and will leave Buffalo on Dec. 22 for Chicago. Charles M. Davis, recently appointed commercial agent of the Toledo, St. Louis & Western at Kansas City, assumed the duties of the position on Thursday. Mr. Davis's rise has been rapid. In March, 1S99, he was a stenographer In the office of I L. Taffee; since January, 1901, has been traveling agent of the road. Conductors, enginemen and trainmen on the Lackawanna are now being Instructed in the handling of air brakes. A special car, fitted with appliances for Illustrating the use and application of these brakes, is being sent over the line, and every em Dlove In the train service is being given an opportunity to inform himself thoroughly as to their use. Since the Lake Shore took control of the Lake Erie & Western the improvement has been marked. From Sandusky to Peoria it is now laid for 175 miles of the distance with eighty-pound steel, nearly the entire roadbed has been ballasted with gravel and a system of general improve ments carried on which places it among the best roads crossing Indiana. Frank Myers, formerly agent at Rincon. N. M.. for the Santa Fe. has been appoint ed point agent for the Santa Fe and Santa Fe-Paciflc at Albuquerque, vice T. W. Page, promoted to the position of freight and passenger agent. W. II. Knight, for merly general agent of the Union Pacific at Chicago, has been appointed contract ing freight agent of the Santa Fe. P. P. Sawyer, agent of the Pennsylvania lines at this point, on Saturday received a letter, written with a typewriter, inclos ing $1. The writer simply said that he owed the company that much. On the same mail Andrew Wood, agent of the Big Four lines at thi.s point, received a letter inclosing $3, written in the same manner, no signature being made in either case. It is stated that within a short time the Toledo business of the Baltimore & Ohio will be handled over the Pennsylvania. The two roads connect at Tiffin, a distance of forty-three miles from Toledo, and with out inconveniencing the Toledo traffic of the B. & O. will be handled over the Penn sylvania. At present this business is handled by the Wabash, the C, II. & D. and the Hocking Valley almost exclusively. That Indianapolis is one of the most im portant points on the Pennsylvania line is shown In the fact that daily there de part from Indianapolis over the Indianap olis lines thirty-three Pennsylvania trains; this includes the Vandalia. Columbus comes next, where thirty-one passenger trains leave daily; Chicago next, with ten passenger trains dally. In each case the same number of passenger trains arrive per day. Ford Woods, assistant general freight agent of the Big Four, and general freight agent of the Peoria & Eastern, returned from Pittsburg yesterday. W. D. Holllday, the newly appointed assistant freight agent of the Wabash at Pittsburg, took charge on Thursday, and being a warm personal friend Mr. Wood arranged to be present at the opening. Mr. Holliday takes with him from the Big Four at St. Louis II. S. Bradley, who has been with him ten years. Good results are likely to come to In dianapolis through the proposition to cut off passes of traveling freight agents of foreign lines, as' their lines must have the heavy traffic which Indiana manufacturers furnish, and they will locate their men at this city and let them travel from this point rather than come in hre every other week or oftener. It is stated that two or three of the Northwestern lines are mak ing arrangements to open offices at In dianapolis. 

ADAM'S WATCH DOG. Ills Skelton Now Deiner Mounted nt the Peubody Museum. NEW HAVEN, Conn., Dec. 8. Adam's watch dog has been found. He Is in the department of geology at tho Feabody Museum, and dog fanciers are Invited to call and look him over. All there Is to him, however, Is his skeleton, but there is a great deal of that. Not so much, though, as there Is to his name. His name is "Dromocyon Vorax." Professor Beech er, curator of the department, Is putting the skeleton together and fitting the miss ing parts with artificial bones made of plaster. "Why did Adam name it Dromocyon Vorax?" some one asked Professor Beech er while he was stringing the vertebrae on a wire preparatory to casting. The professor looked his surprise and pity at the questioner. "Why," he repeated. "did you ask 'why?' Because It looked like a dromocyon vcrax, to be sure. What other reason could there have been? -"Why didn't Adam call it a dog?" "Because dogs had not been invented." The dromocyon vorax, or "dromo," as Eve probably called him. Is the ancestor of our common dog. He is larger than the canines that walk our streets and keep us awake nights with their barking. This one was found in 1S72 in the volcanic ashes of Henrj-'s fork, Bridgcr basin, Arizona, by J Hoisey. It came into the possession of Professor Marsh and has lain very quietly in the cellar of the museum ever ?ince. They just laid him on the iloor and put his name on top of him and he hasn t j-elped once. Recently he was taken out for mounting and with other specimens is be ing put together. SILENT P0HTICIANS. They Are Democrats, and of the Va riety Described ns 'Ornery," Starke County Republican. A Jackson township farmer told me that in the year which is nearing a close he will clean up something like $2,500. Other tillers of the soil have indicated that they have done exceedingly well this year also. and that when the year shall have been rounded out they will have a snug sum of money to their credit deposited with a bank. The crops in this country this year have been good, but good crops isn't all, as farmers know. In other years crops have been much greater than this. It's the demand in the markets which makes the husbandmen glad or sad. They are glad this blessed year, for their labors are being handsomely rewarded. .And. as we meander down the pike, we don't hear much politics on the breeze. These are the times when politicians are silent awed into that silence which backs them into a corner and shakes its fist in their facts. By the term "poli ticians" I mean simply ordinary ornery Democratic, like Jimmie Fletcher and Sam my tlorrell and Braddy CHazebrook. This artful trio is wisely silent these blessed days. They are not lifting up their voices in support of the Declaration of Independ ence and the Kansas City platform as they did in days gone by. They dasnen't do it: they simply dassen't. The people will not stand for it. but would pursue them with musty pumpkins and deceased cats if they attempted such a performance. The coun try is not at the mercy of the politician these days; neither dare the politician pur sue his usual avocation for fear of violence at the hands of his countrymen. Twice blessed are the American people, for the politician is not only out of effvee. but he has not the ground to stand upon to stir up a breeze. As a matter of common de cency, and in accordance with all laws re specting sanitation, the Democratic party ought to go out and bury itself. It looks bad and smells a whole lot worse. Honest, now, it does. TITLE INSURANCE is no experiment. It is demanded by the most conservative Investors. Do not make any investment In Heal Estate unless tho title Is guarantted by the INDIANA TITLE GUARANTY AND I)AN COMPANY. 129 East Market street LOCAL PRODUCE MARKET ACTIVE TRADE IN THE AVEEIv END ED OX SATURDAY, DEC. 7. Staple Groceries Strong, Except In Coffee nnd Sugar" Break In Lin seed Oil-Higher Prices for Ciraln. While trade In the week ended on Satur day, Dec. 7, was not as active as during November, it was, taken as a whole. In excess of the corresponding week in 1300, which was an unusually good one in. the volume of traffic. This year's trade would have been largely In excess of last year's but for the high range of prices, which, has led to a curtailment In the use of the more expensive articles that enter into general consumption. On Commission row the fall ing off in trade is most noticeable. Apples, oranges, bananas and, in fact, fruits of all kinds carry a high range of prices, al though oranges are becoming more plenti ful and cheaper. In the vegetable line high prices are the feature, Irish potatoes head ing the line. Leather is active with prices hardening, but quotably the same f-s a week ago. Staple groceries, coffees ex-cer'J-, are very firm. The sugar market carries an easier and unsettled tone, but not so marked as to affect prices on West ern markets In the dry goods line trade was fairly active and prices firm, except on American prints, which the manufac turers show a disposition to unload at re duced prices. The druggists are having a big trade on holiday goods and in general lines as well. Linseed oils have been re duced twice during the week and closed weak. Iron and steel are in strong position at unchanged prices. Provisions are active at the high range of prices which has .pre vailed for some time, due to the high figures at which hogs are selling. Flour is in strong position as are all cfreallne prod ucts. Eggs, poultry and choice butter are very firm at quotations and are fast movers. Coal is active at the advance of the early part of the week. The Indinnnpollfl drain Mnrket. The wheat market continues active and for oats there Is a strong demand at quo tations, but corn is more quiet, an Impres sion prevailing that prices on this cereal have been sprung too rapidly to be herlthy in character.
