MESSAGE. President Claveland's Final Reg ular Message to Congres3. A. Review of the Condition of Affairs as they Kxlst with Suggested Rem edies The People the Gov ernmeut's First Care. Washinqtox, Dec. 3. After the prelim inary proceedings in Congress to-day the President's annual message was received and read, in substance as follows: TO TUB CoNORKSSOP THE 

UNITED STATES As you assemble for the discharge of the du ties you have assumaU as the representatives of a free and generous people, your meeting is marked by an interesting und impressive inci deat. With thS expiration of the present ses sion of the Conprress the first century of our constitutional existence as a Nation will be completed. Our survival for one hundred years Is not suflleieni to assure us that we no longer have dangers to fear in the maintenance, with all Ha promised blessings, of a government founded upon the freedom of tho people. The time rather admonishes us to soberly rnquire whether in the past we have always closely kept In tho course of safety and whether we have before us a way plain and clear which leans to happiness and perpetuity. When the ex periment of our Government was undertaken the chart adopted for our guidance was the Constitution. Departure from the lines there laid down is failure. It is only by a strict adherence to the direction they indicate and by restraint within the limitations they tlx that we can furnish proof to the world of the American people's fitness for self-xovern-ment. Tbe equal anil exact justice ot which we boast as the underlying pnnciplo of our in stitutions should not be contincd to the rela tions of our c-.tizensto each other. Tho Govern ment itself is under bond to the American peo- Prfs'(lnt CUvfland. pie that in the exercise of its functions and powers it will ileal with the body of our citi KSiis in a manner scrupulously honest and fair and absolutely just. It has agreed that Ameri can citizei-ship shall be the only credential nec essary to justify the claim of equality before the law, and that no con dition In life shall give rise to discrimination in the treatment of the peo ple by their Government. The citizen of our Republic in its early days rigidly insist ed upon full compliance with the letter of this bond, and saw stretchinjr out before him a clear field for individual endeavor. His tribute to the support of his Government was meas ured by the cost of its economical mainte nance, and he was secure in the enjoyment of the recompense of his steady tribute and contonted in it. In those days the frugality of the people was stamped upon their Govern ment, and wus enforced by the free, thoughtful and Intelligent suffrage of the citizen. Combina tions, monopolies and aggregations of capital were either avoided or sternly regu'.atod and restrained. Tlio pomp and glittor of govern ments less free offered no temptation and pre sented no doluslon to tho plain people who. side by side in frienily competition, wrought for the ennoblernont and dignity of man, for tbe solution of the problem of free government and for tho achievement of the grand destiny awaiting the land which God had given them. private vs. public interests. A century has passed, our cities are the abid ing places of wealth and luxury; our manu factories yield fortune never dreamed of by the fathers of tho Republic; our business men are madly striving iu tho race for riches, and immense aggregations of capital outrun the imagination iu tbe magnitude of their un dertakings. We view with pride and satisfac tion this bright picture of our country's growth and prosperity, while only a closer scrutiny de velops a somber shading. Upon mora careful inspection we Mud the wealth and luxury of our cit.es mingled with poverty and wretched ness and uaremunerativo toil. A crowded and constantly increasing urban population sug gests the impoverishment of rural soi tious and discontent witU agricultural pursuits. The farmer's son, not satislied with his fathers simple aud laborious life, joins the eager chase for easily-acquired wealth. We discover that the fortunes realized by our manufacturers are no longer solely the reward of sturdy industry and enlightened foresight, but that they result from the discriminating favor of the Govern ment, ana are largely bunt upon un due exact. ons from the musses of our people. The gulf between the employer and tho employed is constantly widening, and classes are rapidly forming, one comprising the very rich and powerful, whde in another are found the toiling poor. While we view the achievements of aggregated capital, we discover the existence of trusts, combinations and mo nopolies, while the citizen is struggling far in tho real, or is trampled to death beneath an iron tied. Corporations which should be tho carefully-restrained creatures of the law and the servants of the people, are fast becoming the people's masters. Ht ll congratulating ourselves upon the wealth and prosperity of our country, and complacently contemplating every incident or change inseparable rrom inese conditions, it is our duty as patriotic citizens to inquire, at the present stage of our progress. how the bond of the Government made with the people has been kept an I performed. In stead of limiting tho tribute drawn from our citizens to the necessities of Its economical ad ministration, the Government still persists in exacting from the substance of the people millions which, unapplied, are useless and lie dormant in its treasury. This flagrant injustice and this breach of faith and obligation add ex tortion to the danger attending the diversion of the currency- of the country from the legit tinato channels of business. Under the same laws by which these results are produced the Govern ment permits many millions more to be added to the cost of living of our people, and to bo taken from our consumers, which unreasonably swell the profits of a small but powerful minority. The people must still be taxed for the support of tho Government under tho operation of tariff laws. Hut to the extent that the mass of our citizens are inordinately burdened beyond any useful public purpose and for the benefit of a favored few, the Government, under pretext of an exercise of its taxing power, enters gratuit ously into partnership with these favorites to their advantage and to the iurv of a vast majority of our people. This is riot equality be fore the law. The existing situation is in jurious to the health of our entire body politic. It stifles lu those for whose benefit it is per mitted all patriotic love of country and substi tutes in ius place selll.sh greed and grasping avarice. Devotion to American citizenship tor its own sake, and for what it should accomplish as a motive to our Nation's advancement and the happiness of all our people, is displaced by tho assumption that the Government, instead of being the embodiment of equality, is but an in striinientiilitv through which especial und Individual advantage are to tie gained The arrogance of this assumption Is unconcealed. It appears in the sordid dis regard of ll but personal Interests in the re fusal to abate for the benefit of others one iota of fpltish advantage, und in combinations to perpetuate surta advantages through efforts to c Mrol legislation and ImprojxTly influence the suffrages of th" people. The grievances of those not included within the circle of these beneficiaries, when fully realized, will surely arouse irritation and discontent. Our farm ers. long suffering and patient, struggling in the race of life with the hardest and most unremitting toil, will not fad to see, in spite of misrepresentations and misleading fallacies that they are obliged tr accept such p rices for their products as are fixed in foreign markets where thev compete with the farmers of the world: that their lauds are declining in value, while their debts increase, ant that without compensating favor they are forced bv the anion of tip Government to pay for the benefit of ethers surli enhanced prices fur the thimrs they need that the scanty returns of their latsir fail to tarnish their support, or leave no margin for accumulation. Our workmgmen. enfranchised from ail delu aion and no longer frightened b.- the cry that their wages arc i n lan-ered. 1 y a just revision of our tat'tiT l.iv.s, w.ll reasonably demand, through such division, steadier einoloy tnent, cheaper means of I ving in I he, r holm s. free dom for themselves and their children irum the aoiun of pcrpelmil servitude, unit nu op"0 deor to iidvam-einent bt yond the limits of a la bor ng class.

But the communism of combined wealth and capital. the outgrowth, of overweamng cupidity and selfishness, which insiduously under mines the justice and integrity of free Institutions, is not less dangerous than the commun'sm of oppressed poverty and toil which, exasperated by injustice and discontent, attacks with wild dis. rder the citadel of rule. He mocks the people wlio proposes that the Government shall, protect the rich and that they in turn will care for tne laooring poor. Any intermediary between the people and their Government, or the least delegation ol tne eare and protection our Government owes to tho humblest citizen in the land,makesthe boast ol free institutions a elittering delusion ana tne pretended boon of American citizenship s shameless imposition. 

TARIFF REVISION. A lust and sensible revision of our tariff laws should be made for the relief ot those of our countrymen who suffer under present condi tions, iiucn a revision snouiu receive wa sup port of all who love that justice and equality due to American citizenship: of all who realize that in this justice and equality our Govern ment finds its strength and its power to protect the cit zen and his property: of all who believe that the contented competence and comfort of many accord better with the spirit of our insti tutions than colossal fortunes unfairly gathered In the hands of a few; of all who appreciate that the forbearance and fraternity amons our people which recognize the value of every American interest, are the surest guaranty of c ur National progress, and of all who desire to see the products of American skill and In genuity In every market of the world with a re sulting restoration of American commerce. THE 

REVENUE. The necessity of the reduction of our revenue is so apparent us to be generally oonceded. But the means bv which this end shall be ac complished, and the sum of direct benefit which shall result to our citizens, present a controversey of the utmost importance. There should be no scheme accepted as satisiactory bv which the burdens of the peoplo are only apparently removed. Extravagant appropria tions of public money, with all their demoraliz ing consequences, should not bo tolerated, either as a means of relieving the treasury of its present surplus, or us furnishing pretexts for resisting a proper reduction in tariff rates. Kxisting evils aud injustice should be honestly recognized, boldly met and effectually remedied. There should be no cessation of the struggle until a plan is per fected, fair and conservative, toward existing industries, but which will reduce the cost to consumers of the necessaries of life, while It provides for our manufacturers the advantages of freer raw material and permits no injury to the interest of American labor. The cause for which the battle is waged is comprised within lines clearly and distinctly defined. It should never be compromised. It is the people's cause. It can not be denied that the selfish and private interests which are so persistently heard, when efforts are made to deal in a just and comprehensive manner with our tariff laws, are related to, if they arc not responsible for, the sentiment largely prevailing among the people that the general Government isthe fouutain of individ ual and private aid; that it may be expected to relieve with paternal care the distress of citizens and communities, and that from the fullness of its treasury It should, upon the slightest possible pretext of promoting the general good, apply public funds to the benefit of localities and individuals. Nor can It be denied that there is a growing assumption that, as against the Government and in favor of private claims and interests, the usual rules and limitations of business principles and just dealing 6hould be waived. These ideas have been unhappily much en couraged by Iftffislativejacquiescence. Relief from contracts made with the Government is too-easily accorded in favor of the citizen, as the failure to support claims against the Gov ernment by proof is often supplied by no bet ter consideration than tho wealth of the Gov ernment aud the poverty of the claimant. Gratuities In form of pensions are granted on no other rual ground than the needy condition of the applicant, or for reasons less valid; and large sums are expended for public buildings and other improvements upon representations scarcely claimed to be related to public needs and necessities. The extent to which the consideration of such matters subor dinate and postpone action upon subjects of great public importance, but involving no spe cial, private or partisan interest, should arrest attention aud lead t4-reformatlon. 

NEEDED LEGISLATION. A few of the numerous illustrations of this condition may be stated. The crowded condi tion of the calendar of the Supreme Court, and the delay to suitors and denial of justice result ing therefrom, has been strongly urged upon the attention of the Congress, with a plan for the reliet of the situation approved by those well able to judge of its merits. While this subject remains without effective consideration, many laws have been passed providing for the hold ing of terms of inferior courts at places to suit the convenience ot localities, or to lay tho foundation of an application for the erection of a new public building. Repeated recommendations have been sub mitted for the amendment and change of the laws relating to our public lands, so that their spoliation and diversion to other uses than as homes for honest settlers might be pre vented. While a measure to meet this con ceded necessity of reform remains awaiting the action of tho Congress, many claims to the lands and applications for their donation id favor of Stales and individuals have been al lowed. A plan in aid of Indian management recom mended by those well informed, as containing valuable features in furtherance of the solu tion of the Indian problem, has thus far failed of legislative sanction, while grants of doubt ful expediency to railroad corporations, per mitting them to pass through Indian reserva tions, have greatly multiplied. The propriety and necessity of the erection of one or more prisons for confinement of United States convicts, and a post-otlice building in the National capital, are not disputed. But these needs yet remain unanswered, wh le scores of public buildings have been erected where their necessity for public purposes is not apparc n l. A revision of our pension laws could easily be made, which would rest upon just principles and provide for every worthy applicant. Hut while our general pension laws remain con fused and imperfect, hundreds of private pension laws are annually passed, which are. the sources ot unjust discrimination and popu lar demoralization Appropriation bills for the support of the Government are defaced by items and piov.s.ons to me t private ends, and it is freely asserted by responsi ble and experienced parties that a bill appropriating money for public internal fin provement would fail to meet with favor unless it contained more for local and private advant age than for public benefit. These statements can be much emphasized by an ascertainment oflhe proportion of federal legislation which either bears upon its face its private character, or which, upon examination, develops such a mo tive power. And yet the people wait and expect from their chosen representatives such patriot ic action as will advanoe the welfare of the en tire country; and this expectation can only be answered by the performance of public duty with unseilish purpose. Our mission among the nations of the earth, and our success In ac complishing the work God has given the Amer ican people to do, require of those intrusted w th the making and execution of our laws per fect devotion, above all other things, tothe pub lic good. This devotion will lead us to strongly resist all Impatience of constitutional limita tions of Federal power, and to persistently check the increasing tendency to extend the scope of Federal legislation into the domain of State and local Jurisdiction, upon the plea of subserving the public welfare. The preserva tion of the partitions between proper subjects of Federal and local care and regulation is of such importance under the Constitution which is the law of our very existence that to consideration ot expediency or sentiment should tempt us to enter upon doubtful ground. We have undertaken to discover and proclaim the richest blessings of a free government, with the Constitution us our guide. Let us follow the way it points ont. It will not mislead us. And surely no one who has taken upon himself the solemn obligation to support and preserve the Constitution can find justification or solace for disloyalty in the excuse that he wandered and disobeyed in search of n better way to reach the public wel fare than the Constitution offered. nod Wh it tins been said is deemed not inappro priate at a time when, from a century's height, we view the way already trod by the American people, and attempt to discover their future path. The seventh President of the United States the soldier and statesman, and at all times the firm and brave friend of the people in vindication of his course as the protector of tho popular rights and the champion of true American citizen ship, declared: "The ambition which leads me on Is au anxious desire and a fixed determination to restore to the people un.mpa'red the sacred trust they have confided to my care, to heal the wounds of the Constitution and to prevent its vio lation : to persuade my countrymen, so far as I may. that ills not in a splen lid government, .support. d by powerful monopolies and aristo cratic establishments, that tliey will find hap piness or their lioerties protected, but. in a plum system, vo1.! of pomp, protecting all and granting favors to none, dispensing its bless ings hue t ie dew of Heaven, unseen and unfeit sae in the freshness ami beauty they con tribute Id produce.

BLOODY 'BIRMINGHAM. Latent Devrlopnic nil In the Hawes Itliirder An Outraged "Populace Demand Vengeance The Slieritnfa Posse Fire Into a Crowd of Citizen, Killing Nine and Wouudinj; Thirty Birmingham, Ala., Dec. 9. A few min aes after 12 o'clock this morning about 300 citizens Of Birmingham witnessed the most terrible tragedy the South, has knowa for years past. Kine men were killed- and thirty others wounded. Tbe past week has been a season of sensation in Birmingham. On Tuesday morning the body of May Hawes was taken from the waters of East Lake, and on Wednesday tbe remains were identified and the father was arrested, charged with the murder of bis -child. On Thursday aud Friday the coroner's inquest developed some very sensational facts, and lynching was freely talked of. Yes terday the dead body of Mrs. Hawes was fished out of the lake at Lakeview. As it lay upon the bauk, the crowd of CURIOUS AND INDIGNANT SPECTATORS wbich crowded around the lake was mo mentarily increased until it swelled into a surging multitude. The feeling of horror, indiguation and rage increased with each moment, until it threatened to become a frenzy. Men almost cried In tiie intensity of their excitement. Nothing approaching it has ever been witnessed in the .State. Tbe skull wns broken aud the head crushed fearfully. Heavy weights were attached to her neck, waist aud feet. Her skin had been wrinkled aud bleached by the water, and it is evident that she has been under water for several days. Her features had not been obliterated, however, and sh bas been identified! as Mrs. Hawes, wife of R. It. Hawes". (Shortly before the body of tbe woman was dragged from the lake, an other party, searching around tbe bouse, found secretly hid beneath the front door steps a tightly wrapped bundle of bloody clothes, about the dimensions o those worn by tbe youngest child. They were evi dently worn by the little oue when she was so cruelly murdered. The evidence against Hawes is complete. He killed his wife and two children aud married a young lady of Columbus, Miss., all within a week. Mrs. Hawes' body was taken from the lake ab,out noon yesterday. After that hour public indignation continued to increase intensely, until at midnight the crowd was mad with rage. At that hour 3W people had gathered around the jail. They were screaming and yelling like madmen, and all appeared anxious to make the attack, but NO LEADER DEVELOPED. The'SherifT bad drawu a dead line, and said that when cny body crossed that line he would give the guards in tho jail the command to lire. By degrees the crowd came nearer and nearer the line, and when they reached it they stopped. For some time no lurtbtr movement was made, and some of those in the rear of the mob com menced to depait. At this juncture, some drunken men who were in the front ranks of the mob, thoughtlessly, without intent, it is claimed, overstepped the dead line. The Sheriff shouted out to the mob that he would count five and when he had done so, unless the crow d bad retreated, he would OKDER THE GUARD TO FIRE. He counted five but the mob did not move. Then rang out the command "fire," and a perfect fusilade of leaden rain fol lowed aud no less than forty men fell to the ground, nine of them fatally wounded and many of the rest seriously so. The mob broke at once, its constituents sep arating in all directions. The dead and wounded were picked up and carried where the latler could be civen medical atten tion, at the drug stores, physicians' oiliees, at the hospital and undertaking rooms. Heart-rending scenes were witnessed. Strong men in the agonies of death groaned aloud, while skillful physicians did all that could be done to relieve their sufferings. Men who had just been roused from sleep by the news of the terrible affair crowded around operating chairs SEARCUIXG FOR FRIENDS or relatives. All night large crowds of peojde remained on the streets and talked of nothing but the terrible event of the evening. Alter the appeurance of the military at the jail and the removal of all the killed and wounded, tbe crowd which bad again assembled iu the vicinity began to disperse, but soon cougregated ugaiu at a point further dowu town. At 10 o'clock this morning the Second Alabama Regiment, composed of thirteen companies, reached the city, ami is com manded by Col. Thomas E. Jones. The presence of the soldiers seems only to AUGMENT THE K AGE of the mob. At 3 o'clock this afternoon about l.OOd men assembled two squares from the jail. Their ranks were rapidly swelling when the military marched in on the congregation and at the point of the bayonet dispersed them for the time. It is unders.ood that they ore again assem bling on the eastern outskirts ot the city late this evediug. A warrant was sworn out by some of the rioters charging Sheriff tSniith, Chief of Police Pit-kurd anil two lieutenants, John O diiiini and Joe JN'i.x, of the police force with murder. Tbo Coroner bas served the warrants. The officers are all in jail. A strong cordon of troops are around the prison and nil of tbe ttreets in that part of the city nre closely guarded by the mili tary. The mob appears to be more anx ious now TO SECUR'? THE SHERIFF and other officers than the wife and child murderer. The prisoner, Hawes, is the most composed and deliberate man in tho city. He claims to be innoceut, and sim ply smiles when he is told of the actions of tbo mob. He says be can prove Lis innocence. The following is a complete list of those killed: Maurice B. Throckmorton, postninsJtT of Hirmiuxhani, was shot in tho storaacu. Hedied within two hours. J. II. McCoy, a brickmason, was shot through the brain. A. B. Tarrant, a school-boy, was sbot in the back and killed instantly. W. A. Bird, a mechanic, was shot through the chestand died this nfternoon. Frank Cbilder, a merchant, was shot in tbe stomach ami killed instantly. An unknown negro was shot through the heart. A. 1. Brynnt, book-keeper, died tbft morning from a bullet in bis right shoulder. Charles Biiley, from Boston, was killed by a rifle bullet'throuh his stomach. "Brundon, the Deputy United States Marshal, was wounded in the thigh and stomach and died this afternoon. f.nter Information lias just reached tbe city that the mob is preparing to advance from the western limit. The military is pri pared for them, and an attack means great blocdsiied. Birmingham, Ala., T)ec. 10, 12:40 a.m. The reported mob in the westei n part of the city failed to materaliz. Everything appears calm and tranquil, and if the rioters are doing any work they are actiug very stealthily. m A Ooiiflasratlon With a Tragic Scqnel Ciiattanoooa, Tenn., Dec. 0. The little city of Dayton, Tenn., was visited by a fire this morning, which destroyed two cot tages. After the blaze bad ended some one, iu kicking around in the ashes, dis covered the charred remains of a woman, only the headless trunk remaining. Tbe body was finally identified as that of Mrs. Tom Uaun. She attended a ball the night before with her husband, and is thought to have been murdered, as bo bad msde threats agaiiist her, and is supposed to have fired the house to hide his crime.

TALMAGE'S SEK3I0N. An Eloquent Discourse on " The Fragrance of the Qo3pel." The Robes of Christ Redolent of Sweet and Lasting Perfumes that Pene trate the Innermost Recesses of the Christian Life. In a recent sermon at the Brooklyn Tabernacle Rev. T. De Witt Talmage took for his subject "The Fragrance of the Gospel." His text was : All Tny garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia out of the ivory palaces. Psalms xlv.. 8. Among the grand adornments of the City of Paris is the Church of Notre Dame, with its great towers, and elaborated rose windows, and sculpturing of the last judg ment; with its trumpeting angels and ris ing dead; its battlements of quarter foil; its sacristy, with ribbed ceiling and stat ues of saints. But there was nothing in all that building which more vividly ap pealed to my plain republican tastes than the costly vestments which laid in oaken presses robes that had been embroidered with gold and been worn by Popes and Archbishops on great occasions. There was a robe that had been worn by Pius VII. at the crowning of the first Napo leon. There was also a vestment that had been worn at the baptism of Napoleon II. As our guide opened the oaken presses and brought out these vestments of fabu lous cost and lifted them up, the fra grance of the pungent aromatics in which they had been preserved filled the place with a sweetness that was almost op pressive. Nothing that had been done in stone more vividly impressed me than these things that had been done in eloth, and embroidery, and perfume. But to-rday I open the drawer of this text, and I look upon the kingly robes of Christ, and as I lift them, flashing with eteirnal jewels, the whole house is filled with the aroma of these garments, which "smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of the ivory palaces." In my text the King steps forth. His robes rustle and blaze as he advances. His pomp, and power, and glory overmas ter the spectator. More brilliant is He than Queen Vashti, moving amid the Per sian Princes; than Marie Antoinette on the day when Louis XVI. put upon her the necklace of eight hundred diamonds ; than Anne Boleyn the day when Henry VIII. welcomed her to his palace; all beauty and all pomp forgotten, while we stand in the presence of this imperial glory. King of Zion, King of earth, King of Heaven, King forever ! His garments not worn out, not dust-bedraggled; but ra diant, and jeweled, and redolent. It seems as if they must have been pressed a hundred years amid the flowers of Heav en. The wardrobes from which they have been taken must have been sweet with clusters of camphire, and frankincense, and all manner of precious wood. Do you not inhale the odors? Ay, ay. They smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of the ivory palaces. Your first curiosity is to know why the robes of Christ are odorous with myrrh. This was a bright-leafed Abyssinian plant. It was trifoliated. The Greeks, Egyptians, Romans and Jews bought and. sold it at a high price. The first present that was ever given to Christ was a sprig of myrrh, thrown on His infant bed in Bethlehem, and the last gift that Christ ever had was myrrh pressed into the cup of His crucifixion. The natives would take a stone and bruise the tree, and then it would exude a gum that would saturate all the ground beneath. This gum was jsed for purposes of merchandise. One piece of it, no larger than a chestnut, would whelm a whole room with odors. It was put in closets, in chests, in drawers, in rooms, and its perfume adhered almost interminably to any thing that was any where near it. So when in my text I read that Christ's garments smell of myrrh, I immediately conclude the exquisite sweet ness of Jesus. I know that to many He is only like any historical person, another John Howard, another philanthropic Oberlin, another Confucius, a grand subject for painting, a heroic theme for a poem, a beautiful form for a statue, but to those who have heard His voice, and felt His pardon, and received His benediction, He is music, and light, and warmth, and thrill, and eternal fragrance. Sweet as a friend sticking to you when all else betray. Lifting you up while others try to push you down. Not eo much like morning glories, that bloom only when the sun is coming up, nor like "four o'clock's," that blcom only when tho sun is going down, but like myrrh, perpetually aromatic; the same morning, noon and night yesterday, to-day, for ever. It seems as if we can not wear Him out. We put on Him all our burdens, and afflict Him with our griefs, and set Him foremost in all our battles, and yet He is ready to lift, and to sympathize and to help. We have so imposed upon Him that one would think in eternal affront He would quit our soul; and yet to-day He ad dresses us with the same tenderness, dawns upon us with the same smile, pities us with the same compassion. There is no name like His for us. It is more imperial than Ciesar's, more musical than Beethoven's, more conquering than Charlemagne's, more eloquent than Cicero's. It throbs with all life. It weeps with all pathos. It groans with all pain. It stoop with all condescension. It breathes with all perfume. Who like Jesus to set a broken bone, to pity a home less orphan, to nurse a sick man, to take a prodigal back without any scolding, to illumine a cemetery all plowed with graves, to make a queen unto God out of the lost woman of the street, to catch the tears of human sorrow in a lachrymatory that shall never be broken? Who has such, an eye to ste our need, such a lip to kiss away our Morrow, such a hand to snatch us out of tbe fire, such a foot to trample our enemieu, such a heart to embrace all our necessities? I struggle for some metaphor with which to express Him. He is not like the bursting forth of a full orchestra; that is too loud. He is ot like the sea when la-shed to rage by the tempest; that is too boisterous. He is not like the mountain, its brow wreathed with the lightnings; that is too solitary. Giv m a softer type, a gentler comparison. We have seemed to see Him with our eyes, and to hear Him with our ears, and to touch Him with our hand. Oh, that to-day He might appear to some one of our fiva senses! Ay, tbe nostril ishall discover His presence. Ho comes upon us like spice gales from Heaven. Yea, His garments smell of pungent, last ing and all-pervasive myrrb. Oh, that you all knew His sweetness. How soon you would turn from your novels. If the philosopher leaped out of his bath in a frenzy of joy, and clapped his hands, and rushed through the streets, because be bad found the solution or a mathematical problem, how will you feel leaping from the fountain of a .Saviour's mercy and pardon, washed clean, and made white as snow, when the question has been solved: "How ran my noul be saved?" Naked, frost-bitten, i-dorm-lashed Mal, b-t Jesus this hour throw around thee the '"garments that t.rnell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of the ivory places. " Your sec ond curiosity is to know why the robes of Jesus are odorous with aloes There is some diiTereuo of opinion about whwe these uloes grow, what is the color of tbe flower, what i.i tfca partu uljr ap year&nce of the beib, KuttHe it foe you and tne to l:uow ttil ulon tc au i biMtr- j:es the world over, and when Christ comes with .armeut bte-rmg that partic ular odor, they suggest to me the bitter ness of a Saviour's sufferings. Were there ever such nights as Jesus lived through nights on the mountains, nights on the sea, nights In the desert? Whoever had such a hard reception as Jesus had? A hostelry the first, an unjust trial in oyer and terminer another, a foul mouthed, yelling mob the last. Was there a space on His back as wide as your two fingers where he was not whipped? Was there a space on His brow an inch square where He was not cut of the briars? When the spike struck at the instep, did it not go clear through to the hollow of the foot? Oh, long, deep, bitter pilgrimage. Aloes ! Aloes t John leaned his head on Christ, but who did Christ lean on? Five thousand men fed by the Saviour; who fed Jesus? The sympathy of a Saviour's heart going out to the leper and the adulteress ; but who soothed Christ? Denied both cradle and death-bed, He had a fit place neither to be born or to die. A poor babe! A poor lad ! A poor young man ! Not so much as a taper to cheer His dying hours. Even the candle of the sun snuffed out. Oh, was it not all aloes? All our sins, sorrows, bereavements, losses, and all the agonies of earth and hell picked np as in one clus ter and squeezed into one cup, and that pressed to His lips until the acrid, nauseat ing, bitter draught was swallowed with a distorted countenance, and a shudder from head to foot, and a gurgling strangulation. Aloes! aloes! nothing but aloes. All this for Himself? All this to get the fame in the world of being a martyr? All this in a spirit ef stubborn ness because He did not like Ciesar? No! no ! All this because He wanted to pluck you and me from hell. Because He want ed to raise you and me to Heaven. Be cause we were lost and He wanted us found. Because we were blind and He wanted us to see. Because we were serfs and He wanted us manumitted. Oh, ye in whose cup of life the saccharine has pre dominated; oh, ye who have had bright and sparkling beverages, how do you feel toward Him who in your stead, and to purchase your disenthralment, took the aloes, the unsavory aloes, the bitter aloes? Your third curiosity is to know why these garments of Christ are odorous with cassia. This was a plant that grew in In dia and the adjoining islands. You do not care to hear what kind of a flower it had or what kind of a stalk. It is enough for me to tell you that it was used medicinal ly. In that land and in that age, where they knew little about pharmacy, cassia was used to arrest many forms of disease. So, when in my text we find Christ coming with garments that smell of cassia, it sug gests to me the healing and curative power of the Son of God. "Oh," you say, "now you have a superfluous idea. We are not sick. Why do we want cassia? We are athletic. Our respiration is perfect. Our limbs are lithe, and In theso cool days we feel that we could bound like the roe." I beg to differ, my brotber, from you. None of you can be better in physical health than I am, and yet I must say we are all sick. I have taken the diagnosis of your case, and have examined all the best au thorities on the subject, and I have come now to tell you that you are full of wounds, and bruises, and putrefying sores which have not yet been bound up, or mollified with ointment. The marasmus of sin is on us the palsy, the dropsy, the leprosy. The man that is expiring to-nignt on Ful ton street the allopathic and homceo pathic doctors having given him up, and his friends now standing around to take his last words is no more certainly dying as to his body than you are dying, unless we have taken the medicine from God's apothecary. All the leaves of this Bible are only so many prescriptions from the Divine physician, written, not in Latin, like the prescriptions of earthly physi cians, but written in plain English, so that a man, though a fool, may not err therein. Thank God that the Saviour's gar ments smell of cassia. Suppose a man were sick, and there was a phial on his mantelpiece with medicine he knew would cure him, and he refused to take it, what would you say to him? He is a suicide. Aud what do you say of him who, sick in sin, has the healing medi cine of God's grace offered to him, and re fuses to take it? If he dies he is a suicide. People talk as though Ood took a man and led him out to darkness and death as though He brought him up to the cliffs and then pushed him off. Oh, no. When a man is lost it is not because God pushes him off; it is because he jumps off. In the olden times a suicide was buried at the crossroads, and the people were ac customed to throw stones upon his grave. So it seems to me, there may be in this house a man who is destroying his own soul, and as though the angels of God were here to bury him at the point where the roads of life and death cross each other, throwingupon tbe grave the broken law and a great pile of misapproved priv ilege, so that those going may look at the fearful mound, and learn what a suicide it is when an immortal soul, for which Jesus died, puts itself out of the way. When Christ trod this planet with foot f flesh, the people rushed after Him people who were sick, and those who, being so sick they could not walk, were brought by their friends. Here I see a mother holding up her little child, and saying: "Cure this croup, Iord Jesus; cure this scarlet fever." And others say ing: "Cure this ophthalmia. (Jive ease and rest to this spinal distress. Straighten this club-foot." Chris-t made every house where He stopped a dispensary. I do not believe that in the nineteen centuries that have gone by since His heart lias got hard. I feel that we can come now with all our wounds of soul and jjet His benediction. O Jesus, here we are. We want healing. We want sight. We want health. We want life. The whole need not a physician, but they that are sick. Blessed bo God that Jesus Christ comes through this assemblage now, His "gar ments smelling of myrrh" that means fragance "and aloes" they mean bitter sacrificial memories "and cassia" that means medicine and cure ; and according to my text. He comes "out of the ivory palaces." You know, or if you do not know I will tell you now, that some of tbe palaces of the olden time were adorned with ivory. Ahab and Solomon had their homes fur nished with it. The tusks of African and Asiatic elephants were twisted into all manners of shapes, and there were stairs of ivory and chairs of ivory and tables of ivory and floors of ivory and pillars of ivory and windows of ivory, and fountains that dropped into basins of ivory, and rooms that had ceilings of ivory. Oh, white and overmastering beauty! Green tree branches sweeping the white curbs. Tapestry trailing the Hupwy floors. Brack ets of light flashing on the lustrous sur roundings. Silvery music rippling to the beach of the arches. The mere thought of it almost stuns my brain, and you say: "Oh, if I could only have walked over such floors! If I could have thrown my self in such a chair! If I could have heard the drip and dash of those fountains:" You shall have something better than that if you only let Christ introduce you. From that place He came, and to that place He proposes to trenport you. for His "garments smell of myrrh and aloes and c-assia out of ivory palaces." OU, what a pbve Heaven must be! The Tui'eries of the French, the Windsor Castle of the English, tbeSpauUb Alham bra, tbe Kussiau Kremlin, dungfons com pared with it! Not so many-a-tles on fcitber ide the Rhine as ou both m.W of tbe liver of God, tl.e ivwry paU.. One for th arijfe, Ju.tfn raJdy bt Vt.t, itiv,'" fii, liie-rjr.l; t.:7iipi -.:-i !jji loted: ou for fhe martyrs, '!;ii blood-ic 1 robes, fi-iii uilvr tbe alUr; oae Te the Kiug, t'.e steps of His palace, the crowns of the church militant ; one for the singers, who lead the one hundred and forty and four thousand; one for you ransomed from sin; one for me, plucked from the burn ing. Oh, tae ivory palaces! To-day it seems to me as if the windows of those palaces were illumined for some great victory, and I look and see climbing the 6tair oil ivory aud walking on floors of ivory, and looking from windows of ivory, some whoji we knew and loved on earth. Yes, I know them. They are father and mother, net eighty-two atrd seventy-nine years, as when they left us, but blithe and young as when on their marriage day, and there are brothers and sisters, merrier than when we used to romp across the meadows together. The cough gone. The cancer cured. The erysipelas healed. The heartbreak over. Oh, how fair they are in the ivory palaces! And your dear little children that went out from you Christ did not let one of thejn drop as He lifted them. He did not wrench one of them from you. No. They went as from one they loved well to One whom they loved better. If I should take your little child and press its soft face against my rough cheek, I might koep it a little while; but when you the mother, came along it would struggle to go with you. And so you stood holding your dying child when Jesus passed by in the room, and the little one sprang out to greet Him. That is all. Your Christian dead did not go down into the dust and the gravel and mud. Though it rained all that funeral day, and the water came up to tho wheel's hub as you drove out to the cemetery, it made no difference tot them, for they stepped from the home here to the horoa there, right into the ivory palaces. All 1 well with them. All is well. It is not a dead weight that you lift when you carry a Christian out. Jesus makes the bed up soft with velvet promises, and He says: "Put her down here very gently. Put that head, which will never ache again, on this pillow of hallelujahs. Ben"! up word that the procession is comintf. Ring the bells. Ring! Open your gates, ye ivory palaces !" And so your loved ones are there. They are just as certain ly there, having died in Jesus, as that yon are here. There is only one thing more they want. Indeed, there is one thing ia Heaven they have not got. They want it; what is it? Your company. But, oh, my brother, unless you change your track you can not reach that harbor. You might M well take tho Baltimore & Ohio railroad, expecting ia that-direction to reach Toron to, as to go on in the way some of you af going, and yet you expect to reach th ivory palaces. Your loved ones are, looking out of the windows of Hoavea now, aud yet you scorn to turn your bad upen them. You do not seem to kno' the sound of their voices as well as yon used to, or to.be moved by the sight oi the:ir dear faces. Call louder, ye de parted ones. Call louder from the ivory palaces. When I think of that place, auo think of my entering it, I feel awkward; I feel as sometimes when I have been ex posed to the weather, and my shoes have been bemired, and my coat is soiled, aad my hair is disheveled, and I stop in front of some fine residence where I have an errand. I feel not fit to go in as I am and sit among polished guests. Bo some of us feel about Heaven. We need to bo washed, we need to be rehabilitated before we go into the ivory palaces. Eternal God, lct the surges of Thy pardoning mercy roll over us. I want not only to wash njy hands and my feet, but, like some skilled diver standing on the pierhead, who leaps into the wave aud comes up at a far-distant point from where he went in, so I want to go down and so I want to come up. Oh, Jesus, wash me in the waves ot Thy salvation. And here I ask you to solve a mystery that has been oppressing me for thirty years. I have asked of doctors of divinity who have been studying theology half a century, and they have given me no satis factory answer. I have turned over all the books in my library, but got no solu tion to the question, aud to-day I come and ask you for an explanation. By what logic was Christ induced to exchauge tho ivory palaces of Heaven for tho crucifix ion agonies of earth? I shall take the first thousand million years in Heaven to study out that problem. Meanwhile and now, taking it as the tenderest and might iest of all facts that Christ did come, that He came with spikes in His feet, catne with thorns in His brow, came with spears in His heart, to save you and to save me. "God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Hon, that whosoever be lieveth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life." O, Christ, whelm this audience with Thy compassion. Mow them down like summer graiu with the harvesting sickle of Thy grace. Ride through to-day the conqueror, Thy gar ments smelling "of murrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of the ivory palaces." O, sinner, fling every thing else awny and take Christ! Take Him now, not to morrow. During the night following this very day there may be an excitement in your dwelling, and a tremulous pouring out of drops from an unsteady aud af frighted hand, and before to-morrow morning your chance may be gone.
