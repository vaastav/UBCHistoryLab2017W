FRIDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1000 President Roosevelt's message to Congress contained 25,000 words. Secretary Shaw is planning to make paper money smaller. He needn't do it on our account, as our "roll" is small enough now. Gobblers that survived Thanks giving day are hoping people meant it who said they ate so much turkey that they never wanted to see one again. "Farmer robbed of $1,000 in gold" is the. headline in a news paper. Farmers are about the only class of people who could be robbed of that amount, because most of us haven't got that much. In an annual report given by the commissioner of Indian affairs, it is stated congress has never passed laws of such vital importance to the Indians as did the last session of that body. An attempt will be made to promoto the culture of sugar beets among tho Indians thereby rcndorlng them free nnd independent citizens. 231 Tho railroads of tho ontlro coun try are entering upon an era of rigid economy. Plans as now ma tured will' decrease tho expendi tures from eighty to a hundred and twenty million dollars below what it was last year. Increased cost of labor, scarcity of materials, and an increased difllculty in securing capital with which to carry on im provements and extensions arc some of tho principal causes for this retrenchment. The girls employed in a porce lain factory in Now Jersey went out on strike the other day be cause the manager ordered that they must no longer sing at their work. They had been in tho hab bit of amusing themselves by singing popular songs, hymns and Sunday school music, but they may do that no more. Rather than keep silent they stopped work. It cannot be that the man ager was married, else he would havo known what result to expuct from such an order. It Is said that an act is to be in troduced in the Missouri legisla ture forbidding tho issuance of marriago licenses to persons with out visiblo means of support and to those afflicted with incurable diseases. At a recent election held in Indian Territory and Oklahoma, for the purpose of selecting dele gates to a convention to frame a constitution for the new state of Oklahoma, Indian Territory reg istered 101,000 votes as against 94,000 for Oklahoma. The tuberculosis congress which has been in session in New York, is agitating the question of State sanltorium for consumptives. One of the eminent physicians present at the meeting said that if another man as crazy on tho subject as Mr. Carnegie is on the subject of libraries, could be found, much might bo accomplished. It is stated that a new kind of alfalfa which will grow in the arid lands of the northwest where the "winters are bitter cold, has been found by a South Dekota scientist. The new grain is native to Siberia and grows well where the mercury ialls to 40 degrees below zero. The Department of Agriculture will give it a thorough test in the near future. Doctor Forbes Winslow, an alienist, has been quoted as say ing that before long there will be more lunatics in the world than sane people. He has been mis quoted of course. What he said was that if insanity continues to increase at tho rate shown by sta tistics the insane will sometime outnumber the sane. It all de pends on tho "if." Wo need not despair. It is said that tho more thorough inspection of meats will cost tho government 5,000,000, thus ex ceeding tho estimate by two mil -lions. Where the health of the people is concerned the expendi ture of money does not count. The recent snows have made the rabbits keep to shelter. In one day seventy-five hunter's licenses were issued by the clerk of Wyan dott county, Kan.

WHY HE LAUGHED. Something of the New Alco-Fuel. There is no question but that the removal of the duty from dena tured alcohol was one of tho most important measures of tho last ses sion of congress. Indeed, it was so designated by President Roose velt in a recent address, he plac ing the passage of this bill among the four acts of supreme impor tance to the country. To the farmer the increased use of this product as a fuel is of two fold significance first, as to its manufacture, which calls for pro ducts of the farm, it being distilled from the potato, from the corn, etc, and because of its promised use fulness as a motor force in the propelling of machinery. Thcro is little doubt that this alco-fuel, as it is called, will ere long supplant tho more expensive gasoline and kerosene. The fact that it is to bo furnished at small cost wllf lead to tho invention of all kinds of apparatus for its ubo. Indeed, there 'is .already con siderably activity iu this direc tion and it has been given out at Washington that tho departmcot of agriculture will make an exhibit at the Jamestown Exposition next year of the new aloo-fuel and its ubos that will bo most gratifying to those Interested in the country's progress. It will bo shown as the motor power in the running of. both household and farm' machinery and fortunate will be those who can attend the. great fair that is projected and see and study, the product under auspices so avor- tV-,JJ'a.iTf'v.vi-fJ,'.il' A college girl was copying an in scription one day in the British museum when two young women entered. Looking at the rosetta stone, one of them said, "What is this? R-o-s-o-t-t-a rosetta stone." Then leaning down to it, she cau tiously sniil'cd at it several times, and, lifting her head, said to her companion, "Why, it does have a peculiar fragrance like a rose."

TEA DRINKING IN INDIA. The question of drinking tea was practically unknown among natives up to 12 years ago. Government servants were the first to take it up, and it is at present principally used in this class. Gradually its use ex tended to village landlords, and even to the more well-to-do cultivators and village officers, especially within the last three years, the example of railway irrigation employes having materially assisted its introduction. Some castes have a special liking for it and drink it even three or four times a day. UNPRECr.
