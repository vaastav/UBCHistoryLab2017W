He la wanted in Portland for obtain 3ni money under The Prime Evil Of Modern Civilization Overeating and lack of proper exer cise is the prime evil of our modern civilization. People are too apt to gorge themselves with food. The business man who sits all day In his office, or the woman who takes little invigorating outdoor exercise eats as much as a day laborer. The extra amount of food they take lies heavy and soggy on the stomach. It makes a person feel sluggish and tired; one is droopy, half-sick and exhausted all the time. The stom ach gets clogged, won't work, and the fermenting food forms gasses, poisons th blood, and causes scores of minor ocmplaints, all resulting from one central fault stomach trouble. We can't cure any disease by doc toring the spot wher It hurts. We've pot to go to' the root of the trouble and remove the cause. Doctor Na ture is the best physician. Give him a ciianc arid a helping hand and he'll confound all specialists in the world with results. American folk are too prone to use drugs for quick relief every time they feel an ache or pain. This is only temporary treatment, and Is very bad for the system generally. If persisted in it will lead to scores of complaints and even serious illness that might have been avoided. Take the common complaint of con stipation every one knows, or should know, that each dose of a cathartic gives relief only for the time being, and that in reality it aggravates the trouble. People who take cathahtics continually in order to move their bowels become chronically constipat ed and finally their bowels will be come literally paralyzed. It Is the same with stomach trou ble, or headaches, or dizziness, or kidney and liver disorders. When a person has gas on the stomach, or pains after eating, he takes a pepsin laoiet, Blear Donate of soda, charcoal or what not; or, if it is a hadache, a headache powder, and so on. The use of drugs in this manner does not cure, but temporarily re lieves, and the patient Is in a worse condition as soon as the acute part of the attack is over. The reason that the Cooper reme dies have so much success in making sick people into well people is that the treatment makes Doctor Nature do the real work. It is a stomach medicine, and Its only function is to restore the stomach to a normal con dition. The treatment is slow it doesn't cure in half an hour, nor in two days but It tones up the sys tem, and then Doctor Nature takes' hold and all other diseases disap pear. The medicine banishes constipa tion because it is mildly laxative and removes the cause stomach trouble. It ends pain in the stomach and gas belching because it drives away the catarrhal inflammation which has caused all the trouble. It stops headT ache, dizziness, improves digestion and the eyesight, and makes away with kidney and liver trouble because It puts the body in a healthy condi tion, and there is no longer cause for any disease. The Cooper remedies may be ob tained at J. C. Perry's Drug Store. o . Election and Installation Hod son Council No. 1, R. & S.
