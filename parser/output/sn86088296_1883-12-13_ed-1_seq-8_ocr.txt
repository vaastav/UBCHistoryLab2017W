KurcBLicAN organs predict a big laid on the federal treasury, en gineered by the Democratic majority la the House. Democratic majorities have heretofore protected the treasury Irom the cormorants who control leg islation under Republican majorities, und they will do so again. The sav ing measures of this Democratic ma jority will please the people, and win support fc -1884. The decision of the supreme court of Georgia that cotton future notes aire void, and that dealing in futures is simply gambling, is unquestionably in the interest of public morals and sound business. A good authority estimates that the South loses not less than 530,000,000 yearly in this form of .peculation, and whatever may be the Bum. it is as fruitlessly wasted to the Southern people as though it were thrown away. The widow Hoar has rushed fran tically to the front in the interest of Woody-shirtism, and has introduced a bill in the Senate providing for in crease in federal machinery at elec tions. About the best thing for the Senate to do, probably, is to let her have rope. Tho Northern people, as well as those of tho South, will be found ready to protest vigorously against their ballots being deposited under the surveilance of armed min ions of the party in power. s ssssssss mtttmrn To enow the feasibility of a dam to raise the water of the Colorado to a level that it may be used lor manu factories on. the river bank in the low est portion of the city, it may be stated that a dam fifty-eight feet high is now being constructed in Brazil. To dam the Colorado river for manu facturing purposes at Austin, would require only an ordniary dam, since it -would be raised some distance np the river, the water being conveyed by canal to the points for manufacture. It would be worth millions to Austin. The Drover's Journal suggests as st tax on incomes the following schedule: On all incomes of $10,000, 3 per cent. . On all incomes of 20,000, 4 per cent. On foO.OOO incomes, 5 per cent. On 8i00,000 incomes, 10 per cent. On $200,000 incomes, 20 per cent. On $3003)0 incomes, 30 per cent. On 400,000 incomes, 40 per cent. On 500,000 Incomes, 50 per cent. On all incomes above $500,000 a year, 95 per cent. Under such a law, it is claimed, the pvil tendency of a few men after a while owning the entire country would be prevented. v ' . Heke is the way the Salt Lake News, organ of Mormonisni, regards the questions raised oa the existence of polygamy: "The president's message will be hailed by the hireling clergy with ' pleasure, and receive certain amount of popular support. It is not shown inwhatwiy the destruction of our -local government would affect the -question of polygamy. The plural marriages of Mormons are not recog nized bv the territorial laws and could not be dissolved by the commissioners' lict, armie". or earthly power. They ureecclesiaitfi 1, perpetual and eternal until the Moiiuons become recreant tit their faith with high heaven. Those- unions will be recognized by the Almighty Being who published ihm lor the benetit of His people's iu"lnes3 and His glory. The president's remarks on Utah polygamy do not add force to his mes tsage noi." credit to hia statesmanship. They are sop to the bigots and breath tu the flame of popular passion. It is loubtful if it will have a practical hearing on Cocgrce?, and certainly will create no commotion among the tiod-fearing people of Utah." ' As reported in our department re ports, the .governor entertains the opinion, that there can be no question s;s to tho validity of the Gibson certi ficates, which were lrgally issued ac cording to the mandatory provisions of the law. This would make the :laim of the Galveston syndicate good a-i to the alternate sections, but it is jnstioru.ble whether they could sub utitate their claim for the fifty cents lands under subsequent tiles covering the entire territory previously covered alternately. The la wdioldingau perma nent all locations of school sectloo?, whether under valid or invalid certifi cates, applying m this case, would leave the state lands, amounting la value to nearly a million of dollars. If the original claims be recognized, and not that under tho fifty cents law the syndicate will secure lands worth nearly a million dollars, while the state will secure the same. The deci sion of the land board upon the valid ity of the second claim is therefore an important question in which the state has a large share of interest The Times-Democrat should stuJy the political history of Tex H more thoroughly before it cites points, al- lnjrryl to bs connected with it. to strengthen an argument applicable io a federal political question, it sajs. The nrtsent constitution ot lexas moke3 many important changes in its land system. IJy the terms ot its ad mission into me i nion, xexas re served to itseli its utire public do main, amounting to nearly lau.wu.uuu acres. This was usea 10 ueveiop me stiit.A :tnri increase its wealth and pop ulation. All immigrants were granieu innie.4teads: railroads were Riven so in-iTiv thousand acres for every nine of road built, and land wa3 voted lib erally for every public purpose. J.ne people of Texas awoke a short time Atrn to the fact that the state had very nearly exnausitu its puuuc uumuiu, and that there was very little land left for a school fund, unless some less ex travagant system was adopted. This whs done in the new constitu Hn Thn old law. which allowed every immigrant to enter 160 acres of land as a homestead, was abolished, as this land generally fell into the hands of speculators, and Texas was too great a state, holding out too many inducements to emigrants to ncwi offer this additional bonus. As to the railroads, they also, it was urged, would build, whether they re ceived land from the state for doing so or not. Hence, the usel ssness of hi tionat.ion. These ideas are incor- rwimtwi in the new constitution of Texas, which sets aside the public lands of that state for certain specified purposes, fixing the minimum price at which it is to be sold three times as high as previously. The wisdom of these changes is shown in the fact that Texas has received more emigrants, hnilh more miles of railroad ana in- creased its wealth more under the new system that it ever did in the same nr.rinrt of time under the old plan of giving bonuses. The commissioner of t.h trpneral land office urires the fed eral crovernment to attempt similar avstpm in regard id the public domain it. him been even more reckless than Texas. While its donations of lands have done much in the way of settling thecountrv. buildini railroads, etc, millions of acres have been thrown away, and the public domain has at, own so small that it is well no w to become more economical. The railwavs were not denied the acuuision of lands under the new con stitution, which went into effect m 187(5. Since then the treat reserva tion made to the Texa3 & 1'acitic rail way company was kept in force by leg islative enactment, and it was kept alive until the road was built, uniting in "Western Texas with the S uithern Pnciiie. The International, by fail ure to build on time, forfeited its original charter many years ago. Other railways took outjeharters, sintothe adoption of the new constitution, un der the general incorporation law, and all who applied for land certificates the time of the repeal by the legisla ture in special session, in 1882, were granted them. These certificates called for land from the unappropri ated ilomain. and issuance of certi ficates were not stopped until the called legislature passed the law re quiring non-issuanee. Kailway cer tificates, now outstanding, are erood when unappropriated land may be found upon which to locate them. Upon the repeal of the law crantinjr certificates to railways, railroad building in Texas was retarded, but the law was repealed because the public domain was known to be about exhausted. The scarcity of the public lands, even prior to the repeal of the law caused many companies to not apply for cer tificates under the general incorpora" tion law. Were lands now being granted for railway building, more lines than ever would be under con struction. The lands granted to rail ways were given, not only to secure the construction of railways, but th6 grants were beneGcial to the school fund. The grants were in alternate sections, every other section being surveyed and marked for the school fund. The granting of land3 to the roiiumva hav thus see.nred Texas railways and a sectionized sys em of school lands, which adds greatly to the. latter's value. Anything done by the railway companies for the benefit of their land3 inures to the benefit of the school lands. It is useless to say the granting of lands for railway building does not and would not secure tne construction of roads. The only thing which has given life to railway instruction i.i Mexico has been her public grants to railway coiupauies. The St. L'.uiis It-publican calls attention to a falacy. In his recent report the secretary of thfl treasury goes back t went i -three years to lax- down the very doubtful proposiilioni "first, that "the civil war could net have been carried on and brought to a desirable result bud not the bonds of the United States b vn issnKd an.! found acceptance with iiii.-i.tjtd una; and, second, that they would not have found that acceptance had it not been or the lead and the effort of the national banks." Even if this were true, says the Bepnblican, there is no rted of dinning it for'eyer Jn the ears of the people. The people owe the result of the ciyil war to their own efforts, not to banks and moneyed men; and this persistent attempt to manufacture a debt of giatitude from the country to the banks and capital ists for the fervid patriotism of buy ing United States bonds at 35 cents on the dollar and selling them at 100, is unmitigated tomfoolery. National nanks and moneyed men who dealt in United States bonds have been better paid thrice better paid for what they did in the civil war than any other class of citizens. They have received from the government special favors and Tirivileires. worth, from first to last, not less than $1,000,000,000. The national banking system exits for the good of the country, not for the bene tit of the bankers as these Republican officials appear te imagine. The Centennnial Cotton Exposi tion, about which so much fuss is be ing, made, is to be held at New Orleans In December, 1884. The Cot ton Planters' Association of America began to agitate the subject about a yeaf ago, and it was decided to fix the expositloa for the time and place named. The first bale of American cotton ever exported was shipped to England in 1784, hence the signifi cance in having such exhibition next year. But the Idea has since grown into a world's fair projsct, on a larger scale than was even the Philadelphia exhibition in 1876. The main build ing, as determined by the directors, will coyer an area of one million souare feet, or 15 per cent mora than was occupied by tho principal struct ure at Philadelphia, and, although jt is yet too early to say aecniteiy whether th project will be generally nZr aiiffh t Insure a brilliant popular eaougnte wgare a Druiiant popular euuvgu - """"" ' success, on the elaborate plan cpntem- Dlated.lt is certain that throughout the cotton erowintr 3tateS a most de cided interest is felt in the undertak ing. It is a private enterprise, and is to te under privata management, but public sup;ort is asked from many of the states, among them Texas, which might give, were not a constitutional provision jn the w; oi compliance. "What does this new proposed ap plication for the right of way alon :nnrre3.i Avenu?. for a railway to transport freight for the ue o tne capitol syndicate, mean? An em (3 - ployee of the syndicate is engaged in circulating a petition i:i favor of the grant, and it is said some of the alder- nun have signed it. the syn dicate has already been granted right of way for a rail way to the site of the new capi tal, and the grading and bridging along the line granted has already been finished, and the roud bed is now leady for the iron. Therefore just as thi3 juncture immediately in advance of the contemplated iini3hing of this railway, why a petition should be cir culating In favor of a freight railway along Congress Avenue Is hard to understand. The only solution that may be saieiy arriveu at is, that there is some sort of pure cussedness at the bottom of it. There must be some ulterior ob ject to be gained in the acquirement of this route. This was quite appa rent before, and the renewed effort proves it. Certain aldermen, it is said, signed the petition; now let enough more of them do it. and then pass an ordinance, granting the right of way along Congress Avenue, and the entire revenue of the city will have to be expended in paying armed men to en force the measure. There will be war in Austin when such a day comes, The business men of the Avenue will protect themselves, if forced to do so. The proposition to look after the presidential succession in certain emergencies, snouia reeieve tne mi mediate attention of Congress. There is really no partisan interest at stake now, the Itepublican control of the Senate beii s too complete to make Mr. Carlisle's chances of succession un der the existing law worth serious con sideration; and hence the obvious pub lic interest in a fixed and well defined settlement of thesuccession ought to be sufficient to bring the two houses to an agreement on some such bill as that passed by the senate at the last -. . . .

That is true; and the reiison for so unprecedented and dan gerous a condition of affairs was the disregard of the unbroken precedents of over a cent ury by Mr. Arthur, then vice-President of the Lnited States, who refused to vacate the chair in the senate, and alow a president pro tem. to be chosen by that body, because its then Democratic majority would not accent hi3 ( Arthur's) dictation as to whom it should select for the place. We take it for granted that the Cleveland Herald, one of the ablest Republican organs in Northern Ohio, knows what it is talking about in this paragraph "There is no doubt but that Presi dent Arthur is seeking a renomina- tion at the hands of the Republican partv. His cause is in the hands of the .National republican machine.

In Cleveland the ropes are being laid and the pins set for President Arthur's re nomination. The question has been asked why tho Herald is opposed to his nomination ? That is easily an swered. Because he cannot bring out the Republican vote. It will take Republican enthusiasm to carry Ohio next year. We have nothing against President Ar'hur as a man, and hi3 administration has bee clean, safe and respectable, but would Ohio 'enthuse over him as a candidate V Would the Western reserve vote come out lor him?

TlialieU sunset, Cyclones and Earth quakes Foretelling Cominsf Disas terHow to Mret It. The recent mysterious appearances following sunset and preceding sun rise have attracted wide attention om students of the skies and the people generally. During the days of recent, v.eeKs tne bun seems to have been obscured .by the thin veil of a dull leaden hue which, as the sun re eded toward the horizon, became more luminous, then vellow, then orange, then reu; and, as night ,-ettled down upon the earth, a dull purple. At tirst it was thought these appear ances were ordinary sunset reflections of light, but it is now pretty certain that they . re either the misty sub stance of i he tail of some unseen comet, ia which the earth is envel oped, or a surrounding stratum of world i.-.ist or very small meteors. Prof. Breaks of the Red House ob servatory, Phelps, N. Y., has turned his telescope upon these objects and discovers d what he thinks are myriads ot telescopic meteors. It it is unor ganized world dust, or decomposed vapors, as the Democrat and Chroni cle of Rochester, N. Y., remarks: How is this matter to be disposed of V Will it settle and form a deposit upon tho earth, or remain a partial opaque shell about the earth to cut off a portion ol trie sun s light upon it i" Whatever the mystery is, there is no ceuymg mat soma very strange f rces are at work ia the uoper airs The terrible tornadoes and cy. lones which have swept our own country, and the fearful volcanoes and earth quakes which have destroyed so many cities and thousands of people the tidal waves which mysteriously rise aud fall on coasts hitherto unvexed by them the tremendous activity which is evident in the sun by the constant revelation of enormous spots upon its surface all indicate unusual energy in the heavenly bodies. These circumstances recall Profes sor Gnmmer's prophecies that from 1681 to 1S87, the passage of the five great planets Mars, Neptune, Jupi ter, Uranus and Saturn around the sun would produce strange and won derful phenomena. He says: "The waters of the earth will become more or less poisonous. The air will be foul with noisome odors. Ancient races will disappear from the earth." He .attempts to prove his prophecy by the fact that in 1720, when Mars and Sat urn made their passage around the sua coiccidentally, great destruction aud mortality visited all pirts of the globe. He also found the same results in previous perehelion p;issages of the planets, and argues that these circum stances always produce epidemics and destructive diseases which will baffle the skill of the most eminent physi cians; that tho poor will die by thou sands, the weak and intemperate fall ing first, those whose blood has been impoverished by excess of work or dissipation next and only those who are in comparative vigor shall escape to enjoy the era of renewed activity and prosperity which will follow the period of destruction. Inasmuch as the entire world seems subject to the sway of the heavenly bodies no part of the earth, he thinks can escape scourging. He even pre dicts that America will lose over ten millions of people; that farmers will be stricken with fear and cease to till the soil: that famine will make hu man, misery more wretched. That hundreds will llee to overcrowded cities for aid in vain. That sudden changes in ocean currents, tempera ture aud surroundings will entirely transform the face of nature and cli mate of countries; that the air will be so foul with malaria and other nox ious gases that those who survive will be troubled with disorders of the digestive organs. That many who i scape other ills will bloat with dropsy and suddenly pass away, while others will grow thin and drag out a miser able existence in indescribable agony for weeks. Neuralgic pains in differ ent parts of the body will torment them. They will easily tire and be come despondent. A faint, hot feel ins will be succeeded by chilly sensa tions while hallucinations and dread of impending ill will paralyze all elfort. "The birds of the - air, the beasts of the field, and even the fish of the sea will become diseased, poisomng the air and poisoning the v. aters of the globe." We are told on tho other hand that those who shall pass through this period of trial will have larger enjoyment of life and health. The earth will yield more abundantly than ever before. The animal kingdom will be more prolific and lite prolonged very ma terially. This prolongation of life will bo owing to the healthy electric and magnetic inlluences that will per vade the atmosphere. It would per haps seem that the present redness of the sun, and the presence of a belt or veil . of cosmic matter, justified, in a measure, the prediction of Professor Grimmer, but disturbing as his pre diction may be, we are told for our comfort that the strong and pure blooded need have little to fear in these calamities, that those who are delicate or indisposed should adopt means to keep the system well sup pirtf d and the blood pure, and that the most philosophical and effective method of accomplishing this is to keep the kidney3 and liver in good condition. From the testimonials of such men as Dr. Dio Lewis and Professor R. A. Gunn. M. D., Dean of the United States Medical college. New York, and thousands of influential non-professional people, it seems almost certain that for this purpose there is no preparation known to science equal to Warner's Safe Cure, better known as Warner's Safe Kidney and Liver Cure. This medi cine has acquired the finest reputation of any preparation that was ever put upon the market. It is a radical blood purifier, which soothes and heals all inllamed organs, strengthens the nervous system, washes out all evi dences of decay, regulates digestion, prevents malassimilation of food in a philosophical and rational manner, fortifies the system against climatic changes and malarial influences and the destructive agencies which seem to be so abundant in these "evil days." It is not our purpose to dispute the cor-eetness of Professor Grimmer's prophecies.

It is certain, as above stated, that we are passing through what may be re garded as a crucial period and it is the part of wise men not to ignore, but to learn to fortify themselves against the possibility of being over come by these evils. It is a duty which each man owes to himself, and his fellows, to mitigate as much as possible the suffering or humanity uud in no way better can he accom iushthis purpose than to see to it that he, himself, is fortified by the best known preparation in the strong est possible manner and that he exert the influence of his own example upon his fellows to the end that they too, may share with him immunity from the destructive induences which seek his ruin . A writer in a Boston paper says that the traveler in passing along the highway, a mile or so above the vil lage of Xorth Haverhill, X. II., reaches and beside a little pine grove, finds a small grave-yard which con tains the remains of some of the ear liest settlers of that section of the state, and here for over seventy years have reposed the remains of the brave Mcintosh, the leader of the Boston Tea Party, unmarktd by stone and known to but a lew age 1 people now living, who remember his burial. He tills a pauper's grave, having died in 1810 or ISil at the house of a Mr. Hul burt, who resided at what 13 now known as the -Poor Farm, and to whose care he had been bid off a3 a public pauper at public auction as the lowest bid, according to the ancient custom.
