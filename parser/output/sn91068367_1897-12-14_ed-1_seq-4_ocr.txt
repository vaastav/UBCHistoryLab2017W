SOME OP THE PLEAS FOR THE ANNEXATION OP HAWAII. t On Friday morning we presented some reflections of two eminent writers upon the subject of the Hawaiian an nexation, 'and promised to give a glimpse in another article of some of the points of the Right Honorable Jam!s Bryce, of the British parliament. The paper is too remarkable to be over looked. A distingruSshed English states man's view, and one noted for hi3 friendliness to this country, as well as tor his soundness of judgment, must command attention of reflecting men. He disposes of the argument relative to the anexation of Cuba and Hawaii -strengthening the strategic position of -our. country by showing how excep tionally strong is the position which America already holds "He says of all - the great powers of the world the United States and Russia are the only -ones that have no Insular territories to defend. All the territory of our coun- ,try is territory on their own continent. Except Russia, every other great European power has territories which , lie at the mercy of a stronger hostile lleet. If ths United State's owned Cuba . and Hawaii, and 'a war should occur, they would be seized by a fleet of an enemy that were stronger at sea. It could not be prevented unless the United States should maintain a fleet both In the Pacific Ocean and in the -Gulf of Mexico, powerful enough toMe-fen-d both islands. Of course this coun try could build large fleets, but Mr. I2ryce inquires if it would be wise to spend the hundreds of millions that would be needed in order to build such fleets. 'He says that of all great pow ers she Is the one least likely to be at tacked, and because n'o other state or country has anything to win by fight ing her. He thinks there is not a pow er on the globe which would not loose by war with America. A great navy would be a luxury and a very costly .rxrto TT mvo thn f- thf n nnpTa tirn Ctf Cuba and Hawaii would be 'a source of -weakness and not of strength. He says that another idea presented is that both the islands are so attractive that they would be desirable properties fit for American immigration. He says that they are not suitable, really be- cause of climate being so excessively hot, for the settlement of the Anglo- . American race. He says that both of the islands are 'already peopled by races from much hotter countries. As to Hawaii, it Is a climate that is more .agreeable than Cuba, but the strong sun forbids that our race should at tempt physical outdoor labor, and the trades and professions are already . overrun by Americans and Qther - nationalities. He says that 'Hawaii has not enough people to make a respect able state, and the quality of the pop ulation is by no means desirable. It would increase the black element in the American union. According to the -census Of 1896, the population of the Hawaiian Islands constituted in round numbers, 40,000 pure "and mixed na tives; Japanese, 25,000; Chinese, 22,000; Portuguese, 15,000; Americans, 3,000; British, 2,000, and Germans, 1,500. There xvre about 109,000 in all. He says that the inhabitants out there are are not much less to help govern their neigh bors. He gives an account of a pain ful experience of his own country in -dealing with some of her colonies. The democratic system is much less adapt ed to the anomalous addition of terri tory than a strong government is It would involve considerable danger, - evidently, to set up among an Inferior and dissimillar population institutions like our own, and so far departed from .all our own traditions as to attempt ito govern that population and its own citizens abroad by despotic methods. .-Evidently, this country has nothing to gain by territorial annexation. We . have a great country, a vast domain, capable of supporting easily three or four times its present population. The aciirroa -wf nnr rinnn'trv Src immen'se. . Jf k-t u vr u w. j tllKl xiie pieiL i licit, vn tr neeA u.niua.iuj elsewhere, is fallacious, deceptive, and really baseless. Mr. Bryce refers to -the plea that is put up by certain dem agogues, who may say that it is to the Interest and duty of our country to spread democratic principles, but he cays, ,very truly, that Polynesians, Asiatics, Creole Spaniards, and mulat fcoes, are not fit to receive those prin ciples, and he says further that "neith ' cr are negr-oes fit, as the history of Ilayti and of most of the South Ameri can so-called republics proves." We conclude by quoting uie follow ing paragraph, which Is the last in Mr. . Hryce's discussion: "The United States has already a -great and splendid mission In building - up between the oceanfc a free, happy, 3-nd prosperous nation of two hundred milions of people. And one of the no West parts of her mission In the world has been to show to the older peoples and states an example of abstention from the quarrels arid wars and con quests that make up so large and so lamentable a part of the annals of Europe. Her remote position and her immense power have, as I have said, delivered her from that burden of mili tary and naval armaments which presses with crushing weight upon the peoples of Europe. It would be, for her, a descent from what may be call ed the pedestal of wise and pacific de tachment on which she now stands, were she to yield to that earth-hunger which has been raging among the European states, and to imftate the aggressive methods which some of them have pursued. The policy of creating great armaments and of an nexing territories beyond the sea would be, if a stranger may venture to say so, an un-American policy, and a com plete departure from the mixims ap proved by long experience of the il lustrious founders of the republic." 

NATIONAL CONTROIi President McKinley in hi3 message introduces the idea of regulating quar antine in the states by national laws and the exercise of paramount nation al authority. All such endorsements or recommendations may be scrutinized, for there may lurk in them very great dangers. The tendency in this country ever since the war, has been to a strong government. The war so changed the constitution that democrats have been ready to avail themselves at every turn so as to strengthen the cause of fed eral power and consequently to dimin ish the rights and power of the states. It is manifest that this class in the con gress will make a .united effort to fasten upon the country a national quarantine, a general government to have complete control and the state au- m thorities to be completely ignored. We believe that under any plea what ever it is dangerous for the general government to invade the rights of the states, Whether it is to cure a sick hog or to institute quarantine regulations or anything else that robs the-states of power. The Charleston 'News and Cou rier says "that this national movement as to quarantine is supported general ly by committees which seek to escape the expense and responsibility of look ing after their own sanitary safety, by those who regard the protection of the public health as Of less concern than the interrupted source of commerce and by those who would burden the marine hospital service of the United States with duties which it is in no way competent to perform." We agree with our contempor'ary in the opinion which it quotes from Governor Blox some of Florida that the government co operation shall be with state control. In other words that the states must not lose their influence or power but must be regarded while the general govern ment seeks to aid in this matter of quarantine. It is suggested that con gress shall create a department of pub lic health, whose head shall be a mem ber of the president's cabinet. There are always people ready to add to the powers at Washington in the multiply ing of departments. The News and Courier thinks wisely that it would be extremely hazardous to commit the public health into the hands of a prac tical politician. May our country be protected from such a curse. While the quarantine of the state may not have been all that it should have 'been, it has done, nevertheless, in some of the states, very efficient work. In Flor ida specially is this the case. Let the state quarantine be improved, made thoroughly efficient, and there will be no occasion for a politician to ibe play ing big boss as the head of the new system of quarantine, headquarters at Washington. There is a very signifi cant comparison made by -Dr. Ander son of the Florida state board of health between the marine quarantine and the state quarantine. He says twice in four years at quarantine stations un der the control of the marine service, yellow fever has gained entrance into our country, while under the state con trol of the quarantine stations, no such invasion has occurred for nearly twen ty years. Dr. Anderson says "a few grains of common sense is worth bar rels of gelatine culture. Deciding Racing Cases New York, December 11.

Poor and Weak Catarrh and Bronchial Trouble Had no Appetite Now Better in Every Way A Delicate Child. " Some time since I took a sadden cold and could not get rid of it. Being subject to catarrh and bronchial trouble I coughed terribly. I lost my appetite and grew poor and weak and I did not feel like work. I began taking Hood's Sarsapa rilla. In a short time the cough disap- j peared, I slept well, had a good appetite and I was better in every way. Last spring I was not feeling well, I had no ap petite and no strength. I resorted to Hood's Sarsaparilla and soon felt more like work. My little nephew was a deli cate child and had a humor which trou bled him so he could not rest at night.

WONDERFUL ENDURANCE OF THE CONTESTANTS IN THE SIX DAYS BICYCLE RACE. Miller Still In the Lead and Far Ahead of fhe Others and the Kecord Two Drop Oat, Moore From a Bad Fall Rivierre Driven Insane by the Strain The Men xamlned by Police Surgeons The Rec ords New York, December 10. The great ix day bicycle, race at Madison Square garden has narrowed itself down to fif teen riders. Miller still retains a lead of nearly 100 miles over Rice, the Wilkes barre minor At midnight he was something like 235 miles ahead of the world's record, and with twenty-four hours to spare, he had covered a distance up to within 'a few miles of the great record estab lished by Hale last year of 1,900 miles. The great surprise of the night was the retirement of Rivierre, the French man. He is believed to be actually out of his mind, is in a pitable condition and is now under the care of physi cians. Like most of the others in the race, Rivierre has given evidence dur ing the contest of having partly lost his mind. The awful strain after the first day of riding had in a measure mental ly unbalanced him and this afternoon he leaped, from his wheel and made an assault on an imaginary foe in one of the boxes, swearing and jabbering in his native tongue. His trainers rush ed to him and put him on his wheel but after making a few more laps he repeated the performance with even more insane rage than he had at first demonstrated. The result was that Rivierre had again, to be taken from the track to return no more. Another man who has quite the list is Moore. He had a terrible fall during the afternoon while going at a high rate of speed. Crashing into the raii, he cut himself badly and was carried off the track almost unconscious. The shock was too great for his debilitated condi tion and he will be seen no more in the present race. But Miller, that won'derful specimen of physical development, still plods along. He has ground out more miles in a given time on a wheel than ever any man did before. He had subsisted under the most telling strain with less sleep than was thought possible for any man and with it all, an examination of him tonight by the police surgeon dis closed the fact that his condition was normal and that with the exception of muscular soreness and a slight dead ness of the limbs he was in excellent condition, and would be able to con tinue to the end without much danger of callapse. According to various trainers about the track, Miler is beginning to have hallucinations. He Complained to his trainer about noon that the people in the building were throwing sticks and stones at him and that he had to ride over hurdles. Rice, who is second man in the con test, though nearly 100 miles behind the leader, is standing by his colors with dogged determination It was said during the day that he had asked to be taken off, but the manner in which he has "been riding through the night shows that though he might have re quested this, it is not the spirit of his wishes. He is in to stay to the end; his trainers think that he will be much hearer the Chicago man at the end of the next twelve hours than he is at present. At all events he got rid of a dangerous rival when Rivierre left the track. For hours it had ben nip and tuck with these two, at one .time the one leading and at another time the other. Rice's physical condition is also announced to be good. Close up to Rice and third man, now that the Frenchman is gone, is Schin neer, a fellow townsman of Miller. Though he has had several nasty tum bles during the race, Schinneer has never for a moment lost any, of his pluck and determination. He has a lead of 90 miles on Hale, the former champion and, barring accident, will undoubtedly finish third: Hale, with plenty of sleep, com paratively speaking, has the best ap pearance of any man on the track. He has really taken things leisurely, but, nevertheless, at the present writing is nearly forty miles ahead of his old re cord of last year. This is about what his schedule called for, but when the schedule was made up no account was taken of such marvellous speed as has been maintained throughout the race, after "Waller had set the pace. Those Who expected Hale to move up in the last day or two are lapt to be disap pointed, for he is two full centuries be hind the plucky leader. The police authorities tonight in sisted upon examination being made of the men by the police surgeons. The result was a report by the surgeons which, so far as the statistics go, show ed a very satisfactory condition of af fairs, except in the case of Rivierre. Officially this report "goes" as it were, but it gives not the faintest idea of what the real condition and apperance of the majority of the riders are. They are all strong enough to go on with their pedaling until midnight tomor row, and it is not likely that there will be any 'further withdrawals unless for cause of accident. New York, December 11. The score at 1:15 a. m.f was as follows: Miller, 1,900.4; Rice, 1,809.$; Schinneer, 1,792.2; Rivierre, 1,746.0; Hale, 1,705.3; Waller, 1,685.6; Pierce, 1,637.7; Moore, 1,495.4; Elkes, 1,550.0; Golden, 1,534.1; Enter man, 1,517.6; Gannon, 1,514.5; Kinz, 1,425.0; Julius, 1.320.2; Beacon 1,135.8; Gray, 1,060.0; Johnson, 1,109.7. Miller was 243 miles 4 laps ahead of record for 121 hours. Winter Crnlse of the Atlantic Squadron New York, December 10. The north Atlantic squadron, according to informa tion given out at the navy department, will be on its way south by the loth of the month. Repairs on the warships have been hastened as rapidly as possi ble, and the work will be completed by Monday. The warships will sail for Hampton Roads as soon as they are in readiness where they will be joined by the Indiana, the Maine and other vessels. When all are gathered, the annual win ter cruise south will begin. The maneu vers of the vessels will be confined chief ly to Florida waters, with headquarters at Key West. The Montgomery, Detroit and Vessuvius are already in Florida waters. The squadron will be joined by the torpedo fleet when warm weather sets in and drills and torpedo maneuvers will be, begun. The fleet will return to the Brooklyn navy yard some time in April. Thanksgiving's past and next comes Christmas and there will be no files on it either. 

FIVE PERSONS MURDERED The Murderer Captured, Identified and Will be Lynched He Confesses Others Implicated Wesson, Miss., December 10. Full particulars of the murder of the Smith family have come to hand. Mrs. Smich and four of her children were killed by Charles Lewis, colored. His weapon was a club. Smith was working at a gin a few miles from his home, which is situated about two and a half miles from Pearl river, on the east , bank, in Lawerence county and in a wild country. The house is off the main road and no white family lives within two miles of it, al though several negro families live near. On Wednesday sometime between noon and darkness r Lewis went to Smith's house, brutally assaulted Mrs. Smith, then brained her with a club and then, to hide his crime, began on the six children, only sparing a babe, which he left untouched. A girl 5 years of age, regained con sciousness, and when her father enter ed after his day's work she told him the name of the murderer. The mother and four children were found lying in the yara, showing how they had strug gled to escape. Smith immediately sounded the alarm and a posse was or ganized. Late yesterday afternoon the negro was captured, carried to Monfticello, the county seat of Law rence county, and at 7 o'clock was car ried back to the scene of his crime where he was fully identified by the girl. It is said he was promptly lynch ed. It is feared that a wholesale lynching may take place in that neighborhood, as the country is excited to the highest pitch. New Orleans, December 10. The spe cial to The Picayune from Wesson, Miss., says: Your correspondent has just interviewed one of the most prominent men in this section, who left the scene of the massacre of the Brown 'Smith family this morning. The accused negro, Charley Lewis, is being tried before Justice T. D. Holmes and has given testimony Implicating two other negroes Will Powell and Andy Smith who are now in custody. My informant is positive that the negroes will not be lynched tonight but that the recent lynching at Monroe will be imitated, and every negro will be made to carry pine knots to burn the others. The trial is being -Conducted in a law ful manner. During the trial Lewis broke down and confesssed, saying: "It's mighty hard for me to suffer for what somebody else has done." Upon being allowed to talk further he said: "Get Will Powell and Andrew Smith." Lewis is a mulatto, about 23 years old, and marrried. It is believed that a general clean up will be made in that section of the country and that a num ber of negroes will be lynched. AFTER THE DUCKS Ex-President Cleveland Comes South on a Ducking Frolic Washington, December 10. Ex-President Grover Cleveland arrived in Washington this afternoon at 1:15 o'clock in the special Pullman car Davy Crockett attached to the regular west bound train on the Pennsylvania rail road. . He left Princeton this morning at 9:30 and is en route to South Car olina on a hunting trip. Although this was the first time Mr. Cleveland had 'been in Washington since he left the executive mansion last March, he did not leave his car during the two hours it was in the city. He was met at the Sixth street station by Captain Robley D. Evans, of the light house board; General Anson G. Mc Cook, U. S. marshal; A. A. Wilson and two or three other intimate friends.- Mr. Cleveland had evidently improved greatly in health since he left Wash ington. He said that he was enjoying excellent health, and indeed has not been better for several years. He de clined to discuss politics or public af fairs, but laughingly suggested that he might have some interesting stories on duck shooting to tell upon his return from the south. He is on his way to South Island, about thirty miles from Charleston, S. C, where he will be the guest of General E. P. Alexander, the distinguished chief of the confederate artillery forces at the battle of Gettys burg and now president of the Georgia Central railroad. He left Washington at 3:46 o'clock via the Atlantic Coast Line, accompanied by Captain Evans, General 'McCook and. Captain Lamberton, of the lighthouse service Mr. Cleveland and General McCook will remain in camp for ten days or two weeks. Likely to be Proven a Wholesole Murderer New York, December 10. Charles Zanoli, the barber who yesterday plead ed guilty to defrauding an insurance company and who admitted that since 1883 he had collected insurance on four wives, one mother-in-law, one daugh ter and one employee, was arraigned in police court again today on the charge of being a suspicious person. 'He was remanded until tomorrow to give the detectives on the case time to thor oughly invesigate his record, and as certain whether the lives of all these people, whose insurance Zanoli obtain ed, were lost through natural causes. The charge made by the insurance company will not be pressed until the deaths have been thoroughly explain ed. While prosecuting his Insurance business Zanoli sometimes traveled un der the name of Braune and Suhmer. During the day the poilce accumu lated a good deal of testimony against Zanoli which they consider important. Captain McCIusky, chief of detectives, stated that he had discovered a barber who had seen Zanoli giving wife No. 2 a dose of medicine. The woman died the next day of cerebral hemorrhage. He also stated that Zanoli moved a short time ago to another locality in this city with the intention of getting married again. The woman that Zanoli intended to make his wife ad vertised in the papers for a husband and had an appointment with Zanoli at his store yesterday evening. She kept th'ea ppointment and found that Zanoli was in jail. The police also claim hat Zanoli tried to marry an other woman recently. Zanoli told the police today that his child, little Lottie, on whose life he colected Insurance, died from an in jury on the head, resulting from a blow given her by his second wife while in a fit of anger. Zanoli also stated that his second wife grieved so much over Lottie's death that he be lieved It caused her death., Zanoli has continued to cry ever teince he has been locked up. 

COKGRESSIIAII LIIIIIEY FINDS SOMETHING IN TAMMANY TO ENDORSE He Believes That to the Victors Bel on it the Spoils His Opposition to Civil SeiJ rice The Pension Bill Gives Klse to a De bate on the Civil Service and the Trees ory Deficit Republicans Divided on tte Former Question Washington, December 10. Considera tion of the pension appropriation bill was resumed soon after the opening of the house. Mr. Brown, republican, of Ohio, at tacked the civil service law because it protected some of the pension erarnln ing txxitds appointed under the last ad ministration, lie styled it an "abomina tion" and was lustily applauded by many of his colleagues. He said the soldiers of his district regarded this law a inim ical to their Intervals and he favored its repeal or radical modification. Mr. Maxwell, populist, of Nebraska, submitted some remarks in favor of lib eral pensions, and was followed by Mr. Grosvenor. republican, of Ohio, who said that while 'his colleagues from Ohio seemed to differ on the civil service question, he though they were practi cally of one mind as to persons. Mr. Sullivan, .democrat, of Mississippi, in supjort of an argument agaJnst the payment of pensions to those who were wealthy and did not need them, quoted at length from an article recently written by General H. V. Boynton. whose testi mony agrainst abuses in the present sys tem he said, was entitled to respectful consideration by the other side. Mr. Johnson, republican, of Indiana, in defense of civil service reform, reiterate! his statement of the other day that civil service reform was an essential principle of republicanism. He declared that the enemies of the law dare not attack it openly. "Do you favor life tenure In office?" asked Mr. Pearson, republican, of North Carolina. "I do in the civil service," replied Mr. Johnson emphatically. Messrs. Carmack, Gaines and Sims, democrats, of Tennessee, spoke briefly in favor of retrenchment in pension ex penditures. The latter expressed the opinion that the Dingley law would not supply sufficient revenue for the increas ing pension expenditures. These remarks drew out an important statement from Mr. Dingley. The ques tion, as to the revenues and expendi tures for the next fiscal year, proceeded Mr. Dingley, was a practical one Which congress had to face. The statement of the secretary of the treasury, he said, caused much misapprehension, owing o the fact that under a new provision f law he 'had been Obliged to include in the estimates of expenditures $73,000,00 for public works which neither he nor the secretary of war nor any other well in formed person believed would be ex pended. Counting this the estimated de ficit, he said, will be $21,000.OV. He vio lated no confidence, he said, when he stated that the secretary of the treasury and the president were confident that the receipts next year would etxeeed the expenditures. Mr. Dingley mid he took it for granted that congress would exercise reasonable economy. It was not expected that the expenditures for public works next year would exceed $.10,000.(K. Mr. Dingley figured out a surplus of ex actly $10,000,000 for thecoming fiscal ye;ir. He described the steady manner in Which the revenues had been increasing at the rate of one or two millions a month. When pressed by Mr. Richardson, demo crat, of Tennessee, for an opinion as to the time when the full effect of the new schedules would be manifest, Mr. Ding ley replied that the date must necessarily be problematical, but for practical pur poses, looking to the period when the revenues would be ample, he unhesitat ingly fixed the end of this fiscal year. Mr. Bailey, democrat, of Texas, asked Mr. Dingley if the treasury was not con cealing a deficiency 'by counting the re ceipts from the sale of the Union Pacific as miscellaneous receipts. Mr. Dingley responded that the only proper place for this item was in miscel laneous receipts, and he 'had excluded all consideration of the Pacific road receipts in his statement. "Surely," said Mr. Bailey, "you do not credit your tariff bill with the receipts from the sale of the Union Pacific road?" Mr. Dingley disclaimed any such pur pose. Then Mr. McMillin took a hand in ask ing questions. "If revenues wiil soon meet expenditures, he asked, "why do you not use some of the surplus to ex tinguish the public debt?" "Oh!" interjected Mr. Cannon, lightly, amid laughter, "we'll get around in time to step the results of democratic ex travagance." Mr. Allen, democrat, of Mississippi, concluded the general debate with a hu. morous speech in which he referred to the comment of the Spanish premier, Sa ga-sta, on the president's message to the effect that the president's threat of in tervention was merely meant as a sop to a portion of the American people. Mr. Allen declared that this statement from the Spanish premier made his blood boil. Such impressions might be held over here, but When they were indulged in across the seas he thought it time to pass a resolution of confidence In our chief executive. During the five minutes debate. Mr. Linney, republican, of North Carolina, made an argument in favor of over throwing the civil service law, 'which set the galleries in a roar. He believed that the spoils belonged to the victors. It was the only way to succeed. He flourished aloft a picture from a comic paper rep resenting New York overrun by "Tam many Tigers." He had never heard any thing particularly good of Tammany, he said, except that it was vouched for by Amos Cummings. yet Tammany had pre vailed against all the forces of good gov ernment. It was invincible, omnipotent. Why? Because it respected its friends. 'Look at tihis picture," he said. "The big tiger surrounded by myriads of little tigers. How would the tieer look sur rounded by monkeys and mice?" Laugh ter. He eulogized the 'stalwarts of the party who had "stuck to their friends." The bill was reported to the house and passed. Mr. Hitt, chairman of the committee on foreign affairs, asked unanimous con sent for the passage of the bill reported by his committee to prohibit the killing of fur seals. He explained the necessity for the immediate passage of the act owing to the diplomatic negotiations now pending. Objection was made by Mr. Loud, re publican, of California, and then, at 4:30 o clock p. m., the house adjourned till Monday.
