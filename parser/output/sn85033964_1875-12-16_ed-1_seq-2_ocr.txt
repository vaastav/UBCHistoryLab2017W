We venture to say a better speech hart not been made in l'ulabki in many u day than that of JIaj. Sjkes on Monday the Gtli, a biief and irnpei-feil report of which we give on our first page. It will ie pay any one, and especially the farmer, to give it a careful reading, The Hoard of Directors of the Cumberland ami ohio railroad held a meeting at Louisville last week, at which it was unanimously decided to make it a narrow uae. The Courier Journal thinks this assures the speedy building of the road. It says, "The narrow-auge system for interior rends has been found most desirable whereever tested, and there is no reason why it should not result quite as satisfactorily in the present instance as in any of those where it is already recognized as a pronounced success. Steps will be at once taken to push the road to an early completion" 44th Congress. Nothing of special importance has yet been done. The standing com mittees have not yet been appoint ed. The Speaker is selecting them with great tare. Work is being cut out very systematically, and we may exjiect results soon. The most im portant bill introduced this week is one be Mr. Meriman to repeal so much of sect'on 3, ISO of the Revised Statutes as forbids the payment of accounts, claims and demands there in named, and all laws and clauses of laws forbidding the payment thereof. The bill refers to claims or demands against the United States, which accrued or existed prior to the llith of April, in favor of any person who promoted, encour aged, or in any manner sustained the rebellion. It authorizes the settle ment of such claims, and appropri ates $100,000 for that purpose. Af ter a short executive session the Senate adjourned. - . - Milan is at the junction of the Memphis and Louisville, and of the New Orleans ai.d St. Louis rail roads. Milan is only 00 iiles from Clifton, and 124 miles from Pulaski. The road from Clifton to Milan passes through Lexington. From l'ulaski to St. Louis by this route is liOO miles, it being only 23.3 from Milan to St. Louis. From Milan to Memphis is '.)f miles mak ing it 220 miles from Pulaski to Memph'19 b- this route." It thus appears that the probability is that three roads from West Tennessee would meet our road at Clifton, one from Memphis by llolivar, one from Cairo by Paris, and one from Milan to Clifton. All of these would throw their business upon our road from Clifton to l'ulaski. The State (5 range of Kentucky, at its late session, requested the Kentucky delegation in Congress to aid the passage of the Texas Pacific railroad measure. The Courier Journal thinks this action was prop er, and that it will doubtles be sup plemented by all the granges of the South. In that event what will Whit do? It will place him in a dilemma. lie is now opposed to granting any governmei.t endorse ment to aid in the coistruction of this road, notwithstanding the im mense land giants and subsidies heretofore granted tonothern enter prises ot a similar character. We are aware that his opposition is Irom principle that he has persistently and consistently opposed all these subsidies and "Consistency is a jewel" but and however, notwith standing, and nevertheless, it seems to us that "circumstances would sometimes alter cases." Can't you whip over, Whit, Mpoa the ground that the south must got even with the lio.'th before this democratic rule of yours is made inflexible? It seems that there would be no inconsisten cy in this "to hurt." The lJahimoie (lazotte joir.s glad ly in the general acclaim: "L'uder Mr. Kerr's molding hand the'llouse of Representatives will mark out a bold, aggressive policy, which will assure the success of the national Democracy in lSTtl, if it succeed at all, on right principles. Hut wheth er it brings success or defeat, the promise for a return to constitution al government honestly administered-, was never so near realization as it is to-day, with the party follow ing the counsels of its Latnars and Kerrs, and keeping in sight the an cient landmarks free trade, hard money, home rule." The town authorities have ap pointed Thursday the 23rd day of December as the day upon which the citizens of the town of Bolivar are to ballot whether they will vote a tux toward building the M. A- K. Itutli oad. The Memphis Ledger recently sug- j gested that if the people of Memphis would not build their end of our; road, it could bo carried to Milan and then make connections to all points; whereupon, the Milan Ex change goes oil' thus: "We thank the Ledger for the suggestion.. It seems there are not only men 'at Memphis but men at Bolivar who oppose the Pulaski road going to their towns. Let it then be brought from Clifton by way of Lexington to Milan, and go from hereby Tren ton and Dyersburg to the Missis sippi river, and it and the Tennes see Central may form one line from this place to the Mississippi river. This is a much better line for that road anyhow than by Bolivar to Memphis. At this place the Hen derson and Decatur people and the Middle Tennesseeans will reach a direct line ,' either Memphis or New Orleans. Again we nay, "We thank thee, Jew," for those words. Let's have the road to the live, grow ing young railroad town of Milan, the best place for connections lor all points of the compass in the State. What do our co n tern pora lies at Dyersburg, Trenton and Lexington say?" A plausible and ingenious comu nicatien to the Nashville Commei cial Reporter, on the subject of State finances makes this proposi tion as a solution of the financial situation. "The bonds of Tennes see now sell in the New York mark et at 43 and 46 on the dollar. Let the Legislature pass a law calling in all these bonds at their present value, and pny for them in green backs." Wc agree with the Clarksville Chronicle when it says, the Legisla ture should earnestly consider whether a State bank, with a capi tal of $15,000,000, based upon the faith and resources of the State, may not obviate a recourse to such an extreme measure. It should al so enquire if railroads are paying their full quota of taxation, and whether there is not a large amount of property exempt by law which should, in justice, be made accessi ble to the tax collector, and wheth er the reforms in the interest of economy, so much talked about, have been carried into eflect, and whether there are not man' leaks in the Treasury that it would be profi table to stop. Kx-Senator Henderson, of Mis souuri, having been employed by the government to prosecute the whisky frauds, did 60 too well to please the president, and has lost his head for tracing them into the presidential farniby. The president wanted to dictate, and Henderson denied his right in a caustic speech, for which the president called him to account. He refused to apolo gize, ami off went bis head. It seems that the presidentmeant for him to "let no guilty man escape" unless he was a member of the pres idential household. But how dare Senator Henderson insinuate that, Habcock, the president's confidential secretary, w hom he loved so dearly, didn't have a perfect right to steal f:om the government as much as he pleased if he divided fairly! Is he not the government's darling: The Democratic majority iu con gress is working very harmonious ly. At the party caucus on Monday last Mr. Lamar presided again, and during the incidental discussions there was harmony of views with re gard to the duty of the majority of the House. All agreed that they should, as far as possible, etfect a reduction of taxation, and that the Covermcnt should be honestly and economically administered. Much ruspousibility devolved on the ma jority of the House, although the Senate was not politically in accord with them. The country desired a stoppage of wasteful expenditures, and the Democracy could not ex pect the people to stand by them un less they stood by the people. No business apart from that above mentioned was considered. "It must be gratifying to every rightthinkingGranger to know that the National Grange, during its re cent annual session of two weeks at Louisville, evinced its determina tion, on every available occasion, to staud squarely up to the constitu tions and the obligations of the or der, by ruling politics and poli tical partisanship out of the grange and out of the order in every shape and form. This is as it should be, and those ineonconsiderate mem hers wh have so strenuously exert ed themselves to drag the order into the political arena should consider themselves admonished, by this ac tion of the highest tribunal of the order, to scrupulously abstain for ever hereafter from so suicidal a course." A romantic story is told of a Cu ban woman who, with her son of fourteen years, commands a detach ment of the rebel army. She leads the insurgents in person, dressed in a riding habit and mounted on a fine horse, and is as brave as a lion. lion. M. C. Ken is the first Speaker the Democrats have elect ed in eighteen years; Hon. James L. Orr, of South Carolina, being the last. It takes eighty-two columns of Memphis Avalanche to print the list of delinquent taxes for Shelby County and the city of Memphis. Neill S. Brown, Jr., of Tennessee, has been appointed reading ch.rk j for the House of Representatives by Major Adams. Tweed has not yet been heard from. The New York Tribune can put but one constuction upon the presi dent's Cuban policy as shadowed in his message: "There is but one construction to be put upon this. It is simply a forewarning of a rec ommendation of intervention at some future time. And this is the policy of an outgoing Admin:stra tion. Is any one so blind as to mis understand it? The Frankfort Yeoman finds traces, all through the president's message, "of that slip-shod diction, that untrained sophomoiic style, which was naturally to have been expected in view of previous efforts, and from one who, whatever may be his other titles to glorj-, certainly can not be called either a scholar or statesman in any true sense of those terms " The Courier Journal thinks there will be a very general impression that President Grant discharged es- Senato Henderson from the prose cuting counsel, in the St. Louis whisky cases, because he (Hender son) saw too far along the radii of that "circle," and gave his impress ions in his recent speech. The suspension of mining opera tions in the Schuylkill coal region of Pennsylvania will throw about 30,000 miners out of employment. The leading operators state that it is not likely busiuess will be resum ed before spring. Stonewall Jackson's daughter, iu another four years, i3 going to take a husband out of the old Stonewall brigade, even if he shall be its only surviving member, with both arms gone and no legs to stand upon. The most sagacious Democratic leaders who have reached Washing ton are unanimously of opinion that Grant, will bf the Kepudlican nomi nee for the Presidency, and many of them admit privately that it will be no easy matter to beat him. The preparations for a third term are now going on with hardly any at tempt at concealment. The Presi dent certainly means business. Nashville American. When ex-Speaker Blaine wasask- ed what he thought of President Grant's views on the school question as expressed in the message, he re plied: "He goes far beyond me. I have no desire to antagonize the en tire religious opinion of the coun try." That is just what General Giant desires to do; but he will find a majority of his own party against him. lie has made a huge mistake which remands him to the ranks of the fanatics. Courier-Journal. It is believed that Speaker Kerr will make the Hon. W. C. Whit thorne, of Tennessee, chairman of the Committee on Naval Affairs. As this committee will perhaps find it necessary to handle Robeson and his extravagant doing, the public will be glad to know that Gen. Whitthojne is not in the habit of wearing gloves. Courier-Jou rnal. An informal meeting of some of the stockholders of the M. & K Railroad was held in Capt. Dear er ior''s office iast Monday morning. The object of the meeting was, to ascertain how much of the subscrip tion could be realized within the next few days, and from the senti ments expressed by the members present, we judge that they intend for the work to be pushed forward as rapidly as possible. It was in deed gratifying to note such a dis position on the part of the subscrib ers to meet their engagements promptly, and we hope the manag ers of the enterprise will have no cause of complaint. Lawrence Press. Ge neral Orville E. Babcock is in a certain sense to President Grant what Boswell was to Dr. Johnson. If the president has any ideas, Bab cock becomes acquainted with them. He is the confidential secretary of the president, and popularly known as his "tried and trusted friend," who is giaopled to the presidential soul with hootis of steel. "Nobody believes that General Habcock has had anything to do with the whisky ring," says an Administration pa per. Habcock has sneered at the intimations as to his complicity. So Joyce sneered; so McDonald sneer ed; so Avery sneered. But, under the soft euphemism of "Sylph," Habcock has been detected as a ring master among the crocked whisky fraternity. The telegrams produced at Avery's trail tell the story very clearly. The favorite's head must come off. "Let no guilty man escape," grimly proclaims the president. The light ning striks close to his excellency, lie feels its warm breath upon him, and then beholds a dimlj- defined vision of McDonald and Joyce, boon companions are proven to be thieves and swindlers. This is Usses S. Grant, president of the United States. Courier Journal. I resident's Message. The President's message was read in both Houses of Congress on Tuesday 7th. It occupies seven columns and a half. The American says-"it is mainly noticeable for the absence of what most persons ex pee led to find some belligerent allus ions to Spain in connection with Cuban affairs. Instead of this, it is. mild and cooing, and people will re new their wonder as to what all those recent extraordinary naval prepara tions meant. Outside of the long discussion of Spanish affairs, the moit suggestive points brought out are those relating to common school education and the taxing of church property. The latter is strongly re commended, and very plausible reas ons ai e assigned therefor. There is just a mild flavor of the no-popery idea in the suggestions about schools enough to make men of the Bishop Ifavea order throw up their hat and yell for a third term. Specie resumption at an early day is urged. Various other subjects are discussed at length, and some dis posed of ii a paragraph. One mat ter that is not touched upon although it ought to have been, is the whisky ring, and its mammoth frauds upon the government. The reasons for ignoring such animpor tar.t subject will be variously guess ed at and commented oa." The message is remarkable for contain ing a great deal about nothing. The crooked-whisky cases of Mc Kee, of the St. Louis Globe-Democrat, Coastantine Maguire and Con duce Megrue will not le tried on the 15th inst, as the court has ordered them to be certified for the fiVfct Monday in January. There will then be a new jury and a new judge (Dillon), and the defendants think f hey will staud a better chance of acquittal. In the mean time, the sensation will be the trial of Bab cock.
