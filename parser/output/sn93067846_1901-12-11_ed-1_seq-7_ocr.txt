DISGOSSiNfi THE NEW TREATY. Objection Raised to Some of its Terms-Southern Senators Lead Opposition. Washington, Dec. 6.-The senate committee on foreign relations report? ed favorably on the new Hay-Paunce fote treaty providing for the construc? tion of an isthmian canal. The committee was in session for almost two hours and went over in de? tail the provisions of the convention. -No votes were cast against it, but it was criticised very sharply by Sena? tors Money and Bacon, who found in it many "of the objections which they raised against the old treaty. They took especial exception to the provision continuing in force the neu? trality provisions of the Clayton-Bul wer treaty, and also to police the canal as placing a iimtiation upon the pow? der of this country to absolutely con? trol it. The contention was made that the effect of the treaty as sent to the senate would be to deprive the United States of the control of the canal in case of war. Especial attention was cailedjto the provision in the pream? ble of the pending treaty reserving article 8 of the Clayton-Bul wer treaty from the repeal provision of the new treaty. The portion of this atrticle of the old treaty to which especial objection was maude, reads as follows : "In granting, however, their joint protection to any such canals or rail? ways as are by this article specified, it is always understood by the United States and Great Britain that the par? ties constructing or owning ? the same shall impose no other charges or con? ditions of traffic thereupon than the aforesaid governments shall approve of as just and equitable ; and that the same canals or railways, being open to the citizens and subjects of the "United States and Great Britain on ?equal terms,shall also be open on like terms to the citizens and subjects of ?very other State which is willing to grant thereto such protection as the United States and Great Britain en? gage to afford." Senators Money and Bacon did not go to the extent of voting against the report of the treaty, and they acknowl? edged they are anxious to see it ' rati? fied because of their great desire to have the canal built. Still, they in? sisted that the treaty as it now stands is very objectionable in case of the .contingency of war. Senator Frye presided over the meeting and he authorized Senator Lodge to report the treaty to the senate on Monday next in case there should be an executive session on that day. It also was the sense of the commit? tee that the consideration of the treaty should be pressed as speedily as possi? ble in the senate, some senators oxpresing the hope tb.at action might be secured before the adjournment for the holidays. The ?omniittee also votes to recommend that the injune- ! idon of secrecy be removed from the treaty. Senator Bacon moved the revival of the amendment to the original Hay-Pauncefote treaty which was sug? gested by Senator Davis, then chair? man of the committee, and adopted by the senate. That amendment pro? vided that nothing in the treaty should ""apply to measures which the United States may find it necessary to take for securing by its own forces the de? fense of the United States and the maintenance of public order." The amendment was voted down viva voce. 

ISTHMIAN CANAL BILL. i Washington, Dec. 6.-Representative Hepburn, of Iowa, introduced his isthmian canal bill, which, by reason of his being the author of the bill passed last year and his probable appointment on che commerce committee, . is regarded as the measure which will serve as a basis for action by the house. It differs from the Hepburn bill* passed last year in making the total appropriation $180, - OOO, OOO instead of $140, OOO, OOO. Of the total amount $10,000,000 is made im? mediately available to begin work in other respects the bill follows that of last year, authorizing the president to acquire a right of way from Costa Bica and Nicaragua, and then to di? rect the secretary of war to begin the construction, from Greytown on the Caribbean sea to Bri to on the Pacific ocean, with suitable defenses* etc. ---P- I I - - ?

Light Thrown on the Patronym of this Brilliant Financier. A new method of "making money" has developed in western Carolina and upper South Carolina which has made those who started the enterprise rich, while those who became agents are realizing bountifully. This par? ticular enterprise is called the "Amos Owen Cherry Tree company," of Rutherford county. What it is, or what its particular methods are, we have not learned. It has developed to the degree that some of our esteemed oont?mpora ries, notably the Charlotte Observer, have felt called upon to sug? gest in unmistakable but mild terms that it is a "fake." But the name is striking. A com? bination, of "Amos Owen" and the "Cherry Tvree" would naturaly in? spire' confidence in western North Carolina. Every school boy knows the virtue which has attached to the cherry tiee since the days of George "Washington, who afterwards achieved some distinction in grubbing up an? other tree which had taken root on this side of the Atlantic. The "Amos Owen" prefix however, is not so well appreciated by the world at large. If our memory serve? us well, a gentleman by that name who hailed from the Rutherford neighborhood or settlement was an inveterate frequent? er o.f the federal court at Asheville during the late Judge Dicks adminis tration, and as persistently intruded himself upon the defendant side of the docket devoted to those whose "per suasion" led them to cultivate the worm which though it dieth in one spot lives to "run' in another. Uncle Amos was one of those intensely loyal old patriots when believed this was a free country, and anything to the con? trary was due solely to the pernicious activity of the federal courts-a new invention of the radical party so far as his knowledge went-and its minions. "Before the war" he had indulged in the exhilerating if not always profit? able pastime of converting the corn of the valleys into the dew of the moun? tains and there was none to make him afraid. It requred frequent semi? annual visits to Asheville, and a seri? ous but sympathetic interview on each occasion with Judge Dick, ending in varitably with the kindly admonition "$100 and costs," to convince the old gentleman that Uncle Sam insisted on a "davide" in all such undertakings After having gone through this per formance time after time, and the name of "Amos Owen" was again called in court, the amiable and kindly hearted judge ventured to express sur prise not unmingled with disappoint meut and a, little disgust that such things could be year in and year ont, and addressing the venerable defendant said: "Amos, I am surprised to see you here again, -after the leniency of the court in the past and your solemn promise that you would not violate the law .again. I see I must be more severe with you. You have given this court a great deal of trouble" And right here was Amos' opportu? nity and he seized it with both hands, He interrupting, with that sharp, shrill voice of his, and with a dead earnestness in his blue eyes, said "Yes, ?edge, and this court has gin me a great deal of trouble too'." Amos went home with the usual '$100 and costs." And we suspect the "$100" with all its predecessors stands on the docket to his "credit" to this day, but never adding any? thing to Uncle Sam's treasury. If a ""Cherry Tree" enterprise has been turned loose upon our western friends with the patronymical endorsement of the "Amos Owen" of old, we are not surprised that it has been a howling success from the start. A coombination of Amos Owen and the Cherry Tree must possess virtues of some sort of good for the human family if taken with prudence and strictly according to directions. Aa SY?ssf?list's Story.

The south is the only part of the country where the habit of removing their hats when they find ladies in an elevator is generally observed by gen? tlemen. Washington is largely a southern city and this custom is re? garded by a majority of men there, though it is nothing like as common as it is in Atlanta and other distinct? ly southern cities. An effort is being made to abolish the habit of removing hats in eleva? tors. In the corridors of several large office buildings notices have been conspicu? ously posted to the effect that good taste does not require this courtesy. It is said, however, that tho men behave just as they formerly did when riding in elevators with lady passen? gers. Those who were in the habit of removing their hats continue to do so regardless of the gratuitous informa? tion that good taste does not require that mark of respect, for ladies. These gentlemen prefer to decide matters Jof taste for themselves and not leave them to the proprietors or janitors of office buildings. It is. of course, a question of taste whether men should take off their hats when riding in elevators with ladies. Some men see no sense in it, and therefore do not do it. Others consider it courteous and respectful to observe the custom and would feel uncomfortable if they were compelled to keep their hats on when they met ladies in elevators. No law or notice in office buildings or anywhere can carry into effect notices that gentle? men should not remove their hats in elevators and so every man will con? tinue to do as he pleases about the matter. We expect to see our present custom observed by men generally in the south for a long time to come. Atlanta Journal. 

QUEEN OF HOLLAND'S UNHAPPY MARRIAGE. She and Her Prince Consort Do Not Bet Along Well, Bot She Has Gallant Defenders. London, Dec. 6.-A dispatch to The Evening News from The Hague, pub? lished today says : "Peace reigns again at the palace, and the happiest man in Holland is Maj. Van Tete, who was wounded in defense . of Queen Wilhelmina, by Prince Henry, or, as all Dutchmen now contemptuously call him 'the German. ' Van Tete is one of the ten noble youths who formed the body guard of the smiling young queen when she was married in February, and who have since been at their royal mistress' beck and call on every occa? sion. They pride themselves on their servitude, and in this matter of fact twentieth century their chivalrous' devotion to Queen Wilhelmina is a pretty thing to see. It is whispered that every man of the ten handsome yoHths who surround her majesty's carriage when she drives abroad, skate with her when she skates, ride with her when she rides and dance at? tendance on her generally has been, at one time or another, over head and ears in love with the dainty little lady in whom Holland's hopes are centered. Official contradictions not? withstanding nobody at The Hague doubts for a moment that the queen and her consort have been at logger? heads practically since the wedding. Prince Henry is an unpleasant person. He eats too much, drinks too freely and hunting occupies him far more than his wife, and Wilhelmina, on her side, is not a woman to allow herself to be neglected with impunity. It is said that she staunched Van Tets wound with her own hands, and in? sisted on her husband begging par? don of the Jonkherr as well as of her? self before she would forgive him.? All the romance of the marriage of Wilhelmina and the man she herself chose has disappeared." Eealth and. Bsauty. A poor complexion is usually the result of a torpid liver or irregular action of the bowels. Unless nature's refuse is carried off it will surely cause impure blood. Pimples, boils and other eruptions follow. This is nature's method of throwing off the poisons which the bowels, failed to re? move. DeWitt's Little Early Risers are world famous for remedying this condi? tion. They stimulate the liver and pro? mote regular and healthy action of the bowels, but never cause griping, cramps or distress. Safe pills.-J S Hughson <fc Co Hester's Cotton Statement.

Vaccination in London. The statistics of smallpox in London, England, when 420 cases had been re? ported up to Saturday last, present a tough nut for the anti-vaccinationists to crack. The rate of mortality among the vaccinated was 20 per cent. ; among the un vaccinated, 60. All of the twenty-three smallpox pa? tients under five years of age were un vaccinated, and nineteen died. Of those under ten all but one were vac? cinated, and twenty-nine out of forty two died Of eighty-one children un? der fifteen years of age fifty-seven were unvaccinated and thirty-eight died; twenty-four were vaccinated and twenty-three of them recovered. Out of fourteen unvaccinated patients over forty years of age twelve died. These specific cases are more impressive than the total, but even this shows an immense advantage for the vacci? nated. The disease seems to have taken on a very virulent type in Lon? don, judging by the number of deaths. It is said that it is not true that the poorest districts have suffered most, but that no part of London has been exempt. Courier Journal.

C., Dec. 6.-At an early hour this morning a Canadian Pacific freight train was proceeding east at a slow rate around a dangerous curve, 400 feet above the Frazier river, when Engineer Randall suddenly came upon a rock slide scarcely 50 " yards ahead of him. A signal was given to the brakemen and the engine was reversed, but it was too late. The train was going scarcely five miles an hour, but the heavy train behind piled the engine on the rocks and before the engineer and fireman could jump, the engine rolled over and over 300 feet down the bluff to the river. Engi? neer Randall and Fireman Potruff were crushed to death beneath the engine. Three cars were wrecked, going over the bank after the engine. Traffic was delayed six hours.
