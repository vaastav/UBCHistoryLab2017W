UTTER ATTACK ON MINORITY LEADER Uair ef Florida nnd Shackleford of Mlmirl Denannc Distribution of (mlltrr Appoint-meats. WASHINGTON, Pec. li.-The "waahlna; of democratic llnm for the amusrtnrnt of republicans." as Mr. William, the minor ity trader, put It Monday, occupied the at tention of the house for more then four hour today. The result accomplished wa defl thrown at the minority leader by Representative turner of Florida and an other by Representative Shackleford of Missouri. The complaint of both resulted rrom the failure of Mr. Williams to recom mend their reappointment a member of committee rn Interstate and foreign com inerce. Both mndu Ung speeches In which Mr. Williams' lt.-nik-riship wan assailed from many points. Mr. Williams replied to Mr. ltmir at some length, und briefly to Mr. Shackleford. His defense was that last ses sion the democrats on this committee were divided and he deemed It necessary for the good of the party and country that a united minority report should bo made on the sub ject of railroad rate legislation. At times there was high tension In the debate. Mr. Lamar was particularly bitter In his criticism and openly declared that Ills heretofore personal friendship for Mr. Williams was forever at an end unless the criticism of himself were retracted. Ho, however, would -recognise Mr. Williams as the party leader. Mr. Shackleford denounced all bosses and placed himself entirely independent of party leadership in the house. The subject undur discussion was the committee distribution of the annual message of President Roose velt. At the conclusion of the democratic de bate this had not been accomplished and :he house adjourned. . Moadell and Miller Change. When the house met today Speaker Can non announced the transfer of Representa tive Mondell (Wyo.) from the committee on military affairs to the public lands, und of Mr. Miller (Kan.) from public lands to military affairs. The transfer gives the two merhbers the same committee assign ments they had in the last congress. Committee reference of the annual mes sage of President Roosevelt waa made according to subjects treated. The ques tion of federal control of Insurance waa assigned to the committee on ways and means. In explanation of this Mr. Payne aid that In his opinion the only way the I'nlted States can deal with Insurance com panies is through the taxing power, and over this the ways and means committee has jurisdiction.- - "What was done with that weighty sub ject of election expense?" queried Mr. c'ockran (New York), "It went to the committee on tho elec tion of president, vice president and mem bers of congress," replied Mr. Payne. Reverting to the -insurance question Mr. Mann asked Mr. Payne if the committee on Interstate and foreign commerce would tint have jurisdiction should it be doter wined that insurance could be regulated as commerce. This was for the publio to de termine, replied Mr. Payne. Objection to sending the insurance ques tion to ways- and means committee was made by M,r. Ilepburn. (Ia.). Mr. Hepburn . maintained " that the com merce clause of the constitution gave con gress power to control Insurance. Lasanr Attacks Williams. . ' Mr. Jamar (Fla.) was recognized and reverted to the, question of committeo ap notntments he had referred to on Mon- .My. Mr. Williams, the minority leadar, at "lice left his seat and took up a place near Mr. Umax. Speaking of the leadership f Mr. Williams, Mr. Lamar said he would recognise him as the party leader, but not personally "until he relieves me of an unjust charge on his part." He stated that he did not agree with Mr. Williams that republicans would en joy personalities between democrats. Em iiiiaalslng this he referred to the personal debate of last session between Mr. Sullivan and -Pot-stil! Scotch Maaro'a. 4 ha emly a-.infer supply tag whiakr to loo

At that time he charged the minority leader had made no objection to the procedure. Mr. Lamar re-erted to the great Im portance of railroad rate legislation and reviewed the action of the house at the last session, which Included voting down the Davey bill, proposed by the minority. The Davey bill, be said.' had first been adopted by a democratic caucus. The minority leader, he said, was forced to amend the Davey bill on the floor of the house or see it go out to the country In an Imperfect condition. If that caucus was binding then he challenged the minority leader to deny the fact that no one could have amended It. He conceded that the minority leader should have power . to make committee removals as well ns ap pointments, but he must exercise that power in the face of moral obligation and a reasonableness. - Mr. Lamar concluded with the statement that he considered his removal from the commerce committee an act absolutely un tenable and an aspersion upon .his private character. Mr. Lamar said it had gone to the coun try through the press that the Minority leader would not tolerate followers of Hearst. He charged Mr. Williams with contributing more In 'one minute to demo cratic 'Inhnrmony" tlmn he (Mr. Lamar) had in a year, lie admitted that on Mon day he was in' the heut of anger and glad that he had been stopped. However, bis personal friendship for Mr. Williams had ceased. Williams Belittles Question. Mr. Williams was at once recognized to reply. : ' . "I am," he said, "about to perform a very unpleasant duty, and oxti as to the wisdom of which I have serious ' doubts. The gentleman takes himself too seriously. He thinks 'he can make a national Issue out of a committee assignment, but ho can t do It. He thinks he was removed, but he was not. There was no committee." Mr. Williams aaked if he would not have been lacking In moral courage In every essential of a floor leader If he had mode up a minority membership of the commerce committee which would have been divided four to two on the question of railroad rates. "My brother would have gone off that committee under the same circumstances," said Mr. Williams, and he added that had the Hearst bill received the minority sup port in committee he would have supported It in caucus. Comparing Mr. Lamar to his great uncle, L. Q. C. Lamar. Mr. Williams said the uncle possessed "superb egotism, but he also possessed to consecrate it, a superb In tellect." Does Xot Love Hearst. The conversion to' the Hearst bill he lik ened to the conversion of Saul on his way to Damascus. It was Inspired, he declared. Applause followed Mr. Williams when .he said he had not allowed personalities to influence his transaction of publio business. He referred to the committee appointments of Mr. Hearst labor and Irrigation of arid lands and admitted he did not . love Mr. Hearst. "Why should I love a millionaire who owns many newspapers which lie seems to be devoting to tearing me downT" he asked. Mr. Lamar' at once appealed for recogni tion, as did Mr." Shackleford. Mr. Lamar was recognized. He spoke with feeling and charged that tho minority leader had called the rate bill caucus' of last session because ho waa angry ut being turned down by his colleagues on the Milea amendment. "It waa not a caucus, it was a gold brick." he said. Mr. Williams Interrupted to caution Mr. Lamar and "to prevent unpleasant ' things from tiappenlng," adding that "the gentle man Is not permitted to use Insulting lan guage on. the floor, of this house.", , Mr. .'Lamar referred to a letter of 'criti cism of Mr. Hearst by Mr. Williams. The latter denied the criticism. During this de nial Mr. Shackleford ' commended Mr. Hearst personally and his rate bill. He said he was glad to see that President Roosevelt In his message had "Come around to the Hearst bill." Shackleford Contradicts Williams. "The word of one Missouri democrat Is equal to that of two leaders," was a re tort of Mr. Shackleford to a statement of Mr. Williams denying the use of cer. tain language at the St. Louis conven tion. "Out In Missouri we have raised the cry, 'Down with the bosses.' " declared Mr. Shackleford, who insisted that the wishes of his constituents were much more to him than the leadership of Mr. 'William. Continuing his denunciation of bosses, Mr. Shackleford said It was the McCalla and McCurdys who prevented the election of W. J. Bryan as president and that H. H. Rogers and J. Plerpont Morgan would be delighted to have the democracy of the country uoder the control of one boss. Mr. Williams said he had enough and did not desire to reply. People Afraid of Democrats. "The trouble is." he continued, turning to the republican side of the chamber, "that the people of the country are tired of you and are afraid of us and it Is par tially on account of auoh things that happened here this morning that it Is afraid of us." The democratic party, Mr. Williams said. would vote for a republican rate bill If It contained power to name a substitute rate, to put and keep it In force and to ' regulate private car lines and other abuses. Mr. Rodenburg (111.) Inquired If It would be In order to move that the balance of the session be devoted to. the publio busi ness. "A parliamentary. Inquiry," ahouted Mr. Cushman (Wash ). "Would It be In - order to move that the committee do now rise out of further respect ' to the de ceased T" (Laughter.) t,. Without completing the assignment of the president's message, the house at 4:06 adjourned until tomorrow.

NATIONAL LEAGUE MEETING Harry C Pnlliam is E-alotd President, 8ecrtary snd TreMurtr. DIRECTORS' BOARD INCREASED TO FIVE : eMBBBSBSBsanSBf Committee la Appointed , to Confer wltk Otner OrsaaUotflo Re a-ardlae- One-Man Draft ing Rale. NEW YORK. Dec. 13. Harry C. Pulllam waa today re-elected president, secretary and treasurer of the National league of base ball players. James A. Hart, the re tiring president of tho Chicago club, was placed in nomination against Mr. Pulllam by John T. Brush, president of the New Tork club, but declined to run. Despite this fact, . two votes were cast for Mr. Hart, one by Mr. Brush and one by Aug ust Herrmann of the Cincinnati club, It was unofficially stated. The casting of these, ballots for' Mr. Hart, In opposition to his expressed wishes, led to the Intro duction of a resolution declaring "It Is the sense of this meeting that James A. Hart, who was tendered a complimentary vote for president, secretary and treasurer, was in no. respect a candidate." The unanimous adoption of this resolu tion practically made the selection of Mr. Pulllam unanimous. Dreyfus. Nominates Pulllam. Barney Dreyfus of Pittsburg nominated Mr. 'Pulllam. Messrs. Shettsline of Phila delphia, Ebbetts of Brooklyn and Murphy Of Chicago seconding. There was no second to the nomination of Mr. Hart, who had made a speech - declaring that under no circumstance would he opposo Mr. Pull lam; : , After the constitution had been amended so as to provide for five directors instead of four.- and eliminating the geographical qualifications of. the dire-.tors two from the east 'and two from the west the fol lowing directors' were chosen: Messrs. A. H. Soden of Hoston, Barney Dreyfus of Pittsburg, Charles H. Kbbetts of Brooklyn. W. J. Shettsline of Phila delphia and Charles W. Murphy of Chi cago. The old board consisted of Messrs. Dreyfus, Brush, Hart and SoUen. Committees Are Appointed. Messrs.' Brush, Herrmann and Ebbetts were reappointed a committee on constitu tion and Messrs. ; Hanlon, Dreyfus and Murphy were named as the committee on playing rules.. The question of , having uniform .tickets' of admission was referred to a committee. At' the 'meeting today of the National Association of Minor Leagues the only business of ; moment transacted was the appointment of 'a committee consisting of Messrs. Watklns, Farrell und Shlvely to confer, with other organisations relative to the one-man' drafting system. This com mittee appeared at the meeting of the Na tional league and requested that a commit tee be appointed by that body to consult with, them and Ban Johnson, who had previously been appointed for that purpose by the American league. Mr. Herrmann waa named to represent the National league. New Maa-nate In Base Ball. The advent of Charles W. Murphy, former well known newspaper man, as a National league magnate, representing the Chicago club, was a decided, feature of the convoca tion of base ball moguls this week. Mr. Murphy," who has attended these gatherings as a news gatherer, wore his new honors with becoming modesty and seems quite a factor In the deliberations, for a fledgling, aa he 'terms himself. Before the meeting he waa deluged with congratulations 'ori the signal success of the Chicago Nationals In recently demonstrating their decided su periority over their rivals In that city. Pre dictions were heard in many quarters that the champions of Chicago, with their great staff of twlrlera.; will be strong factors In the coming National league race. Brush Of New Tork and Dreyfuss of Pittsburg are both cognisant of the strength of the Chicago team and realize that the club which wins more games in 1906 than Chance's men will doubtless win the flag In the old league." Veteran newspaper men who are attending the National league meeting have repeatedly shown undisguised gratification over the meteoric flight of Murphy one of them In the base ball world. "He'll make good with Interest," waa the opinion volunteered by a veteran base ball editor of Boston and which was Indorsed by all who heard it. From one of the magnates it waa learned that Murphy made a decided hit In tho meeting after he had been formally intro duced by his veteran predecessor. Colonel James A. Hart. The following Is an epi tome of his speech, which was character istic for Its humor and brevity: Mr. President and fellow members of the National league: I am naturally gratified over the eulogistic introduction of myself as a club president by Mr. Hart, and t take this opportunity to pledge my loyalty to the time-honored National league, which has been likened by some to J hat august and ultro-exclusive body of statesmen, the United States sen ate. Incidentally, I shall recall the reputud statement of .1 once new member of the senate and let you judge whether It Is ap propos in connection with my debut here. An Ohio mail, who had never shown the ability of a Oladstone or Disraeli, was elected to the senate. Many regarded his election as a huge Joke and after he had been in Washington a week or so. he met a constituent, who asked: "Well, how does it feel to be a senator?" "During the first day," replied the new senator, "I employed most of my time wondering how I had really got there. After 1 had been there for a few days longer, however, had listened attentively to Measures Introduced and the accompanying speeches. I began to wonder how the other fellows had got there." Seriously, gentlemen, I wish to add that the National league is doubtless the great est association for the promotion of ath letics ever organised and I shall always strive In my humble way to uplift and foster it. - ' Oxnard'Bnye Derby Winner.

The largest crowd of the present roller skating attended the Auditorium rink Inst evening, the principal attraction being the much talked of race between Harley David son, holder of many chamiionhipM, nnd six local aspirants for skaiiiiK honors. The six ambitious young men failed to cause Mr. Davidson any unxlety ut any stage, of the game, although they did mako a game fight for the honors. The race was three miles, tins six local racers tunning In relays of half a mile each. F. A.

Then J. W. Weeks fell during his half mile and gave Davidson an opportunity to get a lead which he increased until the close, finishing with Clinton Higby, over a lap to the good. During the race Davidson proved himself to be a wlsard on roller skates. He gave another pt his exhibitions of fancy bkating and jumping. FYiday evening Davidson will raco one mile with E. C.
