GOVERNMENT COTTON REPORT Showing Area in .Production andJSsti matcd Yield Per Acre. Washington, Dec. 11. The statistician of the agricultural department reports 5,900,000 bales as the probable cotton pro duction of the United States for 1S33-1900. This estimate is based on a larger num ber of both general and special reports than has ever been received by the de partment in connection with a cotton crop. While weather conditions during the past thirty days have been mainly favorable to whatever picking remained to be done, so that the general condition of the crop is slightly better than ane week ago, continued investigations leave absolutely no doubt that the crop is even, smaller than was indicated in either sta tistician's previous reports. Estimated productive area, in thousands of acres, is as follows: Virginia, 437; Louisiana, 1,179; North Carolina, 1,212; Texas, 6,642; South Carolina, 2.212; Arkansas, 1,726; Georgia, 3,288; Tennessee, 81G; Florida, 149; Oklahoma, 199; Alabama, 2.8S3; Indian Territory, 299; Mississippi, 2,704; Missouri, 772.

An exciting time was counted upon on the stock exchange this morning and the expectations of out siders who gathered in the galleries to witness the ferment were not disappoint ed. Saturday's fall in prices had brought in a large volume of selling orders from holders of long stock, who have been clinging to their holdings in the expecta tion that the market would weather the money difficulties until the end of the year and prices would resist any serious decline. The propensity which prompts humanity to "follow the leader," was strikingly exemplified in the morning stock market, when people who would not think of selling stocks last week, when they were worth 5 to 15 points higher, tumbled over each other to sell this morning. Many of them were forced to by the- calling of loans with which they were holding their stocks. Last week's shrinkage of value of stocks placed as collateral for loans &erved to cut down the credit facilities of opera tors. The news of a serious reverse to the British arms in South Africa awaken ed lively apprehension in the minds of Wall Street and was an aid to the bears in the hullabaloo they raised to encour age the decline. The so-called trust stocks were the center of attack and Tennessee Coal, Brooklyn Transit, Ameri can Tobacco, Sugar, Tin Plate and Colo rado Fuel were all severely handled. A perusal of the net changes in prices of stocks as a result of the day's trad ing will give but a faint conception of the violent vicissitudes through which the market passed during the five hours session. During the morning nours the drastic liquidation which was forced up on the market caused great gaps in 1r values of securities apd the market took on an appearance of demo-a'Izit'on. The wide variations in prices between sj'es, running as high as 3 points, were evi dence of the urgent character of the sell ing. At the low point the scale of prices presented a lecldedly ragged dppeornte, the declines in the long list of specialties ranging, as compared with Saturday's close, all the way from 3 to 21 points, the latter in Tennessee Coal. Notwith standing the day's violent fluctuations the market closed with few net losses exceed ing 2 points. The liquidation seemed to have been very thorough, and the great Improvement in the tone of the market during the latter part of the day re flected the benefit to the health of the speculative situation. The influences at work were so broad and well defined that they are soon stated. One leading cause of the weakness was the large decline made last week, which wiped out or near ly exhausted margins on speculative ac count, and the calling for additional mar gins forced large blocks of stocks on the market. -Many were forced to liquidate, and there was a large continent whose hopes of an upward turn in prices halt become exhausted and who threw i.ver their holdings in disgust, determined to wait a more favorable opportunity. The news of the heavy reverse to the British arms in South Africa helped to unettle this market. London hought stocks here in the first hour, but this was simply to cover sales made earlier in London at a beUer figure. The very violence of the selling movement worked its own remedy. The bears were steady buyers for th .,et of the day and there was a sufficient contingent of bargain-hunters on hand to afford assistance toward the recovery in prices. The character of the Interests which were most acutely dist essed wa? shown by conspicuous weakness in the highly speculative Industrials. Besides the declines of 21 points in Tennese Coal, there were losses of fom to seven roints in most of the metal group. Su gar, Tobacco and the New York special ties. The net loss of Tennessee Coal and Iron for the day was 13 points. In tie railroads only a few cases occurred where declines reached over two points, New York Central, Pennsylvania, a number of the Coalers, and Southern Pacific, being conspicuous examples. Kansas and Texas was down nearly four points. The vigorous and determined support in Su gar was th turning point in the day's market. Thi specialty was run up In the late dealings 74 points above the low point, scoring a full recovery but of the quarterly dividend which was deducted from the price today. There was the sub sequent decline of 1 points and the stock closed l1 higher than Saturday. The general lit closed for the most part firm at the recovery- Except for the re lief afforded bv the dav's liquidation the signs of lightness in the money markets at the world werj unabated.

New York, Dec. 1L There was great demand for money today, 15 per cent ruling for some early transactions. A large bank which has made heavy loans marked up those outstanding to 10 per cent and scrutinized closely the collateral offered for new transactions at higher rates. One Wall Street bank required from 20 to 25 per cent margin, besides 10 to 15 points to spare on the stock for $100,000 loans. Fifteen or twenty par cent of good industrials were accepted on this basis, where the borrower's name was satisfactory. In all, from $35,$$$ to $40, 000 was called and paid off, then two or three millions loaned at 6 to 7; large rip plies then loaned down to 3 per cent Sterling exchange advanced U per rent for demand bills. While bankers were puzzled over the mqney situation here and abroad, the prediction was made that demand bills would rule higher through out the week, with no prospect, how3ver, of touching the exporting point. One of the largest foreign exchange houses re ported today's rate as fully 2 cents below the figure at which gold under present conditions could be profitably sent abroad. Chicago, Dec. 11. In the face of the Wall Street panic the steadiness of the stock list here elicited comments of sur prise. Ylth one or two exceptions and these, it is stated, due to other causes the list was steady, in some cases show ing gains. The grain pit, however, felt the influence to an extent, cash wheat dropping 1 cent and the May option ?4c. 

HENRY CLEWS ON THE MESSAGE Commenting: Fnvora'i y on Its Finan cial and Other Utterances, New York, Dec. H. Henry Clews' week ly financial circular contains the follow ing on the financial portion of President MoKinley's recent annual message to congress: "The president's message has wonj more approval than usual. His clear utterance for the gold standard, his pru dent yet progressive attitude on foreign affairs and his advice to congress to give the monopolistic trusts careful attention three most Important topics, treated without a partisan touch all show that he is fully entitled to the confidence of the people. The present session of con gress has much important work before it. Foreign questions will occupy much of its time, and domestic problems will require some serious thought. As a disturber of business this congress, however, prom ises to be less serious than usual. On the contrary, it is probable that one of Its first acts will be to put the country squarely on the gold standard and take the first step toward securing a scientific currency system. When this is accom plished, there will be renerifcd cause for confidence regarding the future. The passage of such a bill will certainly be favorable to all business interests. Until easier rates for money are in sight, how ever, buying of securities should be con ducted with extra caution. The presi dent's message is a well-written and con servative document and should be satis factory to the great mass of the Ameri can people. All the questions to which he refers are presented in a full and com prehensive manner. The most important of these is the one relative to the gold standard and upon which he declares him self in words so clear and expressive as to lea'e no room for misunderstanding. The president has now fulfilled his elec tion pledges and conformed to every ren dition of the policy to which he com mitted himself when nominated for the position which he has thus far so hon orably and faithfully filled. One of his most important implied promises in the course of the policy which he prescribed for himself, more expressively after his election, was the prosperity of the coun try. This intention has "been realized al most beyond the dreams of avarice, when we consider the frightful depression which brought the country almost to the verge of bankruptcy during the two years pre ceding his advent to the presidential chair. "Pres'dent McKinley promised to main tain tho gold standard. He has done so despl:e the most vigorous opposition; also, to adjust the tariff to the require ments cf our industries, and to stop the outflow of gold from the treasury, bring ing the receipts and expenditures of the government to counterbalance each other. And he did all this despite the interven tion cf a war with a foreign power, the affairs of which he managed like an ex perienced ceneral." Of the presidnt's treatment of trusts, expansion and the eastern question, Mr. Clews says: "He now hands the trust question the great bete noire of business and labor interests over to congress and recommends the serious consideration of the question to that -body. With regard to our foreign relations and dependencies in the far east he takes a wide and statesmanlike view of the whole matter. His attitude upon all the questions now before the people should enlist the sup port of the entire country." THi:
