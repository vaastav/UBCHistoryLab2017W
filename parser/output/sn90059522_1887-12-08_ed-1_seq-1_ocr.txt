Chicago Against the Field in the Race for the Repub lican Covention. The Flour City Delegation Still Happy and Hopeful of Victory. Senator Farwell to Present a Bill Regarding" National Banks. Southern Comment on the Message—The Wool Deal ers Are Excited. Special to the Globe. Washington*. Dec. 7.— lt may seem Idle talk, but the Minnesota delegation has taken the city by storm, and Min neapolis stock has taken a bull move ment that is surprising. Omaha has entirely lowered its Hag. and Cin cinnati has voluntarily pledged itself to support the Flour City as against Chicago on the West and Philadelphia on the East. Cliicago had been booming New York as a club to knock out other competitors, but the mask is off, and the Windy City must fight it* battles on its merits. This afternoon the Cincinnati and Omaha delegations paid a friendly visit to the Minneapolis parlors, and a gen eral fraternization took place. Gov. Mel, ill astonished his friends by the warm and (.leasing address of wel come, while Col. Plummer wandered off into a political tirade that grew very tiresome. The result, as far as the con vention is concerned, still iiax«;s ix Tin: 

BALANCE. Committeemen are rapidly coming in. The meeting will occur to-morrow at the I'nion league rooms and the uncertainty will end. In spite of its confidence and general hilarity the Flour City delega tion seems severely chagrined over the failure of several prominent Republi cans to put in an appearance. Wash burn and Lowry were expected in the field, but they failed to come. Senator Davis may lie doing his best, but the boys d • not believe it. and if the convention does come to Minneapolis it will be because of the energy and activ ity of the younger delegates. Tim Byrnes. Freeman Lane. Eugene Hay. Jim Worrell, Carmen Smith, I!. G. Evans ; nd others of the young men are doing wonders in the way of work, and if they succeed they deserve the credit. The committee is also handicapped in a financial way. Other delegations are loaded down with greenbacks, which Ihey put where they will do the most good, while 1111 MIX.NKAI-OJ.ITAX* have barely enough in the delegation 101 lto pay legitimate expenses. Some of our delegation paid a visit to Perry- Carson, the colored member of the com mittee who beat Bob Ingersoll in 1884 as delegate to Chicago. He keeps a gin mill iii Pennsylvania avenue and is quite a power in his way. There are four colored men on the national com mittee and Carson can control them, hence the visit to his thirst factory, which was safely made. For the benefit of their families it may be said the Argonauts are all well and happy, and have kept their trait in the city of temptation-. But if they should get the convention they will paint Wash ington such a carmine as will be reflected in the sky even to far-away Minneap olis. And that, by the way, is what they expect. Mr. Kelly, who reached here to-day, said he was pleased at, what he heard, and believed Minneapolis might go home with the convention to-morrow. The claims of Minneapolis will be laid before the convention by Senator Win dom and Gov. Mellette, of Dakota. Helot. THIS SENATE. Not Much Business Transacted in the Upper Branch. Washington, Dec. 7.— After the pre sentation of various communications from heads of departments and the court of claims, Mr. Cullom remarked that the rule was when bills are introduced be fore committees are appointed, to have bills laid on the table, and that created unnecessary work. lie therefore moved that the senate adjourn. But he with drew the motion temporarily to*_>ermit Mr. Plumb to offer a resolution calling on tin- commissioner of agriculture for information as to whether any person in the employment of that department making experiments as to the manu facture of sugar from sorghum had ob tained or applied for a patent or patents connected with such manufacture and growing out of such experiment, The resolution was adopted. Mr. Parwell asked his colleague to withdraw his mo tion so as to allow him to introduce a bill to perpetuate the national bank system. Mr. Cullom declined and at 12:_0 the senate adjourned. Mr. Farwell's bill to perpetuate the national banking system provides that in lieu of United States bonds the banks may deposit state. municipal or railroad lannis of approved soundness and value. THE MESSAGE. What Leading Papers of the South Think About It. New Youk. Dee. 7.— The following editorials from some of the leading journals of the south are of interest, as (.bowing how that section views the president's plan for reducing the rev enue. The Charleston, S. C, News and Courier says: The president exposes with cruel courtesy •very fallacy of the protective argument, In deed a stronger or more comprehensive ex position of the weakness anil inherent in equality of the protective system hasn't been given to the public. Through it all, more over, there runs a vein of kindly sympathy end patriotic consideration. The New Orleans Times-Democrat Bays: The president declares himself in no un certain terms — a revenue reformer and op posed in protection pure and simple. We do not agree with the president in regard to the non-reduction of the tobacco tax. It is true that tobacco is not _ necessity, tint the tax is troublesome and burdensome to the agricul tural producer, and the cost of its collection it considerable. The Atlanta Constitution says: There is one fact to which Mr. Cleveland fails to call attention, namely: Thai the promises cf the l)cni<>cra_ic platform- ten be carried out by th repeal of ihe -Mean, rev enne law, which was framed to suit an emerg fucy long since passed, and which in its operation Is odious and unjust. 'the repeal of this law would so effectually do away with the surplus that congress would tie compelled to revise the tariff with such protection as the Chicago platform calls for, hut tbe free traders are opposed to this repeal for the reason that while the revenue tax is levied any attempt to reduce the tariff will merely result in increasing the surplus, and they will therefore have an excuse for putting their tree trade notion* into effect to some extent. That a man of practical common sense like Cleveland should walk into Koch a trap is surprising, tint he has not walked in without a protest, as his reference to the Chicago platform shows. 

WOOL i>i:.u..:i;s ri.OTEST. WasiiixgtoxJ Dec. 7. The following statement is made public to-night by the secretary of the conference of wool growers and wool dealers now in Wash ington: "The wool dealers and wool growers of the United States, repre senting a capital of over S__0,000,(JOO and a constituency of 1,000,000, wool growers and wool dealers assembled in conference in the city of Washington the 7th of December, 1887, having read the first annual message of the president to the fiftieth congress, declare that the sentiments of the message are a direct attack upon their industry, one of the most important of the country, and in positive violation of the national Demo cratic platform of 1884, as interpreted by the part] leaders and accepted by the rani; and tile of the party; that the ar gument made by the president for the removal of our "protection against for eign competition is the old one, repeat edly made by the enemies of our indus trial progress and effectively answered in nearly e\ery school district in our land, and so thoroughly disproved by the logic of facts and demonstration of experience ami history as to need no an swer from us."' . A 

CHRISTIAN CONI'KI.I.NCI*. It Opened at the Capital of the Nation Yesterday Moriiinjr. Washington, Dec. 7. A general Christian conference under the auspices and direction of the Evangelical Allance for the I'nited States opened in this city this morning. The conference met in response to a call issued by the al liance several months since and signed by President McCosh, of Princeton, ami a "large number of eminent clergymen and laymen from all of the Evangelical denominations in this country. The stated object of the conference is to dis cuss measures upon which all these de nominations may be broueht to unite to meet certain new and pressing emergen cies which have arisen in connection with the great increasing wealth, busi ness, immigration, the changed rela tions Of labor and capital, and the great and glowing percentage of our popula tion who are not church members or at tendants. The Congregational church, in which the conference met, and which is one of the largest in Washington, was completely filled when President Dodge called the meeting to order and briefly stated the reasons which led to the gathering and the results hoped for. The alliance, he said, had thoughtfully studied social and economic changes in the co tntry, and sought to know nether existing Chris tian organizations were suf ficient to meet growing needs. He re ferred to the organized power of the sa loons and said the church had Inst its hold on the workiugman. Everywhere among them is unrest and a looking for higher good. This means a grand op portunity and a turn for an applied Chris tianity. He said this gathering was called that facts may be presented and a conference, held as to the opportunity and the responsibility. At tne conclu sion of President Dodge's address the Hon. John .lay. of New York, spoke at length. The discussion of the subject was continued by Rev. Dr. S. J. Mc pherson, of Chicago. Justice strong, of the United States supreme court pre sided at this afternoon's session. Sena tor Colquitt, of Georgia' at the evening session, and Justice Harlan, of the United States supreme court will pre side to-morrow at the forenoon session. Notice was given of the cordial invita tion of President and Mrs. Cleveland to delegates to visit them at. the white house on Friday immediately titter the close of the forenoon session. The sub jects discussed during the day were the necessity of restricting immigration of the ignorant and vicious and the duly of placing higher moral standards be fore the lower classes. But Little Counterfeiting. Washington, Dec. 7.— The annual report of the chief ot the secret service division of the treasury was made public to-day. lt shows that tin-re were 355 persons arrested by the officers of the service during the past fiscal year for violation of the laws against counter feiting, etc. Of this number seventy were convicted and sentenced to im prisonment. The report says that the counterfeiting now being done is prin cipally the work of Italians, who op erate in bands in different portions of the country. The counterfeiting during the past year amounted practically to nothing, the only attempts in that di rection being a **__ silver certificate and a _~ silver certificate and these were such poor imitations as to be practically harmless.

SAINT PAUL, MINX., THURSDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 8, 1887. BLAINE HEARD FROM. The Man From Maine Makes His First Political Bluff for 1888. He Gets Himself Interviewed About President Cleve land's Message. He Would Give a Poor Man Tobacco, But Shut Off His Beer. Posing* as the Friend of Pro tected Labor—A Dexterous Document. New York, Dec. 7.— The Tribune of to-morrow will contain a long interview with lion. James 6. Blame on President Cleveland's message. It was taken in short-hand under the direction of the Tribune's Paris correspondent and sent by cable to-night, lt is as follows: 4 *l have been reading an abstract of the president's message and have been especially interested in the comments of the London papers. Those papers all assume to declare the message is a free trade manifesto, and evidently are an ticipating an enlarged market for Eng glisli fabrics in the Unitod States as a consequence of the president's recom mendations. Perhaps that fact stamped the character of the message more clearly than any words of mine can." "You don't mean ' actual free trade without duty.* queried the reporter. "No. no," replied Mr. Blame. "Nor do the London papers mean that. They simply mean that the president has rec ommended what in the United States is known aso a revenue tariff, rejecting the protective feature as an object and not even permitting protection to result freely as an incident to revenue duties." "I don't know that 1 quite compre hend that last point," said the reporter. "I mean.'' said Mr. Blame, "that for the first time in the history of the United States the president recommends retaining the internal tax in order that the tariff may be forced down even be low the fair revenue standard. He rec ommends that *?___■___] Till: TAX OX 

TOBACCO ; be retained, and" that many millions an- I nually shall be levied on a domestic I product which would far better come i from a tariff on foreign fabrics." • "Then do you mean to imply that you would favor the repeal of the tobacco tax." "Certainly, I mean just that," said Mr. Blame. "1 should urge that it be done at once, even before the Christmas holidays. It would in the first place bring great relief to growers of tobacco all over the country, and would, more over, materially lessen the price of the article to consumers. Tobacco to mill ions of men is a necessity. The presi dent calls it a luxury, but it is a luxury in no other sense than tea and coffee are luxuries. It is well to remember that the luxury ot yesterday becomes a neces sity of to-day. Watch, if you please, the number of men *at work on the farm, in the coal mine, along the railroad, in the iron foundry, or in any calling, and you will find 86 to 100 chewing while they work. After each meal the same proportion seek the solace of a pipe or a cigar. These men not only pay the millions of the tobacce tax, but pay on every plug and every cigar an enhanced price which the tax enables the manufacturer and retailer to impose. The only excuse for such a tax is Til.. ACTUAL XF.( KSSITY under which the government found it self during the war, and the years im mediately following. To retain the tax now in order to destroy the protection which would incidentally How from rais ing the same amo _Mt of money on for eign imports, is certainly a most extra ordinary policy for our government." "Well, then, Mr. Blame, would you advise the repeal of the whisk y 'tax also?" "No, 1 would not. Otlier conditions than those of financial adminstration are to be taken into account with re gard to whisky. There is a moral side to it. To cheapen the price of whisky is to increase the consumption enor mously. There would be no sense in urging the reform wrought by high license in many states if the national government neutralizes the good effect by making whisky within the reach of every one at 20 cents a gallon. Whisky would be everywhere distilled if the surveillance of the government were withdrawn by the remission of the tax, and illicit sales could not then be prevented even by a policy as rigorous and searching as that with which Russia pursues the Nihilists, It would destroy high license at once in all the states. Whisky has done a vast deal of harm in the United States. 1 would try to make it do some good. I would use the tax to fortify our cities on the seaboard. In view of the power ful letter addressed to the Democratic party on the " Sl'B.H-.CT OF FORTIFICATIONS by the late Samuel J. Tilden in 1885, I am ama__it that no attention has been paid to t lie subject by the Democratic 1 administration. Never before in the i history of the world has any govern | ment allowed great cities on* the sea i board, like Philadelphia, New York. Boston, Baltimore, New Orleans ami I San Francisco, to remain defenceless."' "But."' said the reporter, "you don't think we are to have war in any direc tion?" ••Certainly not," said Mr. Blame. "Neither, 1 presume, did Mr. Tilden when he wrote his remarkable letter. But we should change a remote chance into an absolute impossibility. If our weak and exposed points were strongly fortified, if to-day we had by any chance even such a war as we had with Mexico our enemy could procure ironclads in Europe that would menace our great cities with destruction, or lay them under contribution." "But would not our fortifying possi bly look as if we expected war?" "Why should it any more than the fortieations made seventy or eighty years ago by our grandfathers when they guarded themselves against suc cessful attack from the armaments of that day. We don't necessarily expect a burglar because we lock our doors at night, but if by any possibility a burglar conies it contributes vastly to our peace of mind and our sound sleep to feel that he can't get in.'' "But after the fortifications should lie constructed would you still maintain the tax on whisky?" "Yes," said Mr. Blame, "so long as there is whisky to tax 1 would tax it. and when the national government should have uo use for the money 1 would divide the tax among the federal union with the specific object of light ening the tax on real estate. The houses and farms of the whole country pay too large a proportion of the total taxes. If ultimate relief could Ik given in that direction it would. in my judgment, ben wise and l_.nc._ iccnt policy. Some honest but mis guided friuuls of [-ten.p.ranc3 have urged that the government should not use the 11101. derived from the tax on whisky. My reply is that THK TAX. OB WHISKY '. •V __ by the federal government, with its sup pression of all illicit distillation and consequent enhancement of price, has been a powerful agent in the t . mperance reform by putting it beyond the reach of so many. The amount of whisky consumed in the United States per capita to-day is not more than forty per cent of that consumed thirty years ago." After a lew moments' silence, Mr. Blame added that in his judgment the whisky tax should be so modified as to permit all who use pure alcohol in the arts or in mechanical pursuits to have it free of tax. In all such cases the tax could be omitted without danger of fraud, just as now the tax on spirits ex ported is remitted. "Besides your general and sweeping opposition to the president's recommen dation, have you any further specific objection?" "Yes," answered Mr. Blame. "I should seriously object to the repeal of the duty on wool. To repeal that would work great injustice to many in terests and would seriously discourage what we should earnestly encourage, namely, the sheep culture among farmers throughout the Union. To break down wool growing and be de pendent on foreign countries, for the blanket under which we sleep and the coat that covers our backs is not a wise policy for the national government to enforce." "Do you think if the president's rec ommendations were adopted, it would increase our export trade. "Possibly in some few articles of pe culiar construction it might, but it would increase our import trade ten fold as much in the great staple fabrics, in woolen and cotton goods, in iron, in steel, in all the thou sand and one shape's in whicii they are wrought. How are we to export staple fabrics to the markets of Europe unless we make them cheaper than they do in Europe, and how are we to manufac ture them cheaper than they do in Eu rope unless we get cheaper labor than they have in Europe." "Then you think that ;' THE 

(.UKSTION OF LABOR underlies the whole subject?" "Of course it does," replied Mr. Blame. "It is, in fact, the entire ques tion. Whenever we can force carpen ters, masons, iron workers and mechan ics in every department to work as cheaply and live as poorly in the United States as similar workmen in Europe, we can, of course, manufacture just as cheaply as they do in Eng land and France. But 1 am totally op posed to a policy that would entail such results. To attempt it is equivalent to a social and financial revolution— one that would bring untold distress.", ' "Yes, but might not the great farming class be benefited by importing articles from Europe instead of buying them at higher prices at home."' "The moment." answered Mr. Blame, "you begin to import freely from Eu rope yon drive our own workmen from mechanical and manufacturing pur suits. In the " same proportion they become tillers of, the 50i1...-in creasing steadily the. agricultural product and decreasing-, steadily the large home demand which is con stantly enlarging as home manufact ures enlarge. That, of course,.- works great injury to the farmer, glutting the market with his products and tending constantly to lower prices." "Yes. but the foreign demand for farm products would be increased in like ratio, would it not?*' ••Even suppose it were," said Mr. Blame, "how do you know the source from which it will be supplied. The tendency in Russia to-day and in the Asiatic possessions of England is toward a large increase of the grain supply, the grain being raised by the cheapest pos sible labor. Manufacturing countries will buy their breadstuff's where they can get them cheapest, and the ENI.ARGI.XG OF THE HOME MARKET for the American farmer being checked he would search in vain for one of the same value. His foreign sales are al ready checked 'by the great com petition abroad. There never was a lime when the increase of a large home market was so valuable to him. The best proof is that the far mers are prosperous in proportion to the nearness of manufacturing centers, and a protective tariff tends to spread manu factures. In Ohio and Indiana, for ex ample.though not classed as manufactur ing states, the annual value of fabrics is larger than the annual value of agri cultural products." "But those holding the president's views," remarked the reporter, "are always quoting the great prosperity of the country under the tariff of 184*3." "That tariff did not involve the one deslwctlve point recommended by- the president, namely, the retaining of direct internal taxes in order to abolish indirect taxes levied on foreign fabrics. But the country had peculiar advan tages under it by the Crimean war in volving England, France and Russia and largely impairing their trade. All these incidents.or accidents if youch(H.se, were Immensely stimulating "to trade in the United States, regardless of the na ture of our tariff. But mark the end of this European experience with the tariff of 1840, which for a time gave an illu sory and deceptive show of prosperity-Its enactment was immediately followed by the Mexican war; then in 1848 by the great convulsions in Europe; then in '■_■'> and succeeding years by the enor mous gold yield in California. The powers made peace in 1856, and at the same time the output of gold in Cali fornia fed off. Immediately the '■'.-'.*- 

FINANCIAL PANIC of Is.'., came upon the country with dis a-troiis force. Though we had in these-' years mined a vast amount of gold in California, every bank in New York was compelled to suspend specie pay ment. Four hundred millions in. gold had been carried out of the country in eight years to pay for foreign goods that should have been manufactured at home, ami we had years of depression and distress as an atonement' for our folly. "It is remarkable that President Polk recommended the tariff of 1846 on pre cisely the same ground that President Cleveland recommends a similar enact ment now, namely, the surplus in the treasury was menacing the prosperity of the country. History- is repeating itself. By the way." Mr. Blame added, after a moment's reflection, "it is worth notice that Mr. Polk insists on emptying the treasury by a free trade tariff, then immediately rushed the country into debt by borrowing $150,000,000 for the Mexican war. 1 trust nothing may occur to repeat so disastrous a sequel to the policy recom mended by President Cleveland. But THE 

UNIFORM FATE has been for fifty years past that the Democratic party when it goes out of power always leaves an empty treasury, and when it returns to power always finds a full treasury." . ..v. "Then do you mean to imply that ' there should be no reduction of the na tional revenue?" "No. what I have said implies the re verse. I would reduce it by a "prompt repeal of the tobacco tax. and would make here and ihere some changes, in. the tariff -not to reduce protection,' but wisely to foster it."' •-...- :"-"--V**. "Would you explain your meaning more fully.** , .-- \ . "I mean," said Mr. Blame, "that no. Continued ou Fourth I\i_,. .

President Carnot's Delay in Naming the French Cabi- . ~-lf net— Foreign Notes. By Cable to the Globe. London, Dec. The complications which have arisen between Austria and Russia are becoming more and more dif ficult of solution, and are undoubtedly the outcome of the recent interview in Berlin between Prince Bismarck and the : czar. Notwithstanding . the asser tions of the German press that none of the publications purporting to state the substance of that interview is correct in a single particular, suspicion has arisen from the tenor of recent official correspondence by mail and by tele graph,. from the information obtained by several reliable correspondents and from the tone of the various continental bourses, that the czar quitted the Ger man capital in a towering rage fomented by .the aggressiveness of the iron chan cellor. A correspondent gives the fol lowing version of what occurred be tween Bismarck and the imperial vis itor which is believed, in view of sub sequent events, to be substantially cor rect: The czar demanded the abroga tion of the new triple alliance between Germany, Austria and Italy accompany, ing his demand with an outspoken de nunciation of the compact as being not only an exhibition of bad faith, but of positive menace to Russia. Prince Bis marck -flatly refused to rupture the new argreement and the czar withdrew.

It is scarcely possible that they will fail of this, in view of the pledges already made by several of the group presidents and the establishment of a cabinet is believed to be only a question of a few days. Judge Holmes, of the Irish court of queen's bench, has granted a conditional order setting aside Mr. Sexton's election and qualifying acts to the office of lord mayor of Dublin, and the. matter of that gentleman's taking his seat depends en tirely on the ultimate decision of the court when the order is returned and argued. The grounds for debarring Mr. Sexton are that lie has violated the crimes act, and in his capacity as high sheriff neglected or refused to perform all of the functions attached to his oflice. The St. James Gazette supplements its highly sensational article to-day, on the discovery of gold in Wales, with an edi torial note stating that the paper itself accepts the story "cum grauo salis." 

RUSSIA'S MENACE. Varying Reports Regarding the Massing of Troops. London, Dec. 7. According to pri vate advices from Warsaw, the massing of Russian troops on the frontier is at tributable to information received by Russia of a concerted plan by Germany and Austria for united action in the event of a war between either of those powers and Russia. In that contingency it was proposed that Germany and Aus tria should suddenly invade Russian Poland ami occupy Warsaw by using their 'greater, facilities for mobilizing. In consequence of the discovery of this alleged project, Russia resolved to com pensate. for her slow power of mobiliz ing by a permanent increase of her frontier forces. The movement implies no 'aggression, but is a purely ! defensive precaution. Emperor Francis i Joseph will preside at a military council ■ which is to be held at the palace in ; Vienna to-morrow for the purpose of ' considering what steps are necessary in i view of the collection of Russian troops on the frontier. The Berlin National [ Gazette, in discussing the Vienna Frem denblatt's article relative to the massing of troops on the Russian frontier, says it is evident that the force of Russian troops vow in Poland is not suffi cient to attack two formidable military powers. The present massing of troops j is tod small for war and too large for : peace*. We must wait and . see how i Russia will reconcile the massing with ' the pacific assurances of the Journal de St. Petersburg. The Moscow Gazette '■■ says the future policy of France will de cide whether Germany will be com pelled to watch one or both of her frontiers. The paper declares that ■Russia must always have a strong fleet in the Pacific ocean. j The political Correspondence of Vi enna send-officially denies a report that the papers interested have officially sent a ljote to Russia in reference to the increased force of troops on the front iers. The paper says the Austrian frontier, guards will.be completely or ganizediand their numbers increased. It adds that the Russian censor has sup pressed all telegrams sent to Russia in reference to the Fremdenblatt's article concerning Russia's action. , The Joyce Libel Suit. - iii.ix.

London, Dec. 7.— Reports come from Dolgelly, the county town of Merioneth shire, Wales, of the discovery of gold at Mawddach, near that place. The find was made four months ago on the es tate of William Pritchard Morgan, who has had long experience in gold mining in Australia. Morgan engaged 100 men to dig and they struck a lode twenty-five feet thick and another sixty-six feet in diameter. The first lode has been stripped, and now 150,000 tons of gold bearing material is exposed. Morgan has slacked 2,500 tons of it on the grass. It is estimated by Prof. Crooks. F. R. S., that the material will yield six ounces of gold to the ton. The lowest esti mate is two ounces. A Tariff Debate.
