THE 

PRESIDENT AND THF FINANCES. While the preater par! Af President M'K'n ley's annual Message, and the part surest to attract Instant and d? ??;? Interest throughout the world, wa.? necessari)) devoted to other subjects, he has sot f ? led ? ? reriew 'lie finan? cinl action which the war has made needful and the results of the revenue laws in force, and again shows his unwavering Interest in monetary progress. Of the Nation's defence fund he speaks briefly, and then expresses the people's approval of Congress for 'te promit passage if the War Revenue act and author? iMtlon Of a popular loan. The fact that the? subscriptions covered the ? mount called for ? many times over the President deems a most significant result, showing the "vast resources "of the Nation and the determination of the "people to uphold their country s honor." He statt?? that on the basis of present revenns laws the receipts of tbe Government for the curnnt fiscal year will be |377.874.?47 an amount only .????'.????,???? |s*g thm the esti? ma ted expenditures for the year, Including all the co?t of military and naval operations, w-ith active hostilities for one month and the ma n tenance of greatly Increased forcee for - p ? months longer. With th? heavy surplus of cash yet In the Treasury, i; Is clear that there need hs no anxiety in regard to the finances until fon eren* shall have bad ample time to make provision for the next fiscal year; n?.r Is then* reason to doubt that the existing laws will provide sufficient reven?'?? for all purposes, together with such sum? ns may be collected in recently acquired dependencies. The I're-irlent compliments ('..nere?? upon the admirable results of legislation in aid of the Government and states that Its provisions "have piren Increased confidence ,n tbe pur? "pose and power of the Government to main "ta!n th? present standard, and have estab? lished more firmly than ever the ?.? ' "credit at home and abroad." The heavy re? ceipts of gold by the Treasury, and hy this country from other countries- are cited as am? ? >ofs of this change In tbe Nation's finan ?????1 position. Nor do?rs the President St any ! ?mint repeat ?n?pestions In recent years too I o'ten heard calculated to create distru?t of tiie ? Treasury, the currency and the ability and readiness of th? Nation to maintain !t? hon r fully. He renew? in the most disti if t form bli recommendation of inst December that wbeq DOtea of the I'nlted States are presented f?T redemption, and redeemed In gold, sit'-ii ncteg j abol? be sel apart nnd paid out only in o*, chanpe for gold. The Tres.dent states that ! this recommendation waa made In the belief ! that such legialatlon would insure to a great , depree the safety of the present standard, and ; be considers that It would he wise to place a, part of the poid holdings of the Treasury io ? a trust fund from which greenbacks should be ! redei-med up?n presentation, not to be after? ward Issued, except for po'.d. The merits ? f tiiis recommendation bave been fully discussed, and it will he seen that a definita and practical end 1? sought whi?h does not Involve general reconstruction of the currency aud baokinij system or cuti-ring upon any untried and hazardous experiment. The President ex presses, the belief that the paper currency should be kept safe, and yet "so related to the "needs of our industries and internal commerce "as to be adequate and responsiva to au? h "needs," and without more definite recom? mendation ou that topic commends it "in all Its parts to the wise consideration of ronpres?." It is evident that Die President has wita scrupulous care avoided approv.il of any of the formulated plans of currency racoustructl <a to which objections are irsted in the report of Controller Dawes Indeed, bla care not to men? tion any Of these !n detail or to ??unmit him self to any of the method* proposed for recon? stru?? tion ?f the paper currency ?> the mure ?ignlficant in view- of his most dlrtimt and explicit recommendation in regard to redr-mr? rJon "f the greenbacks In iroid. Instead of t,)^. Ing from the Government the duty and bordes of presiding amply for the redempt; u of ita notes in gold, ?he PreeMent urge? Cnnpress to make tbe performance of that duty by the c, ?veraasest more eertaln and ?u all the vic.sm? tudes of trade more assy. In what he has re frslned fre.ro proposai? the President has ' shown wisdom nnd steadiness of purpose, as In what he has ap.iin earnestly recommend e 1. and it will not he his fault if definite and pre??? , tica) steos are not taken to render the currency more surely protected and the National credit more unassailable in every emergen?^?. ??Kill 

TIME jo CHOOSE ASD BEOTE. It is gratifying to uote that the tirsi response of Intelligent citizen? and of newspapers re? flecting their virus to the new propensi? of th?? Rapid Tragan Commlaaion comes in the form of emphatic ttectarattena thai oadargronud roads are an Imperative requirement of com? fort and proaperity In the boroughs of Man? hattan and The Brutti? and thai by som?? means the Ir.nlsient demand must be met. It Is rtntu ral to feel Mime disappointment uver the posi? tive coucluelon ot Mr. <?rr and his rnlloggutg. that the original .scheme cannot possibly be carried out now or presumably at any time in the near future, and that consequently a change of base necessitating BOW legislation must lie mad?'. Hut there ia no real cauafl for ?1> cuirageuient, Inasinii' h H the only change in public sentiment is seen to he in the direction of a more determined purpOM to seni re in ?me way or aoother what the people ?lechred In 1S04 that they must have, aid evidence iu? cronaca that private militai was never before so .strongly attracted to the undertaking. Further consideration of the Commission's ? statement and the argument of counee! strengthen our impression that the most seri? ous obstacle to the plan for making the ?iri poaed rapid-transit roads an asset of New-York County and the debt incurred in building th? in a county charge is likely to be found iu that clause of the Constitution which provides that "any debt hereafter incurred by any portion "or part ?if a city, if there shall l?e any si, >b "debt, shall ba included iu ascertaining the j "power Of the wily to become OtbOTWioa In "l.'liteil." It la somewhat positively aaaeTted thnt the Conn ui Appeals has already removed this seeming Inpedlment, but probably no one doubts thai the point must be explicitly deter? mlned In favor of the Commlaaion before any progresa an be made along the line which the Commlaaion prefera Assuming that the plan Of county construction is legally feasible, its advocates can produca strong arguments in Ita support. Indeed, Mr <>rr has already ?lone *,,. laying speziai stress on the consideration that underground roads would be a possession ,,f great and Increasing valu?? to the county, and that Its credit is all that the county would have to give for them. In connection with this It is proper to say that nothing could be more rJlatngettOOUa thin the pretence that the Commission propoeea to double the burden of taxation in the horouehs I of Manhattan and The Hronx. The Rapid Transit act provides that the contractors anali pay the annual interest on the bonds and a sufficient sum In addition to extinguish the Obligation within the period of the leaae, and qulrement would not be modified by a ; substitution of ti,?? county for til-? munlcl| . The people who conatltuted Ihe former ?-in- of New-York, who voted for municipal construc? tion of underground roads four years ego, and ' to whom tn?? benefits resulting from the im? provement would chiefly accrue, would not have to pay an additional dollar In taxation "?i arrotini of an i?i!c of county bonds for t'i ?t purpose, Nor 'in it b>' reasonably ? that ? dangerous preceden! would I.tab- , lislied. In ???,, flrst place, it 's confidently ex peeled thai the people will soon have the ??hance to remove thai possibility hj menus of an amendment to tiie Conatltutlon, and f hns to he einsiliere,i. furthermore, that thla Is altogether an ex??ept1ona1 enterprise, ami as such was approved by an overwhelming ? ? Jorlty at the election of 1804. There i?, bow ever, an oppoalng argument in the fact that the people then voted for a plan which they might have rejected If there had been anv other chance for rapid tranalt In sight, and t may he contended in good faith that they would now prefer to aell the franchise outright to the Metropolitan Traci on Company or some other reaponalble bidder. One thing is certain, namely, that this great and rich community, knowing what it impera? tively needs, ought to asree upon the best way of getting t without delay, and by the force of public opin.on compel ? beginn ng of pra l operations. New-York is singularly lavish, and Indeed disgracefully careless, in many mar? ?, hut when it comea to Indispensable Improve- , menta on a large scale it exhibits astoni? timidity ami hesitation. Other great centres of population, and many far ?mailer and lesa opulent cities, are constantly putting us to aha me ?n this re?pcot by engaging in extensive operations ?nd reaping the benefita thereof while we talk and fret and do nothing. THE CONTROLLER'S REPORT. Tho report of the Controller of the Currency. Mr Dawea, is a surprising document, its great ability will not be denied, even by those who ?liss? nt from its positions moat widely. It not only presenta strong objections t" the meas? ures of currency reconstruction which have re? ceived most attention among followers of the Indianapolis Convention ami among Congress? men, but it ari aya what is lo effect a summary of tbe entire history of the National banking aygteta as proof of tbe aoundncaa ?>f those ob Jectiona. Thla line of reasoning is the mm?? striking because if seems to Conflict With parts of the policy which the Becretary of the Trees ury was ttrongly inclined to favor a year ago, and th?? publication of this report with bla a sent appears to Indicate that its arguments and facts have much weight with the Becretary himself, though his own annual report, about to li? loaned, will show what modifications of currency plans, if any, he now contemplates. Controller Dawea puta gr at stresa at th* outset upon the argument that "there is rxis;. "mg no sucb condition of the Cnlted Btatea "finances, rtvenueg or eredita as to Justify ;!..? "proposition that the shift lug <<( the burden of "gold redemption of outatanding currency from "the Government to the banks is *,, important "as to necessitata of itself ra?licai changea and "conceaslona in National banking laws relative "to the lesue of not? a, whlcb changea and con? "cessions would not be considered wise if the "int'-rests of the community, Irrespective of "Government financ?e, were alone coualdered." ? his has been from the tirsi a position tak.-n by thoee who have queetloned tb? need of such radical measures aa have been proponed, and l-.av.. especially doubted their propriety aa a manna of relieving tbe Government They have argued thai tbe Nation la itronger th?u all Its banke. and <-nn give a bigber degree of security to circul?t.ng notes, and that the pub? lic weifarc require? that such notes should have the Dlgheel aecurity attainable. They have also ' denied that in order t?> secure any elasticity ?u the currency that may he needed any radi? cal change iu the nature und conditions of bank? note Issues is required, such as boa been pro poeed. Bo far Controller Dawea Btatea ???'? nienta which have been presented with great force. But be | ?es much furi bei He proceeds to ahow from tbe records of the National hanking M^nm that the depoall - would be great!** Injured, and their security to a startling extent reduead, by nny measure giving noteholder? ? prior Hen on nasets. Hla stallatica show that th?? depositors of tbe forty, four National banks which lune become Ineol? vent In the Central Btatea, between Penna l vanni and the Weetern line of Iowa and Mia souri, would have lost by preference of note holder? under a 100 per cent leene M li per cent of the dividends them received; thnt, as compared ??< ti;.? losa m tbe N?ew?England de? posltors. the loss to Eastern depositors would I have been IWS BSd Ota half times a* great, to Pacific deposltora four times as great, to slid? \ die States depositors lour und on?? half tini?'? as gretti and to \\?*-?.?p? depositors over seven | times as great, and he states: Prom the taMes which we have ?riven It Is ! evident that from th?? depositors in smaller National banks of from ?MsO.OOO to glfJO.000 ? u> ?t.ii nnd from the depositors ?f th?? newest sec? ? tlona "f th? country the greater amount of the ? this ?.? Heal espi riment In ? urreney must llected. Thus, upon those depositors leaai nl.le to endur? lOeS must the heaviest 1'i.iSi s fall Those locations where deposits are the smallest? and therefore when- ther? would t.e the greatest Incentivi to Ihe taking oui of In? creased circulation, ur?? tboae where the dspoal? tors WOUld suffer the mOSl H? vere losses, be? ..ins.? of this unjust prior lien of noteholders upon the asaeta of Insolvent hanks. . ? ? The meaaure will stimulate In still greater degree ndency of the money of the country to Kos t?. the great money centres, where to fewer Institutions, os time and competition pratese, would pasa the managemenl and control of the savings and capital of th? country. It cannot be denied that these data and ! ?talements deserve the most careful attention j of all who are recommending radiosi changes of the currency sjs'ciu. UnlOSa Mr, I ?awes is in error in ti,?' conclusion- which h?? draws from tbS history of National banking thus far. ] tbe objections be points out musi be held fatal to the essential features of the most important currency plans hitherto submitted, and Will as? suredly I? .id conservative and prudent tneu to s? el: such modifications of those plans as lo avoid completely the injury and the evil cons?* quencea pointed oui by tbe Controller Whether he la in error, whether the elaborate tables be submits conclusively Justify his Inferences, may be better Judge?! when all the details of bis report have been thoroughly examined: but It will hardly be denied by any that the arpu- ; menta he offers have grest force. On the face of things they accord entirely with what nrust reasonably be evpeetod from an effort to make the commercisi business and assets of 'he banks provide noi merely security for deposi? tors and ?itli'-r creditors equally, but a security for noteholders at all comparable with that which they have enjoyed through deposits of United Stetes bonds for their protection. It Is onlj the truth to say that no one has yet been nid?? to point out how either unrestricted or ? ??! Issues of notes can be made as safe ,??< the notes secured by bonds, without tsking away from the commercisi creditors, oud espe dally from tbe depositors of hanks, an impor? tant part of ihe security which has long ren? der?'?! th?? National system on the whole so safe and so beneficial to th?? country. SOME POINTS IS THE TREATY. \ Western Senator is reported as saying that the treaty of peace now being concluded at ? 11 never be ratified by tbe B?sate, be? (li tbe payment of $20.000,000 to >-;ia;n would est.r.ii -h a dangerous precedent; ?2? we do not want more than one island In the Th:l r> pln?-: 'o there Is no place in our general pol? icy for ? lonlal ; ? sslons, and (4) by tsking thi Pbilippinea we. should t??' sbrogatlng ?nd ?! - ? ling the Monroe Do trine, it is noi sop? le that any conaidersble number of srn at? r* w || oppose ratification of the treaty on ? t any grounds. Bui If even one In In? clined to do ao, it will he worth while to point ..ut tiie utter inadequacy and fallacy of ihe stated grounds. In regard to the first ground, there rill he no "dangei ms precedent" established, because In ti.?* Aral place, wa are not pojnp to have cny fon Ign arara and consequent annexations of territory, and because, In the second place, the proposed payment will be merely ? follow in.' of an already established precedent, and a Dtenance of an already fixed policy, we certainly vanquished Mexico 'n lfciS ne com? pi.Vh- a? we did Spain In 1S08; and we took a great traci of her territory, Incltid og what le U"w California, Nevada, L'tan and parts of Art? e< na. New Mi rl ?, G dorado and Wyoming: but Instead of taking it for nothing, ss spoils of war. w? paid Mexico $15,000,000 for It?pur? chase price or Indemnify, as yon please. And p few yi ira la'-r for a smaller tract south ft Ihe ii la we paid $10.000,000 more. That la the prei edenl in the cas?-?. In the second place, our only choice is to ill the PI lippiues or rone. If we have ? 8 r.ght to take one we have a right to take1 all; if we ban no right to take all we have ' n?. right to take one. To take one and ?.ave the rest either to he returned to Spanish mis government or to fall into anarchy would be a monstrous betrayal of moral tru???. To take cue ronld Involve us in exactly is great prob- ? h ms of colonia! government, etc., as to take I them all. And to take one and leave the test to Spain or to som? other Tower would im ? ? isnrably increase the danger 'if unpleasant ? ompl cations with other Powers. As to the third point, that our system has no place for eo'.oiilal possessions, we should ? ? know. then, where Alaska stands. It ? not a State. It is not a Territory. Yet we possess !?. and have possessed it for more than thirty years. Ii" -t i** not a "colonial poaaea s on." such as In the British Emp're would he called a Crown Colony, it would he interesting to know what H Is, The fourth p"tnt has already been answered ?o often and so conclusively that It seems strange it should ever be hinted at again. The ! Monroe Doctrine said nothing about hero I? ?.?.????res. It put us under no obligations con? I renting other continent?.

Sneers over the bnrnlng qualities of fireproof buildings ? ;i doubtless be much in evidence becau.f tbe Bra at Broadway aud Warren? -t on Sunday ni-'ht. Tin* result of that con? flagration, properly interpreted, however, stands much to the ,:vd!t of modern "fireproof con ?traction." The fact that the Home Life lit aurance Company's build.ng was not utterly rulli?'',, but that only a few floors were gut? ted, is. under the circumstance?, strong test! mony to the endurance of sudi structures and their gr?ai value BS barriers to the progres.? of a Ore. Th?* existence of some defects in the design of the building, which apparently pre pared the wsy for such damage as was doue in b. only serves to empii.?nir.e the effectiveness of terrs?cotta covered steel in resisting flame? when it Ii properly disposed and an er??Ve ?? not planned with an opw door for the en? trane?? of a parsine.

The m^t perfect fireproof building devised or Imagined could not have withstood the Chicago tire if planted in its track.

There might beve bee? enough to warp girders and seriously Injure the structure, but that does not appear to have b?en the case. One of the lessons of the occurren ??? is rhe danger of unprotected windows and sidelight! in hlzh lireproof buildings when there Im a combustible structure below them. Another 1? the poworiesMiess of any tir?? department to ?zet an adequate water supplj to ?he top of the exaggerat'vlly lofty towers tint have recently been th?? fashion here. The Home Life build?

Th?? Home Life building was appar? ently perfectly safe SO far as it itself was con? cerned. The mistake of its architect sesos :o have been In considering his building a? the only one in existence and noi thinking of it? reh llons tn neighboring structur?e. Perhaps lie never stopped t?'? ask what was at the north of 'ais plot except to find bow many of his upper st?r:??? could get north light.

TAMMANY BRIDGE SCHEMES. <?n many occasions May.," Van Wyck baa talked a great d?.il about the necessity of econ? omy in the expenditure of public funds. T.sst week be persuaded the Board of Estimate and Apportionment to appropriate the scandalously excessive amount of |100,000 for preliminary surveys, boring?, etc., for the two new bridges over the East River which be is so anxious to have constructed by Tammany contractors at the curliest possible day. The plain truth is that our Tammany Mayor Is frugal Id the px? treme in regard to disbursements which do not enrich Tammany favorites, and excessively prodigal with reaped to outlay which may fill the pockets of his friends In the organization. What has Tammany's record been since Mr. ?',-?? Wyck took office? Streets unclesned, schools unbuilt and rapid transit blocked?a record of shameful waste when Tammany fat? tens on waste, a ree >rd of disgraceful niggard? liness when there Is no plunder for Tammany In sight. The Tribune has said repestedly that addi? tional bridges between Manhattan Island and Long Island ought to be set up and completed within a few years. But it is not safe to com? mit tbe building <>f those bridges to the un? checked control of Tammany. What notable public work has over b??cn carried on by Tam? ii.any with aeemly attention to the comfort and peace of mind of th?? taxpayers? An? Tsm many methods wholesome to follow in ralatng new bridges at a total ?est of tens of millions of dollaro? <>ur present Mayor has never ex? hibited loyal, sincro and unselfish devotion to the development of New-York along the most important Unes of progress, It ? an easy in? ference that be is acting under Mr. Croker's orders In these bridge schemes, a* in everything else, and the Mayor and the Tammany leader are unscrupulous enemies of the true welfare of this community when they Insist upon obstruct? ing rapid transit, aud upon the promotion of Tammany Jobs intended to deplete tbe munici? pal treasury. The motive?, which Influence the Mayor and the Tammany leader in their per? rcrse snd discreditable warfare agalnat rapid transit are well known, but Ihe people of New York an* determined to have rapid transit, and they will gel it In ?--pite "i Mayor Van Wyck and Rlchsrd Croker. Tin? Republican Governor and the Republican Legislature will have some? thing to say concerni; g that matter In a few week?, and they may have something to nay also with reference to Tammany projects for l'.ast River br dges, More bridges by all moans, but not bridgi s with Tammany handling the money, and co moro bridges paid for by, tax? payer* to be stolen by trolley linea and other rapacious grabbers. Th" President reaffirms an 1 re*emphss|ses the conviction that the Nicaragua ?'anal should be constructed as aoon as ?? tsslble, am! should be under the control of th.* United St ite? Govern? ment.
