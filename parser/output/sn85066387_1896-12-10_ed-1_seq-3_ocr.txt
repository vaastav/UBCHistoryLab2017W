LIVES. C.ptain Jane of the Cuban Army T>i» credit* the t.e.portx. BOSTON, Mass , Dec. 9.— Captain G. H. Lane of the Cuban army was in Cam bridge today and he characterized the report of Maceo'a drath as a Spanish trick »o off-et the effect of the message of Presi dent Cleveland. While it was possible, , I he said, that Maceo had been Killed, yet it was altogether improbable that he would have been found by the Spaniards at the head of so small a detachment of men as it is reported be was leading. Then again, he stated, the general was certainly miles away from where the skirmish is reported to have occurred. Captain Lane left here to-night for New York. He was wounded badly about two months ago by a gun shot in the leg and was granted a month's leave of absence. He is now on bis way back to Cuba. While Captain Lane would not speak of the number of men in the Cuban army, he stated that they were numerous enough to meet Weyler and his soldiers in open battle, if Gomez and Maceo so determined, with tbe result that the Spanish would be driven to Havana in disorder. Tbe captain is an American, and with a former Harvard student owned and operated a sugar plantation in the province of Havana at the time the insurgents first rose la the East. He known nothing of tne reported death of Major Osgood. Celebrating in Madrid.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 10, 1896. SHE WANTS TO FIGHT SHARKEY The Sailor Challenged by a Colored Woman of Chicago. Will Meet Him in a Four-Round Go for Points or to a Finish. She Is the Daughter of a Oace Cele brated Bruiser Known as "Sleepy Frank." CHICAGO, 111., Dec. 9. — Mrs. Rosa Boyd, whose distinguished qualities are her wonderful strength and the fact that she is tho wife of a shouting colored evan gelist, wants to fight Sharkey, the pugil ist, and has already sent a challenge to the hardy man-of-war's man. Before the week is ended Sharkey will receive tnrough the mails tne following bold defiance from the Chicago colored woman: Thomas Sharkey, San Francisco—^Dear Sir: I would like to box you four rounds for points or to a finish for the largest pursed offered by any club, or lor gate receipts— winner to take ah. Am a woman and colored, but mean busi ness and am exceedingly anxious to complete arrangements ior h match at once, as I think the oddity of the affair would mean money lor the one who -wins. Awaitinj; an early reply, I aDi, yours truly, Mrs. Kosa BoYd. Mrs. Boyd and her husband live on Armour avenue, in the neighborhood of the recently organized "MeKiniey Zion Church." They are both Zionites and, although not members of the congrega tion that worships in the cnurch with the elongated name, the Rev. Mr. Boyd is an enthusiastic evangelist and is well known tnroughout the South, where he and his wife formerly lived, as "the Black Sara Jones." The Boyds have lived in Chicago about a year, coming here from St. Louis. Mrs. Boyd has always been an athlete. She is the daughter of "Sleepy Frank, 1 ' a once celebrated colored rough-and-tumble fighter and boxer, noted for his phenome nal strength and was trained almost from her infancy by him. She is a tall, powerfully built woman, weighing fully 180 pounds; is 28 years old and is apparently as active on her feet as the proverbial "Kitten." To a reporter who called on her she said: 'Yes, I have challenged Mr. Sharkey and am in earnest about it, too. "I will box him for points or in any way he desires, and am anxious for the match to be brought about as soon as possible. You see I take after my father, who, in ray opinion, was the greatest fighter that ever lived. Sharkey, Jackson and Fitz simnions would have been only play things lor him. "Why, he was built like Walcott, weighed 190 pounds, had longer arms than Peter Jackson and could hit so hard that wherever he went there was an un written law established by the magistrates that he should strike iio man with his closed fist. He could defend himself only with his open hand. "All the champions of his day refused to right him in the ring, but he whipped 'Yankee' Sullivan rough-and-tumble style and knocked Tom Hyer stiff with a single blow. One day, on the Erie canal, he lifted itn anchor that seven men could not budge. "He could jump twelve feet backward, so you see I snould not fear Sharkey. Yes, all I have said about my father, and there are several people in Chicago who knew him personally, is true. "I sent my challenge to Sharkey day before yesterday. I consider him the champion, ana I am anxious toshow what a colored woman can do with him. Of course I would rather box him for points, but have no fear of him at any style. "Men who have boxed with him before hay«» gone at it in the wrong way. I should never use my riyht hand on him : except in close countering. He should be : kept in the lead and met with straight, stinging lefts and swinging left upper cuts. 1 should try to close his eyes and weaken him by keeping his nose bleeding. "When I saw him geuine shaky I should bring up my right and put him out." Mrs. Boyd is a good-looking, intelligent woman, and is pleasant in manner. She says she expects to get an answer from Sharkey soon and to really enter the ring with him. AFTER HIS FEES. Dr. Blare Tevinggton's Interest in the lair 1 stuff Wag Garnisheed Yesterday. A garnishment was placed on Dr. Marc Levingston's interest in the Fair estate yesterday at the instance of J. J. Raver, who holds claims against the physician amounting to nearly $5000. Two years ago Attorney John M. Ch'etien, who held promissory notes of L?vingston's amounting to $3519, sold the same to J. J. Raver, and it is on this claim, with costs and interest, that the Fair estate trustees were served with the garnishment. Raver claims that the estate owes the doctor $10,000 for medicai services rendered to the late Senator, but the trustees are of a diffeient opinion. When the rnpers were presented by Deputy Sheriff Byington yesterday they declared the estate was not indebted to Levingston in the sum of $10,000 or any other sum. A HEAVY SENTENCE. One of the Dick Williams Defaulting Witnegges Sent to Prison. Wong Gim, a witness in the Dick Wil liams case, yesterday learned that the way of the transgressor is hard and that the Federal courts, like the buzzsaw, are not to be handled with impunity. When Dicfc "Williams was on trial Major Moore of the Treasury Department learned that Gim possessed much valuable knowledge of tbe ways of thrifty Dick. He got from the Mongolian a statement that Williams once extorted a large sum of money from Gtm for making a favorable report to Col lector Wise, upon which Gim's nephew wns permitted to Jand. Just before the time for Gim to testify in court to these facts he, with several other witnesses, disappeared and he kept out of the way until a week ago, when Major Mo re arrested him in Chinatown, the fellow having just returned from Los Angeles. Gim decided to plead guilty of contempt oi court and .ludge Morrow pro ceeded "to relieve hi 3 mind upon the mat ter. He said that he is determined that tue business of the court and the adminis tration of jusiice must not be obstructed by witnesses who are not desirous of tes tifying. In order to imoress upon Gim the enormity of his offense and upon his countrymen the fact that they must obey a summons of the court he decreed Wonp Gim guilty of contempt of court and sentenced him to imprisonment for one year in the San Francisco County Jail. The culprit was staggered, for as his at torney intimated he did not expect to bo imprisoned over five or ten days. A Vicious Dog. Policeman Gus Videau swore to a complaint yesterday morning for the arrest of Martin T. Doyle, 139 Silver street, for allowing a vicious dog to be at lsrge. Monday night the dog at tempted to bite Mrs. John E. Heilman in front of St. Rose's church, Brannan street, and when the husband, who is a Deputy County Clerk, jumped in to protect her the dog bit him severely in the right calf and left thi«h. Heilman fired tt the dog but missed it and it ran away. Policeman Videau found it at 514 Brannan street and took it to tbe City Prison. INSANITY PLEA FILED. Dennis McCarthy Cannot Have a New Trial on Ihat Plea. Dennis McCarthy, who killed George Fox, and who was convicted of mnrder in the first degree, has been denied a new trial by the Supreme Court. The decision was handed down yesterday. The defense was insanity, the homicide being admit ted. Tho trial court was found to have charged the jury correctly in these words: You are not to consider whether or not the defendant is insane at the present time, but you are to consider him as now sane. A person charged with a crime cannot be legally tried for huch crime unless he bo sane at the time of the trial. The defendant has presented the issue that at the very time of the alleged commission of the homicide he was insane. As I have already told you, the bur den of proving his insanity nt that time rests upon him. because the law presumes he was then sane. The court found that "the killing was an exceptionally cold-blooded and wanton one, inflicted upon a defenseless man from no other cause, so far as manifest, than a feeling of petty spite and jealousy having no foundation, whiie the evidence relied upon to estaplish the defense of insanity was so entirely lacking in material sub stance that no unbiassed jury, them selves enjoying the blessing of sane and rea u oning minds, could have justly reached a different conclusion." THE 

RIATA USED AGAIN, Humane Methods No Longer Employed by the Pound Deputies. They Tab:o the Net and the Humane Society Will Shake Up the Institution. The riata has come into use again on the public streets with deputies of the public Pound in their business of catch ing dogs, and with it is revived a custom of former days, when the City Ponnd was synonymous with barbarism. The heavy noose curling over frightened animals, that howl with agony as the rope tightens, has come to be preferred by the dog catchers instead of the humane net intro duced after a long struggle by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. It was news to the secietary of tho society, Charles, lloi brook, when be learned yesterday that Pound deputies had gone back to barbarous methods whereby many a valuable dog was ruined, and in every instance catching was at tended by cruelty. "I am surprised to hear this," said Mr. Holbrook. "The society has known nothing about it and I'm sure that Mr. Osborne, the Pound Master, would not tolerate such a thing for a minute. He certainly is not aware that his deputies usa the riata in stead ot the net. For my part I shall bring up the matter before tha board wnen it meets next Thursday. "Our society shall resent this. We bought a lot for ?!*OOO, and in all spent over $18,000 in the new Pound that ani mals lound on the streets would be sure of humane treatment. We furnished the entire equipment, including carts and nets and asphyxiation chambers, at con siderable expense, and it is really provok ing that deputies should thwart our pur pose. "The net is the modern way of catching dogs without injury or pain. The riata went out with the old order of things — with Jake Lindo and his methods. The riata is used only for goats, but dipnties are not allowed to use the rope on dogs. That is positively against tbe rules. "When tho society got control of the Ponnd it sent all over the world for sug gestions as to the most humane methods of catching and killing do^s and finally adopted the net as the most approved way of catching and asphyxiation as the best way of killing. We kill between 5000 and ami 0000 dogs a year now and there is not the slightest suggestion of cruelty in it, except what you tell me now and of which we were lenorant. " Still the deputies gave an exhibition of old-time methods a fsw days ago in the north end of the City. There were four of them on the Ponnd wagon and another in a blue sweater who chased the dogs with the riata, which he threw lite a trained cowboy. The dogs caught in the lasso howled, but they were powerless when tied in a knot. Meanwhile the humane net lay unused on the wagon. From what the secretary remarked it is liKely that there wil! be a change of deputies and a general shake-up in the public Pound. FOWEKS' SEAT CONTESTED. John A. Hoey Says He Was legally Elected to the Legislature. John A. Hoey, Republican nominee for the Assembly in the Thirty-second As sembly District, has filed a contest to the election of John W. Powers, who was de clared the winner by 22 votes. In assigning reasons for the contest Mr. Hoey says that in two precincts which went against him the numbers were not torn from the ballots before they were de posited, thus violating the Jaw, which pro vides that there shall be a secret ballot; that in two precincts the election inspect ors refused to count votes for Hoey when the X was placed before his name instead of alter the name in the blank space left for saidX ; that in one precinct 33 votes for Hoey were thrown out because the voters attempted to vote for too many Presiden tial electors. Testimony in regard to the allegations of set lorth in the complaint will be taken by A. J. Morgenstern. attorney for Mr. Hoey, before Justices of the Peace Kerri gan and Groezinger. After the testimony is written out it will be forwarded to the Speaker of the Assembly 

KEARNY-STREET LIGHTS. They Will Be Kxteuried Beyond Calia fora in Street to Broatlwuy. Keainy street is to be lighted with electric lights from Market street to Broadway. It has been known for some time that the popular thoroughfare would be lighted by a new system as far as California street, and this led the business men toward the north to go to worli and, if possible, com plete t lie undertaking. Dr. 11. Morton Jr., H. Jacobs and Ed ward Holland took an active interest in the proposition and have succeeded in obtaining a sufficient number of signa tures and promises of linancial aid from business men to assure its success. To-day the street, from Broadway to Greon. will be canvassed and if the busi ness men in that district take a favorable view the line of lights wili be extended over the bill. A Reception to Rev.
