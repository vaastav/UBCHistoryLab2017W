I am obliged to ask cus tomers to favor me promptly to en able me to meet my own obligations. W. G. SCHROEDER. Adv. tf A beast of the field! A brute that was once a man! A thing insensible to any of man's finer sensations, his only needs being sleep and enough food to nourish his gigantic body. A monster that stands upright and throws its herculean strength into a yoke that drags a heavy plow, His mind gone and in abject terror of his masters, he does their bidding as a beast of burden. But, sometimes when the lash sings round his ears, and the brute in him gets almost beyond a brute's control, there comes into his soft eyes a look it would be well for them to heed.

PRESIDENT WILSON IN MESSAGE DENOUNCES HYPHENATED PUBLIC (Continued from rage l.j use to serve them and make their in dependence secureand not .their own independence merely but the rights also of those with whom they have made common cause, should they also be put in jeopardy. They must be fitted to play the great role in the world, and particularly in this hemisphere, for which they are quali fied by principle and by chastened ambition to play. "It is with these ideals in mind that the plans of the department of war for more adequate national de fense were conceived which will be laid before you, and which I urge you to sanction and put into effect as soon as they can be properly scrutinized and discussed. They seem to me the first essential steps, and they seem to me for the present suf ficient. Navy Satisfactory. "If this full program should be carried out that we should have built or building in 1921, according to the estimates of survival and standards of classification followed by the gen eral board of the department, an ef fective navy consisting of twenty seven battleships, of the first line, six battle cruisers, twenty-five battle ships of the second line, ten armored cruisers, thirteen scout cruisers, five first class cruisers, three second class cruisers, ten third class cruisers, one hundred and eight destroyers, eight een fleet submarines, one hundred and fifty-seven coast submarines, six monitors, twenty gunboats, four sup ply ships, fifteen fuel ships, four transports, three tenders to torpedo vessels, eight vessels of special types and two ammunition ships. This would be a navy fitted to our needs and worthy of our tradition. "The task of building up an ade quate merchant marine for America private capital must ultimately un dertake and achieve, and it has un dertaken and achieved every other like task amongst us in the past, with admirable enterprise, intelli gence and vigor and it seems to mS a manifest dictate of wisdom that we should promptly remove every legal obstacle that may stand in the way of this much to be desired revival of our old independence and should 

PLAY OF, UNUSUAF %V INTEREST AT GRAND EDITH WYNNE MATHISON. "The Governor's Lady," which will be shown at the Grand theater tonight is the story of two young peo ple in the humblest stations of life, who are strongly devoted to each other. They become wealthy and the husband ambitious, later wishing to divorce his wife whom he thinks is standing in his way. How the faith ful wife spoils his schemes through simple wifely honesty and finally takes her place as the Governor's Lady, makes the story of unusual in terest and appeal. The play is an American story of Americans in which we see the finest type of Am erican men and women, exactly as they are in real life. Miss Edith Wynne Mathison plays the part of the Governor's Lady. facilitate in every possible way the building, purchase and American registration of ships. Something must be done at once done to open routes and develop opportunities where they are as yet undeveloped done to open the arteries of trade Where the currents have not yet learned to runespecially between the two American continents, where they are, singularly enough, yet to be created and quickened. "There is another matter which seems to me to be very intimately associated with the question of na tional safety and preparation for de fense. That is our policy towards the Philippines and the people of Porto Rico. Our treatment of them and their attitude towards us are mani festly of the first consequence in the development of our duties in the world and in getting a free hand to perform those duties. We must be free from every unnecessary burden or embarrassement and there is no better way to be clear of embarrass ment than to fulfill our promises and promote the interests of those de pendent on us to the utmost. "I have spoken to you today, gen tlemen, upon a single theme, the thorough preparation of the nation to care for its own security and to make sure of entire freedom to play J&%inipartial role in this hemisphere vSAd in the world which we all be lieve to have been providentially as signed to it. I have had in my mind no thought of any immediate or par ticular danger arising but of our re lations with other nations. We are at peace with all the nations of the world, and there is reason to hope that no question in controversy be tween this and other governments will lead to any serious breach of amicable relations, grave as some differences of attitude and policy have been and may yet turn out to be. "For what we are seeking now, what in my mind is the single thought of this message, is national efficiency and security. We serve a great nation. We should serve it in the spirit of its peculiar genius. It is the genius of common men for self government, industry, justice, liberty and peace. We should see to it that it lacks no instrument, no facility or vigor of law, to make it sufficient to play its part with energy, safety and assured success. In this we are no partisans but heralds and prophets of a new age." DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE MEETS (Continued from Page 1) Cheney of Juneau, Alaska, succeeding A. J. Daly, deceased.

The pri I will ask for this will 1 mean a big sacrifice on my part and rather than publish it in this advertise ment it will be kept a secret be tween myself and the prospective buy er. I have been a resident on this same property for 22 years and feel certain that any one seeking a real bargain will buy a tract of this property on sight. All I ask is that you look at it before you buy elsewhere. The fact of the matter is I have more land than I feel able to look after, and anxious to sell parts of it in order to improve the bal ance. If you buy you can depend on one thing and that is that I will continue to be your neighbor, together with others living in this vicinity.
