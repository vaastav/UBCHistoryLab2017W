Th special mesage, moreover. aside from it local application, will be one of tht most Important com munication In tht entire list of those sent to Congress by the present exec utive." It will bring to a direct Isau the centralisation scheme of govern ment, which la likely to form the cli max of endeavor on th part of the Roosevelt administration. Th administration Is about to take advanced ground regarding th doc trine of federal supremacy over tat sovereignty. Tht Japanese question raised In connection with the public schools of California has supplied the opportunity to give forcible expression to tht mighty scheme of centralisation that Is to be perfected if possible. It Is not possible at this writing to forecast In detail what the President will say In hts second message on the Japanese question. Accompanying his message, which, It Is understood, will be & full explanation of the admin Istration's projected policy as to th supremacy of federal over state power, will be the report of the special In vestigation of the San Francisco school question made by Secretary of Commerce and Labor Metoalf. Re gnrdless of the nature of this report, tha President will adher vigorously to th position taken by him m hi regulation message, which waa written before h left Washington to visit the Canal sone and before he had any thing at all from Secretary Metcalf, But as to the Metcalf report, It has been learned that Us author found much to condemn In the matter of the treatment of Japanese outside of the school question. His report, In fact will furnish a new sensation. It will show, It Is understood, labor union tyranny over Japanese which affects th rights hold to be theirs by treaty In even more pronounced manner than anvthlna connected with the school embrogllo. " Matters of this nature embraced in Secretary Metcalf report will furnish the key for many arguments , to be advanced by the President In his mes sage. ,.
