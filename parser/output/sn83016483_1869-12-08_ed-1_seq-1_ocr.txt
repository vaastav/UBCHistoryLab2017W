Salnave has strongly fortified Port-au-Prince, and swears he will blow it up before he will surrender. WASHINGTON, Dec. 1.-Gen. Breckenridge here. Thomas H. Talbott, of Maine, appointed assistant attorney-general, vice Dickey resigned. g, It was ascertained to-day, on enquiry at the Treas I- ury department, that the withdrawal of the sale of old - in New York yesterday, does not involve a change of policy, but was on account of the low price offered. The President has transmitted an appeal to the Czar of Russia, asking a favorable consideration of the Jewish petition in behalf of their religious rites. The revenue receipts to-day reached $613,000. The Court of Claims meets ou Monday next. There are over 300 cases on the docket. The Naval Staff and Line Board adjourned without an agreement regarding the status of staff officers. Admiral Rowan, commanding the Asiatic squadron, reports the Idaho dismasted by a typhoon, while lying up as a store-ship at Yokoboma. Decrease in the treasury, seven and a half millions. Coin in the treasury, one hundred and six millions; currency twelve millions. Mulett, Supervisor of Architecture, urges the sale of the custom-houses at Charleston, S. C., and of Plymouth, N. C. The former is characterized by Mu lett as ruins and a nuisance. Ite further adds: It is obvious that the cost, per patient, must be materially greater for small than for large hospitals, and that the most favorable working of the hospital system can be obtained only in the buildings being of sufficient size to warrant the employment of a suitable staff of offi cers. It is worthy of note, that while the marine hos pitals have been erected in places like Burlington, Vt; Burlington, Iowa; Galena, Ill., &c., no provision has been made for buildings at the great ports of New York, Philadelphia and Baltimore. Indeed, so re markable has been the selection of localities, that it is difficult to imagine the motives for their erection. It many cases that a desire to expend money in the locality in which the buildings were located, I would - Sstrongly recommend the sale of the hospitals at Vicks burg, Natchez, Ocracoke, Wilmington, and New Or leans, the latter is an immense, but unfinished pile of cast iron,, that has already cost $527,734, is badly located and constructed, and it would cost more to complete it than to erect a new and suitable building. It is at present like the custom house in the same city, but a monumenti in the incapacity of its designters and constructors. I would also recommend that the hos pital constructed in that city during the war, and is known as the Sedgewick hospital, or such portions of it as may be needed, be transferred from the War de- 8 partmnent to marine hospital establishment. The building is the property of the Government, admirably located, and I am advised that the la .d on which it is situ:ated can he purchased on terms that would make it a desirable investment. tI WASHIsnGTON. Dec. 2.-Samuel Ruth appointed col lector of second district of Virginia. F Retvenue receipts to-day over half a million. it The Mexican Claims Commission meets here on Monday with a docket of 430 American and 130 tl Mexican claims. tl ('lark, the Third Auditor of the Treasury, has re- a signed and has been appointed Supervisor of the ti Southern District of Ohio.

Customs for the week ending 27th ultimo, nearly p three millions. A Apothecaries are required to pay an additional fe license as liquor dealers. 91 The Star concludes a paragraph on Judge Busteed at as follows: It seems to be pretty generally under- T stood, however, that he is regarded by a majority of 71 Sthe committee as a marvellously fit and proper man to be a United States Judge. It is stated, we may add, that Judge B. has adjourned his court until some time at next summer, and is now on his way to Washington -to to look after things. et News has been received, via Key West, Fla., that cr Cienfugas has been surprised by the insurgents, who ol seized a large quantity of medicines, clothing and pro visions and retired in good order. WasnmscrToN, Dec. 3.--The London Times, in dis- Ir cussing the Irish question, says : We must declare ri reform in the land laws. in the next -session of Parlia- ur ment; tut in the meatimne the authority of law must Q be maintained, and infraction thereof punished: Chief Justice Dillon has been selected as Circuit th Judge of the Eighth District, which includes Arkansas. Thomas J. Durant will be appointed Circuit Jundge or of Louisiana, Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia and Florida. The revenute rzeipts to-day amounted to over one ba million.

The Post also publishes letters from Benj. F. Wade, Roscoe, Conkling, Simeon Cameron, John Hickman, and others, in favor of the Cuban cause. Wade declares that if the Republic is afraid to recognise Cuba he shall cease to be proud of being an American citizen, and that the Administra tion holds the destiny of the people of Cuba in its hands.

Lewis, No. 9 Texas street, who keeps constantly on hand the largest and most elegant assortment of boots, shoes and hats in. the city, and sells at prices to suit everybody. A BEAUTIFUL ARRANOGEENT.-The St. Louis Re publican in speaking of the arrangement that has been effected between the Supreme Court and the Executive, by which the Yerger habeas corpus case is not to be argued, and decided, because the Attorney General thinks the reconstruction laws would be declared un constitutional, says that it is a most extraordinary one. The Republican is of-the opinion that it has no parallel in the history of the government, and adds " that it would be difficult to conceive a more humiliating atti tude than the Government is made to occupy in such a bargain. It is, in truth, a confession that the Govern ment is at war with itself-that its administration is, and has been, and shall continue to be hostile to the enduring principles on which its rests-that it is a self violation-that its supreme executive department and its supreme legislative departments stand lawlessly ar rayedagainst its supreme judicial department, and are sufficiently powerful to force the latter to abstain from its sworn official duties. One of Mr. Lincoln's most quoted maxims was: " A house divided against itself cannot stand." If we apply it to the spectacle now preseiited at Washington, how withering is the rebuke it administers to the party that has transformed the Union into a self-admitted schism! IMPORTANT DECISION.-Ever since we can recollect it has been the general received opinion that insur- p ance companies wer not liable for the loss arising from the explosion of steamboat boilers, although they might have taken risks on the boats. This received opinion has lately been decided by the United States Supreme Court to be erroneous, and that boiler ex plosions on steam vessels are among the perils of nav igation, for which public carriers cannot be held re sponsible. The decision is one of much importance to the commercial co'munity, and we give the gist of it as we find it in the Courier-Journal. The suit was brought against the proprietors of the steam propeller Mohawk, plying between Buffalo and Chicago. On her last voyage she had a cargo of wheat, and gounded on the St.'Clair Flats. While she was en deavoring to get off, her boiler exploded and she sank, and the grain was almost wholly destroyed. Suits in admiralty were instituted by the firms on whose ac count the grain was shipped. Their claims were re sisted on the ground that the Mohawk was in good and seaworthy conditi on when she left port, and that she so continued till she grounded, that the catas-' trophe did not arise from any neglect or carelessness on the part of the vessel or of her officers and must be considered a peril of navigation. The plaintiffs insisted that explosions are not dangers of the sea, and that carriers are liable for damages caused by them. The'Circuit Court of the northern district of Illinois, where the suit was first brought, sustained the theories of the'defense, and the Supreme Court of the United States, to which an appeal was made from the lower tribunal, has reaffirmed the decision. CoTro wILL STAND CULTIrATION.-It has been as ceitained that cotton will pay as well for high cultiva tion as any thing else. This was demonstrated last season by Col. G. R. Locket, of Georgia, who made! the experiment on six acres of land. The average yield of Georgia cotton lands is a quarter of a bale to the acre. He aimed to make three bales from each of his six acres. The land was highly manured, deeply and minutely cultivated and kept in the best order, and the result is that notwithstanding the severe drouth in Georgia, he will gather seventeen bales of irve.hndred pounds each, of superior quality, which will sell for 3be..per pound-$9975 for the whole crop. Itis evident, from this example, that high cotton cul ture will pay. Cotton Factories Again. We believe that we recently promised our readers not to further urge upon them the advantages and profits to be derived from a cotton factory in this vicinity. At the risk, however, of forfeiting our word, and, moreover, of severely trying the patience of in credulous readers, we make an extract from an article in the September numbeof DeBow's Review on the subject of Southern factories, to which our attention has been called, by Mr. R. H. Lindsay, to whom we would refer any of our citizens who feel disposed to invest in a business promising so large a profit. After giving a table showing that cotton can be manufactured at the South seven cents per pound cheaper than at the North, taking 20 cents per pound as the cost of the raw material, the article continues as follows: As further evidence of the profits of Southern cot ton manufacturing, we give below an account of six months' work of the Augusta factory, one of the most successful of the South, from the report of President Wm. E. Jackson, ESq., presented at the semi-annual meeting held June 30, 1868, in the city of Augusta, Georgia : " In presenting my twentieth semi-annual report, it is with pleasure I can state the condition of the com pany is very favorable: The gross earnings for the past six months have been.....................$135,510 65 Interest received........................ 3,921 65 $139,482 30 From which is deducted Expense account.................. $ 8,731 64 Repairs account ................ 3,475 11 Taxes paid ................ .. 19,691 41 31,898 16 Leaving as net profits....................$107,534 14 " From which two dividends of 5 per cent each, amounting to $60,000 have been paid, enabling us to carry to the credit of profit and loss account $47,584 14, making the amount now to the credit of that account $.24,798 22." Mr, Jackson goes on to speak of the result of the ten years work of the mill as follows: " It may not be uninteresting to some of our present stockholders to state what has been accomplished in the past ten years. It will be remembered by those who were among the original purchasers, that the property was purchased of the city for $140,000 on ten years' credit, with interest at seven percent., pay able semi-annually, and one tenth of the principal as-. nually, the purchasers paying in as commercial capital $60,000. This amount, in consequence of the delapi, dated condition of the property, was almost entirely expended in the first two years, in repairs rendered necessary by the then condition of the property. " We have, since the purchase, paid for the entire property without calling on the stockholders for another dollar; added largely to the property by pur chase and building, bought about $100,000 worth of new machinery, increased the capital to $600,000, by the addition of a portion of the surplus; paid divi dends regularly, and have now a property worth the par value ($600,000) in gold."
