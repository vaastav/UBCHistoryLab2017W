(Silt (Jfflunijj gdwupie. ii. jr. Pattison, Editor. THURSDAY. DEC. 6. 1872. An Address j the Unite! States Centennia Commission. To the People of (he United State. The Congress of the United States has enacted that the completion of the One Hundredth Year of American In dependence (hall be clebrated'by an In ternational Exhibition of the Arts, Man ufactures, and Prod nets of the soil and mine, to be held at Philadelphia, in 18 76, and has appointed n Commission, con sisting of representatives from each State and Territory, to conduct the clelebra tion. Originating under the auspices of the National Legislature, controlled by n National Commission, and designed as it is to " Commemorate the first Century of our existence,, by on Exhibition of the natural resourses of the Country and of our progress in tbpse Arts which ben efit mankind, in compairson with thoso of older Nations," it is to the people at large that the Commission look for the aid which is necessary to make the Cen lennial Celebration the grandest anni versary the world has ever seen. That the completion ot the first cen tury of our existence should be marked by some imposing demonstration is, we believe, the patriotic wish of the people of the whole country. The Congress of the United States has wisely decided that the Birth day of the Great Repub lic can be most fittingly celebrated by the universal collection and display ot all the trophies of its progress. It is de signed to bring togethqr, within a build ing covering fifty acres, not only the va rious productions of our mines and of the toil, but types of all the intellecual triumphs of our citizens, rpecimens of everything that America can furnish, whether from the brains or the hand of her childreu, and thus make evident to the world the advancement of which a self governed people is capable. In this "Celebration" all nations will be invited to participate; its character being International. Europe will dis play her manufactures, India her curious fabrics, while newly opened China and Japan will lay bare the tieasures which for centuries their ineonious people have been perfecting. Eaeh land will com pete in generous rivalry for the palm'of superior excellence. To this grand gatherieg every zoue will contribute its fruits and cereals. No mineral shall bo wanting; for what the East lacks the West will supply. Un der one roof will the South display in rich luxuriance her growing cottou, and the North in minuture, the ceaseless machinery of her mills converting that cotton into cloth. Each section of the globe will send its best offerings to this exhibition, and each State of the Union, as a member of one united body politic, will show to her sister States and to the world, bow much she can add to the greatness of the nation of which she is i harmonious part. To make the Centennial Celebration such a success as the patriotism and the pride of every American deniauds will require the co-operatjon of the people o the whole country. The United States Centennial Commission has received no Government aid, such as England ex tended to her World's Fair, and France to her Universal Exposition, yet the la bor and responsibility imposed upon the Commission is as great as iu cither of those undertakings. It is estimated that ten millions of dollars will be required, and this sum Congress has provided shall be raised by stock subscription, and that the people shall have the opportunity of subscribing in proportion to the popula tion of their respective States and Ter ritories. The Commiss8on looks to the unfailing patriotism of the ptor.le of every section to see that each contribute s its share to the expenses, and receives its share of the benefits of an enterprise in which all are so deeply interested. It would fur ther earnestly urge the formation in each State and Territory of a centennial or ganization, which shall in time see tha1 county associations are formed, so tnat when the nations are gathered together in 1876 each Commonwealth can view with pride the contributions she has made to the national glory. Confidently relying on the zeal and patriotism ever displayed by our peo ple in every national undertaking, we pledge and prophecy, that the Centen nial Celebration will worthily show how greatness, wealth and intelligence, can be fostered by such institutious as those which have for one hundred years ties 0ed the people of the United States. JOSEPH R. HAWLEY, President. Death of Mr. Greeley. Friday evening November 29th 1872, about seven o'clock, Horace Greeley, ft man of note in American Journalism bicithed h:s last. For more thnn thirty years Mr. Prerley bus bscn at the head of the Xrw Yi.rk Tribttn, indcrd be wns its launder, and fur ninny ycurs it was the most extensively circulated new papers of tho world. To say flint Mr. Greeley wa not a great man would only be to array one self against the facts if history. Mr. Greeley was ranked armmg the first Of the great, mental lights of the age. lie wan an utiremititiu; toiler, devoting the energies of bo-Jo nnd mind nud body in bui'ding up, and giving character to his paper. Rut the pren. journalist has written his last line, the curtain has fallen, and whatever may have been his faults, and errors of life, our common humanity cuvcre ail with the nian'le of charity, and a whole n.'.lion mourns the loss of ono of its greatest sons Tha PresidentsSHjssags. The President's Message like every document of the kind coming from Gen. Grant, is brief but to the point. Tho nation through him as the chief magis trate is informed officially of our rela tions with other nations Jof men, of the prosperous and peuc:ub!e coudition of affairs at home. He dwells at some length on the finances of the country, giving a very full and complete Matt mcnt in detail of the receipts and dis bursements of reveuue from all sources for the fiscal year, and up to date of Publication, showing that on national debt has been grealley reduced during the year. Indeed aM matters that con cern and interest a great nation are fully, yet briefly disiussed by the President. Aftf.ii the death nnd burial of Gen Meade, a number of his personal friends in Philadelphia met at the Continental Hotel, and determined that they would raise a sum of money to present to Mrs. Mcado. 5'he whole ufTiir was conduct ed in a private way, but those inquisi torial reporters of thu hour, the day and the night, got nn inkling of what was on the tapis, and it was accordingly pub lished in the morning papers Rut to show the esteem in which Gen. Meade was held by the people of Phil adelphia and the rjoble interest they have exhibited in the welfare ot his bereaved family, the Public Letyvr says: "No useful end can now be accomplished by witliolding knowledge of the fact that what has beeu done reflects high credit upon the city ar.d upon the devoted af fection of his friends." It also sneeks eloquently of the supreme regard in which the "services nnd character of Goo. Meade were held iu tha city of his home. In a few days in tho quietest pos. sible way, tho Meade fund, which was in teode 1 to bo fifty thousand do'Iars, has mouuted up to one hundred and three thousand dollars, PhiladelJhia may well feel gratified at this demonstration of whatsho may do, io her puiet way, for a noble object. This is not a 'monu ment' fund, but is to be devoted to the purpose which the dead soldier always had nearest to his heart, Josh Hillixqs thus speaKs of 8 new ogricultural implement, to which he attention of farmers is invited: John Roger's revolving, expanding uncere monious, self adjusting, self-greasing and self-tighteous hoss-rake is now for- ver offered to the public.

A dressing which is at once agreeable, healthy, and effectual f o r Jireserving the tain It soon restores faded or gray hair to its original color, with the gloss and freshness of youth. Thin hair is thickened, falling hair checked, and baldness often, though not always, cured by its use. Nothing can restore Jhe hair where the follicles are de stroyed, or the glands atrophied and decayed; but such as remain can be saved by this application, and stimu lated into activity, so that a new growth of hair is produced. Instead of fouling the hair with a pasty sedi ment, it will keep it clean and vigorous. Its occasional use will prevent the hair from turning gray or falling off, and consequently prevent baldness. The restoration of vitality it gives to the scalp arrests and prevents the forma tion of 'dandruff, which is often so un cleanly and offensive. Free from those deleterious substances which make some preparations dangerous and iniu- rious to the hair, the Vigor can only I benefit but not harm it. If wanted merely for a HAIR DRESSING, nothing else can be found so desirable. Containing neither oil nor dye, it does not soil white cambric, and yet lasts long on the hair, giving it a rich, glossy lustre, and a grateful perfume. Prepared by Dr. J. C. Ayer & Co., Practical and Analytical chemists. XOWJilX. MASS. Ayer's Cherry Pectoral, For Diseases of the Throat and Lungs, such a Coughs, Colds, Whooping Cough, Bronchitis, Asthma, and Consumption. Among the great, discoveries of modern science, few nro of more real value to mankind than this ef fectual remedy for all diseases of tiib Throat and Lung. A vast trial of its virtue", throughout this nnd other countries, has shown that it docs surely and effectually control them. The testimony of our best citi zens, of all classes, establishes the fact, thnt Cherry Pectoral will and does relieve nnd sure tho nfflictine disorders of tho Throat nnd Lungs beyond any other medicine. The most dangerous affections of tho Pulmonary Orcans yield to its power; and cases of Consump tion, cured by this preparation, are public ly known, so remarkable as hardlv to bo be lieved, were they not provcu bevond dispute, As a remedy it is adequate, on which the publio may rely for full protection. By curing Coughs, the forerunners of moro serious disease, it snvos unnumbered lives, and nn amount of suffering not to be computed. It challenges trial, nnd con vinces the most sceptical. Every family should keep it on hand as a protection against the early and unperceived attack of Pulmonary Affections, which are easily met at first, but which become incurable, and too often fatal, if neglected. Ten der lungs need this defence; nnd it is unwise to be without it. As a safeguard to children, amid the distressing diseases which beset the Throat and Chest of childhood, Cherry Pkctoral is invaluable; for, by its timely use, multi tudes are rescued from premature graves, nnd saved to the love and affection centred on them. It acts speedily and surcl v against ordinary colds, securing sound and health-restoring sleep. No one will suffer troublesome Influenza and pain ful Bronchitis, when they know how easily they can be cured. Originally the product of long, laborious, and successful chemical investigation, no cost or toil is spared in making every bottle in the utmost possible perfection. It may be confidently re lied upon as possessing all the virtues it lias ever exhibited, and capable of producing cures as memorable as the greatest it has ever euected. PREPARED by Dr, J.
