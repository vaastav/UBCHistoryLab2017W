National Commerce Institution Goes Down, Carrying 3 Smaller Houses With It. The National Bank of Commerce, the second largest financial institu tion in Kansas City, with $lG,y42,CJ4 in deposits, failed to open its doors Thursday. Later three small institu tions! in which the Bank of Com merce was largely interested the Stockyards Bank of Commerce, the Union Avenue Bank of Commerce, and the State Bank of Argentine, Kas., a suburb also closed their doors. The' failure of the National Bank of Commerce followed' a steady run of six weeks, during which the bank havl paid off $19,000,000 of its c s its, reduced its loans three and a halt million dollars, cut down its cash re sources eleven and three-fourths mil lion dollars, and sold two million dollars of . high grade bonds in nn effort to meet the demands upon it. The directors of the bank had been in conference practically all night be fore the decision to suspend business was reached. They gave out a state ment Thusday morning saying that inability to collect money from bor rowers as fast as it was demanded by the creditors of the bank was the cause o fthet -closing. They said Chi cago and New York bankers had of fered assistance, but that "t had been refused because they could not tell how long the heavy drains would continue. j Certain Chicago, New York, and St. Louis bankers agreed to raise $3,750,00 to help out the National Bank cf Commerce if that amount would pt;ll the institution through. It was provided, however, the bank should be specially examined and the securities offered fo rthe loans: to be made should be approved. A spec'a! examination proved conditions- to be unsatisfactory anl the bank was closed. A fe-jv of the Chicago banks al ready had advanced several hundred thousand "dollars. One of the loans was secured by bonds. Another large bank, instead of making a loan, redistontinued a large sum of com mercial paper. The closing of the bank occasioned no disturbance at Kansas City. The same was true in New York. But as Kansas City is a so-called reserve city under the national bank ing act. a great many Kansas banks carried .i part of their reserve with it. There may be some suffering in Kan sas and contiguous territory on this account. To Force Early Trials. It is given out at Georgetown that Attorney General Breathitt, upon as suming the duties of his office, will take up -the Goebel murder cases and bring all the indicted to an immedi ate trial. Many who are under in dictment have been serving in the Powrr:' triil there as witnesses and in return for their services have never teen put in jail or compelled to give bond. The matter, it is said, will be taken out of the hands of the com monwealth's officials because of the methods pursued in prosecuting sonn and letting others go. It is expected that some who are in the state, acting as witnesses in the Powers trial will be arrested and re'd for such proceedings. The :not important testimony at the Powers trial Friday was against Jim Howard, who is serving a life sentence for the murder of the governor. Judge ) II. Hazclrigg, who was chief justice of the court of appeals at the time Goebel was assassinated, wis the first witness Friday. Just previous to the shooting Judge Norton came into his court and 7i formed the witness trouble was brew ing. He adjourned court and they left the room. Judge Habelrigg saw the west door of the executive building open. Three men came out with guns, bludgeons and revolvers. One of the -men seemed to be giv ing a command, and Judge llazelrigg thought this, man was Jim Howard Five minutes later Goebel was shot. Canal for Indiana. An Indiana state organization for the advancement of waterway im provements is one of the possibilities of the near future. Henry Riesen berg, of Indianapolis, who was diet ed vice president of the National Congress of Rivers' and Harbors, said Friday that a soon as he returns to Indianapolis from Washington, he will issue a call for a state conven tion to form a permanent organiza tion to agitate waterways improvc men.'s. The convention will be hld at Indianapolis, and every commer cial body in the state will, be invited o send delegates. Among the specific improvements that will be agitated is a ship canal from Lake Erie to Lake Michigan via Northern Indiana. An appropriation for the Wabash and an appropriation for deepening the Ohio river so as to insure a nine-foot stage at all seas on? of the year will be asked. Jury Acquits Metsker, The evidence in the Metsker .rLl was all in, before G:00 o'clock Friday evening, and the arguments were be gun at 7:1. The pleas were finally fimslvetf by 11:00 a. m. Saturday, and after the judge's instructions the case went to the jury. About thirty minutes later a verdict of not guilty was returned. The best weekly Tribune. I Better to Live The suicide of Clara Bloodgood, the actress, adds another to the long list of men and women of prominence who hive in recent months taken their own lives. When a bank presi dent whose bank has failed through his own mismanagement ends his life voluntarily, as has happened twice lately in New York, a cause' for it can be understood, but the self-destruction of one who to all appearances is enjoying what are, in the common estimate, among the most desirable prizes of existence popularity, re spect, public applause, financial pros perity creates a shock of surprise. Various theories are advanced to account for the growing frequency of suicide. In insurance circles the opinion is expressed that the payment of life policies to the families of men who have killed themselves the antir suicide provision being disregarded for reasons of expediency or because of a difficulty ( f proving the undoubt ed fact is a direct encouragement to self murder and explains many cases. Mcd'cal men, on the other hand, urge the exhaustion of nervous force in cident to the pressure of modern life as the chief cause. Tolstoy, in a re cent article on murder, says that to deprive the human body of the divine principle, which is life, is a rejection and defiance of the moral law reveal ed thousands of years ago and of the central doctrine of Christianity. He is discussing war, but th same argu ment applies, of course, to self- mur der. Probably the Russian philosopher comes nearest to the truth. Certainly the lack of moral stamina is evident in mast .instances. The bank presi dents had not the courage to face the results of their own bad judgment and left the burden of settling their affairs to others. "Every heart know eth its own bitterness," but whatever grief the actress may have cherished, she still had those things in abund ance which make life worth living health, the -power to entertain her fellow beings and rrjake their days brighter, unlimited opportunities of enjoyment for herself. A phase of the moral law not sug gested by Tolstoy is always disre garded in the suicide of the sane For few persons nowadays accept the theory that the man who kills him self fs necessarily mentally unbalanc ed; this phase is the duty of a mar. to his family and friends. Intense selfishness is a characteristic of the suicide. He seeks to evade trouble for himself, careless or the anguish he -causes to thos whom he deserts. Een the man who deliberately goes to his death in order that his family may benefit by his insurance fails to refiect that no money can offset the heritage of horror caused by his act. Whatever the causes of the increase jf self-destruction, the fact remains, however, that the deed is' so contrary to every healthy, wholesome human instinct that its performance can Hir er be other than impossible to the common man. A degree of courage is necessary to one who takes his own life, but the average man, for ttina.ely, has the greater courage to live. He may "not like the way the cards are shuffled," but he will play the game of exi.-itence througli to the end. Indianapolis News. , Bryan Comments on Message of President. William J. Bryan, en route to his home in Lincoln, Neb., arrived at Pittsburg Wednesday from Wash- tngton. Mr. Bryan was reluctant to discuss 4 President Roosevelt's message to Congress, saying that he had not !iad sufficient time to read it through. He however, commented freely on several of the most important issues and gave President Roosevelt credit for introducing an original proposi tion in suggesting the appropriation of campaign funds by the Govern ment. "I hope," he said, "that it will be enacted into a la-w." On important questions Mr. Bry an's ideas coincide with the texture r the message. He is strictly in ac cord with the President concerning postal savings banks and guaranteed banks. "The depositors' need security." said Mr. Bryan., 'and this must cithe? be given by the postal Savings bank, which will grow until it has absorb ed the deposit banking of the coun try, or it must be furnished through the guarantee of existing banks." Grant Haines Fined $50.00. The-case of the state versus Grant Haines charged with assaulting Lib erty Cross Avith intent to kill him, was given to the jury about 9 o'clock Thür lay evening and after, being out less than two hours the jury decided that the provocation under which Ha:nes labored when he attacked Cross with knife was so great that a fine of fifty dollars and costs was sufficient Haines is feeling good over tihe verdict and a great load is tiken from the mind of his wife. Both Haines and his wife felt that he was in danger of a prison sen tence. Hunters' Licenses Total $50,000. There will be no lack of money to igidly enforce the fish and game laws of Indiana next year. The num ber of hunters' licenses issued in the ( state this fall will average about 500 to the county. There are 93 counties so that the grand total at $1 each J will be close to $30,000. Last year the number was; something like 20,- OOO and the amount realized in dol- lars the same. ' 

FALL TAXES COLLECTED. Amount Sho-jvs a Gain Over Last Year's Collection. The fall county taxes, to the amount of $103,21C27 have been col lected by the county treasurer. About 2." per cent, of this vill go to the state treasury, and the remainder will be divided amongst the several town ships and the county. The amount collected this year, is an increase of about $000 over last year. Temporary Injunction Against Ro chester, Ind. A temporary restraining order has been granted in the Federal Court in the case of William W. Harrison of Philadelphia, against the town of Rochester, Ind. The motion for a temporary injunction will be argued in the Federal Court December 21, an J until that time the order that has been granted will restrain the school trustees from paying any money out of the special school fund of the town except on the interest al leged to be due on bonds held by the complainant. It also temporarily re strains the payment of any money to Fred Hoffman for certain street im provements in the town. Harrison brought suit on the ground that payment of interest had been defaulted on about $12,000 worth of bonds held by him that were executed by the city to-ward paying for a water plant and about $9,000 -worth of bonds) that were exe cuted for the purpose of assisting in the erection of a school house. He said that a special school fund had been established to pay the interest on the school bonds, but that the de fendant has refused to pay the in terest on the-school bonds out of this fund.' He asked that the defendant and its officers be enjoined from paying any money out of the school fund, except as interest on the school bends and that they be enjoined from failing or refusing to levy a special tax for payment of interest on the water bonds out of any funds now on hand and not otherwise le also was asked to restrain the pay ment of any money to Fred Hoff man until further hearing of the case. The order, which will preserve the case in its present state until further hearing, was made by Judge A. B. Anderson, who was in the city Wed nesday because the illness of a mem ber of the jury in the Walsh case, which the judge was hearing in Chi cago, caused a recess in that case. Indianapolis News. China and Her Future. That China in a few years will rank among the foremost countries of the world and that the many reforms and improvements now, going on tlVrough out the empire are almost perfected, K. T. Williams, secretary of the American legation at Peking, China, is firmly convinced. "There are " he aid, "three reforms' that are of tre menduous significance. First, the re organ zatron of the army; second, the acquirement of a new navy, and third, the reorganization of the government, which in itself is vastly important. Everywhere the interest in education is keen. Already the Chinese have 10,000 students studying in Japan, preparing to teach them when they return home. The women, too, are seeking cduca.ron. As yet only those K-irls who have money can buy an ed ucation However, the dowager em- press and many rich and charitable women of China are endowing funds for the founding of schools1 and col leges for the Chinese girl who is too poor to buy an education. The young men's whole desire is not to become officials at the court, as It was in the id ler days. They now study for all branches of the commercial life. "Though small of stature and weak jhysicallyx the dowager empress, who i? 73 years old. has strong character istics. The left sidt of her face is much more drawn than the other, be cause, of the palsy with which she was stricken several years ago. She takes great -interest in the many re forms that are being instituted and continually" is sending her subjects to all parts of the world to gain knowledge. The footbinding torture is now extinct, and at the imperial court no small-foote'd woman is al lowed. The cities along the river ways and the coast are progressing much faster than those inland, be cause of their easy access. Apart from the queer Hags and bunting and the quaint customs, the coastwise cities look just like an American city." Baltimore Sun. Financial Situation Looks Very Op ' timistic. The financial situation has cleared materially during the past week and assumed a decided optimistic turn. There was an increased ease in call money, some lifting of the embargo on time loans, advancing bonis and stocks prices and1 lowering of the cur rency premium. Despite the failure of two large banks there are many favorable sides to the stituation, several cities report ing issuance of clearing house certif- fcatcs has been suspended, while oth ers report that currency payments are quite general, and the feeling is that the payment of ihe country will soon be generally resumed, The improved financial conditions encourage the belief that business may be deferred much beyond the end of the mkmth, according to close students. 

METSKER, THE . SAVED BY A MERCIFUL JUDGE. Metsker the Unholy would have been convicted had not a kind-hcart-ed anl merciful judge taken compas-j sio.i on him an l practically instructed the jury to acquit the defendant, the Hon. (?) Clay W. Metsker. Metsker the unholy is charging everybody with beng w-hisky men, Mr. O'Keefe, Mr. Martindale and Mr. Hendricks. The facts in the case are that Metsker, the unholy, the all around grafter, drinks more whisky in one day than all the men he men tioncd do in a whole. inonth,and drfnks more wh'isky in a day than the edi tor of the Trib.ine d es in ten years. His unholiness holds a title to a saloon on North Michigan street Panama Bonds Sold. The secretary of the treasury has accpted bids for the Panama Canal bonds to the amount of $25,000,000. The average price of all the bids ac cepted is 103. Under the terms of the law the secretary's acceptance, of these bids, the allotments of bonds to -individuals and institutions will be confined to the small subscriptions from $10,000 down to $20. The amount of bids from individu als and insti.utions which tt has been possible to accept will, as heretofore, not be large. The remainder of the acceptances will be bids of national banks. The bids accepted have come from every section of the country and are mostly in small amounts. Secretary Cortelyou further says that the notice of acceptance will be mailed to the successful bidders with the least possible delay. The notices will f täte that payments for the bonds will be expected to be made at the treasury of the Uj.ited States or at some subtreasury, as indicated in the bkls of the subscriber, within ten days from the receipt of the notice by the subscriber. The - issue of Panama bonds was largely oversubscribed, but the im provement in business conditions, fol lowing the announcement of recent measures of relief by the Treasury Department, is regarded by the sec retary as warranting him in limiting the issue at this time to half the amount offered, namely $25,000,000. This is almost exactly the amount ot the disbursements from the general fund of the treasury that ' have been made during the year on the Panama Canal account. Powers' Attorneys Fight Over Books of Gov. Taylor. All testimony offered during the Powers trial Friday was for the pur pose of proving to the jury the ex istence of al'eged conspiracy on whirii the whole fabric of the row ers' prosecution depends, and that the conspiracy extended oyer several of the mountain counties of eastern Kentucky, that the object was to in timidate the General Assembly, the members of the Contest Committee; and failing in this attempt the con test was sought to be ended by the killing of Goebel. During the examination late Fri day of Secretary of State McChesney the pardon issued to Caleb Powers by W. S. Taylor, exonerating him from responsibility for complicity in the alleged Goebel murder conspir acy, was brought up, and it was shown that Powers had attested by official counter-signature the pardon granted to himfelf. This and the ex ecutive journal,- with its record of the acts of W. S. Taylor as Gover nor, were put in evidence, were the cause of many heated controversies Letween op;nsing counsel. Fairbanks and. Cannon Favor Deep Waterways. Vice-Preidcn: Fairbanks and Speaker Cannon Thursday, in receiv ing a committee of fifty delegates to the recent waterway convention in Memphis', expressed their heartiest sympathy with tjie project for a deep waterway from the lakes to the Gulf of Mexico. A memorial was pre sented, praying the support of Con gress to the project for a ship canal from the great lakes to the Gulf of Mexico through ihe Atlantic coast States, and recommending an annual appropriation of $50,000,000 for har bors ami waterways improvement. A notable feature of the rivers and harbors congress convention, now in session in Washington, was the ad dress delivered Friday by James J. Hill, j resident of the Greet Northern Railway Company, who was introduc ed to the congress as "a wizard of transportation and one of the greatest railroad builders in the world." New Gold J20 Pieces. The first instalment of new gold twenty doliar pieces has been ship ped from the United States mint in Philadelphia to various subtreasurics about the country. There were 113, 000 of them, their monetary value being $2,300,000. On one side of the coin is sin eagle flying, with out stretched wings, while on the other side is a figure of "Liberty." The coins were -made concave, the figures being in high relief, nine strokes of a hydraulic press being required to make them. Hereafter only one stroke will be used, and thus the coins just circulated will be different from those to be put into circulation later. 

DOWNTRODDEN, which is the only dive in Plymouth Where women have been allowed to congregate and drink and carouse at almost any ho.ir of the night. The gnfring editor is a fine speci men of "humanity to call some one else a whi-ky editor isn't he? Metsker was a grafter before he came to Plymouth and he had to leave Indiana to escaj c the clutches rif the law, and his escaping con viction th'is time is only -for the pres ent. A 1iorse-thief occasionally es capes ihe penitentiary but he does not quit stealing horses until he is finally landed in prison. "Every dog has his day," and Metsker will have Iiis day as sure as right is right. Churches Poor Sellers. Ecclesiastical real estate is a drug on the market in France. There is plenty of it, and much that is really desirable if any one wanti to claim a church as one of the possession- but the French people who cried loudest for the confiscation of the Catholic congregations' properties, with the thought that the revenue would come in handy for the gov ernment are not coming forward to buy. The result is that it is next to im possible fo sell in the provinces and nearly as bad in Paris itself. Offers have to be sought over and over even in the test quartets o fthe city. The great Convent of the Chanoinesses of St. Augustine, on the Avenue Hoche, found no bidders after ft had been put up seven y times. Finally, in- desperation, it was divided into building lots, and of these but two have been sold. M: Menage, the. liquidator of the property of the con gregations, has at last decided that everything shall be offered on the I lock, which gives little hope of real izing the millions for the state that had been counted upon when the Separationists forced the Catholic church to face expulsion, and it is by no nie?ns certain that even thousands will le obtained. Despite all this the expulsions go on just the same. In some places there is violent resistance, in others a keen show of displeasure. At Trehau, the abbot was found kneeling on his prie-dieu, after the door had been forced, but made no res stance. At Rumengpl, however ,the three vicars opposed the expulsion most strenuously, dressed in full sacerdo ia's and excommunicated the officers of the law as they were driven out. Rumengol is one of the most popu lar of all the shrines in Britany, and "s much re orted to by pilgrics from other departments, and' its vicafage is. perhaps, the finest in that region, being an imposing pile, with adjoin ing stables, outhouses and farm. The priests of Benodet were ex pelled by a special commissary from Qnimper, with sixty mounted police, but, though trouble was expected, only one obstreperous woman had to be arrested. The Law and the Rascal. The millionaire caught in a trap is no different from the ordinary cul prit when nabbed by a policeman. He evades, he lies, he shifts his posi tion, he -will commit perjury to es cape. And the rich scoumdrel, like the prtor one, will try to cast dis credit upon those responsible for his "No thief e"cr felt the halter draw With good opinion of the law." We sincerely believe that 95 per cent of ail the banks and big cor porations are managed with the ut most fidelity. This grand majority know exactly where to put the blame for every rascally act on the part of the slim m'nority. And it will avail the few crooked high financiers noth ing to go on preaching that most idi otic doctrine about the White House being responsible for their own mis demeanors. Philadelphia Press. Proposed Tax on Beer. An annual tax of $1 on every barrel of beer brewed in the United States for the creation of a "permanent in vestment fund" of $50,000,000 yearly for the development of the country's waterways is the proposal carried in a joint resolution Introduced in the House by Mr. Acheson, of Pennsyl vania. The preamble asserts the in adequacy of railroad trackage to handle the country's' fast growing business, points to waterways exten sion as the vital prerequisite to State and national development of re sources and recites that the revenue from the proposed high license tax on beer should be applied annually "not as an ordinary expenditure, but as a permanent investment." Van Tassel is Sentenced. Guy Van aTssel was found guilty of the murder of Policeman Luke Fitzpatrick and sentenced to life im prisonment by a jury in the criminal court at Chicago Thursday night. Fitzpatrick was killed while at tempting to arrest Van Tassel and Chas. Hanson for a burglary at Ham mond, Ind. Another policeman shot and wounded Hanson, but Van Tas sel escaped. Hanson was sentenced to life imprisonment, and subsequent ly enough dynamite was discovered in his cell to destroy the entire jail. LOUDEST" PRIZES WON BY F. A. FORBES. Horticulturists Give Premiums to His Onions: Prizes and prizes were awarded a the meeting of rhe Indiana State Hor t (cultural Society, in annual session n 1. O . . TT 1 f . t- . me oiaie iiouse, Din r. v. rorues of Plymouth, succeeded in capturing the "loudest" prize. Mr. Forbes won first premiums on two varieties o : . onions, une variety was the red globe and the other w-as the yellow globe. The onions were almost per fee in shape. Mr. Forbes told mem bers of the society that onion grow ing with him had been very profitable The onions which won the premium came from a five-acre tract devoted exclusively to that vegetable. The yield of the five acres was 200 bushels per acre and the price received for these onions was $500.02. It wasn't a good season for onions at that, he said. Victim to Tuberculosis. Charles Finley, former secretary of state in "Kentucky, wiho, with ex Governor W. S. Taylor of that state, is a political refugee in Indiana, is af fiicted with tuberculosis in its first stages and has gone to the Rockwood tubertulosis camp in' a patch of wood land near Avon, fifteen miles west of Indianapolis, to take the "open-air cure." Finley has been in poor health for some time, and went to the- tubercu los s colony on the advice of his phy sician, Dr. A. C. Kiimberlin. He has been at Röcbwood for about ten days and is already showing signs of im provement, it is said. Dr. . Rimberlin says that Finley' nervous system has become impaired. His lungs have been affected for some time. Finley falls heir to. tubercu losis through his familv. several of his ancestors and relatives having died from it. Dr. Kimberlin says that Finley will give the "open-air cure a momn s trial at least, lie is living in a tent and is being dieted and given absolute rest. Prior to his leaving Finley was told that the "open-air cure" is his only hope. Fin ley has been making his home for the last year with Lieut. Col. and Mrs. Guy A. .Boyle, on NoTth Meridian street. Airship Invented by Bell Makes Suc cessful Flight The tetrahedral kite Cygnet, the airship invention of Prof. Alexander Graham Bell maide a successful as cent Friday above the waters of the Brae d'Or lakes, where Prof. Bell's summer home and experimental lab oratory -are located. Carrying Lieut. Thomas E. Selfridge of the United States army, the big kite soared aloft wiih remarkable ease and maintained its poise without accident, while it towed along above the water by a small steam launch. Thus far the Cygnet has not been furnished with a motor for self -propulsion, although a space for such mmor was provided. Prof. Beli desired 'to make practical tests, of the buoyancy ankl balance of the inven tion before installing the motor and the ascension was one of the first of these tests. The experiments of Prof. Bell have teen going on for many months and have attracted wide attention because of the fact that invention makes use of the tetrahedral unit principle, an enfrely original and unique design in aeroplane construction. Berlin; Ready for Taft W.liiam H. Taft, the American Secretary of War, and the members of his party, arrived at Berlin from St. Petersburg Friday evening. Am bassador Tower and Lieut.-Col. John P. Wisser, the American military at tache there, mot the Secretary at the ra'ilroad station and took him to the ambassador's residence for dinner. fter that a small reception was held to the American residents of Berlin. The car in which Secretary -Taft and lis party are traveling from the fron tier has been provided by the gov ernment several railroad officials, assigned by the administration of Prussian ra lways, received Secretary Taft at fhe frontier and accompanied i:m to Berlin and thence to Hamburg and Cuxhaven. Several German and foreign newspaper correspondents went out to join the Secretary's train. Shout Caused Trouble. James Brokel of Newman, 111., has brought suit against Samuel Leon ard for $2000, charging personal in- ury. Brokel, while taking leave of Miss Hattie Leonard, fejl off the steps and broke his collar bone. He alleges that the fall was due to a shout from Miss Leonard's father while Brokel was in the act of kiss ing the girl good-night. In the suit brought Brokel is encouraged by the young woman, as she thinks the in terference by her father was unwar ranted. Two Valuable Bulletins. The Indiana agricultural experi ment station at Purdue univer.i;y has just issued two bulletins that are of special value to the branches of farm ing which they represent. The first one is on "Beef Production" by Prof. J. II. Skinner and W. A. Cochel and he second is on "Commercial Fruit Growing" by Profs. James Troop and C. G. Woodbury. These bulletins deserve careful reading. TJiey can be liad by dropping a line to Prof. Ar thur Goss, ; director of the experi ment station, Lafayette, Ind. Sueis. for Court Ruling on the M'Kin ley Will Secretary of the Treasury Cortel you and Justice William R. Day are made party defendants to an action filed Friday in the Common Pleas Court at Canton, Ohio, against the heirs and administrators of the estate of William McKinley. Secretary Cor telyou and Justice Day, as the admin istratbrs of the McKinley estate, have in their possession for distribution $125,000. The court action is brought by Robert S. Shields, administrator o the estate of Abner McKinley, broth er of William McKinley, to get a de cree setting farth the meaning of part of William McKinley's will. Plain-tiff Shields declares he re quested the acmintstrators of the late William McKinley's estate to have the court interpret the w:l where he considers it doubtful, but they refused to do so. The petitioner recites that he is in doubt as to whether the annuity given to "Moth er" McKinley ceased at her death The doubtful clause in the will reads: "To pay my mother during her life JlOoo a year and at her death said sum to be paid to my sister, Helen McKinley. The petitioner also declares he is in doubt as to the . proper construction of this clause of the William McKin ley will: 4.t m r VN-natsoever property remains at the death of my wife I give to my brothers and sisters, share and share alike." The late President's mother and two of his brothers died before the President, 'leaving Abner McKinley the only surviving brother. Creditors of Abner McKnley are endeavoring to get any money that may be com ing to his unsettled estate from the William McKinley estate. Governor Asks U. S. Troops. Gov. Sparks of Nevada, has ap peaied to i'resident Roosevelt to send federal troops from San Fran cisco to Goldfield, stating that the miners there are in revolt The ne cessity of calling upon the govern ment is due to the fact that there i no state militia in Nevada. President Roosevelt acted prompt ly and Wednesday issued orders to Getr. Funston in San Francisco to hold troops in readiness! to start to Nevada at once. Details as to the exact situation and the extent of the rioting cannot be secured, as it is said the news paper correspondents in Goldfield, Nevada are afraid to telegraph t tae facts. It is saiidl that even the tele graph operators are terrorized by the miners' union. "If the military are sent to Gold- field, said Funston, "the Twentieth and Twenty-second infantry will be called out. The Twentieth' is now at Monterey and the Twenty-second at. Angel Isjand and the Presidio. I am not sure of the exact figures, but I believe that together they muster ully 1,000 men. If the orders to start should be received we could move with hardly an instant's delay. Everything is in reakliness." The strike at Goldfield, -which has ed to rioting by idle miners, was due directly, it is said, to William D. Haywood, secretary of the Fedcra- ion of Miners, who was recently ac quitted of murder in Idaho. The men had decided to accept the termj offered by mine owners when Hay wood reached Goldfield and counseled them to strike. The mine owners have now an nounced that they wilj make Gold- ield an open shop camp, and Ulis an nouncement doubtless led to rioting. Heesnan Then and Burns Now. Many persons who retail the inter national prize fight between Heenan and Saycrs in 18G0 will remember distinctly the indignation with which the news of the defeat of the Amer ican champion was received. The country was profoundly stirred, and there were many cries of "robbery," "jobbery," and other words of simi larity in rhyme or import. It was a glorious day for England, a sad one for the United States. This burst of human emotion may be contrasted with the apathy with which tne country neana tne nev;s of the "international" fight in Lon don last Monday night. The victory of the American, the establishment of American supremacy in the prize ring, excited apparently no more in terest in the United States than it the two men had engaged in a pea nut eating contest. The English mild ly deprecated the defeat of their champion while admitting his general inferiority, but the children or the grandchildren of the men whose pas sions wcie so violently stirred by the defeat of Heenan treated the af fair as an incidental matter of every- !ay news not sufficiently important to demand a second thought. Allege Parents Sold Girl. Marie Thompson, the sixteen-year- old girl taken from a Gypsy camp on a writ of habeas corpus by her par ents, Antonio Thompson and wife, of os Angeles, Cal., has been given nto the custo'dy of her parents by udge McElhinney at the hearing of the case. The court -dismissed the case with out hearing arguments, but immedi ately afterward Mr. and Mrs. Thomp son were arrested' on the charge of vaving sold their daughter into slav ery. The charge was based on the dec- aration of Teter Adams'; a Gyp:y, who asserted he had paid Thompson $500 in gold for tjxc girL s.

"The -unlawful and corrupt protec ion given by the police to vice tor th e benefit, pecunialy and political- ly of the heads of the administra tion and many of the rank and file of the departments is unbelievable, it were not for the lotw character the witnesses examined and the If of tangled mass of contradictory evi dence submitted much of it undoub- edly perjured, indictments would ave been found for extortion anJ conspiracy in- forming a house of ill fan.- trust "There was not a property owner in San Frincisco after the fire in hose property there remained any salvage, who was not robbed by con-, nivance of the police officials with the junk thief." Five Hundred Lien Entombed in f Mine. A terrific and disastrous explosion occurred Friday in mines Nos. C and 8 of the Consolidated Coal Company, of Monongah, W. Va. A long dis- N ance telephone message said that the bodies of three miners had been re covered near the mouth of mine No. 6. They were foreigners. Superin tendent John Malone, of the mines, said there were at least five hundred men entombed. Mine No. C is lo cated on the east side of the Monon gahela river, and mine No. 8 is on the west side. How the explosion oc curred simultaneously in both mines can not be explained. The explosion was heard for a dis ance of eight miles. . It is believed that a majority of the entombed men were killed. Immediately after receipt of the news, physicians ana special cars were sent to the scene from Fair- mount. The mine was then too full of gas and smoke for the rescuers to be able to go in. It was said the explosion started in No. 6 and spread to No. 8 mine, the wo being connected. The very earth seemed to be rent at the moment of the shock. Some idea -of the force of the explosion may be gained from the fact that props- from the mine were not only be own out of the entry, but were hurled by the force of it clear across the west fork of the Mo nongahela river.
