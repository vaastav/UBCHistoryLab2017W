NEW HARDING PROPOSAL REVIVES HOPE OF PREVENTING WAR-IDA TARBELL ? ? ? ??? Writer Says World Must Join Before Disarming * Arms Conference Delegates Work in Harmony Despite Rumors of Differences Between The Premiers in Closed Sessions. . By IDA M. TARBELL. W hy did President Harding, without warning, inject an associa tion of nations into the conference on the limitation of armament on the last day of its second week of life? The conference has a definite agenda. Mr. Hughes, its chairman, is following it with the rigor of a good schoolmaster. That agenda makes no mention of a conference, association, or league of nations. So far as it is concerned the world is rfiade up of nine nations, and here comes the President ot the United States and casually announces that before the work here is completed it should include an association of all the nations of the earth. Why did he do it? Did he want to divert public attention from the dangerous irritations of the moment? We do not yet know enough of the workings of Mr. Harding's mind to be able to say whether he would, like Napoleon 111, gild a dome when there was equally public weather. All we do really know about the President ft? far is his genuinely beneficent intent. Is he canny enough to Know that the public i*- as easily diverted as a child and capable of attempting the trick when things arc getting a bit out of hand5 Sitnnt.-oii Wan Crttical. 1 No one can deny that the situa tion was ticklish enough in Thanks giving week to justify such a maneuver. The conference had entered on its second stage?the stage in which you ?et down to cases, trying to j make realities of the noble senti ments of the first or platform stage e- ,xnd theoi there happened in the tr.Mj^ition just what happened two and a. half years ago in Paris. It is aljnosf startling: som? times to an observer hiere who was also an db s?*r\Vr of the Paris conference to i ?fe hvw th? experiences of the two! "bodies parallel. The moment the Paris ctV*f*rence got down to work, that Is. i*^solved itself into commit, teen. shut f??e door and went at its tasks, there was an outburst of re monstrance. suspicis n and accusa tion. It was "seciVt diplomacy." There must be thine* going on that they ^' re concealing f)con? the public, breaks in cood will. The same thing happened here the moment the con ference set itself aiw its task. There" was a rumor siT^ad of a sharp quar. rel between MV. Jialfour and Mr Hughes on the way the discussion* in the committers were to be han dled. It was said that Mr. Hughes "w anted everything that was voiced put down: that Mt. Balfour thought fc. digest of the dhtrussioaa would be sufficient. This rujnor was followed bv the story of h n ugly scene in committee between the presidents of the French and the Italian dele gation*. Premier S'.riand and Sen ator S? hanzer ovej- the morals of the Italian army. Deler*tea A?-?*e*nlble. Vow. luckily, this conference has fc^en admirably arranged to scotch vicious rumors Ttiere never has fceen a great international gather ing in which the pr?ss was having as real an opportunity to learn what is going on. 11 very morning there is given out a t press head quarters a list of del* urates who at fixed hours will recei ve the press The mornincr bulletin v ITT ron some, thing like this. 11 a.I m.?Lord Lee. 11:30 a. m?Ambassador Schan fcer. 3 p. m.?I^ord Rlddell 3:30 p m.?Secretary Hfughes. I P. m.?Th?> President of the United States. 5:30 p. m.?Admiral Ka to. And so on Every day from 6 to * opportunities are given to Cor? r< spondents to question principals of the conference. How much they get depends upon how mxch they ?anry?how able they are to ask questions?how sound thHr judg ment is of the answers they get h..w honest their intent tan In in terpreting. When ugly rumors such those which disturbed the? second wrrk of the conference life occur this method of treating the press is of real advantage to the powers concerned. ( onT.'ncf# rorrfairandrntii. It wa aa joy to see the way sec retary Hug toes. for instanoe. handled the rumors. It is aim-ays a joy to see Mr. Hughes -when he Is righteously fndlgnant and he cer tainly was *p on tiie afternoon of1 November 2~- Ho lunged at once at th.? reprrrt of the break between himself and Mr. Balfour. The state ment bad no base but the imagina tion of the writer It was unjust , to Mr Palfogr, who had been co operative fro.v th% start To put htm of all m??n at the conference I in n position of opposing the I'nited : States was most unfair. There had be?en no clashes in I committee* no qiftarrels. There had of course been differences jn points of view, candid statements, free ex. i planations. but anyone with com mon sense knew thai such exchange of views must take place. It was a fine, generous convincing answer, tb th? ugly rumors a.nd the beauty i of It It that-vou bel|ev?e Mr. Hughes ! You know, that he Is not lying to! you. I bellere this to be the gen- ' Tal conviction of the new-paper . men. He convlnceas them and thev are all for him. Rumor* n? Harm. , This is a real achievement for any ; man. for the press craft are hard to convince and quick to suspect. ' Many of them have been for years In the thick of public affairs, watching men go up and down; see |nc heroes made and unmade; the incorruptible prove corruptible. One ! Wond?r? sometime not that thev have so little faith, but that they ! b*v* any But they believe Mr H jghes and when he denied *. rumors his word was accepted but the rumors were out?had been cabled abroad and they were al ready doing their ugly work?bit ing right and left like mad dogs. Kharp speeches were being made in /.'itMon and in Paris; there was ri t and bloodshed in Italv So Mr S*rfn^,h.V P,enty of J"?Wcatloi If h*. did throw out his suggestion of an association of nations to di vert public attention. 'However, there are other ?. planatlons of his moVe. One is that the experience of the conference to dute has demonstrated clearly that the armaments of the world cannot *? fely and wisely be handled bv nine nations Moreover, that land fr.d sea armament* cannot he con ? 1-Vre.l a* separate entities . Mr. Hughes Included both\jiavies ? nd armies on his proer*m and in ? ? legall.tle fashion he has been t*ktnc up quest ions in the order In whfch they were la|d down Both the public and the press, however ? Hre seemed to have lost sight at t mes. of the agenda. Early (n the conference they Jumped to the con cision that all would he over her# when England. Japan and the l*r\ited States had agreed to Mr. I Huffhei' naval program. Public r.anily Stayed. Thin was one of those snap judg ments that are always disturbing ( gatherings ?Jike this conference. . Press and public seem to forgot when some fragment of the pro gram on which the body is working trtracts unusual attention that it is ;i fragment and that there are still other things to foUow. When it seemed sure at the end of the first week of the conference that Mr. Hughes' naval program would go through practically as it had been laid down you heard talk on all sides from those who ought to have known better that the conference would be out of the trenches by Christmas. Yet there was a long j and difficult series of questions still untouched. It was France that dragged land armament into the scene before the time scheduled for its appear ance. France did not play much of 'a paft In the conference at the 'start. Her time had not come. She h:is not been accustomed to being off the .stage in recent years, a?d it worried her a little. Then Mr. Rriand had to go home. To accom modate him he was allowed to make his plea ahead of what would have been the chronological order. It swung the conference a long dis tance from the point where it was then operating The French pre mier made it perfectly clear in his speech, something that has been, curiously ignored, that France was cutting her army in two. from 750,0^0 to 350.000 men?was propos ing to reduce her term of service from three years to eighteen months. But, said M. Rriand. France can not do more In limiting her I armament unless England and the I United States will guarantee her safety. And he went on to de velop the French theory that Ger many and Russia are dangerous menaces to Western Europe. Powerful as was his oratory. Ills material did not convince those at whom it was directed. Mr Ralfotir and Mr. Hughes made most sympa thetic replies. protesting that France could be always sure of the moral support, at least, of England ?lud America If she were attacked wantonly by any power, but they made no sign of giving the kind of guarantee that was sought. What Rriand Arc?mpll?hed. One important thing that M. Bri and did do. however, was to bring Into sharp rejief the faCt that land and naval armaments can not be handled separately that they dove tall In the game of war and that to cut the navy of a'nation whose main defense is ships, without con siderlng the relation of that cut to the size of the armies of those na ; lions in which armies are the chief \ defense. Is to leave an unbalanced 1 situation. A second realization went along with this and that was that the scrapping and cutting by nine na tions must be done with an eye to the actual or potential armaments ; of the other forty-flve or so nations i of the earth. i Mr. Jlriand s speefh made vou realize how France and Italy must consider possible continental alli ances of powers that are not repre- i sentcd at this conference; must ron ! sider a possible Russian crusade to convert -the world by ^irce to its! gospel. And if France and Italy must secure themselves against these, possibilities, could England weaken herseelf disproportionately? When you begin to consider the question of armament in terms of the world and not simply of nine nations, you can not if you are candid find any peaceful solution but by bringing everybody In? Germany, Turkey. Kussia. Now It may be, though we do not know Mr. Harding well enough yet to say. that the logic of the experience that the conference has been going through up to date laid hold of him and he said It like a man?"There ts but one way out, a?d Miat Is by one big union." listens to the People. Of course, there is another ex- j planation of why he did it, and I rather think it may be the true one after all. The President may be j hearing from the country. One ' thing that we do know about him is that he Is a man who with almost j religious care listens to the voices that come up to ?im from the peo- I pie And It Is no secret that a mul titude of voices, strong and weak have been calling to him in the last! few weeks, "conference," "assocla ,tion." "league." some method of' carrying on In which everybody can I join. In no other way can we hope for permanent peace. It may be that Mr. Harding had heard so much I of this that he felt he much reply. And if this is true, "he has Hone wisely. We. mav take It as one of the i deepest convictions of the present world that some sort of association | of nations is necessary. So far as we can determine, the'world Is not j s?t on any particular form or co?e- i nant, though, of course, there Is one I I to which some fifty-three of Its na | tions have subscribed and which for i some two years now has been doing Increasingly practical work in ad Justing international difficulties and in building up machinery for co-op. ?ration in law. labor, economics, transportation, the control of*erlme This experience. ,h? manifold echoes of Its wotk whl?| reach us only makes the Idea of ak^ociation stronger, emphasizes the belief that it can be made a practical rea)4ty The conference may limit ! aments. naval and land In the nine I Nothfng Else in World Like It on Windless, Cold Days.

For Is % winter feature here, apd takes the place of snow which only falls once or t^ice dur ing the season. Now the few American^ who still remain in Lon don are getting their full share. There is nothing else in the world like this fog. Lorylon lies in a valley, the old city having b?en built on the flat tidal marshes o^ the river Thames. In winter, when the sea fogs come up this valley from the mouth of the Thames es tuary. they miiglt with thei (ImM ?>f black soft coal smoke that hangs over the city and produce a thick, black, opaque v$il of tiark-; ness known as "smog"?a word coined by combining smoke and fog. HnI IsUs*IIm For. lAMflwn is a city without central heating, and almost every room in offices aid homes his an open fire place where soft coal is burned all | day. Thus the constant rising strean^ of soot intensifies the fog. in?l the soupy mixture darkens and thickens throughout the day. At night the foj% 'usually lifts with the evening wind, but when a| series of windless days occur Lon don gets a sample of real * 'black fog." The soot forms on the fot: particles, hanging in the air. and j gradually a 'London particular" fog develops At high noon on the day of a black fog It will be pitch dark throughout the city All lights will be on In homes and office build- j Ings: autos crawl through the streets with headlights glaring, and all street lamps will be lit.

But In the black fogs of today there are moments when one Is apt to fully believe that old legend that once.

Dec. 10.?The old question at what age a child becomes capa ble of a wittingly criminal Impulse., receives a lurid side.-light from a case which has just been 4?cided before the court at Jolgny (Tonne).

I Walt Whitman once said that Abra ham Lincoln's passion for tjie Union ! had become what he called a "new virtue." Whitman called this new ' virtue* "Unionism." and he saw it : as a part of Lincoln's character, like his honeaty, goodness, shrewd ness. There Is no manner of doubt that this world Is coming to regard Unionism as a virtue, and that it is demanding that It be realized In {he same way as it demands that we realize, honor and understanding. Mi*: Harding may see this. He may have gone over In his mind the steps taken to realize "Union ism" In the last twenty-five years, ! not to go further back. They have 1 been many: The Hague conferences! and conventions, the schemes of federation that great individuals like Lord Brvce, powerful groups. French?
