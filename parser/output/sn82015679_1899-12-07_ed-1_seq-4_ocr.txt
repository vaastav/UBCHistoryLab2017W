" The Kentucky mob that cut out the eye of the wretched murderer yesterday and committed other atrocities on their victim displayed a fiendishness Quite as revolting as the crime of the negro. It would be a wise thing' for' Congress to stop the waste of J20.000.000 to carry the second-class mail matter of three or four thousand individuals and devote one-half of It to encouragement of steamship lines that would benefit the whole country. The New York Times "congratulates Mr. II. H. Hanna, of Indianapolis, and his as sociates of the monetary conference be cause so much of their good work has been Incorporated Into the bill of the Repub lican caucus committee of the House. A committer of the Cincinnati Council has been Investigating the elevated track system of Chicago. A small Indianapolis official junket did the same thing for this city. .The result was an unsuitable ordi nance and the dropping of the wholo mat ter. The Democrat who put Mr. Richardson in nomination declared that upon the con duct of the minority of the House the next presidential election' would turn. This may be true, tout llr. Bryan can never be brougftt to believe that he will not be the whole thing. ; "When silver coin can be taken to the treasury and exchanged for gold, as Is provided by the Republican caucus bill, its passage cannot be assailed because sliver money is left to depreciate. What silver money the Republicans coin they propose to keep as good as gold. If any portion of the 861 bills presented In both branches of Congress on Tuesday chould be given the force of law the country might well be alarmed. Fortunately not one In twenty will get upon a calendar, and, thanks to the Reed rules, will never be taken up in the House. In this year of prosperity it appears thU the drug trade of Indianapolis has Increased 23 per cent., which warrants the conclu sion that either the people need much more medicine In prosperous seasons or that when times were not good they did not have as much medicine as they needed. Senators Teller of Colorado, Jones and Stewart of Nevada, and Pettigrew, who have been holding Senate chairmanships by the courtesy of Republicans, have declined the offer of the Republicans that they re tain their places. It remains to be seen what the Democrats will do for them. , There Is no reason In the world why the President .. In his message should not be just as cordial to Germany as to Great Britain. An English paper seems to be laboring under the delusion that Mr. Chamberlain's remarks about American good will extend only to Great Britain. : "While the Governor of Alabama is de nouncing Senator Morgan because he is not enough of a Bryan and silver advocate he Is making an effort to refund the 5 per cent, bonds of the State into gold bonds bearing 02 per cent. Interest. And yet it was not long ago that the Bryan party was denounc ing gold bonds. SBSSBBBBBBSSSBBBBBBBSSBBSiBBBSSBBBBBBBSBSaSBSSBBfMSBSB Correspondents of several papers de nounce Ervins WInslow for his insane as sault upon the President in his thanks giving greeting and desire to hold him up to "public execration." Those writers should understand that men like WInslow, If they cannot have praise, prefer execra tion to being Ignored. 1 That thousands in Washington have rushed to the Capitol to see Mr. Roberts proves that many people are the victims of an idle, not to say vulgar, curiosity. What sort of purpose, of a worthy sort, can those people have ' who wait about the hall cf the House of Representatives all day to get a sight of a man who is alleged to have three wives? Mr. Joseph Pulitzer, publisher of the New York World, and a nonresident, asks In the North American Review if Congress has abdicated Its powers to the President, alluding to the failure of the last Congress to legislate regarding Hawaii and the pos sibility that it may not legislate regarding the Philippines, Porto Rico and our other possessions and responsibilities. Now that the President has asked Congress to adopt a po'Jcy regarding our possessions. It Is evi dent that he has no idea that Congress has abdicated. Mr. Pulitzer's yellow news paper took the imperialism side of the Phil ippine matter because its rival In the yel low business opposed the flag-furling theory. Senator Jones, of Arkansas, is dissatisfied because the President was not sufficiently definite In his message in relation to trusts. The Arkansas senator has represented his State in the Senate fifteen or twenty years and has not offered a bill which will defi nitely restrain trusts. For years he and his party in Congress have held that that body cannot adequately legislate regarding trusts, never presenting or advocating a till, and new, after ail these years, they complain ttzl ha President Is indefinite. Lt the Democrats present a bill. Mr. Bryan has outlined a measure which provides in effect that no corporation shall be valid that does not have authorization by a board created by Congress declaring that it Is not a trust. Perhaps Senator Jone, who has been some thing of an advocate of slate supremacy, is ready to introduce the proposition of the one Democratic leader. 

SECRETARY GAGE'S REPORT. The secretary of the treasury is a finan cier of Ion?? and varied experience. Not only has he studied the subject as a the ory, but he has had the opportunity to as certain the truth by an extensive expe rience as a financier. For that reason what he has to say In his report, much of which 13 given In this Issue, 13 worthy not only of the reading, but of the careful study of those who are seeking accurate Information on the money question. In fact, there are few men In the country who are as well qualified as Secretary Gage to discuss the money question or to present suggestions for legislation which will secure the best results for the coun try. In his report Mr. Gage discusses the importance of placing the currency of the country firmly upon the gold basis. His reasons are those of a man of business ex perience. The money of the world is gold; in effect, the United States has been on a gold basis for years; all values have been measured by gold for years, and no really potential and civilized nation has any other or desires any other monetary basis. International bimetallism, whether now desirable or the reverse. Is an Impossibility not to be discussed. No nation. can pre serve the parity between coins of the two metals acting independently. It is simply a choice between a silver or gold standard. There Is no argument which can affect the argument of Mr. Gage. What he says In regard to national banking is the expres sion of a business man and not the dog matism of a theorist. He believes in the national banking system anu presents un answerable arguments to warrant his opinion. He would increase the usefulness of the banks. His methods for the In crease are those of a man of experience. These subjects are treated with clearness and force In the portion of his report re lating to the currency. THE 

MERIT SYSTEM. Most people who believe in the merit sys tem will admit that the President is a firm believer in Its application to every branch of the public service, yet there are a few men who have denounced him and his Cab inet because he took several thousand em ployes out of the certified lists. Some of these, when they meet here a few days hence, will assail the President and denounce him as an enemy to the merit system because he does not accept their views. These excellent men are confident that they own the recipe for the improvement of the civil service, and that Is to extend Its rules to cover thousands of men without exam ination, and thereafter to have all appli cants examined with a view of ascertaining their fitness according to their method. which they think Is the only one. After two years consideration the President and his Cabinet, including men of larger busi ness experience than any of those who as sail them, found that it was not for the good of the public service to retain about 10,000 places In the service under the Cleve land classification. A portion of these em ployes are the confidential subordinates of chiefs who are under bonds. The average Judgment is that a high officer shouli choose his own cashier and the deputies who are responsible to him In a personal and financial way. The few men who claim the patent for the only civil service that can be efficient hold that these confidential subordinates must be selected under the rules of the civil service. Many of them never passed an examination, but hold the places they oc cupy by partisan appointment. Again, hun dreds of men are needed from time to time, often temporarily, as teamsters and labor ers, and many more hundreds are employed by ttye War Department. No competitive examination can discover the qualifications of such men. So these men are regis tered, as it is called, upon presenting evidence of good character. Then they are employed, and, if competent, they are se cure In their places; if not competent they are dismissed. This method of registration was adopted by the Harrison administra tion in the navy yards. The general verdict of naval officers is that it has worked a revolution in that service, securing compe tent men and faithful service. It Is not. however, civil-service reform in the Judg ment of a number of theorists who'really believe that their method is the only one that can be devised. 

TIIC TWO CTURKXCY BILLS. Those who have carefully examined the Senate currency bill and the bill of the House caucus committee have found they do not contain such radical differences as to hazard an agreement between the two houses. In the most essential features there is no material difference. Both de fine the gold standard and make provision for maintenance of the reserve. The lan guage is different, but the purport Is the same. There Is some difference In the pro visions of the two bills regarding silver coinage, but it Is only a difference in method, since the object of both bills seems to be to make the largest use of silver consistent with stability of the currency f ctf,, me standard. and the maintenance o Such being the case, there can be no doubt that both houses will agree upon the gold standard, the breaking of the endless chain by which the reserve can be drawn from the treasury and the coinage of sil ver. In regard to the banking features of the two bills there Is some difference. Both measures authorize the Issue of bank notes to the face of the bonds. One places the bank tax upon all the assets, while the other continues It upon the circulation. These are not material differences, since the main purpose of both bills is to encour age the banks to Issue a larger volume of notes than they have been doing tdnce the reduced Interest and high premium on bonds have made the note-Issue feature of the banking system profitless In the larger cities. And here it may be said that the Republicans should not hesitate to assume the responsibility of making the banks the source of paper-currency issue. There must be an Issue of the representatives of money In the form of notes. It Is no part of the function of the government to make such Issues, particularly when It already has more than $431,000,000 of outstanding notes. There was no excuse for the Issue of the greenbacks except the urgent necessity of the government during the war. Before that time it was never assumed that the government should issue money other than to coin gold and silver. When Andrew Jackson put. an end to the United States bank he never dreamed of having the gov ernment Issue notes, but allowed banks created under state laws to do so. All of the men, whether belonging to the Senate or House, who have taken part in formulating the bills are intent on se curing a measure that will prove satis factory and salutary. They have not com mitted themselves to plans which have been advocated but which many fear be cause they do not afford sufficient security for the redemption of the notes issued by banks. Republicans and sound-money men who are not Republicans should pass a currency bill which will Include the essen tial features of both. Those who are not for sound money and who are looking about for a political Issue should not In terfere with the passage of a bill which may afford them one. It scarcely needs be. added that the ma jority In Congress should waste no time In agreeing upon a currency or' financial bill. If such a measure could be passed before the holidays it would give addi tional assurance to the business situation and inspire the country with confidence in the wisdom of Congress. All of the leading featurs of both bills are important. If passed with the provision authorizing the incorporation of national banks with a capital of $23,000 and to issue notes to the face value of the bonds deposited for the security of circulation It Is probable that many small barks would be organized for the purpose of issuing circulation, and that many others would Increase the volume of their circulation. These and other considerations should lead Congress to pass a currency bill as early in the ses sion as possible. The people who were set to the task of making bricks without straw in an age when the latter was a necessary ingredient of the former had a sinecure compared with the job assigned E. C. Corser, of Minneapolis, who has nothing to do but preserve peace between the silver Repub licans, Democrats and Populists. Before his task is through he will ask to be trans ferred to some lonesome back yard, and there set at the pleasant employment of keeping peace among a half dozen tom cats, tied tail to tail and hung over clothes lines. The London Thunderer found nothing to criticise in President McKinley's message. Neither did anybody else except Bryan and his followers, and their criticism is at least open to the suspicion of being prejudiced.

CHICAGO, Dec. 6.-Charies Kingsbury Miller, chairman of the flag committees of the Sons of the American Revolution and Society of Colonial Wars in Illinois and an executive member of the American Flag Association of ew York, has' forwarded to every representative and senator at Washington a document appealing n strong language for the enactment of a law for the protection of the flag and to pro hibit Its use for advertising or commer cial purposes. The petition, which Is headed "Desecration of the American Flag. Our National Disgrace," is accompanied by indorsements from hundreds of public men. including ex-Presidents of the United States, members of President McKinley's Cabinet, foreign ambassadors and minis ters, senators, soldiers who achieved dis tinction in the Spanish and civil wars, lead ing educational men and many others. All of the communications are strong Indorse ments of a Hag law and call upon Con gress to enact sucn a measure without delay.

BUCKET SHOPS. Concerted Movement ly the Lending Commercial Exchanges. CHICAGO. Dec 6. The Board of Trade of Chicago has taken first step In what is Intended to be a concerted movement of commercial exchanges ail over the country against the bucket shop system. ResoIu tlons adopted by the board of directors call ing on the exchanges to combine against the encroachments of this form of specula tion have been circulated' by Secretary Stone, of the Board or rraae, ana a num ber of replies have already been received, all of which Indicate a strong feeling In favor of such a movement. The purpose of the nntl-bucket shop crusaders is ro strike at the bottom of the whole business by se curing the aid of the New York Stock Ex change and the Cotton Exchange, which in conjunction .with the Chicago Board of Trade form the basis of nearly all the bucket shop operations In the country. Among the exchanges which have been communicated with are those at St. Louis, Detroit, Buffalo, Indianapolis, Duluth. Phil adelphia. New Orleans. Baltimore.

If the general ser.t.'ment is favor able to such a movement it the Intention. nrcordlnir to Secretary Stonj, to hold a convention to discuss the most practical manner In which to do away -with bucket Khnns. If the replies are favorable a com mittee will at once be appointed to work out preliminary plans. FOR GOLD STANDARD FORMAL DECLARATION nECOJI MENDED 11V SECRETARY GAGE. Several Important Reason "Why Con gress Should Firmly Establish the Country's Jloney Standard. HR. GAGE'S ANNUAL BEPORT NOTABLE DISCUSSION OF PHASES OF THE Cl'UULXCY QUESTION. Necessity of Changing the National Banking Laws .Made Apparent Amendments Su Kites ted. WASHINGTON, Dec. 6. The annual re port of the secretary of the treasury was transmitted to Congress to-day.. It is an interesting document, containing a review of the work of all bureaus in the Treasury Department, with Recommendations of vast importance to the business Interests, and the people in general. Nearly an me statistics given by Mr. Gage have been made public from time to time in reports of bureaus, and the President, in his message, yester day, gave the summary of the government receipts and expenditures. The secretary's estimates were sent to Congrss on Mon day. The matter of greatest Interest is the secretary's discussion' of the financial ques tion. He says: The state of the treasury, as shown in Its proper place, exhibits a degree of finan cial sirengbh never before equaled. It places the government In a position more iavoraoie. than has before existed to tane any siepb Ccneress mav consider wise toward in augurating needful improvements in the currency or judicious modifications in tne banking laws. Ihere are two points to ; v.nich public attention has long been direct- i ed and upon which legislative action has been earnestly desired. These are, first. the monev standard, and. second, a better adaptation of our currency system to the requirements of expanding trade and indus try. Both of tnese quesidons are of primo importance to our well being as a people and demand the consideration which their importance justifies. Upon these two ques tions I feel it my duty to speak with earnestness. "First as to the money standard. Gold now constitutes that standard. It is- now, and for many years ha3 been, the stand ard by which the values of all commodities. whether foreign or domestic, have been measured or declared. It is tne standard to which reference has been had in all con tracts or undertakings involving the future payment of money. It is the standard which tests the quality or value of the In termediate currency with which wages are paid and all. or nearly all. of the minor business affairs of the people are carried on The debate over the relative merits of gold and silver as the true and proper money standard -.has been long and exhaustive. but while the discussion has continued the advanced nations of the earth, one after the other, with hardly an exception, have adopted gold as the more suitable for com mercial neds. Indeed, it is vigorously as serted, and with truth, that the United States is in this very category that our money standard is gold and with some show of reason it is argued that nothing Is required other than to let thing3 alone. Such a conclusion, however, does not com mend Itself to the judgment of those to whom stability dn the future is not less important than good conditions in the pres ent "More and more, as srv stv advances In its power over nature ami in the complex ity of Its industrial relationships, the pres ent anci the future -are woven together. The three-hur.dred-ton craft, built of wood. uiat once might have realized the invest ment cost In a single voyaer to the Indies, has been succeeded by the ten-thousand-ton steamship, built for ye.s of service. The one was the product of a few men's ha::ds. wrought with. rude tools in a brief Derlnd of time. The other embodies in Itself every diversity of skill, and science, and art. The one could safely venture Its small in vestment In the hazards of a distant trade, even though barter was the rule of the ex change?. The other, combining in itself a vast aggregation of capital, must enter the service of a modern commerce, where enor mous volume at lowest cost of carriage is the fundamental condition of success. The cne was under the law of hitrh hazards. with great possibilities of profit. The other is under the law of conservative safeguards against risk of small rewards and uninter rupted employment. The illustration is ap plicable to modern industry In all its forms. The one word most Important is stability stability of conditions and the most Impor tant icaiure ro tnat stahinty is an estab lished money standard, and so established that It cannot be subverted or ehanired bv any hasty or ill-considered' action. It has long been the desire and hone of many intelligent and patriotic citizens to secure needful and enduring stability in the xnoney standard hy. art international agree 'ment in regard to gold and silver which wouia De ertectlve to that end. The realiza tion of that desire and hoDe seems now too remote to justify present consideration, but if those who still cherish it shall offer It in obiection to the action above proposed it is a. sumcienx answer to say that stability on the gold standard Is the only stability now possible to us. and if the time should come when International aereement offers a safe and desirable suDstitution the free dom of our representative form of govern ment will give to our. people the liberty of choice. "if it be true, as true It undoubtedly Is, that gold is now our standard of monw values, the future needs only the assurance mat it win so continue to be, until at least the people shall be so united in their desire for a change therein as to be able to direct the voice of both houses of Congress, and secure the approving signature of the chief executive. The confidence that Congress will furnish this kind of a guaranty has Inspired enterprise, called capital into use. Improved the condition of labor, and given new Impetus to all ouf energies. To make this favorable state of affairs permanent, the highest security should Le given that the common denominator of all calculations In value shall remain unchanged. It Is evident that a direct and effective way to do this would be to declare that the credit obligations of the government itself, whether payable on demand or at a future period, snail be paid in gold coin of present weight and fineness: or It would be equally effective if. by positive law, it were made mandatory upon the Treasury Department so to pay and receive the two kinds of money silver and cold as to maintain their parity under allTonditlons. Such action would be In logical conformity to what has already been established as the "policy" of the government. To the end contem plated, the treasury should be clothed with sufficient powers to meet all emergencies. The establishment of an ample fund, sep- arate and apart fr be held specifically demand liabilties. from the general funds, to as a redemption fund for must be an important Incident to such legislation. The recommen dations of the President In this particular, if formulated into law, seem to be ade quate. Banking and Cnrrency. "In the beginning, law took no cognizance of banking. It grew Into being as, in a free condition, the arts and trades and divisions in labor have grown. When society reached a stage where man could put confidence In man, credit was born. The producer or owner of property became willing to pass its ownership to another, against the buy er's promise to pay its equivalent value at a future time. Thus an enormous step for ward was made. Brain and brawn, united to character, could then gain the use of the tools of production, and with their aid "ould win from the reluctant soil the value for the repayment of their cost. Ability, borrowing capital, could create capital. Thus the accumulations of society advanced from the rule of addition to that of multi plication. The men who desired the power which credit gave increased In number, and under the same law which developed the diviion of labor and the specialization of Industry, the dealer in credit became specialized from the dealer In goods. "The man thus distinctively separated be came known as tha banker. Of necessity, he was a man of property and of acknowl edged responsible character. Ills obligation was effective for the exchange of goods, and those of lesser repute or standing found :t to their advantage to borrow his credit In exchange for their own. Possessed of financial resources of his own. represented largely In cash or money, It became natural for him and advantageous to the community that tos should pay for local products at the point where they were produced, to take his reimbursement at some distant point to which they might be shipped and sold. He further became a natural temporary reposi t?yJ.,lhe IdIe rnoney of others, and this nlded him to perform in a large way hi particular function. The above describes all he did then. It describes all he dees now. Summarized, he exchanges his effective credit for the less effective, or elsewhere Ineffective, credit of those with whom he deals. He makes payment for goods in om place, and takes his pay in another. He makes payment for goods purchased at dis tant points, and takes his reimbursement at his home point, whee they are bought and consumed. He receives deposits of money. These deposits, together with any unuse balances of credit due to others, are evi denced by proper entries on his books. He carries in his money chest a percentage of all the obligations thus evidenced to erable h m to meet the calls for cash from such of his creditors as may require that form of payment. To such as could be well accom modated thereby he formerly gave his notes of hand, convenient In size and denomination. THE 

BANKER'S DUTY. "To this list of operations carried on by the banker nothing can be added. It com prehends all his functions. It will be ob served by the thoughtful that in no one of these Is he able to operate, except In com pliance with the desires of those with whom he deals. He is powerless to take the initiative in any of them. Whoever deals with him does it of choice, and not in obe dience to any power of coercion the banker can exercise. Of all the members of the community, he is the one the most depend ent. In the degree that he operates his function, to that degree ho becomes a aebtor, with all his liabilities immediately payable. He is under the highest bonds of self-Interest to so carry himself as to win and retain the respect and confidence of his constituents and dealers. A failure on his part in this respect means disaster to his business and ruin to himself. Holding claims against the communty, the value and solvency of which depend to a large degree upon continued activity and indus try in trade, it Is his interest to promote, as best he can, the conditions favorable to the prosperity of the community. "It would appear, then, that the banker as a private person might be safely left to pursue his calling without interference from the law, because it Is evident that h's own interest, if wisely considered, will guide him In those directions which it would be the policy of good laws to direct him to take. "With the growth of society, the increase of capital and the Increased demand upon the banker for the services he alone can render, the Individual became powerless to meet fully the requirements of a develop ing situation. As in other departments of life, the strength of the individual was in creased by association with his fellows. The delicate nature of the duties involved, to gether with the large responsibilities :md many hazards which time and expuiene had shown to exist, made these co-op-rating individuals reluctant to stand fullv and personally responsible. "To limit their individual risks, they Fought authority from the law-making power to incorporate, with the limit of per Fonal liability strictly defined. In this re Fpect they followed the example set by as sociated efforts In many other forms of en terprise and industry. In this way only could the fall power of association be util ized. Now, when the banker vas thus given partial exemption as to responsibil ity. It became the duty of the law to put proper and just limitations upon 'the exc ctee of his natural prerogatives. Exempted to a degree from the perils of ruin by the limitation of personal liability, it was right that this exemption should be accompanied by such limitations of his powers as the in terests of te public should require. With limited responsibility, he was properly lim ited in the risks and hazards he migh as sume. The Justice of this will nowhere be denied. The nuestlon for examination Is not whether limitations and prohibitions should be InM. but whher they are wisely and sufficiently Imposed. AN ERRONEOUS IMPRESSION. "The development of our legislation dur ing the last thirty-six years, which covers the history of the national banking act and all amendments thereto, has thrown upon Congress a large responsibility for the ef fective working of that agency known as the bank. There seems to be, in some di rections, an opinion that by the grace oil government these institutions are cstab llshed as a privilege to certain persons so favored; that they have no real occasion to be; that at best they are parasitical plants, drawing life and nouiishment from the industrial tree to which they are at tached, and to the well-being of which they contribute nothing. If this were true, no duty could be more immediate than to re peal all laws which give them existence, and, by one sweeping prohibitive act, for bid the exercise of their function. Whether it was wise for the general government tc legislate at all concerning them,1 It would be useless now to discuss. It is sufficient that this has been done, and by action, per missive in certain particulars and prohibi tive In others, there have been evolved some 3,500 national banking institutions. Like other angencies which time has devel oped and made operative in the natural re lations of men to each other, banks are valuable for the service they perform for the social whole. They are to be considered In this light alone. They ought neither to be made recipients of public favor or boun ty. nor unduly constrained in those par ticulars where a proper liberty will Insure to them a needful power for useful service. "In a government where the imperial edict cannot be questioned, explanations are superfluous, but in a government of the people it is most desirable that all the peo ple should understand the motives or action which govern the makers of the law, and be sufficiently wise to comprehend the scope and range of legislative dealing, so as to approve that which Is rirht and con-: demn that which is wronc "It is especially important that the legis lator himself should nave clear conceptions of the truth, and since that great, far- reaching Influence covered by the term banking has come so largely under legisla tive control, it Is doubly important that we understand the force and effects of that aeencv. that we should know intimately how it works In its details and comprehend the direct and reflex benefits, or evils, of the measures which may give liberty or lm nose repression. "Important as is the establishing of our money standard upon a safe and enduring basis. Important as Is the guarding of the national demand obligations by adequate reserves, these alone will still leave our financial-svstem exnosed to evils which oueht to be cured. These evils arise out of our situation as It relates to the currency. FLEXIBILITY REQUIRED. "While sfability In the currency should be safely guarded, flexibility the power of needful expansion must also be provided The exercise of this power, with proper limitations and restrictions, must be in trusted to the bank. There is no .-other agency that can wisely and efficiently exe cute It. In fact, the banks do exercise that power now In regard to the larger part of that element which, rightly understood, really constitutes the currency. It is a pop ular delusion that the bank deals in money. Money is an incident in its dealings an important incident, no doubt but. truly speaking, an incident only. The bank deals in credits. For a consideration, varying according to time, place and circumstance. it "Ives the public with whom it deals its own debt ob.igatlons in exchange for tne debt obligations or its dealers and custom ers. The obligations of the bank hus ere ated are generally evidenced by a credit uoon its books to the dealer, w no nas tne right to draw upon it by his checks or drafts as his convenience may be served. The constant Interchange of credits be tween the bank and it3 dealers, with the enormous volume of checks aYid drafts con stantly passing between buyer and seller, constitutes, in the broadest sense, the cur rency of the country. It is these instru ments which trade uses in much the larger part of all Its operations. Money real mon ey, gold or silver plays but a small part In the multitudinous exchanges. The total money of the country metallic and paper Is less than two thousand millions, while the 'deposits' of the commercial banks, state and national, aggre-rate more than four thousand millions. "Whence comes this excess of two thou sand millions on deposit? It represents, as, Indeed, does the whole deposit fund, the unused credits longing to the bankers public, temporarily at rest in the bankers hands. But the period of such rest is ex tremely short. Through the clearing houses of the country, this great fund Is each month Invaded by checks and drafts to the total of more than eight thousand millions. By this calculation. In one-half of ne month the whole deposit fund would be exhausted: and so It would, were It not that the recipients of these checks them selves prefer a credit upon their bankers books. Thus it comes that these checks and drafts are rather Instruments for the transfer of property and credit than for the realization of money. They, however, per form in our domestic commerce and trade the same function that the dollar note of the government, or the fractional silver coin, performs that Is to say. they are the agency by which goods are passed from one to another and by which trade ac counts are settled. Thus It would appear that in the department of our commercial life, where checks and drafts and bank credits constitute the real currency, the movement of expansion and contraction Is now governed by the mutual action of the banks and the business public. WHAT IS NEEDED. "If what Is above written is true it must be recognized that in the larger affairs of our commercial life, the 'currency supply Is. as a rule, equal to the demand. In other words, when the operations of trade are In their usual and regular groove, bank credits, with the accessories of checks and drafts, furnish all the mechanism of ex change that trade requires.

The Western bankers and merchants who have funds or credit at rest with the banxers in the financial centers find that checks and drafts are not suited to the purposes now in question.

W rnat they need for these uses is a rorm ci crcun. instrument .4-iilv recocnized by the people, one convenient as to denomination, and one which will pass from hand to hand without being questioned.

WINDOM'S WARNING. "About this time a new influence made itself felt. Bankers and merchants living in the Interior or the farther West, who owned or controlled a portion of the credit balances standing on the books of the New York banks, needed to realize to some ex tent their balances in a form of credit ob ligation which would be convenient for the payment of harvest hands and the other incidentals of crop gathering. These con ditions were known to my distinguished predecessor.

The demand for money in this country is so irregular that an amount of circulation which will be ample during ten months of the year will fre quently prove so deficient during the other two months as to cause stringency and commercial disaster. The crops of the country have reached proportions so immense that their movement to market. In August and September, annually causes a dangerous absorption of money. The lack of a sufficient supply to meet the in creased demands during those months mav entail heavy losses upon the agricultural as wen as upon other business interests.

Equally certain It is that In otner countries sucn perturbations do not result In similar general disaster. It la not an agreeable task to point out defects and weaKnesses witnout offering effective reme dies, and It Is much easier to criticise than to create, in my opinion, however, the patn to betetr conditions Is quite nlainlv marked. Society, left In a state of compar ative freedom, has by slow steps worked out for itseir those tools and appliances and methods best suited to its needs. The prac tice of banking is as natural an evolution as Is the locomotive or the steamship, a in Its relation to modern Industry and com merce It is hardly less important and serv iceable. Note issuing was a development of the natural function of a bank, that function being to make private credlf fective to commercial and Industrial needs. What the bank credit does in a large way with the aid of checks and drafts, the bank note does In a smaller but equally neces sary way. "I have said that foreign- systems of banking afford objects of profitable study. We need not go so far.

"I beg to point out some of the general limitations an 1 restrictions which Conrrcss has Imposed In this department, and In quire as to their Justice, wisdom and ade quacy. RESTRICTIONS OF THE LAW. First As to the conditions of capitaliza tion. The law requires a minimum capital of $30,000 as a precedent to organization under the national bank act. . hlle this sources of small communities, where Dank- Ing facilities are much needed, and It is suggested that for places of a population of l.ivu or lets the minimum be reduced to "Second The national bank act clearly rc-cofciiues the noie-isulng function as a proper one, but It is piain that the original conuitior.s ana limitations imposed nave, ' unuer cnariKing conditions, become sub stantially piouibitlve in their terms. This ought to be reiuuied, ana as iaie. a lib erty given as may be consistent with safety in the exercise of that useful function. "Third The law prescribes percentages which national banks shall carry In cash against their deposits and limits tne amount of risk which the bank shall take in loans to any one Individual, firm or corporation. lhe percentage of cash reserves feems to have justined in practice the provision of the law. but the llm.tations on loans have been found to work with ereat inequality. The recommendations of the controller of the currency cn this point, to be found in his report to Congress last year, merit care ful consideration. "Iourth-r-While limitations and restric tions exist in several directions, no llmlta-. tion has ever been given as to the ultimate liability a bank may carty upon a given amount of capital. cTton this point tne bank with capital stands legally as free as j.g tnie hank vith tfAW) capital. Cash reserves are a defensible subject of leKi?.ation because they afreet the imme diate solvency of the bank. The limitation of liability compared with capital Is equally so, since the percentage of capital and ac cumulated surplus affects the ability of the bank to bar its own losses. Capital, loans and deposits bear healthful and proper rela tions to each other. Lverytnmg eise oe ing equal, the measure of risk is determined: by the extent of the loans; ana tor tne ulti mate solvency of the bank as to its de posits the capital of the bank is the proper guaranty. The capital should, therefore, be relative and fairly adequate to tne nsKS in volved. "It is mainly In the lack of adequacy to public needs that our national system is at note lauiu iuc v w v v v. ww.. issues destroj-s or injuriously limits one of its very Important functions. How in cer tain particulars this injury results l nave tried truthfully to s-how. In view of th weakness and limitations which time and experience have trought under notice efforts have been made to modify the national banking act. In the House- of Representa tives of the last Congress certain bins were proposed embodying measures which I believe would be effective toward needed reform. These measures In their general principles are approved by ttre Informed judgment of the nwt tnougtuiui or our people. It is to be expected that they will - - . . . . be again offered for the consideration of the present Congress. Without indulging in specific recommendations at tn:s time, whioh. if made, could be but repetitions of previous recommendations, I commend the subject to the thoughttui attention or tne legislative body."
