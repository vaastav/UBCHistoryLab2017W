President Ilconscvolt's nnnual mes sage to Congress opens with a broad and confident expression of belief in the resources of Amoriwi uud : ui ap peal to the rilizcns to keep their money in circulation. The message attempts to reassure the business man/ the railroad man , the working man , the farmer and tlic labor leader. The President is in favor of curren cy legislation. JTexnl < l Iiave provi sion made for the ipsuam-e by the banks of an emergency currency safely secured by bonds , which should be tax ed enough to make -it uuprlitable .to continue its use after the emergency Iiad passed. ' He would have the Sherman anti trust law amended , PO as to permit cer tain proper combinations , necessary to Industrial progress , and also made to prevent other combinations that are op posed to the public interest. Railroads , for instance , if Ins plans' ' &re carried out , eor.Id combine under restrictions safeguarded by the Inter- fitate Commerce Commission , while if they did it now their officials would fat * the penitentiary. Railroads , he says , should be permitted to increase- their capital stock , but under scrutiny by the Interstate Commerce Commis sion or other body , whereas when it is done now there is a suspicion that fliere arc improper profits in some se- < 2ret syndicate. Railroads , he urges , should have the right to make rate agreements among themselves under the scrutiny of the interstate Com- znerce Commission , whereas now this is illegal. In return for this permission the President would have Congress devise ome scheme which would compel rail roads aud great corporations doing an Interstate business to get a. federal li- ceuse or charter. ' While the President commends ctm- Bideration by the people of : m inherit ance tax aud an income tax , he does act suggest their immediate considera tion. He would have consideration given to the subject when Congress comes to revise therevcnue _ laws.

He does not ex pect Congress will enact any of his rec ommendations ut this session , except , perhaps , currency reform aud railroad relief. If his present plans Rfu carried out he will have no figlits on his hands with Congress. President Roosevelt is in favor of a fixed sum being provided for payment to employes for certain injuries or death in case of accident , while in the discharge of their duties. In Jhe end , it is held , this would not be a tax on the manufacturer aud other employer , but would be against the cost of the product and the general public would pay. The President' also hopes to see tuat the use of the injunction against labor unions can be mitigated. THE 

BISSSAGE Jr PAIIT. > oeuaseut Entire Would Sliilcc Over Twenty Kewsipai > ci' Columns. President Roosevelt's message to the Sixtieth Congress 5 * of great length , the longest ever penned by any President , and in full contains ov y D.1.000 words. In pert the President says : Xo nation has greater resources than ours , and 1 thiuk it can be truthfully said that the citizens of ro nation posses greater energy and industrial ability. In no nation are the funilanr'ntal business conditions sounder than iu ours at this very -moment ; and it is foolish , wiien eticli is the case , for people to hoard money instead of keeping it in sound banks ; for it is suc-Ii hoarding that is the Immediate occasion of money stringency. Moreover , as a rule , the business of our people is conducted with honesty and probity , and this applies alike to farms aud factories , to railroads and banks , to all our legitimate commercial enterprises. In any large body of men , however , there are certain to be some who are dis honest , and if the conditions are such that these men prosper or commit their mis deeds with impunity , their example is a. . very evil thing for the community. Whore these men are business men of great sa gacity aud of temperament both unscrupu lous and reckless , and where the condi tions are such that they act without su pervision or control and at first without effective check from public opinion , they delude many innocent people into making investments or embarking in kinds of business that are really unsound. When the misdeeds of these successfully dishon est men arc discovered , suffering comes not only upon them , but upon the inno cent men whom they have misled. It is a painful awakening , whenever it occurs ; and. naturally , when it does occur those who suffer are apt to forget that the loiig- cr it was deferred the more painful it would be. In the effort to punish the guilty it is both wise and proper to en deavor so far as i os : > iblc to minimize the distress of those who have been misled by the guilty. Yet it is not possible to re frain because of such distress from striv ing to put an end to the misdeeds that are the ultimate causes of the suffering , ami , as a means to this end. where possible to punish those responsible for them. There cnay be honest differences of opinion as to many governmental policies : but surely there can ba no f = uch differences as to the need of unflinching perseverance in the war against successful dishonesty. Jnerstiitf Commerce. The founders of the constitution provid ed that the national 'government should have complete and sole control of inter state commerce. There was then prac tically no interstate business save such as was conducted by water , and this the na tional government at once proceeded to regulate in thoroughgoing and effective fashion. Conditions have now so wholly changed that the interstate commerce by wuu-r is insignificant compared with the amount-that goes by land , and almost all big business concerns are now engaged in interstate commerce. As a result , it can be but partially aud imperfectly controll ed or regulated- the uction of any one of the .several States ; such action inevita- l/ly tuml.ug to be either too drastic or else too las , and in either case ineffective for purpscs of justice. ( July the national government can in thoroughgoing fashion exerc.se the needed control. This does not mean taat th re should be any extension of feJerai authority , for such authority already exists under the constitution in amplest awl most far-reaching form ; but it does mean that there should be an ex- ter.s.on of federal activity. The most vital need is in connection with the rail roads. As to these , in my judgment there should now be either a national incorpo- rat.oii act or a law licensing railway com panics to engage iji interstate commerce upon cortan conditions. The railroads aud all other great corporations will do well to recognize Unit th.s control muit come ; the-only question is as to what gov ernmental body can most wisely exer cise it. Slieniiuu Asrtl-Trust Iiirw. Moreover , in my judgment , there should be additional legislation looking to the proper control 0t the great business cxni- t-eriis engaged in interstate business. triis control to he exercised for their own bcTte- lit and prosperity no less than for Uic protection of investors and of the general public. As I have repeatedly said ia messages to the Congress and elsewhere , experience has definitely shown not me-e- ly the unwisdom but the futility of En deavoring to put a stop to all business combinations. Modern industrial cotrJi- t.ons are such that combination is z'-ot. only necessary but inevitable. It ia so in the world of business just as it io so iu th < ; world of labor , and it is as idle to desire to put an cad to all corporations , to all big combinations of capital , as to desire to put an end to combinations of labor. Corporation and labor union alfke have come to stay. Each if properly infm- asred is a source of good and not e il. Whenever in either there is evil , it should b promptly held to account ; but it should receive hearty encouragement so loii # as it is properly managed. It is profoundly immoral to put or keep on the statute books a law , nominally in the interest of public morality , that really puts a pre mium upon public immorality , by under taking to forbid honest men froai doing what must be done under modern business cc diricus , so that the law itself provides that its own infraction must be the cftu- tition precedent upon business succoss. To aim at the accomplishment of lee : uuch usually means the accomplishment of coo little , and often the doing of-posi tive damage. The anti-trust law should not be repeal ed ; but It-should be made both more effi cient and more ia harmony with actual con ditions. It should be so amended as to foriiid only the kind of combination which & , ? ! , h.-ivui to the general public , ' 'such : in.er.iment to l-e accompanied by , or to be an incident of. u smut of supervisory pow er to the government over these big ccm- tvias * ergagod iu interstate business. This should be accompanied by provision for the compulsory publication of accounts and the subjection of Looks and papers to the in spection of tlie government oflieials. A be ginning has already been made for such su pervision by the establishment of the Bu reau of Corporations. The design should be to prevent the abuses incident to the crea tion of unhealthy and improper combina tions , instead of waiting until they are in existence aud then attempting to destroy them by civil or criminal proceedings. The law should make its prohibitions aud per missions as clear and detinite as possible , leaving the least possible room for arbi trary action , or allegation of such action , on the part of the executive , or of diver gent interpretations by the courts. Among the points to be niired at should be the prohibition of unhcaltny competition , such as by rendering service at an actual loss for the purpose of crushing out competi tion , Ibe prevention of inllation of capital , and the prohibition of a corporation's mak ing exclusive trade with itself a condition of having any trade witb itself. Reasona ble agreements between , or combinations of. corporations should be permitted , pro vided they arc first submitted to and. ap proved by some appropriate government ody. To confer upon the national govern ment , hi connection with the amendment I advocate in the anti-trust law , power of su- lKi-vison over big business concerns en gaged in interstate commerce , would bone- tit them as it 1ms benefited the national banks : In the recent business crisis it is noteworthy that thcA institutions which fulled were institutions which were not under the supervision and control of the nationalgovernment. . Those which were under nation : ; ! control stood the test. Tiio-se who fear , from any reason , the ex tension of federal activity will do well to study the history not only of the national banking act but of fbe pure food law , and notably the meat inspection law recently enacted. Til re Footl T < nT5- . Incidentally , in the passage of the pure food law the action of the various State food and dairy commissioners showed in striking fashion how much good for the \\uole people results from the hearty co operation of the Kederal and State officials iu securing a given reform. Currency. In my message to the Congress a year ago I called your attention to the condi tion of our currency laws. The national bank act has ably served a great purpose in aiding the enormous business devclop- ment of the country , and within ten years there has boon an increase in circulation per capita from $21.41 to § 33.08. For several years evidence has been accumulat ing that additional legislation is needed. The recurrence of each crop season empha sizes the defects of the present laws. There imibt soon be a revision of them , because to leave tlicin as they arc means to incur liability of business disaster. There is need of u change. Unfortunately , however , many of the proposed changes must be ruled from consideration because they are complicated , are not easy of comprehen sion , and tend to disturb existing rights and interests. I do not press any especial plan , but I again urge on the Congress the need of immediate attention to this mat ter. We need a greater' elasticity in our currency ; provided , 'of course , that we rec ognize the even greater need of a safe and secure currency. There must always be the most rigid examination by the nat'onal authorities. Provision should be made for an emergency currency. The emergency is sue should , of course , be made with an ef fective guaranty , aud upon conditions care fully prescribed by the government. Such emergency issue must be based on adequate securities approved by the government , and must be issued under a heavy lax. This would * permit currency being issued when . the demand for It was urgent , while secur ing its retirement as the demand fell off. We must also remember tliat\even the wis est legislation on the subject can only ac complish -ertain simount. No le- Illation can by nay possibility guarantee the busi ness community against the results of spec ulative folly : iuy more than it can guar antee an individual against the results of hin estravagny.ee. When an individual mort gages his house to buy an automobile he invites disaster ; and when wcslthy men , or men who pose as such , or arc unscrupu lously or foolishly eager to oecorcesuch , in dulge in reckless speculation especially if it is accompanied 'by dishonesty they jeopardize not only their own future but the future of all their Innocent fellow-citi zens , for they expose the whole business community to panic and distress. Revenue. The income account of the nation is In a most satisfactory condition. For the six fiscal years ending with the 1st of July last , the total expenditures and revenues of the national government , exclusive of the postal revenues and expenditures , were , in round numbers , revenues , 3,4Go,000,000 , and ex penditures , ? 3li7oOOU,000. The net excess of income over expenditures , including in the latter the fifty millioas expended for the Panama canal , was one hundred and ninety million dollars for the six jears , an average of about thirty-one millions a year. This represents an approximation between income and outgo which it would be bard to improve. The satisfactory working of the present tariff law has been chielly re sponsible for this excellent showing. Nev ertheless , there is an evident and constant ly growing feeling among our people that the time is rapidly approaching when our system of revenue legislation must be re vised. The Tariff. This country is definitely committed to the protective system and any effort to up root it could not but cause widespread in dustrial disaster. In other words , the prin ciple of the present tariff law could not with wisdom be changed. But in a coun try of such phenomena/ growth as ours it is probably well that every dozen years erse so the tariff laws should be carefully scru tinized * so as to sec that no excessive or improper benefits are conferred thereby , that proper revenue is provided , and that our foreign trade is encouraged. There must always be as a minimum a tariff which will not only allow for the collection 01 an ample revenue but which will at least make good the difference in cost of produc tion here and abroad ; that is , the dilt < jr- cnce in the labor cost Here and abroad , for the well-beiu of the wags-worker must ever he a cardinal point of American pol icy. The question should be approached purely from u business standpoint ; both the time and the manner of the change be ing such as to arouse the minimum of egi- tation and disturbance in the business world , and to give the least phiy for selfish and factional motives. The sole considera tion should be to see that the sum total of changes represents the public good. This means that the subject cannot with wis- dim be dealt with in the year preceding a presidential election , because as a matter of fact experience has conclusively shown that at such a time it is impossible to get men to treat it from the standpoint of the public good. In my judgment the wise time to deal with the matter is immediate ly after such election. Income Tux unit Inlicrlianee Taz. When our tax laws are revised the ques tion of an income tax aud an inheritance tax should receive the careful attention of our legislators. In my judgment both of thefce taxes should' be part of our system of federal taxation. 1 speak diffidently about the income tax because one scheme for an income tax was declared unconstitutional by the supreme court ; wliiie iu addition it is a dilhcult tax to administer in Us practi cal \\orkiug , and gre.it care would have to be exercised to see that it was not evaded by the very men v/hom it was most desira ble to have taxed , for if t > o evaded it would , of course , be worse than no tax at all ; as the le.ibt desirable ofill taxes is the tax which bears heavily upon the honest as compared with the dishonest man. Nev ertheless , a graduated income tax of the proper type would be a desirable feature of federal taxation , and it is to be hoped that one may be devised which the supreme court will declare constitutional. The in heritance lax , however , is both a far bet ter method of taxation , and far mure im portant for the purpose of bavins the for tunes of the country bear in proportion to their increase in size a corresponding ii- civdse and burden of taxation. The gov ernment has the absolute right to decide as to the terms upon which a man shall re ceive .1 li quest or devise from another , and this point in the devolution of proper ty is especially appropriate for the imposi tion of a tax. Kiit'oi-ceniunt of the 

IJUIT. A few years ago there was loud com plaint that the law cuud not 'be invoked agaiust wealthy offenders. 'here is no buch'complaint now. Ihe course of the de partment of justice during the last few > e.u-s has been such as to make it evident that no man stands above the law , that no corporation Is so vrealthy that it cau nut ue tieiu to account. Tiie two great evils in the execution of our criminal laws to day are , sentimentality and technicality. Both of these evils must be removed or public discontent with the criminal law will continue. Injunctions. Instances of abuse in the granting of in- jnnctious iu labor disputes continue to oc cur , and the resentment in the minus-of those who feel that their rights are being invaded and their liberty of action and of speech unwarrantably restrained continues likewise to grow. Much of the attack "on the use of the process of injunction is whol ly without warrant : but 1 am constrained to express the belief that for some of it there is warrant. This question is becoming more and more one of prime importance , and unless the courts will themselves deal with it in effective manner , it is certain ultimately to demand some form of legis lative action. I refrain from discussion of this question as 1 am informed that it will boon receive the consideration of the su preme court. Employers * Liability. The national government should be a model employer. It should demand the highest quality of service from each of its employes and it should care for all of them properly in returu. Congress should adopt legislation providing limited but definite compensation for accidents to all workmen within the scope of the federal power , in cluding employes of navy yards and ar senals. In other words , a model employ ers' liability act , far-reaching and thor oughgoing , should be enacted which should apply to all positions , public and private , over which the national government has jurisdiction. IndiiNtritil Disputes. Strikes and lockouts , with their attend ant loss and suffering , continue to increase. For the five years ending December 31 , 1'JOo , the number of strikes was greater than those in any previous ten years and was double the number in the preceding live years. These figures indicate the in creasing need of providing &ome machinery to deal with this class of disturbances in the interest alike of the employer , the em ploye , and the general public. I renew my previous recommendation that the Con gress favorably consider the matter of cre ating the machinery for compulsory inves tigation of such industrial controversies as are of sufficient magnitude and of sulficient concern to the people of the country as a whole to warrant the federal government in taking action. Cti > ititl and Labor. It is certain that for some time to come there will be a constant increase absolutely , and perhaps relatively , of those among our citizens who dwell in cities or towns of some size and who work for wages. This means that there will be an ever-increasing need to consider the problems inseparable from a great industrial civilization. Where an immense and complex business , especial ly in those branches relating to manufac ture and transportation , is transacted by a large number of capitalists who employ a very much larger number of wage earners , the former tend more and more to com bine into corporations and the latter into unions. The relations of the capitalist and \\age-worker to one another , and of each to the general public , arc- not always easy to adjust ; and to put them and keep them on a satisfactory basis is one of the most im portant and one of the most delicate tasks before our whole civilization. It is idle to hold that without good laws evils such us child labor , as the over-working of women , .ns the failure to protect employes from lost , "of life or limb , can be effectively reached , any more than the evils of rebates and stock watering can be reached without good laws. To fail to stop these practices by legislation means to force honest men into them , because otherwise the dishonest who surely will take advantage of them will have everything their own way. If the States will "correct these evils , well and good ; but the uation must stand ready to aid them. No question growing out of our rapid and complex industrial development is more Im portant than that of the employment of women and children. The presence of wom en in Industry reacts with extreme direct ness upon the character of the home and upon family life , and the conditions sur rounding the employment of children bear a vital relation to our future citizenship. Farmers * and V/ngrc Workers. The two citizens whose welfare is in the aggregate most vital to tne welfare of the nation , and therefore to the welfare of all other , citizens , are the wage-worker who does manual labor and the tiller of the soil , the farmer. The calling of the skilled tiller of the soil , the calling of the skilled mechanic , should alike be recognized as nro- fesslons , just as emphatically as the call ings of lawyer , doctor , merchant , or clerk. The schools should recognize this fact and it should equally be recognized in popular opinion. It should be one of our prime objects to put both the farmer and the me chanic on a higher plane of elliciency and reward , so as to Increase their effectiveness in the economic world , and therefore the dignity , the remnueration , and the power of their positions in the social world. No growth of cities , no growth of wealth , can make up for any loss in cither the number or the character of the farming population. We of the United States should realize this above almost all other peoples. We began our existence as a nation of farmers , and in every great crisis of the past a peculiar dependence has had to be placed upon the farming population ; and this dependence has hitherto been justified. But it can not be justified in the future if agriculture is permitted to sink in the- scale as compared with other employments. We can not afford to lose that pre-eminently typical American , the farmer who owns his own medium-sized farm. To have his place taken by either a class of small peasant proprietors , or by a class of great land lords with tenant-farmed estates would be a veritable calamity. The srowth of our cities is a good thing but only in so far as it does not mean a growth at the ex pense of the country farmer. We must welcome the rise of physical sciences in their application to agricultural practices , and we must do all we can to render coun try conditions more easy andpleasant. . There are forces which now tend to bring about both these results , but they are , as yet , in their infancy. The national gov ernment through the department of agri culture should do all it can by joining with the State governments and with independ- Mit associations of farmers to encourage the growth in the open farming country of such institutional and social movements as will meet the demand of the best type of farmers , both for the improvement of their farms and for the betterment of the life it self. self.The The grain producing industry of the coun try , one of the most important in the United States , deserves special consideration at the hands of the Congress. I suggest to the Congress the advisability of a national system of inspection and grading of grain entering into interstate and foreign com merce as a remedy for the present evils. Inlanil V/atet"5rvy . For the last few years , through several agencies , the government has been endeav oring to get our people to look ahead and to substitute a planned and orderly devel opment of our resources in place of a hap hazard striving for immediate profit. Our gre'it river systems should be developed as national water highways ; the Mississippi , with its tributaries , standing first in import ance , and tiie Columbia second , although there are many others of importance on the Pacific , the Atlantic and the Gulf s pes. The national government should undertake this work , and I hope a beginning will be made in the present Congress ; and the greatest of all our rivers , the Mississippi , shonld receive special attention. From the Great Lakes to the mouth of the Mississippi there should be a deep waterway , with deep Avaterways loading from it to th ? ca.-'t and west. Such a waterway would prac tically mean the extension of our coast line into the very heart of our country. It would be of incalculable benefit to our pee ple. If begun at once it can be carried through iu time appreciably to relieve the congestion of our great freight-carrying lines of railroads. I have appointed an in land waterways commission to study and outline a comprehensive scheme of develop ment along all the lines indicated. Later I shall lay its report before the Congres. Reclamation AVorls. Irrigation should bo far more extensively developed than at present , not only in the States of the great plains , and the Kocky Mountains , but in many others , ns. for in stance , in large portions of the south Atlan tic and Gulf. States , where it should go hand in hand with the reclamation of swamp land. The Federal Government should seriously devote itself to this task , realizing that utilization of waterways and water power , forestry , irrigation , and the reclamation of lands threatened with over flow , are all interdependent parts of the same problem. The work of the reclamation service in developing the larger opportuni ties of the western half of our country for irrigation is more important than almost any other movement. Public Laiul.s. The effort of the Government to deal witb the public land has been based upon the same principle as that ofthe. . reclamation service. The land law system which was designed to meet the needs of the fertile aud well-watered regions of the middle west has largely broken down when ap plied to the drier regions of the great plains , the mountains , and much of the Pacific slope , where a farm of 1GO acres is inadequate for self-support. In these re gions the system lent itself to fraud. Three vears ago "a public lands commission was appointed to scrutinize the law , and de fects , and recommend a remedy. Their ex amination specifically showed the existence of great fraud upon the public domain , and their recommendations for changes in the law were made with the design of conserv ing the natural resources of every part of the public lands by putting it to its Vest use. The recommendations of the public lands commission arc sound ; for they are especially in the interest of the actual ' ho'me-maker ; and where the small homemaker - maker cannot at present utilize the land they provide that the Government shall keep control of it so that it may not be monopolized by a few men. Some such legislation as that proposed is essential in order to preserve the great stretches or public "grazing land which nro unfit for cul tivation under present methods and are valuable only for the forage which they supply. Preservjioii of Forests. Optimism is a good characteristic , but if carried to an excess it becomes foolishness. We are prone to speak of the resources of this country as inexhaustible : this is not so. The mineral wealth of the country , the coal , iron , oil. gas. and 'the like , dons not re produce itself , and therefore is certain to be exhausted uutimately : and wastefulness ir. dealing with it to-day moans that our de scendants will feel the exhaustion a gener ation or two before they otherwise would. But there are certain other forms of waste which could be entirely stopped the waste of soil by washing , for instance , which N among the most dangerous of all wastes ' now 'in progress in the United States , is easily preventable , so that this present enormous' loss of fertility is entirely un necessary. The preservation or replacement of the' forests is one of the most important means of preventing this loss. We have made a beginning in forest preservation , but It is only a beginning. At present lumbering is the fourth greatest industry in the United States : and yet , so rapid has been the rate of exhaustion of timber in the United Stales in the past , and so rap idly Is the remainder being exhausted , that the country is unquestionably on the verse of a timber famine which will bp felt in every household 'in the land. There has already been a rise in the price of lumbor. but there is certain to be a more rapid and heavier rise in the future. The present annual consumption of lumber is certiiiulv three times as great as the annual growth" ; and if the consumption and growth continue unchanged , practically all our lumber will lc ; exhausted in another generation , ivhi'r ' long before the limit to complete cxhau.-- tion is reached the growing scarcity will make itself felt in many blighting wa.\s upon our national welfare. Forests can be lumbered so as to give to the public the full use of their mercantile timber without the slightest detriment to the forest , any more than it is a detriment to a farm to furnish a lira-vest. But rorosts , if used as all our forests have boon used In the past and as most of thorn are still used , will be either wholly destroyed , or so damaged that many decades have to pass before effective can be made of them a.-rtl * . . * ; tlicsf- ar so oovioiis that It li orrraordlnary that it shoiild i > e necessary to lejc-at tuoui. The oniy trouble with the musoinent for the preservation of our forest" , i. ; t .at It has not gone nearly fir enough , and was not begun son enough. It is a mo > t for tunate thing , however , that \e began it \ vhn we did. We should acquire in the Appalachian and White Mountain regions all the forest lands that it is possible to ac quire for the use of the nation. The o lands , because they form a national asset , are as emphatically national as the rivers which they feed , and which flow through so many States before they reach the ocean. Tariir on Woort Ptilp. There should be no tariff on any forest product grown in this country : and , in especial , there should be no tariff on wood pulp ; due notice of the change Iwlng of course given to thee engaged in the fiusi- ness so as to enable them to adjust them selves to the ne\v conditions. The repeal of the duty on wood pulp sbo'uld if possible be accompanied by an agroomnt with Can ada that there shall be no export duty on Canadian pulp wood. In my judiment the Government should have the right to kei-p the fee of the coal , oil and gas fields in its own possession and to lease the rights to develop them under proper regulations : or else , if the Congress will not adopt this method , the coal deposits should be sold under limita tions , to conserve- them a public utilities , the right to mine coal being separated from the title to the soil. ' The J'iUi5ua Canal. Work on the Panama Canal is proceeding in a highly satisfactory manner. Uist winter - tor bids were requested and received for doing the work of canal construction by contract. Xonc of them was found to b l satisfactory and all were rejected. It is the unanimous opinion of the present com mission that the work can bo done better , more cheaply , and more quickly by the Gov ernment tr.an by private contractors. Fully SO per con of the entire p'ant ' needed for construction has been purchased or con tracted for : machine shops have been erect ed and equipped for making all needed re pairs to the plant ; many thousands of em ployes have been secure-I : an effective or ganization has hern perfected ; a recruiting system i.s in operation which is capable of furnishing more labor than can Tie usv ! .vl- vantageousily : employes are r.-el ! sheltered and well fed ; salaries paid arc satisfactory and the work is not only going forwarl smoothly , but It is producing results far in advance of the most sanguine anticipa tions. Under those favorable conditions. .1 change In the method prosecuting tl : work would be unvie and unjustifiable , for it would inevitably disorganize existing con ditions , chock progress , and Increase the- cost and lengthen the tinle of completing the canal. 'The chief engineer and nil his profes. sional associates are firmly convinced that the 85-foot level lock canal which tboy sirs constructing in the best that could be de sired. Some of them had doubts on if.is point when they wept to the Isthmus. As the plans have developed unJor thpir din--- : ton ! their doubts have been di.speHe.l. V "aile they may decide upon changes in detail ns construction advances , they arc * n heorty accord in approving tlie general plan. They believe tr-at it provi.les a canal not onlv adequate to all demands that will he made upon if. bat superior in every way to a &ea level canal. I concur in this belief. Postal Affairs. I commend to the favorable fonsi-l Tation of the Congress a postal savings tank sys tem , ns rfrommen ; ] ? ; ! by the PosiEinster General. The primary object Is to encour age among our p-Mnrfp economy aad thrift and by the use of postal savings banks to give them an opportunity to husband their resources , particular'v ' tLose who have not the facilities at hnn'd far depositing their money in savings banks. Viewed , however. from the experience of the past fe.v.veek = , it is cvMent that the advantages of such an institution are still more far-reaching. Timid depositors have withdrawn liieir sav ings fjthe time - being from national banks , trust companies and savings hanks ; individuals have hoarded thetr cah : and the workingmen their earnings ; all of which money ha * ijcen withheld and kept in bid ing or in the safe deposit box to tb > detri ment of prosperity. Tfaroagh tLe agency of the postal sivings banks such money would be restored to the channels of tmde , to the mutual benefit of capital an-1 labor. I fur ther commend to the Congress the consid eration of the PostraK. rer General's res-oni- mondatiou for an extension of the parcel post , especially on the rural routes. Pre.4i < leniiul Campaign EspcJiacs. It is well to provide that cori'.oi-atitans ' shall not contribute to presi > atial or na tional campaign . The need for collecting large campaign funds would vanish if Con gress provide. ! an appropriation for tlio proper and legitimate cxwn es of each of the srrcat national parties , aa appropriation ample enough to meet the necessity for thor ough organization and machinery , which re quires a large exenditure of money.

I call your especial attention to the un satisfactory condition of our foreign mail service , which , because of the lack of A-ner- icau steamship lines , is now largely done through foreign lines , and which , particu larly so far as South aud Central Arr.eri'-a are concerned , is done in a manner which constitutes a serious barrier to the tx > n- sion of our commerce. The time has come , in my judgment , to set to work seriously to make our ocea i mail service correspond more closely \\ith our recent commercial and political development. The only serious question is whether at this time we can afford to improve our ocean mail service as it should b * improve. ! . All doubt on this subject is removed by the reports of the PostoSiec Department. The Govern ment of the United States , having assumed a monopoly of carrying tue mails for tlie people , is makinc a profit of over $3JOOOuo ( by rendering a cheap and inefficient service. That profit I believe should be devoted to strengthening our maritime power in those directioas where it will best promote our prestige. I strongly recommend , therefore , a simple amendment to the ocean mail act of 1801 which shall authorize the Postrn. s- tcr General in his discretion to eater inro contracts for the transportation of mails to the republics of South America , to Asia. the Philippines , and Australia at a rat . not to exceed $1 a mile for steamships of 10 knots speed or upwards , subject to the restrictions and obligations of the act of isyi. TI ; Aritiy. Not only there is not now. but there never has been , any other nation in tha world bo wholly free froia the evils of ini- itarism as is ours. Never at any time of our history has the regular army been of a size which caused the slightest apprecia ble tax upon the tax-paying citizens of th - nation. As a nation we have a I1ajs been shortsighted in providing for the efficiency of the army in time/of pe.ace. I think it is only lack of foresizht that troubles us , not any hostility t. > the army. There are. of course , foolish people who denounce any care of the army or navy as "militarism , " but i do not think that those-people arc numer ous. We are glad to help in any moveinem for international peace , but this Is beva-ise we sincerely believe that it is our duty t help all such movements provide 1 they aie sane and rational , and not because there i- , any tendency toward militarism on our part which needs to be cured. The evils w ? have to' light are those in connection with industrialism , not militarism. Industry is always necessary , just as v.ar is sometimes necessary- Each has its price , and industry in the United States now exacts , and his rhvays exicted , a far heavier toll of death ' than'all our wars put together. We should maintain in peace a fairly complete skeleton of a largo army. A great and 'long continued war would have to be fought by volunteers. Cut months \von ! i pass-before any larze body of efficient vol unteers could be put in the field , and ou.- regular army should t > e large enough t > meet any immediate need. In particular it is esentinl that we should possess a nom- bcr of extra officers tr.iined in peace to rx-r f. rm < 01.-i"ntly the duties urgeatlv reqnim ? upou the breaking out of war. The rate of pay for the otncci's should be sieatly in- civased ; there is n.i hfchet * typp of citizen than the American regular officer , and he should have a fair reward for his admir able work. There should be a relatively even greater increase in the pay for the enlisted men. The rate'of desertion In our nrmy now in time of peace is alarming. The deserter should be treated by public opinion as a man guilty of the greatest crime ; while on the other hand tiie man \ ' who atvi rtridn > 10 the army should * treated as what he In , that Is , as preeminently nently one of the best citizens of this r - public. The IVuvy. It was hoped The Hague Conference might deal with the question of the limita tion of armaments. liut even before it had assembled informal inquiries had developed that as regards naval armaments , the only ones in which tills country hud any Inter est. it was hopeless to try to devise any plan for which there was the slightest pos sibility of securing the assent of the na tions gathered at The Hague. It Is evi dent , therefore , that it Is folly for this nation to ba.se any hope of securing peaca on any international agreement as to the limitation of armaments. Such being the fact it would be most unwise for us to stop th3 upbuilding of our navy. To build one battleshio of the best " < ! most ad vanced type a year would barely keep our fleet up to its present force. This is not enough. In my judgment , we should thW year provide for four battleships. Dut It is Idle to build battleships unless in addi tion to providing the men. and the means for tharough training , we provide the aux iliaries for them , unless we provide docks , the coaling stations , the colliers and suppler ships that they need. We are extremely deficient in coaling stations and docks on the Pacific and this deficifocy should not logger bo permitted to exist. Plenty of tor pedo boats aud destroyers should be built. " Koth on the Atlantic" and Pacific coasts , fortifications of the best type should be pro vided for all our greatest harbors. We need always to remember that In , time of war the navy Is not to be used to defend harbors aud seacoast cities : vro should perfect our system of coast fortifica- tious. The only efficient use for the navy is for offense. The only way in which It can efficiently protect our own coast s g.iinst the possible action of a foreign navy is by destroying that foreign navy. For deft'usa against a hostile lieet which actually attacks them , the coast cities must depend upon their forts , mines , torpedoes , submarines ami torpedo l oats and destroyers. Until our battle fleet Is much larger than at present it should never be split into de- t.ichmpnts so far apart that they could not in event of emergency be speedily united. Oar coast line la on the Pacific just as much as on the Atlantic. The interests of California. Oregon and Washington arc as emphatically the interests of the whole Union as those of Maine and Now York , of liO-iisiana and Texas. The battle fleet should now and then be moved to the Pa cific. just as at other times it should bo kept iu the Atlantic. It must be remembered that everything done in the navy to fit It to do well In time of war must be done in time of peace. Ji'urolKii Affair * . In foreign affairs this country's steady policy is t < > b-have toward other nations as a strong aud self-respecting man should behave toward the other men with whom he is brought into contact. In other words , nr . aim Is disinterestwlly to help otiier nations where such help can be wisely given wit iont the appearance of meddling with what dues not concern us ; to be care ful 10 act as a sx i neighbor : and at the same time , in ici il-natnrr.l fashion , to make it evident that we do not intend to be im posed upon. The FenceConference. . The second internntiona ! peace conference was convened at Tue Hague on the l.'th of .Jnuf h'.si and rtiaaiai-d in session uutil the istii of October. For the lirst time the representatives of practically all the civiizd ! countries of the world united in a teMpciute and kindly ' nisciission of the meti oJ.s by which thir cnuses of war might be nsu-rowed and its injurious effects re- duct-d. Although * be agreements reached Inthe eom"ex".ee dirt not in any direction go to the length hoped for by thqt mor.- sanguine , yet ia mandirtvtioc ; * important steps were taken , and upon every subject on the program there was such .full aad consider ate discussion : : s to justify the belief that substantial prorpss ; has been n : ulo toward further agreements in the future. Tha delegates of the I'nitod States worthily r.'fjre.sentcd the spirit of the American people ple and maintained witb fidelity and abil ity the policy ' our government upon all the great questions discussed in the con ference. .

The adoption of a new tariff by Ger many , accompanied by conventions for re ciprocal tariff concessions between that country and n'-st of the other countries of continental Kuro e , led the < ; ennaii gov ernment to give ne notice necessary to terminate the reciprocal commercial agree ment with this country proclaimed July l.'I , 1UOO.
