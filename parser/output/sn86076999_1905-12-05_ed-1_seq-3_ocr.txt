THE UORNINa APPEAL, -CARSON CITY, NEVADA, DECEMBER 5. 1BJ5. I THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE. ANNUAL, LODGE OF SORROW. ENTERS SUIT. A FINE TRAVESTY. Document Which Goes to Congress Today. WASHINGTON, Dec. 4. Congress opened today at noon. Cannon was nominated by the Republicans for speaker and Williams by the . Demo crats. The former was chosen. Con gress then adjourned In respect for Senator Piatt of Massachusetts. President Roosevelt has written a message to Congress full of confidence fcs to the future,, irreatnlng a dee? 'spirit of Americanism, dealing ' with those questions which he has thru it to the front in advance of his party and proposing remedies with a calm' reliance in the capacity of Congress '3 handle them. It is a very long message. Perhaps such a long message has never bean written by a President to Congress, The newspaper that prints it all will have to issue a supplement. The part of the message which will attract the most attention, ; because it deals with what has been made by the President the "paramount Issue" in American politics, is that devotjd to the railroad question. GeneraOv the views of the President as to remedies are those which were "given by Senator Knox of Pennsylvania in his Pittsburg speech. Less- than one page was devoted to a discussion of a rate question a year ago, but that was fenfficnt to kejp Congress in a turmoil throughout its entire session, in the message which is to be Tead to Congress Tuesday much more space will be devoted vj rates and companion subjects. It. will be found tnat the President stands almost where be stood a year ago, but . not exactly. Then he said that while It was undesirable to clothe the Interstate Commerce Coin mission with general authority to fix railroad rates, he did believe that the comission should ba vested "with the power, where a given rate has been challenged and after a full hearing to be found unreasonable, to decide, sub- a reasonable rate to take its place, the ruling of the commission to take effect immediately and to obtain un less and until reversed by the court of review." 

POWER TO FIX SCHEDULES rih his message this year the Presi- - -3 A 11 I J J I . . - 1 1 ueui, ii is uuucrsiuoa, lhkcs iiiw posi tion that this power should be vested in the Interstate Commerce Commia- . sion, or "some other- power" created j j vuv - vuvi ca vw a uuivui., cauu .nx i the commission should have the au thority to fix a maximum rate that !s to say, a rate above which the car riers shall " nof go until the matter has been reviewed by the court. But the President still stands out for a law which would put .the rate into ef feet and keep it there, and to all intents and purposes his position tne same as last year, Because mere would seem to be no liklihood of an agreement on some rate-regulatii; body outside of the Interstate Com merce Commission. The President is not opposed to a Federal inspection of the great life insurance' companies, for the better protection of the policy holders. He believes the -work of the., Bureau of Corporatins in investigating crpora- tlons Is having a good eff ect The message strongly denounces the corrupt -use of money at elections. Th President would make it unlawful for any corporation to contribute to , the fnnda of " a. political committee. ' He would require the publicity of all con tributions, of all individuals. He leaves Congress no excuse for failing to meet this growing evil. There Is a full discussion of, the Panama Carnal. . He describes the present financial situation, showing that the money is exhausted and that more must be appropriated and at 'PCe if the work is not to halt. I'-ve is a recommendation .th it Congress pass a law reducing the tax of national bank circulation secured by the proposed Panama canal bonds. so that they will be available for cir culation on the same, basis as the 3 'per eent United States consols.- I The President refrains from urging la revision of the tariff.; He does sujj- leet however, the granting oi a lduction in the schedule of import i ltions from the Phillipplne Islands, and Vnakes some recommendations for legislation concerning the Philippine. I There is a full discussion of our re lations with China on the cuestion ot the exclusion' of the Chinese. There tas been much ground for complaint n the part cf intelligent' Chinese gainst the enforcement of the exclu sion laws. -nd Congress is councel-"! ion li o act act wisely in order to prevent similar to-those attempted ir. lie boycott : of American goods in hina.
