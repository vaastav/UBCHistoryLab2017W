The telegraph informs, us that the Presi dent's Menage was retd to the Cabinet on the 28 nit. It was read to Congress yesterday, at noon. Interesting Article, The article frora the liallimora Ameri can, on the first page, on " The Drift of Events upon the Interest of Maryland," is lonjr, but deserving of attentive perusal by all persons. The theatre continues to be crowded nightly. We are glad to see the man agement so success ful at the beginning of the winter, campaign ; yet wo are not surprised, for tho energy and enterprise j)f Major 'Duffield are an earnest of success under any "circumstances. We hope the season throughout may bo re munerative to the Manager, and that each evening's entertainment may be pleasant to all who attend. The play last night was tho "Kobbers," cast with tho full strength of the company. The perform ance was in every respect unexceptiona ble. We hopa the piece will be repeated at an early day. We cannot, however, say as much for tho after-piece " Tho Good For Nothing," for most assuredly it is the ruost yonl-for-volhiiig farce that was ever enacted. To-morrow evening will be given "The Soldier's Daughter," and " Jenny Lind." Our young friend, Wm. Com.ieu, has removed his News Depot to No. 22 herry street, where his former friends and customers, and tho public generally, can always bo accommodated with the latest newspapers, from New York, Cin cinnati and Louisville. His shelves are well supplied with light literature and all kinds of stationery Ho is a worthy young man, and deserves a liberal pa tronage. The Lonisville Journal complains that tho "Putternut" prisoners can be smelt all over the city, whenever they enter it Wo have no doubt of it. They out- stink onions, they outstink garlic, they outstink forty brigades of polecats. We bopo Satan won't take exceptions to tho comparison when wo say, that they outstink the very devil. We don't know whether the Butternuts smell according to their rank, or rank according to their smell. Like Parson BnowsLow's skunk, we verily believe that the rebel army is on the point of stinking itself to death They seem to have supplied themselves with all aorts of necessaries. Prisoners. Some thirty Butternuts were marched to the depot yesterday, to take the mora ing train for Louisville. They were hard-looking set decidedly. If any of them could read or write, it was, as DoonEHKY remarked, "tho gift of nature." They tiro tho poor dupes of intelligent sconndrels. Wo were pleased to see in our ollicc yesterday, the jovial eouutenanco of our humorous ami enterprising friend, Mr B.C. Tut' man, of the Philadelphia J'reie, Ho is one of the live newspaper corre? pondonts of the day, always keeping a sharp look out for the sublime, the beau tiful and the funny. Dick McCanv, guerrilla captain, and perambulating Pickpocket-General of tho gre.at Butternut t'onfetleracy, made an attack on one of our for a go trains on Saturday. 1 1 is arrival was gnvicu so warmly by our foraging party that the cowardly thief lied, several of his men being badly wounded. Col. Mahki.avp, General Mail Agent for Ibo Arniv. arrived here latt Saturday le has a host of friends hero who will cordially welcome him. We bad n,uite a thunuer-storm on Sunday night, with a heavy rain and vivid lightning. There has not been rain enough, however, to affect the river, con sidcrably. We ask tho attention of the reader t the advertisement of "Carpet Sack Loft.' The finder w ill be liberally ivwarded. Conscripts Resisting.,., , A gentleman from Bedford county says that in that county and in Lincoln the conscripts ara forming in companies, to take the woods and bnahwhack the con scripting parlies. A troop of cavalry made an expedition into Lincoln county, to force the conscripts into the confede rate ranks, and were fired upon, and driven back by the outraged and op pressed people whom they were endeav oring to drive into the rebel army. We are informed that a regiment is being or ganized there for home protection against the hell-hounds of General ISbaoo. Let the people rally and slaughter the last one of these minions of tho Kichmond dynasty, who are endeavoring to make the white non-slaveholders of this State more degraded than the black bondsmen on the cotton plantations. A good many Kentucky rebels are be ing sent South to recover their rightf Tho Louisvillo Democrat, of the oOth ult, says : Tho IVllc Creole took from Portland, ast night, J15 prisoners, on the way to Vicksburg to be exchanged. The name paper sayB that 250 more were brought from Lexington the day before. Keen them moving. A total eclipse of the moon will take place commencing about midnight on iday and continuing four hours on Saturday morning. The moon, in conse quenco of its position to tho earth, will be faintly visible, and its disc appear of copper hue. Picked Ur At the Station in Gallatin, Tuunk, marked "Francis L.

As the evening train was on its way from Louisville to this place, on Sunday, four passenger cars ran oil' the track, and two of them were badly smashed up. We believe nobody was hurt. Lewis Gaiitii, the notorious Kentucky guerrilla thief, wlfo was badly wounded in a recent skirmish with (Jen. Hansom had his right leg amputated tho other day. We know this fellow Gautii well lie possessed great wealth, having one of of the finest farms in Southern Kentucky lie was a vulgar, overbearing tyrant, a bully and a coward. He has "one foot in the grave" already, and it will be blessing to decent society when tho other foot follows. The Louisville Journal says that the Military Governorship of Tennessee has been handed over to General IIit.miut We suppose the Journal meant to say tho Governorship of Memphis. It certainly did not intend to depose Governor John son by a dash of the pen. Tho Louisvillo papers have advanced their prices half a cent a copy, to dealers The Bonds. Wo aro requested to state that the form of tho Bonds and Protection, to be offered to tho peoplo by the military authorities has been fully decided upon, and will be prepared and ready for issue, to-mor row. Notice of time and place and pus silily an official explanation, will doubt less appear in to-morrow morning's pa per. f(iood. Some two hundred of our people, from town and country, were on hand yester day, to give the Bond, and gain the pro lection. Properly originated, it may and we hope will prove most beneficial restoring a wandering people to tho faith fjl allegiance of good government, and return to them of its bcnclicicnt protec t ion Special Notice. r Anelloii Sulci) lct-e luber 2, INO'i,

Washington, Dec. 1. The President thinks the issue of Treasury Notes was unavoidable, to provide for the payment of the army and economically provide for other just demands.
