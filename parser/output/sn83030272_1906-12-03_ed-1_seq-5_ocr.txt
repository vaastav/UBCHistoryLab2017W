Acrlcultural cultural Bank Outside of ManilaWASHINGTON WASHINGTON Dec 3The report of thechief chief of the Bureau of Insular Affairs tothe the Secretary of War made publio yesterday day deals chiefly with conditions in thePhilippine Philippine The report commends thecoinage coinage law reducing the weight and finenessof of Philippine silver coins the increase inthe the price of silver having made their coinvalue value greater than their face value ascurrency currencyIn In regard to the acquisition of coal claimsof of certain Spaniards on ths Island of Batanthe the report saysThe The governmental interest in this arosefrom from the fact that while there was at this of coal suitable to the use of the Government transports and interisland island coastguard steamers yet owing tothe the fact that these claims remained undeveloped developed tlie Government was forcedto to buy Its coal to foreign markets at a priceconsiderably considerably In excess of what it could beprofitably profitably mined for in the WandsThe The report pleads earnestly for the passage sage by Congress of a pending bill providingthat that all products of the Philippines exceptsugar sugar and tobacco shall bit allowed toenter enter our ports free und that augur andtobacco tobacco shall have imposed on them forthree Ithree three years only u duty of 23 per cent of theDingley I Dingley rates and that aftor 1939 thereshall shall be complete free trade between theislands islands and the United StatesIt It should be borne In mind the reportcontinues continues that for more han four yearsevery

IIIf ot past efforts to obtain thin leKinlutiou soearnestly earnestly desired by the Filipinos that wewere were called upon to enter into tOme altruisticbargain bargain impoverishing our people for thobenetlt benetlt of barbarians on the other side ofthe the earth It requires very little analysisof of the measure to show that it involve noextreme extreme altruism but Is one of distinctadvantage Iadantafie advantage to us regardless of Us advantageto to the Filipinos It may be safely awsertedthat that In no case have we been able to obtainfrom from any country a reciprocal trade arrangement rangement MO favorable to uii as that embodied jbodied bodied in this bill whloh increases ourhome Ihome home market by over 7000000 peopleproducers producers exclusively with the exceptionof of a
