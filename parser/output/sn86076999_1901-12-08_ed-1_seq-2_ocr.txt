IT may be a series of coincidences, but comparison of the parts of President Roosevelt's message relating to irriga" tion and the Hawaiian policy are so perfectly identical with Rep resentative Xewlands' bill on the former subject, and his speech in the House upon the amendment to the Hawaiian Government bill, delivered in April 1890, it seems probable that both were consider ed by the President prior to the formulation of the message. At all events the same ideas are expressed in the message upon those subjects that appear in vha" is known as the Xewlands irrigation bill and in the remarks of Nevada's representative upon the Ha waiian policy, at the time above mentioned. The message, so far as it relates to forests and irrigation follow precisly the lines embodied in the Xewlands' bill. First, that the forests be;ng the natural reservoirs should be protected in the arid land sections. Second, that artificial reservoirs should be construc ted. Third, that the States are unable to handle the irrigation matter, as questions of interstate ownership would' arise, where reservoirs are situated in one State and the lands to be reclaimed in another; the inability and ineffiency of private enterprise to undertake such a scheme, and the very positive declaration that the national government should handle the matter, which latter, by the by, is in direct opposition to the contention of some of the Republican members of the arid land States, and all being in per fect harmony with the provisions of the bill introduced by Mr. Xewlands at the last session of Congress and with his argument in advocacy of the measure upon the floor of the House. The President recommends the appointment of a cabinet offi cer, to be known as "Secretary of Commerce." The same was pro vided for in the Xewlands measure relating to Hawaii, and that the province of such official should be to deal with commercial matters in their broadest sense, including among other things whatever concerned the intnrest of labor. The necessity for precaution against the accumulation of large land holdings in the Hawaiian islands, which was urged by Mr. Xewlands, is emphasized by the President in his recommendation in regard to the Philippines. Whether or not our Congressional representative's position and arguments upon these subjects exercised an influence in the executive department does not matter. It is quite certain that his views "Were expressed long anterior to the formulation of the Pre sident's message, and it must be a matter of gratification to Xev adans that the ideas of the chief executive of the nation tally so lo.selv with those of their representative, The entertainment of similar views upon matters of so iiiuch impcrtance to the people of Nevada can hardly fail to inure beneficially to their local interests.

The same financial authority notes the concurrent and alarm ing decline of 325 of the leading listed securities of Great Britain Indian Government, railroad stocks and the like amounting, it says, to $719,730,00. To a country that lives as Great Britain does, largely on its income from its money invested in home and foreign securities Gladstone estimated the aggregate of British interest bearing loans abroad at $5,000,000,000 a large and progressive fall in the prices of its leading stocks threatens disaster. It is true of all wars, and especially so of this one, that their indirect, or, to use Charles Sumner's phrase, their "consequential damages" are greater than their direct. The nearly $1,000,000,000 spent on military operations in the past three years by the British Government is only one item in the total bill of costs. War is a serious matter nowdays. It is not strange that Britan's face, so jaunty a few months ago, grows longer and longer or that the Government has receded from its unconditional surrender policy.
