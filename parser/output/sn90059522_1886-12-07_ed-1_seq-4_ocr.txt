Mr. Cleveland occupies the same ground that he did when ho first took pos session of the executive office. His views concerning public matters have undergone j no change and h a last message is mainly a j rearcumeiit of the points presented in the I first The only new policy of importance that is developed in his late message is in relation to toieign affairs. The Cutting episode and the fisheries trouble give him an opportunity to define the administra tion's attitude toward Canada and Mexico, lt is gratifying to observe that while there is a proper degree of conservatism mani fested, there is also evidence of a stiff backed foreign policy. There is nothing that pleases the average American better than a display of pluck, and Mr. Cleve land is tickling the American feeling reasonably well in this respect. He says that the Canadian trouble will be adjusted in a way to satisfy every reasonably minded American. We hope that he is correct about this matter, for if the Amer ican people are to be pleased there must be no indication of a back down on our part. It will perhaps be a matter of disappointment to some people that the Canadian difficulty is to be brought to an amicable settlement But those who are disappointed in this respect will find en couragement iv what he ins to say about the Mexican troubles. There is a very pre valent feeling in the country that it is about time for the United ."States to have a little scrap with some other nation. This feeling prevails to a greater extent among the old soldiers than any other class of our citi zens. They feel thai the American flag is not being treated by our Canadian and Mexican neighbors with the respect that is due to the national emblem. They are anxious to redress the insult that the glory crowned banner has been subjected to and consequently are not particularly solicitous that the government should resort to any extra amount of diplomacy to avert hostili ties in either quarter. They would prefer to have the administration draw a chalk line and then dare the Canadians or Mexi cans to step across it That is the kind of diplomacy that would be popular with the people of the United States at this time. The president's views concerning tariff redaction -will receive a hearty endorse ment here in the Northwest Our people are with him in this matter and will stand by him. But we cannot say as much for his anti -silver policy. There is an impres sion in this section that the silver dollar is playing a most useful part in our financial system, and the people want it to stay. Silver makes good enough money for the plain people of the Northwest, and the more they get of it the better pleased they are. 

BROOKLYN niEOLOaT. The world is broadening and the circle of religions life seems to be broadening with t At least the tone of religious thought has a more liberal ring to it than it did in the days of our strict construction ancestors. As an illustration of this fact we find a Christmas ballad printed in the December number of the Brooklyn Magazine which begins with the following lines: ••No., fill up your glasses with champagne and sherry And turn to tue bumper of ejrgrnojr again." That is the usual manner of greeting worldly-minded people ordinarily observe toward Christina*, but the singular part of it is that i; should he. recognized and given an official in lorsement in a literary journal edited by^two such eminent pulpit repre sentatives as Henry Ward Beeciiek and T. Dv. Witt TaL—AGK. But champagne and sherry and eggnog are not the only cheer ful features of the glorious Christmas time that are recommended by the Brooklyn divines, for we find the second stanza of the ringing Christmas ode commencing in this way: "Let beauty an! gayety trip to tbe measure Which musical cadenzes mark for their feet - The :na/.e of the dunce is a well sprinur of pleasure, And atdds Its own charm to this festival sweet." That settles it. If wine and song and dancing during the Christmas holidays are the prominent features of Brooklyn theol ogy then it is going to become the most popular religious system of the world. It brings the church and the world into such close relations that it becomes an easy mat ter to step from one into the other. - — m LEGAL INCONSISTENCY". The theory of the law that an individual shall not be punished for crime so long as there is a reasonable doubt as to his guilt does not hold good in the case of Cluvek il*s. the young Virginian who is to be hanged next Friday on the charge of hav ing murdered his cousin, Fannie Lillian Madison. The case was reviewed by the court of appeals, and a . majority of the judges affirmed the verdict of the court be low. But one of the supreme judges has filed a dissenting opinion in which he sets forth such strong grounds of doubt respect ing the convicted man's guilt that it would be an outrage upon every principle of law to hang the prisoner. Yet he is likely to swing, and we will have another illustra tion of the truthfulness of an old definition of the administration of law being "an un just distinction of justice." IT NEED- EDITING. The president's message is an able and dignified discussion of public matters. The only adverse criticism it is liable to evoke is respecting its length. It is singular that public men do not more readily catch on to the truth that the power and influence of a state ilocu oe.it depends very much on its brevity. The terser the style and the crisper the sentences the more readily do these documents find a lodging place in the minds and hearts of the people. There are not many people who have the time to wade through an executive message occupying from trn to fit en columns of a newspaper. If th.* -mi matter was boiled down to-one i.r two co 1..1.1 • everybody would read it. The difficulty with most of our presidents is that they lack editorial training. If they understood the science of editing public documents so as to reject the surplusage and condense the valuable matter the result would be an improvement in the character of state papers that would be most grateful | to the country. Some of these days when ; a number one A grade editor gets into the presidential chair the world will he startled ; with the wonderful improvement not only .' in the style and character of slate, but in ; the standard of statesmanship as well. NO 

SLEIGH BELLS. The commendable spirit shown by the authorities in checking the dangerous fast driving which, particularly on Sunday I afternoons. seems to animate every possessor ' of a horse and cutter. while excellent so far ! as it goes, might well be extended also ' in another direction. There is an ordinance which requires vehicle on runners to have warning of its approach given by suitable bells, it is an ordinance honored about as frequently in the breach as in the observance. Already several accidents, though as yet for tunately none of them of a serio ;s nature, have occurred through the heedlessness of driving without sleigh-bells being attached to the harness or vehicle. The approach of a conveyance on runners is peculiarly noise less unless, warn ing is given by some such means.. Passersby are continually in imminent danger of being run down, par ticularly after nightfall. Should one or two examples of well known offenders be made and the proper fines exacted there would be fewer infractions of the ordinance and the lives and persons of people who are neces sarily upon the streets would be safer. The remedy for the evil lies with the municipal authorities, and it is their duty to apply it. ■ AN EXA.MLK OF PLUCK. Capt. Eads. of ship-railway fame, well illustrates one trait of the American char acter. Having desptired of receiving the government guarrantee which he considered necessary to establish con fidence in his undertaking, he does not weakly abandon his great project, but announces his intention to persevere un aided in the accomplishment of what will fitly be the crowninz achiev meat of a life not unmarked for its triumps of engineering skill. His indomitable energy has carried Capt. Eads safely through other difficulties, and it is quite within the bounds of probability that he will be equally fortunate, in the present instance. " The aid 'he asked of congress was reasonsble enough in its character, involving the government in no pecuniary obligation for which it was not amply secured, and should he succeed in bringing his scheme to a satisfactory conclusion the modesty of the request he has been making will be readily recognized. A ship railway, in cost, feasibility and rapidity of construction has decided advantages over any other means of Isthmean transit, and if the problem is ever to be solved it will probably be on the lines laid down by Capt. Eads. At any rate he deserves encourage ment for his pluck and persistency. They are two qualities that go for toward the attainment of any object however difficult it mar seem, and though there may be many doublets now, the en ergetic engineer will find in the event of bis success that the name of those who have all along been sure of his ultimate triumph is legion. THE 

PALMS WILL. The curious will left by Millionaire Palms, of Detroit, displays an effort to establish in America something contrary to the entire spirit of American institutions. He desires his immense estate to be entailed, to ascend from generation to generation and become through the natural accretion of interest a power in the land. With J this object in view he leaves simply the j I interest of his many millions to his two children, the capital to be held in trust for all time. Among the very first of the declarations made by our colonial fore fathers against the established forms of the old country was repudiation of the undemocratic idea of entailed estates. The experience of years has vindicated the wisdom of their action. An enormous aggregation of money may be a great power for evil or good, but the tendency is toward its use for purposes dangerous to the welfare of society. The evil is far more apt to occur than the good, and that is the danger which the abolition of entailed estates seeks to avert.- Under a Democratic form of government the con centration of property constitutes the one form of centralization of power which, inimical as it is to the interests of the peo ple, is yet the most possible. The injury which might be wrought by enabling that concentration to be continued indefinitely is obvious. With the prevention of entailed estates the danger is reduced to the mini mum. Property which in one. generation reaches an abnormal bulk is through the pro cess of distribution among a number of heirs reduced to more legitimate and less men acing proportions. As a means of corrupt ing legislation or of oppressing the wage earner, it is less available by being di vided. It is therefore to be hoped that the Detroit court, by refusing to sustain the Palms testament, will refuse to sanction a precedent so dangerous in its character and so thoroughly undemocratic in its tenor. 

FAST D.J I VI KG. The police are doing some very commend able work in breaking up the practice ot fast driving on Summit avenue. The num ber of persons who have recently been ar rested and lined for violating the city ordi nance by driving at a too rapid gait over Summit avenue is evidence that the ordi nance has not been forgotten and that the police force remember their obligations to enforce it. But why should this commend able spirit to enforce an important ordinance be confined in its operation to one street? The law applies to all streets and crossings in the city. To ono violation on Summit there are a dozen on Wabasha and Third and Jackson and other principal streets every day. It is difficult to understand why tho discrim nation should be made. There is no objection to the law being en forced on Summit, but the Globe does ask that it be enforced with equal strictness on every other street. CONFLICT OF INTERESTS. The president points to the folly of bur thening the treasury with an unnecessary surplus. The great difficulty in securing a common sense adjustment of the taxes to the necessities of the government has been in the fact that the advocates of high revenue taxes are the holders of na tional bonds. They want the revenue piled up but they do not want the debt reduced. There is a conflict between their own interests, and a very decided conflict between their joint interests and those of the taxpayers. IT 

FAILED. The faith cure doctrine gets another backset in the death of Congressman Price, of Wisconsin, lt Is a matter of surprise to the friends of the congressman that a man of his intelligence would be deceived into submitting to such a ridiculous treatment and can only be explained by the human desire to cling to life and to avail every means that promises a hope. A BROKEN DESPOTISM. The despotic sway of the prima donna of the American opera stage is at an end.

If the star doesn't fullfill her engagement and sin? according to contract she Is to be fired. The country is setting around to democratic principles in good shape. Capt. Willabd Gl-izikh resembles the late lamented "Tug" Wilson who ran up asninst J. L. Sollivav. Fin., with disastrous consequences, in that he doesn't seem to knew when he is beaten. The Mississippi is altogether too fresh a stream for the rornanc inar captain to be fooling with. He should look for a body of water with a little more salt and then steep himself thoroughly in it. ■^ There is weeping and —ailing and gnash ing of teeth amomr the Democratic citizens of Weeping Water, Neb., because the postmaster bavins: at last been induced to resign, and tbe Democrats being torn with dissensions, the place is about to be given to a Prohibi tionist, actually a cold-water man in Ne braska. ■ Having wailed patiently In rain for some one to make the suggestion, we now nominate the Hon.

If the completion of the '-Soo" road will put the Northwest within twelve days of Livedo >1, what an excellent chance there will be lor certain old fogies in St. Paul, who will neither improve or sell their property, to get out of town. If Congressman Cox continues to find dif ficulty in accepting the two salaries which the treasury officials say are due him, he might compromise by distributing the sur plus among loose who haven't any offices at all. Since a verdict In favor of the Soldiers' Home for over $10,000 has been declared against Gen.

Mrs. Cleveland has been buying Christ mas presents in New Fork, It is surmised that she got Sister Hose a beautiful mitten. It rather looks as though Col. Lamont's blue pencil did not get a chance to exercise itself ou the president's message after all. ■ Since the discovery of coal at Omaha, that ambitious town rather sneers at the existence of such a slate as Pennsylvania.

To the Editor of the Globe. To day there was an election of offi cers of our Eighth ward Reform club at Chestnut hall. There has been a decided feeling against Albert Lawrence as presi dent of the club. A majority have thought we ought to have a change in the'presi dent's chair, so to day we nomi nated J. W. Tonsley to fill the office, as Mr. Lawrence said he did not care to till the chair any longer. But we found, before we got through, he had the thing all cut and dried. Brother Lawrence said we would take a recess of 15 minutes to talk this thing over, and the result was they got about fifteen girls and boys from the age of 10 to 19 years to stuff the baskets with Lawrence ballots, and when the count was made Lawrence had 23 and Tonsley IS. The opinion was that Tousley was elected and should have his seat, but Lawrence has always had the name of being an office-seeker; so it was thought best to let him have it. The objec tion to Lawrence is he runs the club as a high license club, when a large majority of the club is for prohibition straight. Law rence is a traitor to our cause and we, as prohibitionists, oppose him. One Who Was There. >Nt X'r» to St. I*— ill's Standard. Chicago Tribune. The youmr women about New York are spending a good deal of time and thought on tobogganing suits, but as yet the results ob tained are not altogether satisfactory— at least to the masculine observer they are not.

Yet neither Senator' Beck, nor his children, nor his descendants of the third or fourth generation, are likely to see that tine town at tho bead of American cities.

SPORTING ffiSOELL'A-EY. Teenier at Home. Pittsburg, Pa.. Dec 6.— John Teenier,, ex-champion oarsman of ths United States, has arrived from England, where he went four months ago to row Beach, champion of the world, and others. He arrived in New York last Saturday on the steamer Nottingham, and. although somewhat ill on the way over, look* to be in first-class con dition. Ha stated that he was very much pleased with the treatment he received in England, and came back* with considerable more money in his pocket than he had when he went away. One reason he gave for the American oarsmen making such a poor, showing against Beach was that none of them, including himself, was in first-class condition. At the same time he stated that although Gaudaur was not well when he rowed Beach, the latter was also feeling poorly, but beat him two lengths in a mile and a half, which has always been Gaudaur's favorite distance. "The Austra lians," he said, "are the speediest rowers I have ever seen. . In fact. they are extraor dinary for speed. Beach beat Gaudaur by two lengths at the latter's favorite dis tanceone and one-half miles, and Matter son, the other Australian, beat me by four lengths in the same distance, but could not stay to the finish. Every race of the series was rowed on the square. One thing that surprised me over there was the heavy betting by the English sporting men. Groups of them would gather on the referee's boat, and bet as much as £300 and £400 at a time, making an extraordinary pool." Teenier added that lie expected Hanlan home about Christinas, and will challenge him after he returns. He will also row Beach again if he comes to this country. He added that Bubear is coming over next year. Teenier will winter at Mc- Keesport. " and row double with Hamon next season. A Franchise Sold. Pittsburg, Dec. 6.— The franchises of i the Allegheny Base Ball club were sold to- J day by the sheriff to A. K. Scandrett, j trustee, on an execution for $30,778. This I sale is sa dto divest all claims of the orig- j inal stockholders upon the club's property. i The debt for which it was sold was created by money to the extent of $39,940, loaned the club three years ago by W. A. Nimick, N. K. Brown and E. C. Converse, for whom Mr. Scandrett is trustee. A Sprinting .71 » ten. Pittsburg, Dec. 6.— Harry M.

Uraltkan. the .Milwaukee Anarch lax. tit-tn l>'tu .is ore ."rouble. Milwaukee. Wis., Dec. G. There was a sensational scene in Judge Sloan's court this evening at the close of the trial of Paul Grattkau and Albeit Moessinger. who are charged with having incited the labor riots at Milwaukee garden last May. The entire day had been consumed in argument Jud,re Sloan bad concluded the delivery of his charge, the jurymen -were just film out, and the crowd that had jammed the court room was on the point of departure when their exit was arrested by the rapping to order of the deputy sheriffs. Flourish ing a copy of Grattkau's paper, the Arbeiter Zeitung, District Attorney Williams ad vanced to the judge's desk and in a loud voice said: "Your honor, I desire to call your attention to A GROSS SCANDAL and villainous libel ami contempt in connec tion with this case," and he pointed to sev eral marked articles in the paper. One was a poem taking Judge Sloan tor a' topic and I containing the most scurrilous abuse of him. The prose articles were of similar tenor and denounced the jury as bought up. and the witnesses lor the state as perjurers. | The action of the district attorney | created a great sensation. Grattkau j turned pale and hurriedly sought ! his lawyer. Judge loan said he ! had heard of the publications referred to. | and also that witnesses for the state had t been grossly intimidated. He declared : that a thorough investigation would bo ; made, and appointed Monday as the day on j which Groltkau wou,d be given an oppor- j unity to explain. At a late hour to-night j the jury is still out, with little prospects of j an agreement. Forgery Hinted .41. Detroit, Dec. G. — John Keck & Co.. j furniture dealers, of this city, with a branch store in Ann Arbor, are iv financial diffi- j cullies. Their store has been closed for several days on account, of the pressure of j creditors. No assignment has been made, although a report to that effect was current at one time. There is great excitement in Ann Arbor over the affair. Humors esti mate the liabilities at 5:200,000, including mortgages and many , small suras borrowed from friends, farmers and woi kinsmen. Keck is in Ann Arbor, and the First National bank officials will not alllow him to leave, although claiming that their account has been se cured. If the signatures to notes held by j them prove to be forgeries, as has neen hinted, the banks will immediately begin action. The first in this city was instituted to-day for SG.OOO on two promissory notes by the American Exchange National bauk. ■ An Artist's Details. New York, Dec. 6.— James A.Wales, the cartoon artist of Puck. The Judge, and other publications, died to day in a base ment restaurant on Broadway. He had breakfasted there between 10 and 11 o'clock, after which he sent out for a potion of bromide of potassium, which he drank with liquor. He then stretch-d himself out on a sola in the private office to sleep. Some hours later he was discovered to be dead. A doctor was summoned, and announced his belief that Mr. Wales died from syn copne from organic cardiac disease, result ing from an overdose of bromide. There were some intimations of suicide, as he was known to have been indulging iv protracted excesses, but his friends scout the idea. Deceased has a wife and two children, but has lived alone. He was born in ISSO at Clyde, O. ■ Charitable 1 equr*t«.

BiS" Bequest to Harvard. Boston. Mass.. Dec 6.— Harvard col ! lege gets nearly $50,000 by the death of E. Pries Gieenleaf. an eccentric miser of this city, who lived almost a century. He was a miser with hundreds of thousands of dollars behind the granite walls of the Safe Deposit company; he denied him self nearly all the privileges and most of ! the necessaries of life. He had a great desire to be immortalized by Harvard. That was his chief ambition in life. hen it became known a short time ago that his days on earth were very few, he expressed a desire to have his photograph taken. His wish was gratified and the photograph was taken while he was propped in bed. A copy of the photograph will accompany the bequest, and if Harvard follows Mr. Green leafs desire, the college will have it copied in oil and hung upon its walls. t NO USE *<>X A GOD. The United Labor Tarty uses to Rrco.uize a Supreme Being*. Philadelphia, Dec. 6. — The second convention of the United Labor party in i this city was held this evening, when a declaration of principles and the ! report of the executive committee on the organization and government of the : party was adopted. The plan of ' govern- j ment provides that the party shall be gov- j em* d by division, wards and city commit tees, three delegates from each division to , constitute a ward committee and three dele- i gates from each ward a city com mittee. The declaration of principles I congratulates the laboring men on the sue- J cess achieved elsewhere in the political j field, and asks their co-operation and sym pathy in carrying forward the work in this i city. When the credentials of the \ newly-elected delegates were being re- r ceived. William J. Gorsuch, as I the delegate from the Friendship Liberal I League was objected to because he was an anarchist, but the objection was overruled. Mr. lierwig was delegated to read the dec- j laration of principle, and when he came to , "we believe in the fatherhood of God and I the brotherhood of man," Mr. Gorsuch i objected. "There is a delegation." he I said, "which recognizes no specific relig- I ions. It is 100 years since the constitution ot the government was adopted, and no word of God was mentioned in it." "The I delegate who does not believe in the j fatherhood of God." exclaimed a dele gate, "i--. not tit to be an j American citizen." But in spite of this ob- j jurgation, the "fatherhood of God" was : striken out by a vote of sl> to 40. Mr. Herwig continued reading uninterrupted until he said that the ballot was the only ' method by which the redress of j social and political grievances was to be sought. Mr. Gorsuch j objected to the word "only"' and suggested that "one of the methods" be substituted, I "for there are other methods besides the j ballot for the redressing of political and social grievances" he significantly added. It was decided, however, not to change the clause. CT LACONICS t. V .iGII INING. ' nrisjjraapliic Chronicles off Interest* incr News Events Keceived by Tel egraph Last Mb lit.

Portland, Me., Dec. 6.— Ever since Nov. '30, when Howard T. Blackstone, formerly discount clerk of the Canal Na tional bank of this city, wrote his wife from New York that he had robbed the in stitution of $25. 000, the directors of the bank have been working at the books to ascer tain Blackstone's methods. They have at last discovered that he added the crime of forgery to that of embezzlement. Blackstone, as discount clerk, made notes of his own in various amounts from $300 up, forging some name as the maker or endorser. These notes he passed through the usual forms, without sending them to the cashier or directors. When he acted as paying teller, which he often did, he would pay discount slips to himself. As Blackstone took the forged notes with him the amount of his embezzle ment cannot at present be ascertained. — «^_. A Cure lor Paralysis.

Written for the Globe. He was on the shady side of 40, had made money, loved comfort above all i things, and desired to settle down to quiet j domestic felicity. She was 23, a gay belle, the oldest of several gay young sisters who were ready to dispute her title of supremacy in the family. Sue wanted independence — | and so they got married. He had been a gay bachelor, and in his ! younger days preferred the young married j women, because it involved no "entangling I alliances," and he was not then a marrying. man. Afterwards he buckled down to business, sought the pleasures of the table much more, became portly, was very re spectable and greatly admired by scheming matrons with marriageable daughters. Evelyn Greenough was the en vey of her set Such a sensible thing to do, such good form. W. Dudley Smith was congratulated at the club. Dick Beverly punched him playfully in the ribs, tola him he was a sly dog. and that he always did have good taste where the ladies were concerned. It was a brilliant wedding. The bride looked lovely, the groom was faultlessly attired, the pres ents were numerous, her mother cried a little, and when they had departed for the train the guests tripped lightly the festive dance and in the morning the vile Daily Call contained a glowing account of the wedding. 11. They had returned from the wedding jaunt and drove directly to Sunnyside, W. Dudley's own creation, cozily nesil ng in one of ville's most beautiful suburbs. The place was the constimation of an ideal picture conjured over many a postprandial cigar in his old bachelor establishment in G. street There were to be velvety lawns, trees and shrubbery, lattice windows, nooks ami corners. He was of artistic mold was W. Dudley, and the dado editor of the ville Call had been taken into confidence in regard to the interior decorations, and Dr. Entree, who was a gortnette, had beeu consulted with referee to the wine cellar. And now they were going to settle down to hum-drum life in this dove cot. W. Dudley had not en joyed the wedding trip. His wife had. She had grown enthusiastic over the Casino when they were in New York. Boston was perfectly lovely, and Old Orchard Beach was a revelation. She had never seen the ocean before. In his younger days W. Dudley had met and carried on a des perate flirtation with a young widow at Old Orchard. Now he did not care to go in bathing. When his beautiful young wife, arrayed in one of those fascinating modern bath ng costumes, glided into the embrace of the swelling billow, accompa nied by an athletic college undergraduate. an Eastern relative of hers, he felt a pang of jealousy and wished that his extremi ties were more bul key and the region of his diapbrain less so. They went to Washington. She insisted on climbing to the dome of the capitol. hen he was there the last time he was only 30, and he wondered why he could not now gaze upon the beautiful Potomac with historic Arlington on the Virginia hillside, with the same enthusiasm. The day was as perfect, the scene as fair, and he was on his wedding tour. Her eyes were beaming with delight; he was blowing like a por poise. Then she wanted to see the navy yard and the arsenal. They visited the Smithonian and the different departments. She was always on the go. and he sacrificed his comfort for her pleasure. But now it was all over, and they were going to have solid comfort They had returned the evening before. It was a beautiful morning in early autumn. He did not wish to disturb the slumbers of his wife, so he quietly dressed, partook of a cup of coffee and an omelette and was new quietly smoking in a vine-covered summer house and laying plans for his future comfort. There was to be no non sense: Breakfast at 10. luncheon at '3 and dinner at 6. In the evening an occasional card party, and so everything would be comfortable and cozy and he had at last realized his dream of human happiness. It was 10 o'clock. Evelyn had completed her morning toilet, and for the first time in a fortnight she took occasion to think, some thing she considered very stupid and did not often indulge in. Was she happy? She had had a good time. Her husband had been very considerate, he had fulfilled her every wish. But where is he now she wondered. She walked out in the sunlight and there through the open door of the summer-house she saw her husband's pro file. He had his hands thrust in his trouser pockets in a meditative sort of way and a thin thread ot smoke curled lazily upwards. He was evidently thinking, too. She had not noticed it before, but she thought he looked faded. He saw her and a glad smile played over his features. ••Ah. my darling, this is a beautiful morning and you look as fresh as a rose. Come let me show you the beauties of Sun nyside." Evelyn smiled as she took his arm. "It is so cosy and 1 dare say we are to be very happy here, but it is so lonely. Dudley, do you not think we could have a few friends with us?" A shadow passed over his countenance. She cannot settle down all at once he thought. It would be asking too much perhaps, she is so young. We must get to it gradually. And so her two younger sisters came to stay a month and in their wakes a half dozen or more admiring swains, and then there were drives and horseback rides in the morning, dinners and dancing par ties in the evening, and every one was gay and happy at Sunnyside, none more so than its young mistress. W. Dudley did not enjoy it. He was too portly to ride and did not look well mounted. The dancing had changed ma terially since he had abandoned that pas time some ten years ago. He felt de trop in this merry crowd, but it wouid be better after awhile, so he put up with it all as gracefully as the nature of the circumstan ces would permit Then came the holiday festivities followed by as gay a season as ville had ever witnessed. W. Dudley was amiably at hand on all occasions, and began to be a noticeable figure at balls and operas, dutifully holding his wife's wraps while she chatted gaily with her young admirers. He began to tire of it. In fact he felt silly and uncomfortable. Yet in his selfish sort of way he loved his beautiful, butterfly wife, and he was too good-natured and had not the heart to remonstrate with her. She tyranized over him in such a charming way that he submitted good-naturedly, although she led him along at a rapid pace and he retired every mght completely fagged out. Then there was a lespite for a season, and W. Dudley was happy; the milleuneum had now arrived, and to crown his happiness he had the proud pleasure of announcing to his friends the arrival of a son and heir. But this short glimpse of domestic peace and tranquillity was soon to be rudely broken. The doctor prescribed salt sea air and much outdoor exercise for the young mother. A seaside cottage was rented and thence they hied themselves accompanied by maid and nurse. The bracing sea air soon restored Evelyn to her former self. She was more mature, more full of life, more gay than ever. It became too ex hausting for W. Dudley to follow his young wife in her energetic pursuit of pleasure. He began to stay at home when she went to take her morning bath. She had de termined to learn to swim. Harry Loftus, of Boston, kindly volunteered to teach her. He found the occupation so congenial and she found him st.cii an amia ble instructor, that since she must have much outdoor exercise none could be a mora charming companion than he upon her horseback excursions into the country. Then there were the hops at the hotel every evening. W. Dudley soon tired of playing whist all evening with old Willet and the two dowagers, and so he stayed at home with the baby and Harry Loftus led the cotillion with his wife. At length they returned ■ home. The young Boston chap accompanied them to the depot and as she waved him a co quettish farewell she admonished him not to fail to come and see them at ville. W. Dudley was disgusted, still he had hope that after all. things would change, his wife become satisfied with pleasure and ad just herself to his contemplat.on of peace and quietude. But the time never came. Their return home was celebrated by a fete champeter and then followed around of dissipation. Young Mrs. W. Dudley Smith became positively giddy, and to cap the climax. Harry Loftus, true to his word, turned up during the holidays, and there was a desperate flirtation, and people began to talk. The gentlemen said: What a limb of a woman! and the ladies, what a doit of a man! T. Dixey When. Gobbled by Gould. Little Bock, Ark., Dec. 6.— The fact that Jay Gould, president of the Missouri Pacific system, has become possessed of a majority of the stocks and bonds of the Little Bock, Mississippi River & Texas Railroad company. was announced here to-day.

It is believed here that Mr. Gould Will buy in the road without opposition at the sale, and it is also known that the pres ent management of the Arkansas Valley road will not be changed.

Mississippi River & Texas railroad will give him weight to make freight con tracts with the Little Rock & Fort Smith and the Arkansas Valley roads that will divert the Kansas and Western traffic with New Orleans and the Southeast to his Iron Mountain line and newly-purchased line to the Mississippi river. The work of construction of the Kansas & Arkansas Valley excision to Gibson is to be com menced as soon as the contracts can be awarded. t Custniu. Kwitidle. New York. Dec. 6.— Collector Magone has brought to light a nice piece of swindling in public stores. The man in charge of that department about two years ago was named Hill. The collector charges that Hill entered into a corrupt agreement at that time with Israel Hamoerger, an im porter of No. 374 Broadway, this city, by which Hill allowed Hamoerger to take goods consigned to him out of the public stores to his place of business. There the cases were einpt.ed. tilled up with rubbish and returned to the pttolic stores. Hain berger then appeared before the collector, and said he had decided to export the goods belong ng to him in tiie cases back t«> Europe. Permission was granted, the eases shipped to Europe and then filled by Bamberger's agent with merchandise and returned to tin;, country. By the first trick Hainberger evaded $I,ooo* worth of duty.

Watts had a dispute with the guard at the inner gate, and when ordered to his cell drew a knife and made a savage assault on the officer. Deputy McKean then came to the assistance of the guard. A desperate struggle ensued. Watts got away, however, and started down the cor ridor, flourishing the knife, when McKean drew his revolver and shot him in the groin. The wounded man was then over powered and taken to the hospital. His condition at midnight was very critical, and he may not survive. The prison board, at a meeting to-night exhonorated the deputy warden. mm Garlai'd Wants a Rest. St. Louis. Dec. 6. — A special from Little Rock, referring to the senatorial estion in Arkansas, says a letter recently written by Mr, Garland to a friend in Little Rock contains the following para graph: I am at present Irving to serve the whole country M an impartial adjunct to the cabinet, and the question of whether or not I will be a candidate for re-election to the United States senate two years hence Is so far in the future that I have not even thought of the subject. However. I feel safe in saying that my official services will cease for a while at the end of my term as attorney general, because I long for the peace and quiet I at least merit at the bands or the good people of Arkasas who have honored me by political preferences. California Wines. San Francisco, Dec. 6.— F. Gundlach & Co., in their circular to-day of wine pro ducts of California, say: The season has been one of the most favor able known. Both the quality and quantity are away above the average. The vintage of the state is 19.600.000 gallons, one-seventh of which will be turned into brandy. The qual ity is so bigh that the vintage of 1886 will be reckoned as a famous year. The production ot sweet wines, owing to low prices, has been restricted.
