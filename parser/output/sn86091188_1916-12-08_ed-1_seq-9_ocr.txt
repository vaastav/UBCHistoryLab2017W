ISON'S MESSAGE 0 THE CONGRESS ite and House in Joint Ses sion Hear Address of the President. A lier Legislation for Settlement and guiation of Railway Labor Dil utes Held Imperatively Necea sary by the chief Magistrate. ishington, Dec. 5.—The senate house met in joint session today heard President Wilson's message, was as follows : deuten of the Congress: fulfilling' at this time the duty laid me by the Constitution of com Icating to you from time to time ln8 tion of the state of the Union recommending to your considera sueh legislative measures as may judged necessary and expedient I continue the practice, which I lias been acceptable to you, of 1 ing to the reports of the several Is of the executive departments the oration of the detailed needs of - ] rt iur akes few suggestions public service and confine myself jse matters of more general pub policy with which It seems neces and feasible to deal at the pres ssion of the congress, realize the limitations of time un liich you will necessarily act at session and shall make my sug tions as few as possible ; but there some things left undone at the session which there will now be to complete and which it seems essary in the interest of the public at once. the first place, It seems to me Im ntively necessary that the earliest Bible consideration and action be accorded the remaining isures of the program of settle nt and regulation which I had occa to recommend to you at the close our last session in view of the pub dangers disclosed by the unaccom dated difficulties which then existed, which still unhappily continue to between the railroads of the ntry and their locomotive engineers, ductors, and trainmen. Railway Troubles First, then recommended : irst, immediate provision for the lenient and administrative reor J> lzntion of the interstate commerce nmission along the lines embodied bill recently passed by the house representatives and now awaiting Ion by the senate ; in order that the nmission may be enabled to deal the many great and various duties devolving upon it with a prompt and thoroughness which are, with present constitution and means of inn . practically impossible. ■ond, the establishment of an hour day as the legal basis alike ork and of wages in the employ of all railway employees who are unlly engaged in the work of oper trains in Interstate transporta Third, the authorization of the ap intment by the president of a small of men to observe the actual re in experience of the adoption of eight-hour day In railway trans ation alike for the men and for railroads. Fourth, explicit approval by the con of the consideration by the in tate commerce commission of an rcase of freight rates to meet such rational expenditures by the rail as may have been rendered nec by the adoption of the eight day and which have not been ofif i*y administrative readjustments economies, should the facts dis * isp d justify the Increase. Fifth, an amendment of the existing ernl statute which provides for the jjggfdiation, conciliation, and arbitration such controversies as the present adding to it a provision that, in case method* of accommodation now ovided for should fail, a full public v estigation of the merits of every « dispute shall be instituted and nipleted before a strike or lockout ay lawfully be attempted. od, sixth, the lodgment in the ID s of the executive of the power, **** of military necessity, to take 0,r "l of such portions and such roll t stock of the railroads of the coun i as may be required for military ar ' li to operate them for military rer^rpo>«-s with authority to draft into military service of the United ** 11 train crews and adminis uve officials as the circumstances It . tor their safe and efficient use. en»ws Hit Recommendations, j. w ">'d and third of these rec ■raendhtions the congress immediate " n ' ** established the eight / as the legal basis of work W wag, * ln train service and it au ^ appointment of a com t0 ohserve and report upon the ii easUr^s results, deeming these the most immediately needed ; Unusual Experience. remarked Sandy. "I did a nicht what I've no dune this 1 r - I went to ma bed pnirr L , but I'm rieht thadVful to _f ot up this mornin' none the t jjy ev * Eeggars in Panama. , !Cfl the city of Panama is a cosmopolitan place, practically race being represented in its 60, racibitants, there are no beggars, o' a few blind men. but it postponed action upon the other suggestions until an opportunity should be offered for a more deliberate con sideration of them. The fourth rec ommendation I do not deem it neces sary to renew. The power of the in terstate commerce commission to grant an Increase of rates on the ground re ferred to is indisputably clear and a recommendation by the congress with regard to such a matter might seem to draw in question the scope of the com mission's authority or Its inclination to do justice when there is no reason to doubt either. The other suggestions—the Increase ln the Interstate commerce commis sion's membership and in its facilities for performing its manifold duties, the provision for full public Investigation and assessment of industrial dispute*, and the grant to the executive of the power to control and operate the rail ways when necessary in time of war or other like public necessity—I now very earnestly renew. The necessity for such legislation is manifest and pressing. Those who have intrusted us with the responsibility and duty of serving and safeguarding them ln such matters would find It hard, I believe, to excuse a failure to act upon these grave matters or any unnecessary postponement of action upon them. Not only does the interstate com merce commission now find it practi cally impossible, with its present mem bership and organization, to perform its great functions promptly and thor oughly, but it is not unlikely that It may presently be found advisable to add to its duties still others equally heavy and exacting. It must first be perfected as an administrative Instru ment. The country cannot and should not consent to remain any longer exposed to profound industrial disturbances for lack of additional means of arbitra tion and conciliation which the con gress can easily and promptly supply. And all will agree that there must be no doubt as to the power of the execu tive to make immediate and uninter rupted use of the railroads for the con centration of the military forces of the nation wherever they are needed and whenever they are needed. This is a program of regulation, pre vention and administrative efficiency which argues its own case in the mere statement of it. With regard to one of its items, the increase in the effi ciency of the interstate commerce com mission, the house of representatives has already acted ; its action needs only the concurrence of the senute. For Control and Operation. I would hesitate to recommend, and I dare say the congress would hesitate to act upon the suggestion should I make it, that any man in any occupa tion should be obliged by law to con tinue in an employment which he de sired to leave. To pass a law which forbade or prevented the individual workman to leave his work before re ceiving the approval of society in do ing so would be to adopt a new prin ciple into our jurisprudence which 1 take it for granted we are not prepared to introduce. But the proposal that the operation of the railways of the country shall not he stopped or inter rupted by the concerted action of or ganized bodies of men until a publie investigation shall have been instituted which shall make the whole question at issue pluin for the Judgment of the opinion of the nation is not to propose any such principle. It is based upon the very different principle that the con certed action of powerful bodies of men shall not be permitted to stop the in dustrial processes of the nution, at uny rate before the nation shall have had an opportunity to acquaint itself with the merits of the case as between em ployee and employer, time to form its opinion upon an Impartial statement of the merits, and opportunity to con sider all practicable means of concilia tion or arbitration. I can see nothing in that proposition tiut the justifiable safeguarding by so ciety of the necessary processes of its very life. There is nothing arbi trary or unjust in It unless it be arbi trarily and unjustly doue. It can and should he done with a full and scrupu lous regard for the interests and liber ties of all concerned as well as for the permanent interests of society itself. Other Legislation Urged. Three matters of capital Importance await the action of the senate which have already been acted upon by the house of representatives: the hill which seeks to extend greater freedom of combination to those eugaged ln pro moting the foreign commerce of the country than is now thought by some to be legal under the terms of the laws against monopoly ; the hill amending the present organic law of Porto Rico ; and the bill proposing a more thor ough and systematic regulation of the expenditure of money in elections, com monly called the Corrupt Practices Act. I need not labor my advice that these measures be enacted into law. Their urgency lies in the manifest circum stances which render their adoption at this time not only op|s»rtuw but neces sary. Even delay would seriously jeopard the Interests of the country and of the government. Immediate passage of the bill to reg Most Fishermen Have Done IL "Simple Simon went a-flshing in his mother's pail." "Not so simple, at that." declared the amateur sportsman. "I've spent time and money getting to a place where the likelihood of catching fish was no whit greater." Nothing New. "I see some scientific sharp has dis covered a substitute for bread." "He needn't think he's so much. Our cook has been turning that out for years." nlate the expenditure of money in elec tions may seem to be less necessary than the immediate enactment of the other measuntj to which I refer; be cause at least two years wiU elapse before another election in which fed eral offices are to be filled ; but it would greatly relieve the public mind if this important matter were dealt with while the circumstances and the dan gers to the public morals of the pres ent method of obtaining and spending campaign funds stand dear under re cent observation and the methods of expenditure can he frankly studied in the light of present experience; and a delay would have the further very se rious disadvantage of postponing ac tion until another election was at hand and some special object connected with it might be thought to be in the mind of those who urged it. Action can ba taken now with facts for guidance and without suspicion of partisan purpose. I shall not argue at length the desir ability of giving a freer hand In the mutter of combined and concerted ef fort to those who »hull undertake the essential enterprise of building up our export trade. That enterprise will presently, will immediately assume, hns Indeed already assumed, a magni tude unprecedented in our experience. We have not the necessary instrumen talities for its prosecution ; it is deemed to be doubtful whether they could be created upon an adequate scale under our present laws. We should clear away all legal obstacles and create a basis of undoubted law for it which will give freedom without permitting unregulated license. The thing must be done now, because the opportunity is here and may escape us if we hesitate or delay. Porto Rico's Needs. The argument for the proposed amendments of the organic law of Por to Rico is brief and conclusive. The present laws governing the island and regulntlng the rights and privileges of its people are not Just. We have cre ated expectations of extended privi lege which we have not satisfied. There is uneasiness among the people of the island and even a suspicious doubt with regard to our intentions concerning them which the adoption of the pending measure would happily re move. We do not doubt what we wish to do ln any essential particular. We ought to do it at once. There are other tnatters already ad vanced to the stage of conference be tween the two houses of which it Is not necessary that I should speak. Some practicable basis of agreement concerning them will no doubt be found and action taken upon them. Inusrnuch as this is, gentlemen, prob ably the last occasion I shHll have to address the Sixty-fourth congress, I hope that you will permit me to say with what genuine pleasure and satis faction I have co-operated with you ln the mnny measures of constructive pol icy with which you have enriched the legislative aunals of the country. It has been a privilege to labor ln suflh company. I take the liberty of con gratulating you upon ihe completion of a record of rare serviceableness and distinction. Cut Trees by Exploding Dynamite. Instead of an ax and saw to remove the tops of trees that are to be used as masts in logging operations, dyna mite is used to shoot off the tops. After the branches have been removed, a rigger climbs the tree, with a set of Irons, to the |s»int whpre it is neces sary to cut off the top. Here the trunk Is usually about 12 inches in diame ter.' The rigger ties a string of ilynn mite cartridges, fastened end to end like sausages, around Ihe trunk at this point, Inserts a blasting cap with about 20 feet of fuse ln one of these sticks, lights the end of the fuse, and de scends before the explosion takes place. The tree top pumps Into the air with tile explosion and the trunk is left ready for attaching the rigging for dragging in and loading the logs. —Engineering Record. All He Saw of Battl«.

He conducted himself with t>ecoming dig nity, and when the foreign-looking gen tleman who had kept silent went out at a roadside station the audience set tled down to hear the yarn.
