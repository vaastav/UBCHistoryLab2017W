A factory at Youngstown, Ohio, is engaged in making nickel-plated shing les for the New Orleans exposition. The electors of each State met yester day and cast their ballots for President and Vice President of the United States. President-elect Cleveland has promised to abolish the office of barber at the White House which was created by Grant. Blaine takes his defeat cheerfully. Ilepublican. Yes, as cheerful as a spanked baby. Wayne Co. Dem. President Arthur, widower, and President Cleveland, bachelor, going arm-in-arm about the capital, will be a spectacle for all the ladies. In the event of Hon. Henry B. Payne being placed in Cleveland's cabinet, the Wood County Democrat booms John It. McLean,1 of the Cincinnati Enquirer, for the Senatorial vacancy. ; The kind of ci vil service reform we are ia favor of Is just this: We are will itg'ttx keep as many Republicans in oflloo-as there .were Democrats kept in offloebythe Republicans. That's fair, isn't it? If not, why not? Zanesville Signal. ' ' Hhe Sandusky City Local, heretofore a independent paper, has come out squarely and declared its intention hereafter to champion the cause of Democracy, and makes its bow "as a Democratic newspaper, not in word but la deed.". Postoffiok holding Republican edi tors speak of the incoming Democratic administration as the "Confederate" administration, and yet propose to hold their offices for the periods for which they wereappointed,"under the tenure" of the Civil Service law. How patriotic! It is strongly hinted that Gov. Hoad ly does not desire a re-nomination for Governor In 1885. ; The Immense amount of campaign racket in a great State like Ohio is not congenial to his Keryous system. The Governor is not overpleased with the dull routine of official duties which tie him up all the year, round in a dull, dusty old burg liite-Gblumbus. Sunday Journal. The corner-stone of the Washington monument was laid during President Polk's administration, when the De mocracy had just been returned to flower. Work was resumed upon the structure in 1878, when Samuel J. Til den was elected and will not be com pleted until Grover Cleveland is presi dent. Hence It is a monument to the Democracy as well as to Washington. A spiritualistic crank named Geo, Burris, weighing two hundred pounds, tried to cure Mrs. Sarah Walker, near ML Vernon, of inflammation of the bowels, by kneeling upon her stomach, and pounding her head, face, spine and hips. This treatment was for the pur pose of driving out of her body the spirit of a devlish nelghbor,Dick Lybar ger, recently deceased, but it killed the patient. It is said the cr&nk Is crazy, and if ho isn't he should bo strung up tar murder. Only 30 hungry Democrats want the Napoleon Port Offloe and 88 of the ravenou gang will weep and wall and swear they were more entitled to it than the fellow who gets It. ', The above and similar squibs are go ing the rounds of the Republican press of the Northwest, and a teeming de light is taken in classing Democrats as thV'ra venous gang." While there might be a half dozen applicants for the posi tion named, which is no moro than right and proper, yet Democrats are not such for mere greed of office. They are Democrats from principal, or else their organization would have went to flinders long ere this. But our Repub lican friends are judging others by them selves. They have been bo long in office that It has become a second nu ture to them, and they have sacrificed every principle they ever possessed to retain their grip upon the purse-strings of Uncle 8am. The people have wrench ed It from them and oh how they wail and howl. The distress In the Hocking Valley mining regions appeals not only to the sympathy and charity of the people, but to the business sense of business men and the common sense of working men. There ought to be a speedy ad justment of the differences between t operators and miners, and an early re sumption of business. If it is possible to make concessions on both sides, and arrive at an understanding by which a picture of desolation may be changed to a scene of industry and prosperity, no time should be lost in movements toward such a change. Each side maintaining a dogged, immovable position will protract' tho miserable spectacle beyond toleration in public sentiment. The miners can not get work under present circumstances In the valley, and can not move away. They are even "pinched" for the bare necessities of life. They constitute a factor which can not be ignored, what ever course the operators may under take to pursue. Hasn't each side ex hibited its staying qualities long en ough? Isn't the cheapest way, the fair est way, and the most business-like way, to get together in a conference in which each side will be sincere, and In which nobody is to stumble oVer quibbles and technicalities? Enquirer. Perhaps many of our citizens will visit the great New Orleans Exposition during the next six months, and will of course be interested in the exhibit of Ohio products. Prominent among the various exhibits made by the Buckeye State will be that of agricultural pro ducts, which will be displayed upon an immense pagoda, built at Columbus, and shipped this week to New Orleans, occupying three cars for its transporta tion. It is an immense affair, and in both design and ornamentation it is a model of, art,- The following descrip tion will give some idea of it: It is 90 feet long, 30 feet wide and the main part 14 feet long. The arches and dome will of course rise higher, the for mer being 25 feet from the base. The main part will be supported by columns ten on each side. Running along over the top of the columns will be a hand some frieze. At each side will be an entrance, and over each an arch. With in the arch will be a triangle contain ing the word "Ohio." The farm pro ducts will be arranged in shelves in re treating step-ladder form against the pillars at the sides, but not touching them.. The structure will be placed within the main building. The Republican party may not be dead, but the chances are that it will never again appear as a leading factor in a Presidential contest. The past four years have been sad ones for the "grand old party." It has declined so rapidly that the day and the hour of its final extinction seems not to be distant. In every State in the Union, except Penn sylvania, California and Neveda its vote has decreased to an extent that should alarm the leaders. Iowa, long the "banner State" of Republicanism, has reduced her majority from 78,000 for Garfield to 19,000 for Blaine. Illinois gave Garfield over 50,000 majority, and Blaine but 14,000. Wisconsin gave Gar field over 30,000 majority, and Blaine but 9,000. Garfield's majority in Mich igan was over 50,000; this was wholly wiped out, and Blaine received a plu rality of 3,812. In Indiana the plurali ty of 6,000 for Garfield was changed to a Democratic plurality of 6,000. The same monotonous story can be told of nearly every State from Massachusetts to Texas and from Minnesota to Flori da. The Republican party, permeated with corruption and honey-combed with rottenness, has lost the confidence of the people. A 4 , Some persons think that the sign boards forbidding hunting, fishing, nut gathering or trespassing upon private lands are of little account, and that tbey may be disregarded with impunl ty. This is a mistake, as tho law makes it an act of trespass to go upon any cul tivated or enclosed land for any purpose without permission from the owner, even if there is no sign board, and the owner is entitled to recover actual damage for such trespass. When the signboards are properly erected, any person who trespasses upon land so guarded Is not only liable to pay the actual damages, but also a penalty not exceeding $25. The Ohio Stato Democratic Club is making arrangements to properly cele brate St. Jackson's Day, January, 8th, at Columbus, the date of the first an nual meeting of the club. . Good-Bye, My Lovers, Good-Bye! The following ticket accounts for the absence of so many of our citizens, they seem to have been distributed broadcast in this vicinity. We hope the "Jim Blaine" will have a successful voyage.

Civil Service Laws. Much has been said of the civil ser vice lately for the consolation (if there be any) of the dethroned party. The impression pretty generally prevails that under the law the Republican government officials will have Just as secure hold on their places as they have before the change of administration. The fact is that only about one-tenth are protected by the civil service law and probably every one of the other nine-tenths have laid themselves liable to expulsion under the provisions of that law which they looked to for pro tection from the Democratic broom.. The civil service law forbids govern ment employes paying political assess ments, joining campaign associations or making themselves conspicuous in party work, and employes doing any or all of these things can be lawfully re moved. There is scarcely a man in the employment of the Government who did not participate with clubs or pay political assessments to secure the elec tion of Blaine. The civil service law that the Republicans claim to be so in love with seems to favor a tolerably clean sweep. The President's Message was read to Congress on Monday. The document contains about the usual matter found in like papers, and is probably as good as any of Its predecessors. It contains the usual recommendations and sug gestions, and is most remarkable for its being tho farewell of the last Republi can President.

P. MEKK1SON, dee 4-3t 1891. Probate Judge, The plague In tho Southern part of West Virginia and In Eastern Kentucky Is attracting general attention. Accord ing to tho best authenticated reports the centre of the afflicted district la In the centro of Dickinson county, Virginia,. In the midst of tho Cumberland moun tains, and over one hundred miles from the nearest railway station. The great est destitution prevails and the cold weather is sure to cause such a state of mortality as even the present state of affairs has not begun to equal. The last rainfall was on August 3, unless It has fallen within a week. Business is at a standstill. Crops are a failure. Many families have not a bushel of grain nor a head of live stock left. Medicines are exhausted, and physic ians are nearly all dead from overwork. Corpses lie Tor days unburied. In many Instances water is carried three and four miles 'in buckets. There is no running water left, that which is used being found In pools in the deeper holes in creek bottoms. Louis river has not sufficient water in it to flout a chip, save in pools. The fish are dead by tons. Indeed, it U asserted that there is not a live fish in six or -teven counties. As the water evaporated, that which was left naturally retained all the salts and minerals. It is believed that drink ing this water produced the disease. The disease is not contagious. The patient is seized with vertigo, heavy fever, complete unconsciousness, with Involuntary discharges much colored with blood. Death ensues in about ten hours, the victim suffering Intensely. Animals suffer the same symptoms as men. Mr. W. C. Lester, a prominent attorney of Williamsburg, Ky., visited a county in the mountains, in the neighborhood of the prevailing disease. He says that "no one seemed to know the exact nature of the pestilence. Most of the people called it "flux," and It is probable an aggravated form of that dis ease. It begins with griping pains in the stomach, followed by a debilitating diarrhoea aud swelling of the throat, and if not fatal In three or four days the patient as a rule recovers. All re ports agree as to the cause of the epi demic, it being attributed to the use of impure water by the natives. The sea son has been unusually dry." Climbing the Spiral Stairs.
