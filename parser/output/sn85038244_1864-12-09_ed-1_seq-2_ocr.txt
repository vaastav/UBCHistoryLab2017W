The people of Vnr At are preparing to resist an invasion from Cnidi, of which tbej have rclialilo information. The President's Message. ill I rciiuem J message waa ici;k. and read in both bomes of Congress od Tues-lav. It is another document which gwg to stamp Abraham Lincoln a great man It m t the unbounded approval of the Uuioo members of the -Senate and House of Representatives. It will be en-dor.-e by the loyal people of the land. It b -gins with the Bta'ement that the blessings of health and abuadant harvest claim our prufuuudest gratitude to Al wipUy God. The President speuls favorably of the construction of a telagraph line between America and Europe by way of Behrings Straits and Asiatic Rus iu, and also of one between the Eastern coast of America and Great BiT'uiu. Fie also names several ports ali.ng the Southern coast, from which t'ja blockade has been removed.- The President thinks foreign slave-traders should not be allowed te practice t';eir criminal operations in our country. He also reftrs to Congress, the question as to whether measures should be taken to pre vent rebel raids 10 our northern border:!. It is thought proper to'coolinae to giva encouragement to emaiigration from for eign couutries. The finsocial affairs hare been success fully administered du ing ihe last year. Iucr-iSJ taxation is recommended. The military situation is favorable. Our armies have B'.eadily advanced during the past year. - ' . An amendment of the Constitution abolishing slavery is recimmanded. Tho President tl.inks the people fe as firm as ever in their determination to Bi iintain the Uni n. No attempt will be nudo to treat for p3?e with Jeff Davis. The Emanc:pation Proclamation will be adhere 1 to. , The President desires paice and will put no obst iclt jia the wayof its attainment. The only condition is a return of the reb els to their aliegi.inca to the Government. A War of Plots. The frustration of the many diabolical plots that have bren L'u for the destruc tion of life and property throughout the Northern States, aiuee lLa election, must Lave a vary discouraging effect upon the desperate scoundrels wl;o plan them. No stronger proof could be given of their be ing aware of thj hope'e-soess of the cause they madly advocate, than the discovery of schemes f t destructh n so devilish that they sound incredulous wha told. Who does not resp ct an open honevt foeman who m?eU you is the field front to front, and whose object to destroy you if he can is appirent? Np matter how bad the cause, if advocated and upheld in a manner to" shw you its supporters are honest and open in their belief, it will re ceive a semblance at least ct respect, but when the blinded advocates, of a wicked aod crut-1 rebellion, like the oae we are now combatting, decend to such plots to further Iheir ends as have been ventilated eiuce the Presidential election, none ean djubt the thorough, rottenness and un whoUsoraeness of their cause. The very worst feature of the war is that the pes tiferous brood that should bear the scourg ing and be made to bear the vengeance of a pr..Ucting government, outraged beyond endurance, wi'l be most likely to eseapo. While Sherman marches through the South, and the open advocates of seces sion fiee the wight of woes they have irouglt upon th mselves in their madness, the cowardly ne.iks in the North, burrow l.ke .moles .an do their mischief in the drk, and hope to escape the hoar of ret ribution by sneaking. Rut thauk Heaven them is a day of reckoning for all, and those who are prolonging this cruel war fire by clogging the wheels of the admia is'ration, and by crumbs of comfoit to their Sjuthern brethren will havo to meet it finally. There scenes to be a Provi dence in tho manner in which their eiu'a have been defouted.

We kDO" transpire ou t what great events may e broad theatre of war be. fore the pre sui t number of the Sentinel reaches its readers ; but at 'he present early date of our writisg-Tueiday our information is such as to warrant the state ment that the military aituation is of the most enoouraging character. An ex tended view of the whole field of war operations cannot but gratify every lover of his country. Ia no previous year of the rebellion has the Confederacy suffered such damaging blows as it has received iu ISo. At the very bestit cannot endure another year of such war; and one would think it impossible fur the traitor Government to last even through the present winter. The day of a restored Uuion docs not seem to be far in the fu ture. Rebellion and slavery' promise soon to go down together. Let us brief ly review the prospxts of the whole sit uation. , In -the first place, then, it may be set down as certain, as forever settled, that the traitors are" to receive do material aid in the North. Aside from the fact of the re-election of President Lincoln by so overwhelming a majority; aside from the fact of the ignominious dc&at of SIc Ciellun, there are certain other reasons which go to show the truth of the state ment made ia the opening of this para graph. The jrcat conspiracy in the Nerth-Weit, which was organized to pro mote the interests of the rebellion, has been thoroughly exploded. Indiana, Illi nois and Missouri are yet firmly linked to the Union. The revelations made at In dianopulis every day expose to the people the traitorous character of the conspiracy, which was intended to promote a second great rebellion. The government of In diana is still in loyal bands. There is no new provincial government there. Gov ernor Morton is not assassinated. Gen eral" Price is not marching through the western states recruiting his army as he goes. On the ' contrary the last known of him, he was seeking bodily safety, by rapid flight over the mountains of Arkansas. The rebel prisoners in our midst have not yet been liberated. In other words, the organization of the ''Sons Liberty" is a magnificent failure, and the rebels need not expect to receive one iota "of benefit from it. Other conspiracies have also signally failed. The diabolical on at Chicago resulted in no good to its orig inators. The city was hot burned. Like wise the traitors in the ' East have met with similar reverses. The awful scheme to burn New Yorkwas unsuccessful. Rebel raids from Canada have done the rebellion no good. All traitorous plots have failed, and the great North is to day as completely as ever, a Goit for T igorous proseoution of the war. Let us look then at the map of the rebellion. The confederacy is shattered and shivered like the tree, rest to splin ters by the thunder-bolts of the s'rm. It was cut in two once, and effectually, whea the Mississippi river was open from its source 10 its moutn. men again it was a1 most cut in two, when the path of federal victory was extended to Atlanta. And now again, for the third time, is the eon-fedcr-cy cr.t in twain by the grand expedi tion cf Sherman to Savannah. . T .e geography of the rebel govern ment, tow presents a scene of disjointed acd frag men tsry states. - Union armies have penetrated to its very heart, and out si de ghel! ! 1. :'y fnd hourly crumbling away. Loou ; - edition-is proving to be ODe of great disaster to the conici eracy. In'the battle of Franklin, Ten nessee, ho lost ten Generals and , six thousand privates. True, he has contin ued bis advance towards Nashville, tut the fiat has now gone forth "thus far, but no farther-" The rebel army oanhot cap. tare Nashville. It cannot winter in Ten nessee or Kentucky, and we confidently expect that before the end of the present year it will be almost wholly destroyed. Then no rebel army of any consequence will exist in all the western rebel state. Half of the rebel territory will thus be free from rebel armies, and the eastern half of the rebellion will be compelled depend upon its own resources for sustenance. Its communications with the west will be effectually Bevered, and with Sher man marching up from Savannah, and Grant and Sheridan marching down from the North, we may look forward to an early grave, for the last and all that re mains of the rebel government. The prospeot therefore, ia most en couraging, indeed.- The confederacy has exhausted its last man and its last dollar, and is going down with slavery, to an in famous oblivion. The American Union, established at thecost of seven years blood and strengthened through eighty years of unpnralleled nutional growth, now rises up in the mnjesty of its latent power, to free itsself from the incubus that has hang upon it from its infancy. With ncbie strides it marches on to a free and glorious future Slavery and its fruit . . . . rebel ion, approach the r end, and the Republic stands forth, the best, the bra vest, the most free, the mo;t p wcrful beneath the Heavens.

The affair waa a brilliant oce and an entire success. The rebels are apprehensive that Grant is about to disturb their quietude, but as yet nothing appearing like a grand move ment has ben developed. te?"The appointment of Mr. Chase to the position of Chief Justice appears to give entire satisfaction. Speaking of the appointment the N. Y. World, (Dem.) remarks: "We are bound to give the President the same praise fer appointing Mr. Chase to the Chief Justiceship which was due to the appointment of Mr. Fessenden to be Mr. Chase's successor in the Treasury Depart ment. This appointment, like that, will be very generally indorsed by the public opinion of the country at the most suita ble that could tiave been made, from the range of selection to which the President is confind by his party relations. Neither was it the spontaneous choice of Mr. Lincoln, but he hazarded the mortification which he encountered before a prompt rejection by the Senate, of an unfit nomination. We are glad to see a fitting tribute to the im portance of that high office, as the ap poinment of the ablest man in the Repub lican party, for such we hold Mr. Chase to be, te fill it." That Mr. Chase will make an efficient officer there can be no doubt, and at tbis time his services are ic dispensable to the welfare of the countrv. I" The English papers teem with ac counts of the execution of Mutter the railway-car murderer, whe was hung at Newgate, in London on the 14th inst.

The execution was wit nessed by nearly one hundred thousand people (at least so say the papers,) and was 'characterized by the most disgiaceful proceedings garrotings and robberies un der the very gallows. Rebel papers of Monday say Sherman ia still between the Oconee and Ocomulge rivers; and that the rail-road from Augus ta to Millen and Macon is in running or der, and to be repaired back to Atlanta that Sherman's objective point ia Darien, near the mouth of the Altamaha river, about fifty miles south of Savanna"h.

Mr. PEXDLET0X, of Ohio, elered the fol lowing: Resolved, That the President be requested to communicate, if not incompatible with the publio interests, the report made by Colonel Thomas M. Key, of the interview between himself and Hot. ell Cobb, on the 14th day of June, 1862, on the banks of the Chickahomi ny, by the authority of the War Department, on the subject of the exchange of prisoners: Mr. 

WASHBURNE, of 111., objected, so the subject lies over. Mr. COX, of Ohio, offered the following: Resolved, That the Committe of Ways and Means, with a view to lesson the cost of the necessaries of life, be instructed to inquire into the expediency of reducing tha tariff on coffee, sugar, tea, and similar articles, either by the payment of all customs in the paper currency of the Government instead of gold, or by the modification of the tariff so that an advalorem, and not a specifio duty, be laid on said articles.

In the rebel Sen ate last -Wednesday, resolutions denounc ing the seizure of the Florida were intro duced. They say it is the duty of the Brazilian Government to protect Confed erate property within its territory, and demand the restoration of the ship. They provide for the appointment of a com mission to Brazil on the subject; also, for laying the subject before the European Goveruments. Mr. Foote in the House, introduced a resolution that Congress cannot interfere with reference to the emancipation of slaves, as suggested by Davis, and that though impolitic for States to act separ ately in negotiations for peace, the right to do so naturally inheres in each one, and.providing for a Convention of dele gates from each State to devise measures for the vigorous prosecution of the war in order to secure an early cessation of hostilities. - ' The Ricmond Whig of the 2d says that Price, with a large army, is within strik ing distance of Little Rock. The Richmond papers "discredit the re port that Grant is crossing men from the south to the north side, and it is not; on his right, but on hit left that Grant medi tates an early and heavy attack. Some important movement in the vicinity of Dutch Gap Canal by the monitors is also apprehended by the Richmond editors." . New Yobk, Deo. 7 We have to-day sime additional items, from rebel sources, showing how the fright at Shermau's ap proach to the coast is spreadiug in Geor gai and South Carolina! All the officials, and military, have is sued fierce and feverish proclamations, call ing on every male, old and young, able to shoulder a musket, to immediately report for duty. ' The Mayors of Savannah and Charles ton, as well as the rebel army officers com manding in those places, have issued be fore their already terrified " communities, documents of this character, probably by tbis means adding considerable to the panic. 'Got. Brown of Georgia, h s issued three more proclamations on the crisis, but in Savannah, according to the Republican of that city, even these stirring papers do not bring out the citizens, for it appears a military guard Las to go around the town agd drag them out of their hiding places. " ' . Gen. Disk' Taylor has been assigned to the command of all the Alabama a-.id Georgia reserves, with headquarters at Savannah. . , The Macon Telegraph of November 25th", Eays: "Sherman's situation is daily growing more precarious, and we may confidently hope for his complete over throw and destruction. . The Central Road is said to be entirely destroyed be tween Griswoldvillo and Mclntyre." General Foster's Expedition. In relation to the rebel reports of Gen. Foster's expedition, the New York Tri. bune of Tuesday remarks : "The news of the rebel press from General Foster's ex pedition is neither oorrcct or authentic. It is pretty clear that General Foster has eut the Charleston & Savannah Road hear Pocctalign. If, as Iladee allegs.be subse quently suffered a repulse at Giahamsviila, fifteen miles nearer Savannah, there is no th hi to show that bis hold on the Char leston & Savannah Railroad, has been let go. And that is the important point in General Foster's expedition. Ho under took to lever and to hold that road, and he docs it." 

LETTER FROM JAMESTOWN. Jamestown Ohio, 1 Nov. otla, lbtM. J MR. EDITOR. Our "City" is still situated on the I' head-waters, and between the Middle and South branoLes of Ca;sarscreek. So near is our beautiful "City" to those streams .that their "several" waters wash it on either side; and if the obstruc tions to navigation were removed and the enemy's gunboats should steam up some night under cover of the darkness, our citizens would discover, on the fallow ing morning, (when it would be "ever tsstingly too late,") not that they had been surprised, aud ("secondly,") that they were in a very tight place. But in asmuch as the obstructions aforesaid are of a somewhat formidable character, eur peoplo persist in attending te their daily business, and nightly amusements, "as if nothing was the matter." You will doubt less iufer from the foregoing remark that we have both business and amusements at Jamestown, You are right Mr. Editor. Our stores and workshops, hotels and -doggerries send up the busy hum of indus try, and the incense of "departing Spirits" by day. And the Freemasons, Odd Fel lows, Sons of Temperance, and Lyceum Halls are lit up and shine alternately at night. An excellent weekly paper is read at each meeting of our Lyceum. It is not edited (like your Xenia papers) by Smith, or Jones, or Brown, of the mas culine persuasion, but by Misses Mattie Sutton, and Laura Sphar, who with their host of able correspondents make it high ly entertaining. OUR RAIL-ROAD —ALA MODE CEDARVILLE. ' Sojae of onr "City Fathers" were so deligted with the Rail-road ordinance recently enacted by the Council pf Cedar- 'ville, that they determined to draw up a bill of nearly similar import and submit it to the Common Council of the incorpora ted village of Jamestwon. As neither ot the gentlemen had sufficient legal knowledge to draw up such an instru ment in a manner to compare favorably in point of legal perfection, with the Cedarville production ; Joshua Billings, Esq., who (fortunately for tbeno) was stop ping in town, was applied to and produced the following, which I send you in Advance of the telegraph. "Wareas.". The city council in the uncorporated village in Cedarville has lest a greate ,deal of bogs, and geese, an cows, an other quadrepids an critters, afoursaid; by the purpensity of sed critters to travel by rale, and (Wareas) If any Locafoker, or steme engine shall travel faster than a mile ia four hours, the aforesed council in Cedarvill will find it in any sum not exceedin the penalty, and (Wareaes,) The Daten and Zeny Rale Rodeaint finished to Jimtown, an dont ex pect to-be, and (Wareas,) Tie Jim towners haint lost much critters by the runnin at large 01 ingines ; l iarour Resolved) That steam ingines may run as fast as they darn please through Jim town : (Purvided o.idways,') That they must finish the Rale Rode before they begin runnin. At this juncture the ''learned gentle men" declared that "Cedurvilie was beat in every pint," suggesting at the same time to the city futl.ers, that it was a long time between driuks. BURNED TO DEATH. A melancholy occurrence- happened in Jamestown on Monday last, the circam stances of which spread a deep glom over the entire population of thia place. i Miss Amanda Cabin was scrubbing a hearth at the house of Mr. Blain, (with whom she was living) when her clothes caught fire. . In her fright she ran t) the well to draw water to put it out. Mrs. Blain being absent and there being no one about the house to assist her, she abandoned the idea of drawing water and ran to Mrs. Dillingham's at the other cor ner of. the square. Meantime her clothes had burned entirely off, her hair Was singed, her eyebrows burned off, yet her eyesight was not destroyed, one was taken to Mr. Blain's and found to be ter ribly burned ; so much so that she died in about twenty-three hours after the ac cident occurred. , We learn that Miss Sabin was about 17 years of age, and was an orphan, her Father and Mother being both dead She was of a kind and affectionate dispo sition,' and beloved by all who knew her. Her trust was in God the Father of the fatherless and he gave her grace to meet his messenger Death, calmly and smiling ly, with an abiding hope of blissful 1m1 mortality bevond the grave. Snatched from us so suddenly in the springtime of lite, when just bloming- into beauteous womanhood ; as a community we mourn her loss with parental grief, and share the anguish of her patriotic brother who now faces the hardships and privations of the camp, and her gentle little sister left friendless and dependant on a cold un friendly world. OLD FOGY. INTERESTING CORRESPONDENCE. PENCE. Hon. E. B. Tlo.sA.6ume.- My Dbar Sir: I heard a short time ago that some one had informed Lt. Gen. Grant that I had spoken slight ingly of him as an officer. . As it is possible that your frank may enable a letter to reach him, I beg leave to say, through you, that I have never uttered an unkind wor4 about him. The inquiry has frequent ly been addressed to me, "Do you know Gen. Grant?-' ' I have answered, that he made the campaign of Mexico with me, snd was considered by me, and I suppose by his brother officers in commission, a good officer, and one who attained special distinction at Molino del Ray. - Of his more recent services, I have uniformly spoken in terms of the highest admiration, and added, that in my opinion, he had richly earned his present rank, and trusted he might speedily pat down the rebellion. - Very truly yours, .
