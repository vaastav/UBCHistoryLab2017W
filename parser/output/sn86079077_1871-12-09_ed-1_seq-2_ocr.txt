Masonic .—At the next regular communication of Orphans' Friend Lodge, No. 18T>, Big Cane, La., the election for officers to serve the en suing year, 1872, will be holden. The membership are requested to take notice thereof and govern themselves accordingly. accordingly. District Court .—The last crim inal trial, at this term of the court, came off last Monday and Tuesday— the State vs. Charles P. Gordon, in dicted for manslaughter, for killing Omer Poiret. The jury rendered a verdict of not guilty. The court has tinee been occupied in the trial of civil eases. Geu. Emory has issued an order taking command of the Department of the Griff,- td which he was recently appointed, consisting of the States of Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, and the Gulf Posts as far eastward as and embracing Fort Jefferson and Key West, and excluding the Mili tary Posts in Mobile Bay. Mr, Munzcsheimer has recently re ceived a lot of excellent flour, • and all other kinds of groceries. Being an experienced flour dealer, and hav ing a considerable reputation in that line, we have no hesitation in recom mending him as such to our readers. We have tried several barrels of his flour, and always found it as repre sented. The cane in this parish is yielding' a hogshead to a hogshead and a half of sugar per acre, according to cir cumstances. We give one instance where a little over two arpents gave five hogsheads. The cane was so very late maturing this season, that many planters, for fear of losing their cane by a freeze, commenced grinding it while green, and the yield was only half of what is has since been. A G ood Y ield .—We are reliably informed that Mr. Dors Noel, on Bay ou Teche, seven or eight miles from here, got a yield of five hogsheads of sugar from abont two and one-fifth arpents of cane. For the informa tion of those not acquainted with measurements in Southwestern Lou isiana, we will state that an arpent is le8s than an acre—six acres makes about seven arpents. ! The President's Mèssage. Wo received, too late, tlie "New Orleans papers, containing the 1'resi : dent's annual message to publish it, 1 owing to its length. The subjects treated in the message are the loss of life and property by storm and lire during the year, the relations of the United States with foreign powers, the treaty of Washington, the fish eries, inland navigation, forty-ninth parallel, protection of Germans in France, Germany friendly to the United States, the Italian question, claims against Spain, relations with Russia, remarks on the Kassian Min. ister Catacazy, Japan, the affair at Corea, Mexico, (■entrai and South America, Cuba, Pacific mail lines, the national debt, tarif! a yd internal tax laws, the currency, the army, the navy, post-office department, postal telegraph, the kuklux law, Utah, the Indians, public lands, the Interior Department, agriculture, salaries of bureau officers, estimates for the sup port of the Government, removal of disabilities under the fourteenth amendment, condition of the South ern States, District of Columbia, the Chicago fire, immigrants, and civil service reform. Xcxt week we will publish the message in full, or at any rate that part of it in which we are most concerned—that which treats of the domestic affairs of the nation. A New Business. Messrs. J. V. Roy & Co., as will be seen by their advertisement, have opened an auction room in Opelou sas. We have often wondered that some one did not do this before. There lias been no regular auction establishment in the parish for years, we believe. Purchasers have large ly increased since the war, on ac count of emancipation ; and anion as large a population as we have in this parish, there is always a great deal of cash seeking to be spent. Nothing will bring out this cash like the selling of goods at auction, regu larly every week at the same place All kinds of goods and produce from different parts of the parish, can be brought here and sold ; and by hav ing an agent in New Orleans, to pur chase goods that are continually sold there below cost, the auction busi ness here etui bemade a regular and permanent one. We think the firm of J. V. Roy& Co., understand their new vocation, and we know they have the energy and industry which brings success. Judge Hebrard's Court .—Al exander Muudell was brought before Judge Hebrard on the 2d inst., for shooting one William Lee, on the 1st inst., at Mr. Theo. Chachere's sugar mill, near Rider's Bridge. It was shown that the shooting was ac cidental, though the accused was to blame in jokingly threatening " to shoot Lee and carelessly holding his gun. lie was discharged. The preliminary examination of Francois Fournier, Roselins Four nier and Joseph Founder, accused of shooting into the cabin of one Charles Handy, on the plantation of Ludger Lastrapes, on the night of the 25th ult., and mortally wounding Pratt Handy, son of said Charles Handy, and dangerously wounding one Lu cius, a freed boy, took place before Judge Hebrard, on the 29th ult., and the parties accused proving an alibi, were discharged. All the parties in this case are"colored. Several other cases are pending before Judge Hebrard, which will probably not be disposed of this week. Produce Shipped .—The steamer Lessie Taylor arrived at New Orleans last Monday, with 130 bales cotton, 103 sacks cotton seed, 51 hluls. su. gar, 110 bbls. molasses, and-lot of sundries. The steamer Selma arrived there on Tuesday, with 10(5 bales cotton, 73 sacks seed "Cotton, 324 sacks cot ton seed, 54 hluls. sugar, 222 bbls molasses, 3 half bbls. molasses, 0 hides, 8 rolls leather, and lot of sun dries. The Fair.—A fair, concert, and general entertainment, accompanied with refreshments, will be given at the Courthouse in Opelousas, on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, the 26th, 27th and 28th days of the present month, commencing at 7 o'clock, p. m ., of each day. There will be a Christmas tree, and many other things appropriate to such oc casions. The fair will be given for the benefit of the Catholic Church at this place. The price of admission is only fifty cents. Ex-Controller Connelly, of Xew York city, has been arrested and put in jail on account of complicity in the Tammany frauds. At last ac counts he had failed to furnish bail. It was thought that Mayor Hall would be arrested on the same charge; and it was Stated that three of the bondsmen of Tweed, the Boss of Tammany Hall, had signified their intention of withdrawing their names from his bond. In which case he would have to furnish others, or go to jail. J The Democratic Address. The State Democratic Committee, under date of Nov. 30th, have issued an " Address to the People of Loui siana." The address is published in the New Orleans papers as an ad vertisement, but of course the conn try papers, being more patriotic than their city brethren, will publish it for nothing. The burden of the ad. dress is, that since reform is all the rage, the Democratic party is the best reform party that exists or can exist. The difficulty is that the De mocratic party has failed so long to bring about a reformation in politic al affairs, that the people have lost all faith in its ability to accomplish anything. Besides, the party is dead, if the Central Committee is not. Len ders of the party at the North have declared it to be dead, and others of them say it should die, as ithas lost all power to do good. The Demo cratic party has been out of power for ten years, and has been defeated in every general contest during that time, and absolutely slaughtered in the last one. One would think, look ing at the political history of these ten years, and reading this address, that the .words "Democratic Party'' was a mania with the gentlemen of the Democratic Central Committee, and that they would not move in the way of reform under a ny other party name. Faquetaique .—Mr. Joseph Fa baclier, of the German settlement at Faquetaique, called on us this week. He reports the settlement in a pros perous condition, and the prospects ;ood. He says cane grows well there, and the potatoes, both Irish and sweet, grown by him this season, are unsurpassed. He planted some Irish potatoes on the 28th of last Septem ber, and dug them last Saturday, just two months and four days after planting. He showed us some of those dug, which were as large and larger than a man's fist. They were the largest home grown potatoes we have seen this year. Our New Lieut. Governor.— A private dispatch received here just before Ave went to press, says Hon. P. 15. S. Pineliback, colored, has been elected President of the State Senate, and consequently Lieutenant Governor. Mr. Pinch back was president of the Turner Hall Republican Convention, which favored Gov. Warmoth, as distin guished from the* Custom House Convention, which opposed him. j | I i j ' j ; j Convention, which opposed him. Lieutenant-Governor Dunn. The death of Lieutenant Governor Dunn, of Louisiana, which occurred at Iiis residence in Xew Orleans, yes terday, «is of no little importance, Oscar J. Dunn Avas a negro, and was. perhaps justly, regarded as the po litical leader of his race in this coun try. He was a man of more depth than "Revels, the Mississippi Senator, and. though in the scale of official posi tion he was hardly so high, it is very probable that in time he would have made a reputation for good sound sense superior to the other and sur passed him in every respect. At the time of his death Dunn was the ac knowledged leader of the'Grant wing of the Louisiana Republicans, and was engaged in a movement which, there are many reasons to believe, had for its ultimate object the eleva tion of his name to the place of Vice President upon the Republican ticket next year, or in 1.870 at the farthest. In his " Black Man's Party " move ment in Louisiana he had the sanc tion and support of Gen. Grant, and it is believed that the President was willing to take Dunn with him upon the ticket. The object of this move ment was the concentration of the Africah vote of the country in one solid phalanx, with an ulterior view to the triumph of #ie extreme of the Radical party. The immediate ob ject of the movement in Louisiana was the impeachment of Warmoth and his party. Whafeffect the death of Dunn will have in this regard is hard to tell. It may be the triumph ! I ; j of t-Uxi anti-Grant party. Lieutenant-Governor Dunn was a large, portly, well-proportioned, good looking man of his class, Avith con siderable afiability of manner, and a pleasing expression of countenance. He presided over the State Senate with notable dignity, propounding motions with distinctness, and ex hibiting a perfect familiarity with parliamentary rules. The distin guishing character of his intellect was common sense, to which might be «added, among his highest moral traits, a sense of pruprietv. His speeches Avere always brief, 1 though he spoke sensibly enough and Avith commendable fluency. His death Avili be a severe blow'to the Grant party in that State—[ Louisville Cou rier-Journal. Report of*the Commissioner ° F - i »^ e ^ SI0N ?*— r ^ ie Commissioner ot 1 ensions, in bis annual report, will give for the first time a list of special pensioners, made so by con gressional action. He will also give a series of tables, showing that the amount of money paid to each pen sioner averages $10 50 a month. A statement will also bemade showing the amount of money appropriated b> Congress, since the foundation of the Governemeut, to pay the pen sioners. - 1 The sum appropriated for this pur pose, since the close of the war amounts to $153,000,000. The great American " ism*—Jour nalism. Phenomena of the Wisconsin Fires ! 1 j i j Mr. J. A. Richards, a member of a relief committee from Milwaukee, which has visited the districts in Wisconsin ravaged by the recent fires, writes to the Milwaukee Senti nel as follows : The phenomena and results of this storm were mysteriously strange. In some places* the forest trees lay in every imaginable position, while in others they were mere sticks in the hands of a great power slashing and whipping the earth, and then made fuel for the work of death. The fields, wq^ds, barns, houses and even the "air" was on fire, while large balls of fire revolving and bursting in every direction, igniting everything they came in contact with ; and the whole of this fierce element was driven before a tornado at the rate of a mile a minute. There can be no doubt that the air, stron^ ly charged with electricity, helped on the work of destruction and death. Mr. A. lvirby says he saw large ho dies or balls of fire in the air, and when they came in contact with any thing they would bound thirty or forty rods away. Others testify that they saw large clouds of lire burst into fragments, and in some instances great tongues of fire like lightnii o would issue from these dark clouds and light upon the buildings. Pen nies were melted in the pockets of persons who were little burned. A small ball upon an engine, and a new stove, both standing from twenty to forty feet from any building, were melted. A New Kind of Wall.—A wall, lately invented, is coining into use in England, the advantages claimed for which are the very important ones of non-absorbency of moisture, non-conduction of heat, economy of space, a washable surface, and vrith all cheapness. Over a framework of strong cross wires, of about one eighth of an inch thick, there is woven, by a powerful pressure, fibrous matter, which is saturated j witli a solution that renders it iire | proof. It is then subjected to a I \ erv powerful pressure. A coating i ot light Scott's cement is then put j upon it for inside facing, and Port land cement for outside facing. By ' this means surfaces are made im permeable to moisture, smooth, and j easily washed with water, thus sav ; ing the expense of repeated lime j washings. It is formed into slabs in iron frames, which are put to gether and closely and securely fastened with bolts. The slabs are lroin one and a half to four inches thick. They are sound to serve as superb panelling for dividing-walls and partitions. Where the space is of importance, it has the advantage perhaps, over concrete walling, in enabling a wall to be made ot not more than one and a half or two inches in thickness, and vet its quality is said to greatly deaden sound. Major Gen. Win. II. Emory, hoav commanding the Department of the Gulf, with headquarters here, en tered service as cadet at the United States Military Academy.

COAA-. It appears that her friend and co-tenant, McLaughlin, the fid dler, had a social time that evening; that wishing to cook a few oysters for the social croAvd, and being short of milk, he went for Mus. O'Leary's cow, and while engaged in surreptitiously obtaining the lac teal fluid from the beast, she be came indignant at their dishonest practices and kicked over the lamp. Ilence the great conflagration. Velpeau, the French surgeon, had two hospital patients whose business for fifteen years was to be knocked down and run over in the streets. "When they saw a light vehicle ap proaching, and knew the owner to be wealthy, they would run across the street in such a way as to get before the horses, to be knockd down and carried to the hospital, when they would sue for damages. When the money thus gained was spent, they would go out and get run over again. They generally managed to avoid being too seriously injured in this way; yet nearly every bone in their bodies had been broken. Here is a fragment overheard at a theatre the other night. "My Jove! how she is pretty, that young lady there!" " Kb, my taitli, 1 used to think so, four or five weeks since." " Truly, but you think so now, too ?" " Eh, well, I hardly know. I was her lover then, and now she is my wife!"—[Punch. A "devoted" little wife in Lafay ette, Ind., seeing her husband blow ing in the muzzle of a gun while holding back the hammer with his foot, tripped down to the milliner's to ask about the cost of full mourning.
