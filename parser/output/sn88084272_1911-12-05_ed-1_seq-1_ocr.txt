For tonight and Wednesday. na i i k i i - 1 i - i MESSAGE BRIEF AND PfllKTE Differs From Lengthy Doc uments of Predecessor; - Gets to the Meat. WANTS PLAINER ANTI-TRUST LAW That Supreme Court Weakened Operation e Sherman Law. Washi bgton. D. C, Dec 5. In strik ing cont -ast to the practice of his pred ecessor, president Taft today sent to congress an "annual message" which required I only 38 minutes te read, in stead ofthe five to six hour encyclo pedias traversing every topic of hu- man interest from obll weevils to ba bies and krom Mooselookmaguntic lake to Mars, which president Roosevelt used to slhip down to the capitol on such occasions. President Taft confines his "arnaal message" y to one topic only the anti trust law fend proposed modifications in direction ef more effectual federal con. mtr9!-i . I ie- aenves mat tne recent supreme i court dectc'ons in ar-y way weaken or I restrict tne operation of the law; on the contrary, he says they only state an old and well established rule in a new way. He .describes the enforced disso lution of the tobacco trust and volunta ry dissolution of other trusts. Mere size, he says, is no objection, but' the only ru,e 'that shuuld be applied is un lawful monopoly and restraint of trade by means prohibited- in law. For new legislation, the president suggests a law defining definitely the wrong methods prohibited; provision for federal Incorporation; and a federal corporation" commission with large powers, similar in scope to those of the controler of the currency or of the interstate commerce commission. The message follows: ; First of a Series. To the Senate and House of Represen tatives: This message is the first of several which I shall send to congress during the interval between the opening of its regular session anJ its adjournment for the Christmas holidays. The amount of information to be communicated as to the operations of the government, the number of important subjects call ing for comment by the executive, and the transmission to congress of ex haustive reports of special commissions, make it impossible to include in one message of a reasonable length a dis cussion of the topics that ought to be brohght to the attention of the national legislature at its first regular session. The Anti Trust Law. I- May last the supreme court handed down decisions in the sulfa in equity brought by the United States to en join the further maintenance of the Standard Oil trust and of the Ameri can Tobacco trust, and to secure their dissolution. The decisions are epoch making and serve to advise the business world authoritatively of the scope' of operation of the anti trust act of 1890. Xo Sen Precedent. The decisions do not depart in any substantial way from the previous de cisions of the court is construing and applying this important statute, but they clarify those decisions by further defining the already admitted excep tions to the literal construction of the act. By the decrees, they furnish a useful precedent as to the proper meth od of dealing with the capital and prop erty of illegal trusts. These decisions suggest the need and wisdom of additional or supplemental legislation to make it easier for the en tire business community to square with I tne rule or action and legality thus finally established and to preserve the benefit, freedom and spur of rea sonable competition without loss of real efficiency or progress. Net a Xew Rale. The statute in its first section de clares to be illegal "every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy. In restraint of trade or commerce among the several states or with foreign nations," and in the second, declares guilty of a mis demeanor "tevery person who shall mon opolise or attempt to monopolize or combine or conspire with any other person to monopolize any part 'of the trade or commerce of the several states or with foreign nations." Is two early cases, where the statute was invoked to enjoin a transportation rate agreement between interstate rail road companies, ft was held that It was no defence to show that the agreement (Continued on Page 8.)

VOCATES BETTER ONTROL OF THE IHl DP RRIGAT1QN Experts From Many West ern and Foreign Countries Attend Congress. PRESIDENT FOWLER . DELIVERS ADDRESS Chicago, HI, Dec. . Experts in ir rigation from many of the -western states and from a dogen foreign conn tries, including Mexico, Canada and Central and South America, and gov ernment officiate interested in the re clamation of arid and swamp lands, at tended the opening today of the 19th annual meeting of thp National Irri gation congress. Taft Sends Greetings. Dr. F. H. Newell, director of the United States reclamation service; R. P. Teele. in charge of irrigation sta tistics of the bureau of censue. and senator William E. Borah, of Idaho, were the chief speakers for the after noon session. An encouraging mes sage from president Taft was re ceived. President Fowler's Address. President Benjamin A. Fowler, speak at the opening of the irrigation con gress, advocated amendments to the national Irrigation act and urged thevl reclamation oi swamp lands as two of' the most important matters for discus sion by the congress. "More than nine years have passed since the national irrigation act became a law ana the reclamation service was organized," said president Fowler in taking up the subject of the proposed amendments. "As anticipated by its friends, the act has In practice -demonstrated some, weaknesses, which could not he foreseen, but ought now to be corrected. "I. The time limit of 10 years in which to return to the government in J equal annual payments the cost of) con struction of a project fs now recog nized as too short, and the necessity of an extension. 4s admitted. "1. Theoretically, irrigated lands under any government project ought to furnish the best of security for con servative mortgage loans at low inter est. But outside capital hesitates to of fer itself for such loans because in case of foreclosure, the act operates against the mortgagee and prevents him as a nonresident from securing title. Tills ought to be remedied In the Interest of both sides. "3. Experience has shown that when any project is more than half complet ed, acreage property has so appreciated in value that the opportunity for the speculator as such or the large capi talist -has gone forever, and the time has come when the owner should no longer be required to live on these lands." Regarding the reclamation of swamp lands. President Fowler said in part: 'lln addition to the land area avail able -. for reclamation through irriga tion, there are about 80,000,000 acres of swamp and overflow lands not now in habitable but susceptible to drainage. "Though these wet lands are mostly along the gulf and Atlantic slopes, with considerable areas in tbe Pacific states. they are distributed throughout e- ry state. Generally of great fertility ney would, if reclaimed, sustain a popula tion of 90,000,000 of people. While not yet settled or cultivated, except in a small way. most of the wet lands have been ceded to states and have passed into private ownership. . By far the greater portion of the area (for exam ple, in the lower Mississippi region), is so located that drainage projects would necessarily affect several states, so that the drainage problem is essen tially interstate, involving federal ac tion with that of the states." moroccan question is

Im perial chancelor Von Bethmann-Ifolt-weg gave a calm and dispassionate ex position of the German case.

' ' REBELLIONS Several of Them Are Noy Tinder Way Execution of Prisoners Charged. CONGRESS READY TO PROBE MATTER Mexico City, Mexico. Dec 5. Revolu tions in Yucatan, Tamaulipas asd Sen Luis Potosi are disturbing the Mex ican government. Vice sresldent Pino Suarez, a citizen of Yucatan, declares the insurrection in that state is due to Delio Moreno Canton, defeated candi date for governor., Canton Is la New in .niHtllaa Hut rebela-re led by Emiliano-xfooita, who recently escaped after being arrested In Veraerux. The San Luis Potosi band apparently has no leader. At the department of the Interior it is admitted that the Yuca tan revolt is Reyista lit character; the known leader of the TamauHpas in surrection is a Reyista,, while the pil lagers In San Luis Potosi are sacking haciendas to the cry of "viva Reyes." The rebellion in Yucatan is almost statewide, according to advices reoflwed yesterday by tbe government. So seri ous is the situation regarded that a gunboat has been ordered to proceed from Veracruz to Progresso with a de tachment of troops and a full supply of ammuriition. A dispatch from Merida, tne capital of Yucatan, says the communication with the interior is hampered, the wires having been cut, but reports brought to the capital by couriers in dicate that the rising is of little im portance. Shooting of Prisoners. The ministers of war, justice and gobernacion have been summoned to appear before the chamber of deputies and explain the alleged shooting of prisoners taken during the recent up risings and the mistreatment of news paper men by the authorities. The summons Dresented to the vari ous ministers states that the press has published stories of the summary exe cution of prisoners in various parts of the country, that Pedro, L. Ulloa, aj newspaper man. was arrested in Her mosillo without due process of law, and that Brigido Caro and Roberto Ber nal were obliged to pee to the United States for certain articles they had written and that they were threatened with death if they returned to Mexico. At the war department it was denied that any men had been shot, except during combats, and that all prison ers were turned over to the author ities. The minister of gobernacion aid that he had heard of no execu tions or mistreatment of cltlneus by the authorities. There had been fight ing in Durango. Coahulla, Teplc and other parts of the country, but the men who had hist their lives had been killed while fighting against their f-ountry. He would request the judges to make an investigation, but he be lieved that it was all untrue. Compulsory Service Distasteful. The Democratic Anti-reelectionlst party has issued a call to all the inde pendent parties of the city to meet With t at 7 oclock this evening in the New York salon to discuss the attitude of resident Madero In respect to recruit ing soldiers for the army. The invitation states that as the party feels it to be Its duty to guard the principles of the platform sworn to by president Madero and seeing that the decree of the president in regard to obligatory military service violates the principles of the platform, the party calls Sipon all the parties which took part in the convention of last August and September to take action against the "wrong committed against the platform by the triumphant candidate of the parties." To 'Increase Army. If Madero's plans are carried out the Mexican army will have 15,000 new sol diers on February 1 next year.

DR.SUNYATSEN MAY SAVE COUNTRY Shanghai. China. Dec 6. Eeach day brings, keener apprehension that China Is drifting into a political chaos. The revolutionary juntas here are now marking time, awaiting the arrival of Dr. Sun Yat Sen. It is hoped that he may prove to be the leader whom every one is seeking. If he can line up the various revolutionary chiefs and unlfy the movement, a solution of China's troubles may be ho?ed for. There are dissensions everywhere .among the reb els, especially at the Wu Chang and Nanking headquarters. The lall of Han Tang last week proves to have been due entirely to wholesale desertions of rebel troops enroled in Hunan province. Huang Sing In Shanghai. The rebel eeenraL Huansr Sing, -who was at Wu Chang as second in com-1 mand to Uen. Li Yuen Heng. left Han Yang a short time before the im perialists regained that city. He ar rived in Shanghai this week and imme diately proclaimed himself generalis simo of the revolutionary forces as signed to Li, a subsidiary place. Huang asserts that he has been given the right to name a., temporary premier or edu cator act pending ihe election of a president. He is now making plans, he says, for an overland advance on Pekin through Shan Tung province. Cost Is Enormous. The cost of the struggle thus far has been far greater than is easily realized. Apart from the losses of campaign and battle fields, it has plunged a majority of the provinces into poverty and famine, it has stopped all commerce and trade, crippled agriculture and In dustry, and diverted practically every penny of tax revenue from the purpose of peace. Brigandage Is General. Brigandlng is almost the only prof itable profession left to a people hith erto peaceable and orderly. Millions are starving within a radius of a few hundred miles of Shanghai. In in creasing numbers there are brought to this city accounts of robberies and violence and even the killing of Euro peans has ceased to be exceptional In the absence of law and order. Close observers are more and more uneasy regarding the prospects for foreigners in the immediate future.

The drawings are to take place in all parts of the country January 1. This will give Mexico an army of 30.000 men. Abram Gonzales minister of gober nacion, said last night that the rural force would be reduced, as the coun try will not need such a number of fighting men as the two forces com bined will amount to after the second drawing for the regular army is held a year hence. One feature of the new enlistmen act is that a man drawn may arrange to send a substitute, if the substitute is satisfactory to the war department and has Dot passed the age of 45 years. Cartridge Reach Monterey. One hundred thousand cartridges and 500 rifles have arrived at Monterey, ad dressed to the government for tie na tional guard from New Haven. Conn.
