UJHUO 0?pUCIHIIV 10 Ureati,UUM ; j I . j , j This has Britain, franco, Spain nnd Russia. In each oase It bas been kindly received, but not yet formally ndoptcd. Applications have been made to me by many free Americans of African descent, to favor their emigration with a view to mieh colonization as was contemplated in recent acts of Congress. Other parties, at home and abroad, some from interested nnd other nations, have suggested similar moasures, while on the ether hand sev eral of the Spanish American Republics imve protested against the sending ol such colonics to llieir reapecuve Itrrilorios. Under these circumstances, I have de- cllned to move any such colony to any Sta'.e without first obtaining the consent of its Government, with an agreement on its part to receive and protect such emi grants in nil their rights as freemen, and I have nt tho same limn offered lo tho several Slates, shunter! in ihe tropics, or liaving colonies there, to negotiate with them on tho subject, with the udvico nnd consent of the henate, lo favor the volmi lary emigration of persons of that cbiss to their respective territories upon conditions which shall be equal, just nnd humane. w .. . .

In ,o?.l others, nor ns willing ns I think their in-1 teresl demsnds. 1 believe, however, lhal tho opinion is improving, and that ere long' there will be an augmented and consid-i erable emigration to boili these countries. Our relations with huropeiin Stales ro-; main undisturbed, nnd wiih States of our own coniincnt have improved, especially Mexico, Costa R:ca, its. The President favors ihe projocl of an Atlantic tulcgraph, nnd extending the Pa cific line to connect wiih that beiug built across the Russian Empire. He thinks the mineral resources of the territories ought to be developed ns rap idly as podible. Every step in that di rection has n tendency lo improve the rev enues. Il U worlby serious consideration whether some extraordinay measures lo promote that end cannot be adopted. The means which suggest itselfs ns most likely to effect that end.is a scientific exploration. The vast expenditures, incident to ihe military and naval operations reouircd for the suppression of the rebellion, have liiiherto been met with a promptitude and certainty unusual in similar circumstances, nnd the public credit has. been fully main tained. Thu continuance of Ihe war, however, nnd tho increased disbursements made necessary, demand your best rc- . ., , , - , . ,. flvctioni as to the best modes ol providing me necessary revei.ue. iiio suspension o( specie payment by the banks made large issues of United Htntes notes una- voidable. In no other way could the par inent of the troops and the satisfaction of, other just demauds be so economically or! ns well provided for. r. , , i i i ,r i i . it Is extremely doubtful whether a o.r-l cuiuuonoi t ni ea oiuies noies, payaoie in coin aud sufficiently large for tho wants cl the people, can bo permanently usclul ana saieiy maintained, is there any other mode in which the, necessary pro-j vision for the publio wants can be made,' and the great advantages of a safe nnd uniform currency secured? 1 know none which promises so ceitnin results,' nnd at the samu time so unobjectionable, as the organization of bankingaHsociations Under a general act of Lougioss, well, guarded in its provisions. 1 such assneiatiiii.t ili nnmunt night fumlth circulating notes on tho' so eurity ef United Bmtos bonds, deposited in the troaiury.

A moderate reserva tion from Uu Interest on the bonds would compensate tho United States for iho prep aration and distribution of tho notes, and gonoral supervision of the system, and would lighten the burden of (bat portion tha public debt employed at security.
