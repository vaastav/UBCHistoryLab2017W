rfW&ffi "Who are you?" He answered: "Never mind, get out of here," to several questions I asked him. A striker named Hohn, not more than a boy in size, said: "He's not an officer unless he's got a star." The man leaped on young Hohn, shook him like a big dog would a rat. He dragged the striker a block and a half to a police box. When I said there was no need for shaking and drag ging young Hohn, he said: "You've got no business here; you ought to be In your office." At the police box he turned another torrent of abuse on us. He was profane and obscene. When Hohn was placed in the wa gon a sergeant pointed at me and -o- said: "Put that man in." On the way to the wagon, I remember one remark the officer made to Hohn. It was: "I'll beat your face to a jelly." At the station we learned the name of this profane, obscene, brutal officer is Edward Touhy and he is a detective sergeant When I realize that this course is followed with hun dreds of strikers who have no means of redress, I ask: Who governs the city of Chicago at the present time?" Ellen Gates Starr, Hull House: I notice Joe Notarro, the newsboy, sends 25 cents to The Day Book strike fund. Since Joe has done his duty, let this respectable audience do its duty. o- 

PREPAREDNESS PLAN AND ROAST OF HYPHEN FEATURE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE Washington, Dec 7. President Wilson today read his message to the 64th congress, mincing no words in attacking hyphenated Americans and calling for new measures of prepar edness.

We still mean al ways to make a common cause of na tional independence and of political liberty in America. "We have been put to the test in the case of Mexico and we have stood the test Whether we have benefited Mexico by the course we have pur sued remains to be seen. Her for tunes are in her own hands. But we have at least proved that we will not take advantage of her in her distress and undertake to impose upon her an order and government of our own choosing. "We will not maintain a standing army except for uses which are as ne cessary in times of peace as in times oi war; and we shall always see to it that our military peace establishment is no larger than is actually and con tinuously needed for the uses of days in which no enemies move against us. But war has never been a mere mat ter of men and guns. It is a thing of disciplined might If our citizens are ever to fight effectively upon a sud den summons they must know how modern fighting is done and what to do when the summons comes to ren der themselves immediately avail able and immediately effective. And the government must be their serv ant in this matter, must supply them with the training they need to take care of themselves and of it "It is with these ideals in mind that the plans of the department of war for more adequate national de fense were conceived. They contem plate an increase of the standing ! force of the regular army from its present strength of 5,023 officers and ' 102,985 enlisted men of all services to a strength of 7,136 officers and 134,707 enlisted men. "By way of making the country ready to assert some part of its real power promptly and upon a larger scale, should occasion arise, the plan I also contemplates supplementing the ! i Jfc
