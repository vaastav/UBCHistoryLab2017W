O. of Calif. For the purpose of funding current debts and raising ndditioi.nl funds for tho acquisition of now properties and betterments and additions to plants the Transcontinental Oil Company is plan? ning to issue $10,000,000 first mortgage and collateral trust sinking fund ten- I year 8 per cent gold bonds. Stockhold? ers will be asked to approve the finan? cing at a meeting to be held December 19 in Pittsburgh. Approximately $5,000,000 of the Issue, according to tho announcement made to the stockholders, will he pur? chased at par by the officers and large stockholders, and $2,000,000 will be purchased by the Standard Oil Com? pany of California at par. The pro? ceeds of tho sale, approximately $7,000,000, will be applied on current indebtedness and to tho expansion of the company's business. The remain? ing $3,000,000 of tho $10,000,000 author? ization will be held in the treasury to be used for future requirements. The proposed sale of $2,000,000 of the bonds to the Standard Oil Com? pany of California follows the con? summation of an agreement between that company and the Transcontinental whereby the Standard takes more than [il per cent of tho joint stock inter? ests of the Transcontinental Oil Com? pany end the Arkansas Natural Gas Company in tho Latin-America Petro? leum Company. The holdings of the latter company comprise approximately (500,000 acres of land in the municipali? ties of San Jacinto and El Carmen in Colombia, South America, the western boundary of which property is twelve miles from the Caribbean Sea. Two wells aro now being drilled on this property. Under the same contract the Stand? ard Oil Company of California also secures a 61 per cent interest in the Simiti tract, comprising some 750,000 acres, situated on the Magdalena River in Colombia. Under the terms of the contract with the Transcontinental the Standard of California agrees to pur? chase the $2,000,000 bonds, to "pay a substantial cash consideration," to take over the operation of the Latin-Amer? ica Petroleum Corporation and to start drilling on the Simiti tract, and to pay an additional sum of $1,000,000 out of the production of oil from these prop? erties. "In view of the extraordinary finan? cial conditions of our country," the letter to the stockholders says, "and the exceedingly high rates new capital commands, your management feels the company is exceptionally fortunate in disposing of approximately $7,000,000 of the proposed bond isue at par. "Looking forward to the return of normal business conditions the com? pany has been conservatively acquiring additional holdings in the states of Montana, Wyoming, Oklahoma, Arkan? sas, Louisiana and Texas and adding to and improving its refineries, gasoline plants, pipe lines and distributing sta? tions. While we have opened no new pools of substantial size nor completed any large wells, nevertheless a gradual gain is being shown in our crude oil production, and we are now drilling a number of wells throughout the states r.bove mentioned, on carefuly selected acreage, a large percentage of these wells being located in proven terri? tory." Crude Oil Costs Higher Increased Prices Will Bo Neces? sary, Says Haskel CHICAGO, Dec. 7.?Crude oil and its byproducts, including gasoline, will cost more in the future because of the difficulty in getting at the oil, Frank Haskel, president of the Tidal Oil Com? pany, told the American Petroleum In? stitute to-day. He said that the first paying wells drilled in the mid-continent fields were shallow, but that it was now necessary to go deeper, with a proportionate rise in the cost of drilling. He said there were 55.000 productive oil wells in Oklahoma, that nearly every state in Mexico contained oil, and there was much in untouched fields in South America.

Directors of the Porc Marquette Railway Company yesterday declared a dividend of 10 per cent on the 5 per cent preferred stock, the first since the reorganization in 1917. This pay? ment was in addition to the regular quarterly disbursement of l1,i per cent declared on the prior preference pre? ferred. A statement issued after the meet? ing pointed out that the dividends on the preferred have been cumulative since January 1, 1010, so that at the end of this year there will remain only 5 per cent of accrued dividends on this issue. The statement con? tinued: "The preferred steck of the railway company was issued under the reor? ganization of the P?re Marquette 1917, and represents bonds of the old company. Although the dividend upon the preferred stock has been earned by the present company in each year since the reorganization was effected no dividends have previously been paid thereon, as the directors have consid? ered it more prudent not to do so owing to conditions arising out of the war and the Federal control of rail? roads by the government. "The company's claim against the government recently has been settled, and the directors feel that the condi? tion of the company is now such as to permit the above distribution to be made to the holders of its preferred stock on account of the accumulated dividends to which said stockholders are entitled." Cased on earnings for the ten months, it is estimated that the com? pany will return a surplus at the end of the year equivalent to $40 a share on the preferred issue. > ... London Market Steady

The principal and interest of the bonds are to be unconditionally guaranteed by endorsement by the Union Pacific Railroad Company. "Excluding the approximately 291 miles above referred to, the Consolidated Mortgage is a direct mortgage on approximately 1,146 miles of road, as to which mileage (after payment of the First Mort? gage 6% Bonds of The Oregon Short Line Railway Company on February 1,- 1922), it will be a first mortgage on approximately 659 miles and a refunding mortgage subject to $6,591,000 prior lien bonds on approximately 487 miles, of which about 55 miles are also subject to a lease. The mileage on which these Bonds will be a first lien, as above stated, includes (with the exception of about 23 miles subject to prior liens) the entire main line of the Company forming the connection between the main line of the Union Pacific Railroad Company proper at Granger, Wyoming, and that of the Oregon-Washington Railroad & Navigation Company at Huntington, Oregon. "The total amount of bonds issuable under the Consolidated Mortgage is limited to $36,500,000, of which $28,752,000 will be outstanding after the issue of the $16,424,000 Guaranteed Bonds, the balanci being reserved to take up prior lien bonds. "The Union Pacific Railroad Co. owns all of the $100.000,000 of outstanding Capital Stock cf th?

For the ten months ended October 31, 1921, the net income from all sources was $24,878,519 over and above all charges. "The Consolidated First Mortgage 5#* Guaranteed Gold Bonds, which you have agreed to pur? chase, will mature on July 1, 1946, and will bear interest payable semi-annually oil January 1 and July 1, of each year. They will be issued as coupon bonds in denominations of $1,000 and $500 each, with the privilege of registration as to principal. Both principal and interest of the bonds will be payable in gold coin of the United States of America without deduction for any taxes which the Railroad Company may be required to pay or to retain therefrom by any present or future law of the United States or of any State or Territory thereof, excepting any Federal Income Tax, which tax. as provided in the suppl? mental indenture, will not be assumed by the Company. "The issuance of these bonds, their guaranty by Union Pacific Railroad Company and their salego you arc subject to the approval of the Interstate Commerce Commission and all legal proceedings in reit? tion thereto are. subject to the approval of your counsel. "Application will be made in due course to list the Bonds on the New York Stock Exchanf*. Pending the engraving of the definitive bonds, temporary certificates will be issued." HIE

Congress to Act On Tax Free Bonds Representative McFadden Re? quests Hearing by House Committee WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.?Strong pres? sure was brought to-day upon the House Ways and Means Committee for action along the lines recommended by Pi'esident Harding in the part of his address to Congress dealing with cutting off the issuance of any tax exempt security.
