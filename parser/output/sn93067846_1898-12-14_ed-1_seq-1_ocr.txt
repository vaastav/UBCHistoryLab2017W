MISSIONERS TAKE TO THEIR BEDS,. Paris, Dec. 7.-There was co joint session of the peace commissions to day as she Spaniards are stii! occupied io translating the Americans' answer to their proposals io regard to the status of Spanish subjects io annexed territories As cabled last evening, the eight principal articles of the treaty are settled and ail that remains for the commissioners to atteod to is the settle meat of the mioor points of thc treaty. The latter will probably be signed cn Saturday next, for the Spaniards are as anxious as the Americans co finish the work in hand. Secretary Ojedo of the Spanish commission said to-day : "It is very pain fal for us to remain here haggliog over details, sioce the main poi o ts have been settled and -xe. have beep obliged to relinquish our colonies. AH work will be finished this week. The commercial treaty between the United States and Spain will be negotiated upon the reestablish meet of diplomatic relations, and the question of Spanish ships sod products in Coba and Paerto Rico will be included therein." Paris, Dee, 8 -The United States and the Spanish peace commissioners concluded their work to day and finally settled the terms of the treaty of peace. They will meet one? more ic formal session, on Saturday or Monday next, whoo the Spanish commissioners, sor? rowfully, and the Americans, with a feeling of relief, will write their signatures upon the document which embodies the results of the war and the preparation of which bas consumed eleven weeks, a longer time than the war itself. In the meantime the treaty will be engrossed coder the supervision pf Mr Moore and Senor Ojedo. the secretaries of the respective com missions The Spaniards are exceedingly bit? ter over the result, though observing the forms of friendliness and ooortesy to the end. Senor Montero Rios, whose strong and persistent struggle to save for bis country every possible asset from, the wreck of ber colonial empire, has commanded the respect and ad mir stioo of his opponents, weot from the council chamber to-day to bis bed in s state of complete collapse as the result of the long strain and bis chagrin over the small fruits of bis efforts Senor Ojedo bas been prostrated since yesterday and was,unable to attend tbe joint: session to-day. Tbe Spaniards charged equal blame upon tbe European powers and tbe United States for their downfall One of the Spanish commissioners said this evening : "Tbe European natioos have made a great mistake io deserting Spain and leave ber to spoliation hy the conscienceless giant. Tbey all know that in the Philippines America has taken moro tbao she oan digest She will ultimately sell the islands to Eog land or Germany and when the trans fer is attempted it will precipitate genera! European strife "We have refused to sell any islaod in the Carolines, We never thought of considering am offer Nor have we consented to negotiate upon any que? tioo except those directly involved in the protocol signed at Washington. THE DAY'S SESSION Paris, Deo 8 -Tbe treaty is finish ed. Tbe Spaniards have declined to grant most of the requests of the United States which were unsettled ar the beginning of tbe session They refuge to cude a coaling Cation io the Caroline islands to the United States Judge Day to-day said : "We have settled ali the points on which we oan agree It only remains to engross aod sign a treaty That will be done in two or three days." The members of the commissions say tbe treaty will contain li rr ie outside the scope of 'he Waeb:f.gtoo protocol and the matters direony ba?ed tbereoo. like the prnvisioo for the ?vacua ion of tho ceded territories ?be transfer o' public property therein and guarantee* ot the safety of the property ??od rigbrs of the Spanish citizens remaining there. The details of the last class of questions -covered by the statement which the Americans handed te Senor Montero Bios at the last meeting were coosidered to day. bot all ?he commis? sioners refuse to divulge the details of the conference. Several points upon whioh they were unable to agree were left open for diplomatic negotiations. The Spaniards refuse to admit that they had failed to respect former treaties guaranteeing religious freedom in the Caroline islands or that there was a necessity for new guarantees The conclusion of the work was, according to the commissioners, marked by politeness and all outward evidences of good feeling a cd relief at the fact that the task was accomplished. Wheo all the propositions bad been disccssed. Judge Day, president of the American commission, remarked : "There seems to be nothing more to do bat to engross and sign the treaty " Senor Montero Rios, president of the Spanish commission, acquiesced to this and the Americans bowed themselves ont before the Spaniards, according to their custom The American commissioners entered the joint conference to-day. io a nervou* frame of mind They evidently bad reasoos to believe that a possibility existed, even at this late hour, that there might be a rapture. This feeling of apprehension was based on the temper the Spaniards have displayed lately. The Madrid papers ?re disposed to revive the question of the Maine and excite public opinion against the United States on account of the reference made to this subject to President McKinley's message to congress. They report that. Senor Montero Rios, president of the Spanish commission, made an impas? sioned denunciation of President Mc Kinley at the last joint meeting of the commissions Bot, these reports are practically without foundation Seoor Rio9 did refer to the Maine, but in only one calmly worded sentence, expressing regret that the president bad spoken, as Spaniards thought, unjustly of them. The Spaniards bad already proposed at this coo fere nee to have the responsibility of the Maine reported opon by a joint commission of t&e European powers The American commissioners refused to listen to this and permitted Senor Bios's refereoce to the president's message to go uueha3 lenged, as a discussion would have provoked debate and bad blood Diplomatic circles io Paris predio, a3 one of the results of the treaty, a dipiomio contest between France and the Unite^LSiates which may have an .importao'&.ffgfrter in history The French government is reported to have resolved to take up the case of the French holders in Coban bonds and it is believed that France will deolar> that the repudiation of the bonds is tt e results of the treaty which the victorious nation imposed opon Spain. They air gue that through the treaty, respoosi bi ? : ty bas been shifted upon America, and therefore the French government will endevor to exact some pledge for the payment or guarantee of the bond i Americans Parade in Cnba.

DEATH OF COL R. M. SIMS. Volunteered as a Private, Surrendered as a Colonel. The State, Dec. 10. Col. R. M. Sims died at bis resi? dence in Shandon yesterday after an illness of a fortnight For some time he bad been in declining health, bot he bravely battled against disease till the last Surrounded by his family and a few friends he entered tranquilly into rest. Robert Moorman Sims was born December 8th, 1836, and was reared in Lancaster county, and graduated at the Sooth Carolina Military academy in 1856. He had scarcely settled in business when the out break of the war gave the signal for him to rally in defense of his State He volunteered as private in Capt John D. Wylie's company of the Ninth South Carolina volunteer reg iment commanded by James D Blanding. It was not long before he was appointed adjutant and in Bpector general of Brattor.'e brigade, and in that capacity he saw hard fighting and bore his foll share of it. He was of that cool, unobtrusive j courage that stops not to think of! ostentation in the performance of j duty, but seems simply to ignore j danger After passing through sev eral desperate campaigns Col Sims rose by promotion to the adjutant generalcy of Longstreet's corps He was several tiroes wounded In the trenches aroarid Richmond he saw the corps gradually dwindling under the hammer strokes of overwhelming numbers, and it was his sad duty to bear the flag of truce at Appomatox that led to the capitulation of Lee's shattered columns This flag, a sim? ple towel, was borrowed by a Fed? eral officer on the field and was not returned It is now in the posses? sion of Mrs. General Custer, who preserves it as a precious souvenir j Returning home Col. Sims was i elected to the State senate by the j Democrats of Lancaster, at a time when the Legislature was over? whelmingly Republican Finding that he was powerless he refused to serve longer He was engaged in business in j Rock Hili when the year 1876 opened in the midst of a political storm. Whipper and Moses had been elected judges and Gov Chamberlain refused to issue them commissions In an incredibly short time the whole State quivered with excitement Mass meetings were held everywhere to declare stern resistance to this at? tempt at debauching the judiciary Ont of this turmoil arose the new born Democracy. Ail eyes in two j worlds were turned to South Caroli-1 na. The whole union was in such a state of political tension that it seem? ed as if our Palmetto State would again inaugurate a contest that would end io civil war Northern Demo? crats, especially Mr. 'Tilden, feared the hot temper of our people But Democratic policies were under pru j dent guidance The aggressive and conseivative element closed hands in compromise, and in August nomi nated an entire State ticket, repre ! sentative in character, composed of men of whom it could be truthfully said, they sought not the positions but the positions sought them On that ticket Coi R M Sims was nominated for secretary of State Col Sims served as secretary of Stale for three terms and voluntarily j declined reelection, although a re nomination was reasonably assured j During Cleveland's first adminis tration Col Sims was boarding officer of the port of Charleston Since then be has been in private life A skillful floriculturaliflt and arbor- j culturis*. Col JSims b*?gan the adorn j ment of the capital square Col Sims was a brave man, an honest man, a true man and a Chris tian. Duty with bim was love, he never shirked it When in the storm of battle, the vicissitudes of politics, or the trial? and temptations of pri vate life, hie pleasant, genial unaffected manners made him friends everywhere In bim passes away ' another of the Old Guard--valiant1 io arms, patient and courteous in I peace. Col Sims was first mar-ied to ! Miss Catharine C Lucky of Mecklen ! burg, N C , who bore him two sons j and died in 1867 In 1869 he mar j ried Miss Ada Sims, of Co umbia, j who with several children sui vive him TICKET SCALPERS ARE IN TROUBLE.
