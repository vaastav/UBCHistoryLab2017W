As a result ofran unquenchaltle de Flro to possess jewelry, and a handi teas in drawing checks, when he had no money In the bank, Pete Maxwell, a ten day man, la now occupying a cell in the branch county all, .due entirely to tho prompt attention given to the matter by Consable Jack White. On Friday afternoon Maxwell enter ed the Keenhold Jewelry store, which occupies the small space in front of the poKtofflco, and asked to see some watches. Ho was shown several and finally turned all his attention to a D. W. Raymond 19-iewel watch which had been displayed. He then left the store, telling the clerk that he would return the following day. True to his statement Maxwell' re turned to tho Jewelry store at- 11 o'clock yesterday morning, and .pre sented a feferenco bearing the signature- of ThoB. Foster, a shift boss at the Lowell shaft. The reference stat ed that tho bearor was a good, honest hard working man, and was addressed to .anyone It might concern. On the strength of the recommendation Max? well was allowed to take the watch, -and also a chain, and stated that he would return last evening and pay the purchase price of $42 for the jewelry- Again, truo to his promise. Max well returned last evening at 7:30, and presented a check for $100, drawn on the Miners and Merchants bank in favor of cash .and signed Pete Max well. The clerk had made a depotlt in the bank In tho afternoon, and did not havo enough money on hand to cash tho check, but 'Maxwell told him to deduct $42 in payment of his ac count, give him $25 in cash, and keep the remainder until Monday morning. After Maxwell left the store tho clerk became suspicious, and seeing Constable White showed him tho check and asked his advice, which was to the effect that the check did not look good under the circum stances. White immediately got in connection with the bank, and .found that Maxwell had. no account. He then went to the pawnshops, but coulJ find no trace of his man, so he started & search among thersaloons, and final ly went to the Tenderloin district, where he- found Maxwell, and asked concerning' the watch'. Maxwell said the watch was at his house, so the offl w took- him at once to his room on Chihuahua HilL At. the house an other man was found,, who stated that there was no watch there, but that Maxwell had pawned s watch thai afternoon and had the ticket.

" If the Attorney General Can Prove Allegations, Bailey WS Resign and Quit Public Lift-Forever. DAXJLASj Tvxt,, Dec S, I-ite, to- mgbt'-United- Bsxe Senator Joseph, VT. Bailey gave out, an open letter to Attorney uener&l tmrtason In answer to ajetter which the Attorney General Issued last night setting out copies of papers of the Waters-Peirce Oil com pany, i. -k j, j ., v Senator Bailey says that the attor ney general has eliminated "very much from the discussion by confirming what I said In my previous open let ter." f The documents, he says, do not sup port the Inference which tho attorney general previously made; Indeed, he says, the voucher for $3,300 and nota tions upon it how conclusively that this sum was loaned to him by H. C. Pierce, and not by tho Waters-Pierce Oil company, and bills receivable upon it shows that Pierce torrctrcd money upon it from the Oil company, and that it was not treated as an item ol expense. As to the voucher purporting to show that the Oil company had paid $1,500 to Henry & Stribbling, and the memorandum that it had been paid upon draft of Senator Bailey, he says that if he had ever drawn such a draft it must have passed through at least two banks, leaving a record behind. He suggeests that the attorney gene ascertain if there was such a transac tion. "Now, sir, if you can prove by any single bank that I ever drew a draft in favor of Henry & Stribbling, or either of them, upon the Waters-Pierce OH company or H. C. Pierce, or J. D. Johnson, or any other individual, firm or corporation, for $1500, or any other sum, I will resign my seat in the sen ate and retire forever from pubtc life," declared Senator Bailey. "I will go further than this. If yon can produce any order, receipt or mem orandum In favor of Henry & Strib bling, or either of them, bearing my signature, endorsement or approval, I will resign my seat in the senate and retire, from public life forever." He declares that ho never heard of any'loan to Henry & Stribbling by tho Oil company. Pierce or Johnson, and that the telegram published by the at torney general was nover mentioned to him. Quoting the vouchor purporting to show a lean of $1,7C0 to him by H. C Pierce, and the letter of Pierce re questing the Standard OH company to send Bailey exchange for the amount. Senator Bailey draws attention to what he terms a curious feature of the letter, namely, the statement that the writer (Pierce) had advanced the amount to Bailey, but that Bailey had repaid it, followed by a request that exchange should be sent to Bailey for the amount and that same should be charged upon the books of the compa ny. Bailey says this statement Is preposterous. He declared that he only got money once, and yet the pur ported letter would, show that he h.d received it twice. Senator Bailey declares that the at torney general has failed to produce a shred of evidence that ho assisted in returning the Waters-Pierce Oil com pany to the state, or that he had act ed as attorney for or received com pensation from it. He declares that he had represented Pierce publicly in many matters. "Nothing in your much heralded documents some of them stolen, some of them forged and still others rrrefevact, confused and confusing disproves anything I have said." He continues: "They only tend to show that I have had business rela tions with H. C. Pierce, a fact that I frequently myself asserted, and that I had borrowed money from htm, which money I repaid to the last dollar. "I believed when I asked for per mlnBlon to examine the papers that they had Mn forged, in whole, or in part, an: smc. reading the lucu ments in print I am certain that some of them are forgeries." He says the attorney general must have known that the .man from whom he received the papers ht.l stolea them from the files of Jtis employer, and he should have known thai a thief would not hesitate to commit forge.?; "I willingly leave it to tha decent and fair-minded men of Tex.i to say how much weight they will r.tUch tt the documents famished by a man who either robbed the files of his em ployer's office, or forge J pa-s, which you are using, on J .evidence of whose false swearing cat not deceive the officers of the sta'j," Serfato Bailey concluded.

BONAPARTE SCENTS The Seem' the Navy Says "Cwcmwtiwxt- Have Changed," an mitt War Ships The StatementkSifWficajit In View or tfteHUin in Cali fornia Over e Japanese Question. ' WASHDlTOX?,DKrC., Dec S. The annnaJ.resartof. Secretary of the Navy Bonasarte-haaabeen submitted. His- rfirtiKon the subject of increase- in.the? navy, in view of the present talk of a Japanese war, are significant and are as follows: "In my last annual report I staUtl that ''tho aggregate of our battleships, armored cruisers, and coast-defense vessels, built, or authorized, wqtiiit seem, according to present indications, sufficient to. provide for any contin gencies within the limits ot probabili ty.' When this statement was made the facts teemed to Justify an assump tion, at least tentatively, that th& for eign navies with which It is material to compare our own had, in general, reached the Hmlta of its extension im mediately contemplated, and there ap peared to some persons a fair pros pect that some reduction of naval ar maments or, at all events, some limita tion to their indefinite increase, might rosult from "the contemplated "Hague conference. "Without sharing tne last mentioned expectation, I yet deemed that I could then safely speak as I did; but, with out going into detailed explanations, which are needless and might be ob jectionable. It is my duty now to re port to you and to the1 congress that, iri' my Judgment, circumstances have so far changed as to make provision for a moderate increase In the effect ive fighting strength of our navy tho part of patriotic foresight at present, I recommend, therefore, that, as soon as may Ve" practicable at this session, the congress authorize the construc tion of a sister ship to the one already authorized and of which the plans are now submitted; so that, by simply duplicating these plans and the furth er detailed specifications and draw- v Ings by which they are to bo supple mented, we "can have two vessels ot this class completed within tho time which would otherwise be needed foe tho construction of only one." Closing the" report the secretary1 says: "I think It is but right to call atten tion to certain features of our coun try's situation, which, although suffi ciently obvious and of self-evident im portance, nevertheless appear to bo frequently overlooked. Although a continental power, for practical pur poses wo. 6hare with Great Britain tho immense advantages of insular posi tion. Provided our naval strcngtu be sufficient to retain command of tho sea. we are absolutely safe from in vasion, and consequently escapo the. burdens of a vast military establish ment which bear upon all the great powers of the European contlnentr but ,lf we have not a sufficient navy the oceans to the east and west of us. Instead of serving as bulwarks ot defense, become highways for Inva sion. Tho extensive steam merchant marines which serve the commerce of the world are no less available to transport men and munitions of war and they place our shores within a week's, or at least a fortnight's march of a powerful army from any one of the great military countries, of the world, a danger rendered far more serious by thf fact that an enemy com ing byater is restricted"" to no line ot advance ascertainable beforehand. and may choose for aggTessIcn anv polnt of our coast line which sccmt moat vulnerable. Under these circum stances, unless wo are willing to main tain a strong standing a rray,tho. main tenance of our naval strength 13 a matter of supreme moment to the na tional safety, and I am convinced that an enllghtoned and patriotic opinion will assent gladly to any reasonablo acrifices necessary to assure such safety. The pecuniary burden imposed nn neh Inhabitant of the United states for the maintenance of tho navy may bo roughtly estimated, but with a fair approximation to accura cy, at one-third of that bornp by each inhabitant of Great Britain and Ire land aivf the burden of personal ser vice to the like end at about one- sev enth. Expressed In figures we may say that tbe- cost of the navy amounts to about $1.33 per annum for each in habitant of the United States and that about six men out of every ten thous and lshabitants are at present bound by law to naval service Surely such burdens as these, or even some ver sllght increase of these burdens, will be accepted without reluctance or murmur by the patriotism and good sense ot the American people."
