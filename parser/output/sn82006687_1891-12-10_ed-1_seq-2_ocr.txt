Read the proceeding* of the tax payer*’ meeting published in our local columns and give them all the aid in your power that they may accomplish some good. The Baltimore Herald, of the Bth instant, says that “the President’s message will not be delivered to Congress until to-morrow. As it is said to be some ten thousand words long, Mr. Harrison evidently does not believe that brevity is the i soul of wit.” The opening proceedings of the Fifty-second Congress were witness ed in both houses by large crowds 1 of spectators. Vice-President Mor ton welcomed the Senators, after which the newly-elected members of that body, including Mr. Brice, of Ohio, were sworn in. Only four Senators were absent. In the House, Clerk McPherson called the roll and announced the presence of 320 members. Thereupon, the House, on motion of Mr. Holman, adjourn ed to meet at noon Tuesday. On the 7th instant, the contest in the Democratic caucus over the Speakership of the House of Repre sentatives was ended on the thirtieth ballot by the choice of Hon. Charles F. Crisp, of Georgia. The vote tood Crisp, 119; Mills, 105; Spring er, 4; Stevens, 1. The caucus nom inated the other House officers as follows: Clerk, James Kerr, of Clearfield, Pa.; sergeant-at-arms, cx-Congress man Samuel S. Yoder, of Lima, Ohio; doorkeeper, cx-Congressmau Charles H. Turner, of New York city; postmaster Lycurgus Dalton, of Indiana. The choice of Judge Crisp is regarded as a wise one and it is believed that he will honor the Speaker’s chair. Mr. Crisp was such a true tariff reformer as to vote against his most intimate per sonal friend, the late Samuel J. Randall, for Sja-aker and in his speech before the caucus after his nomination he declared that “he would take no step backward in tariff reform.
