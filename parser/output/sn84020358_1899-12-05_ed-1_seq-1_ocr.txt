After having been read bv Assistant City Clerk Martin the report of the board of finance was received on motion of Alderman Chillingworth. Alderman Hall said that he thought the members were unprepared to discuss it fully. He moved that the estimates should be separated and referred to varlqus joint standing committees to consider and report back recommendations within one week. Alderman Chillingworth seconded. Alderman Cooley did not see how that would help matters. Some portions of the estimates might be re ferred to regular committees, but he thought that nothing would be accom plished by dividing up the report. He moved an amendment to have the es timates referred to a special commit tee to consist of two aldermen and three councllmen. to hold public hear ings and report back within one week. Alderman Baldwin seconded the amendment. Alderman Chillingworth eaid that he thought the estimates should have a fair hearing and he moved that the chairman of the joint standing com mittee be appointed a committee to consider the estimates. He asked Mr. Cooley to accept the amendment; Al derman C. F. Brennan seconded. Mr. Cooley thought that the commit tee contemplated In Mr. Chillingworth's amendment would be too large. He did not care if the committee consisted of three aldermen and five councilman, but thought that the committee should not be so large as it would be if com posed of the chairman of the joint standing committee. He insisted upon his amendment. Mr. Chillingworth said that last year the committee to which the estimates were referred was not large enough, He thought that no members were so com petent to pass uron certain appropria tions as the chairman of the committee to which matters relating to those ap propriations were referred. The amendment to the amendment was carried by a vote of 15 to 6, and the original motion as amended by Al derman Chillingworth was adopted. The estimates were then transmitted to the board of councllmen. . Alderman Chillingworth offered the following resolutions which on his mo tion was referred to the uorporatlon counsel: Whereas, the amended charter of the city of New Haven provides in Sec tion 44 (last paragraph) as follows: "The board of finance, upon the rec ommendation of the court of common council, shall have the power to make appropriations for public receptions parades, concerts, and celebrations to an amount not exceeding fifteen hun dred dollars, for any one of said pur poses In any one year. No amount ap propriated for any one purpose, wheih er general or special, shall be used or appropriated for any other purpose ex cept the same be authorized by the board of finance." And whereas, there is doubt as to the true intent and meaning of the foregoing, And wheras, if the board of finance has the power to authorize the trans fer and to authorize the expenditure of the funds transferred for a purpose not contemplated in the original appro priation, and without the consent of the court of common council, it ie a mere form ad practically of no ffect for the court of common council to approve or disapprove of the recom mendations of the board of finance making appropriations for the ensuing yeaf, And whereas, if the board of finance can transfer a part of the appropria tions they can also transfer the entire appropriations and thus defeat the ob ject of the election by the people of the members of the court of common council to transact their business for them and to pass orders for public im provements upon petitions after public hearings and reports made thereon. Therefore be it Resolved, That the honorable corpor ation counsel of the city of New Haven as such be, and he hereby Is, requested and directed, for the information of the court of common council and its gov ernment, to answer the following ques tions: 1. Under this section who can be au thorized by the board of finance to ap propriate or use moneys for purposes other than those for which they were originally appropriated? (Enumerate the several persons, committee, legisla tive bodies, etc., if tbey have the pow er.) 2. If an appropriation Is made for a general or a special purpose, and the board of finance should authorize the whole or a part of said appropriation to be used for another purpose, what leg islation, if any, is necessary to legally transfer and authorize the expenditure of an appropriation, or any part there of? The recommendation of the special i committee on t he general registrars' bills, that the bills be paid, was adopted with no dissenting votes. A petition for the return of taxes to the Essex Savings bank $1,219 was presented by the attorneys for that bank. The petition was- not signed by any member of the common council, and Alderman Donovan raised the point that it could not, therefore, be properly considered. The chair ruled the point well taken. Alderman Baldwin then volunteered to sign the paper, it was then accepted and it was referred to the corporation counsel for an opinion as to the legality of the claim.

A fire, the most disastrous which has visited this town, occurred here to-day. A dozen business firms lose everything and a number of families are rendered home less. The entire loss will probably reach $150,000. Assistance was asked for from Worcester and other places and quick responses were made and it was due to this that the entire business portion of the place escaped destruc tion. An extremely high wind was blowing from the west and spark's were carried great distances, setting many j-csidences afire, among them Dr. Park hurst's of New York. The fire started by the overturning of a lantern In the boiler room of the theater building. The numerous occupants of the block lose everything and there is but little inj surance.

FOR A PURE GOLD STANDARD TEXT OF THE SEyATE COMMITTEE'S CURUEXCY BILL EityK AA'i) o'jiniEy :nitA w. Liability of Employer to Employe. Washington, Dec. 4. The United States supreme court to-day reversed itself to an extent in pasBing upon the liability of an employer for damage to an employe. The case under considera tion to-day was that of the New Eng land Railroad company vs. Conroy, and in the case the court held that a con ductor of a freight train "could not be held to be a vice-principal within any safe definition of that relation." SE1ILED OUT OF COURT. Milt of illldriletown Physician Agnlnet Conaolldnted Inr 10,000. Middletown, Dec. 4. It was learned to-night that the suit for damages that Dr. Leonard Bailey had instituted against the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad company and which was to be heard in the superior court at Springfield, Mass., had been settled out of court. Dr. Bailey was struck by a train on the Valley division road at the Union street crossing on the night of November 25, 1898. His horse was killed and Dr. Bailey had his arm broken and he was otherwise badly In jured. He claimed negligence on the part of the railroad and brought suit for $10,000 damages. The case was brought in Massachusetts so that the railroad company could not default. Dr. Bailey would not state the amount of the damages he received, but the im pression is that it is In the neighborhood of $2,500. ' Hard Fight Dnth Men Damaged Fcleifce Agnliint Strength. New York, Dec. 4. Frank Erne of Buffalo and Jack O'Brien of New York fought twenty-five rounds at the light weight limit 133 pounds at the Coney Island Sporting club to-night, and at the end of it all George Slier of Chicago declared the bout a draw. This decision was fair and just. O'Brien did a lot of forcing and fighting, but Erne's work was cleaner and more scientific. O'Brien's blows fell with a force that was not behind Erne's. It was the old case of a clean boxer against a hurri cane fighter. Of the two O'Brien's face bore the worst marks. Both men were badly damaged. Erne's left eye was smashed, but this will not hurt him half as much as the punishment he re ceived In the body. O'Brien Invariably got in pile-driving blows on the stom ach, ribs and kidneys, which left red welts on Erne's body. O'Brien's fierce assaults made him many friends. He was an even-money favorite about the fifteenth round, while before the fight began 100 to 75 was laid against him. O'Brien scored three knock-downs, wh(le none was decided against himself. Both men were in fine shape, but it is just possible that Erne was drawn a bit fine in order to get down to the limit. The big club house was barely three fourths filled to-night.

The Liberty of Niw York Una Factory ' tti lirltlgeporf. New York, Dec. 4. The Liberty Cycle company of No, 4 Warren street made an assignment to-day for the benefit of creditors. The assignee was Frank Leonard, jr., a lawyer fo No. 45 Wil liam street. The firm refused to dis cuss its business further than to say: "The company could not get material in time. It has only about $2,500 mer chandise liabilities. There are, no notes out to merchandise creditors. It was thought better to stop than create new liabilities." The company has offices at No. 9 Park Square, Boston; 183 Fair field avenue, Bridgeport, Conn.; 82 Wa bash avenue, Chicago, and a factory at Bridgeport.
