A GIG SffilKf FEAREU Arrest of Noted Labor Leader at St. Petersburg BAISED A GREAT STORM INDICATIONS FATEFUL REACTION IN RUSSIA HAS COME. Newspapers to Defy t he Temporary Press Law?Situation in Livo nia Frightful. ST. PETERSBURG, Sunday, December 10 (morning), via Eydtkuhnen, East Prus sia, December 11.?There Is every indica tion this morning tliat the government's challenge will be accepted tnd that within forty-eight hours a general strike through out Russia will be ordered. A terrible ?torm has been raised t>y the arrest of M. Krustaleff, president of the executive cr.mmlttee of the workmen's council, which ?was followed during the night by the im prisonment of the members of the work men's council and a number of soclalistio lenders. "The reaction has come," were the words on every lip and in the liberal extremist canvp there was only one opinion, namely, that it must be resisted to the bitter end. At all the meetings last night, some of which lasted until morning, the opinion was unanimous that the government had forced the hands of the proletariat and that the ?upreme weapon, a general strike, must be Invoked. The newspaper editors at yesterday even ing's meeting decided that the temporary press law forbidding the discussion of vital questions affecting the welfare of the na tion violated the principles of freedom of speech and of the press guaranteed by the imperial manifesto and that it must be de fled. The result was that the editions of the Ruv and half a dozen more radical papers were confiscated. The employes of the Riga-Orel railroad have declared a strike on account of the declaration of martial law in Livonia and have sent an appeal to the other roads to Join. Last night the railroad men of the Baltic lines decided to follow the exam ple of the Riga-Orel men. Anarchy in Livonia. The situation in Livonia is frightful. Absolute anarchy prevails. A messenger who arrived here this morning declared that the streets of Riga were flowing with blood. After a meeting the railroad men of Riga were mowed down by the lire of machine guns and artillery. The railroad men of St. Petersburg, at a meeting yesterday evening, resolved that Inasmuch "as the reaction is gaining force and the government is seeking to retract what was won by the tirst pan Russian strike," the railroad men stand ready to obey the signal for a general strike, but advise their fellow workers to await the word from the ctentral commit tee at Moscow, as a failure must not b? risked. Wholesale Arrests at Moscow. Simultaneously with the arrests here M. Dronshilny and all the members of the union of the employes of the posts and telegraph operators of Moscow, with M. Kokhanowski at their head, were arrested at Moscow. Interior Minister I>urnovo today Issued an official proclamation not only notifying all the post and telegraph employes that their failure to return to work tomorrow will be equivalent to their discharge, but that all those who agitate for a continuance of the strike or are guilty of cutting or otherwise destroying wires and apparatus "will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.

STORM-BOUND SHIPS OFF. .Aragon and Barge Still Ashore on Carolina Coast. NORFOLK, Va.. December 11.?With clearing weather and favorable winds a large number of sailing vessels which had been storm-bound In Hampton Roads put to sea today. The steamer Aragon and the barge Ooddard, which stranded Saturday on the North Carolina coast, are still ashore.

Secret Service Agent Otienln aup officers fro mthe central police station, it is believed that one of the smoothest gangs of counterfeiters that has operated on the Pacific coast for years was broken up. With the prisoners a quantity of para phernalia and sufficient evidence is said to be possessed by the officers to permit of a prosecution of the charge. The men are alleged to have been operat ing in Los Angeles. San Francisco, Oak land and a number of California cities for several months past, flooding the coast with bogus bills. They have been under surveii ance for some time. The raisin* of $3 bills to the denomina tion of tS and |10 la said to have been the principal occupation of the counter jiiiHfc Few in Those of Important Chairmanships. TAWNEY - BARTHOLDT WERE REALLY THE ONLY TWO; THE FORMER PREDICTED. Mr. McCleary Satisfied With His Transfer to the Ways and Means Body. The make-up of the House committees shows very few changes In the chairman ship of important committees. In fact there are only two among-, the most coveted chair manships, appropriations and public build ings and grounds. Mr. Tawney gets the former, as was forecasted In The Star last summer, and Mr. Bartholdt of Missouri falls heir to the latter in regular order ot succession. The nomination of Mr. Tawney to the head of appropriations was accomplished James A. Tawney, Chairman Appropriations Committee, by the transfer of Mr. MeCleury to ways and means, a change which Speaker Can non desired on account of Mr. McCieary's exceptional fitness as an economist and hie pronounced high protection views. Mr. McCleary was placed high on the list of ways and means, coming Immediately after the oldest men In service on the committee, fayne, Dalzell and Grosvenor, Mr. McCleary Satisfied. "I am entirely satisfied with the arrange ment," said Mr. McCleary this afternoon. "I am very much more interested In the wise solution of great national problems than in the details of appropriationa. At the same time, my six years of experience on the committee on appropriations will en able me to keep an inteiligvnt watch on public expenditures. "Ever since the battle for the gold stand ard was fought and won I have been desir ous of becoming a member of the com mittee on ways and means, which frames all tariff bills and other revenue legisla tion, and which can therefore so greatly affect for weal or wOe all "the people of the country. But Mr. Tawney was on that committee, and. of course, I would not al low myself to antagonize him in his com mittee assignments. Now my way Is clear. And at this time, when the fundamental principles of wise tariff legislation seem to require clear and vigorous restatement and unflinching application, X am convinced Richard Bartholdt, Chairman Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds. that Speaker Cannon is right In urging that a duty to the country much higher and more important than that possible even as chairman of the committee on appropria tions calls me to the committee on ways and means. And where my duty lies, there I go cheeerfuily. "On the ways and means committee I shall have better opportunity than ever to help protect the Interests of the entire country, and especially those of the farm ers of the central part of the continent, whose interests seem to be at this time the special objects of attack by certain power ful elements in Boston, Montreal and else where. "X am glad that the chairmanship of the appropriations committee cornea to Minne sota. Mr. Tawney is an intelligent and in dustrious man. Wfrdle he has had no ex Serlence in framing appropriation bills, and as practically everything to learn in that line, I hope that In due time he will master the difficulties and perform the duties ot the position with honor to himself, credit to the state and profit to the country." Mr. MoCleay retains -the chairmanship or the library committee. Other ChtairmR&ship Changes. Other chairmanship changes were as fol lows: Pacific railways, Thomas 8. Butler of Pennsylvania, vice W. A. Smith, trans ferred to membership on ways and means; levees and improvements of Mississippi rirer, George W. Prince of Illinois, vice Bartholdt, to public buildings and grounds; claims, James If.

Foster as chairman, and the membership of many committees was Increased. CONDITION OF THE CROPS. Reports of Correspondents to the Agri cultural Department. The crop reporting board of the bureau of statistics of the Department of Agriculture finds, from the reports of the correspond ents and agents of the bureau, as follows: The newly seeded area of winter wheat Is estimated at 81,341,000 acres, an increase of 0.0 per cent over the area sown In the fall of lt>04.

The final estimates of the total acreage, production and farm values of the princi pal crops for 1905 will be Issued on Decem ber 20 at 4 o'clock p.m. TO RAISE BRONZE TABLET. Lincoln'a Gettysburg Address to Be Perpetuated in Metal. Secretary Taft returned to Washington this morning from Gettysburg, Pa., where he went to select a site for the location of the bronze tablet ordered to be erected there by Congress to perpetuate the famous memorial address delivered on that battle field by President Lincoln in July, 1884. The secretary was accompanied by Gen. 3. R. Brooke, U. S. A., retired Judge Advo cate General George B. Davis, Col. Nichol son of the Gettysburg Park commission and Representative DeArmond of Missouri. It is expected that Secretary Taft will announce his action in a few days. The tablet cannot be erected on the spot where the martyred President stood on that me morable occasion for the reason that It is already occupied by a monument to some of the soldiers who fell in the battle. 

AFFAIRS OF VENEZUELA. It is Expected That the President Will Send a Message to Congress. It Is expected that the President will make the recent diplomatic correspond ence with the government of Venezuela in regard to the disputed claim of the New York & Bermudez Asphalt Co. against the Venezuelan government the subject of a special message to Congress. This Is given as a plausible explanation of the reason for the omission of any reference to the controversy by President Roosevelt in his regular message to Congress. Another reason given for the delay In submitting this matter to the legislative branch is that the President is awaiting the detailed report of Mr. Calhoun, the special commissioner sent to Venezuela to make a thorough personal investigation of the matters in dispute 'between the United States and President Castro's government. So far as can be learned the case has long since passed the acute stage, and is now in a fair way of settlement. If, indeed, that result has not already been attained. Respecting the more serious differences between the governments of France and Venezuela, it is stated on good authority that President Roosevelt has received positive assurances from the French government that the movement of its warships near the Venezuelan coast does not contemplate any infringe ment of the spirit of the Monroe doc trine. It is on aocount of the assur ance -that France has no intention of seiz ing Venezuelan territory, that the United States has tacitly acquiesced in the pro posed French naval demonstration in Vene zuelan waters. The exact policy of France in this matter has not been disclosed. The future movements of the fleet which has been anchored at Martinque for several weeks will be closely watched, however, by the United States, and also by the European powers interested in the financial welfare of Venezuela.

ROME, December 11.?The pope today held a secret consistory, which was the sec ond of Ms pontificate, In which he created j new cardinals, and apparently showed a tendency to have a better equilibrium be tween the foreign and Italian elements in the sacred college, as three of the four new cardinals are foreigners. The cere mony was performed with the usual pomp Nearlv thirty cardinals were present. The pontiff appeared walking and preceded, surrounded ajid followed by the gorgeous pontifical court. Then all withdrew ex cept the members of the sacred college and the pope read his allocution. In it he said he wished he could give the -cardinals pleasant and consoling news, but the con- ] dltlons at the present time do not PeranU of consolation. Although, he continued, the Catholic faith 1s spreading more and more throughout the world, especially in dissi dent countries, on turning toward Catho lic nations one feels sadness and fear lest the prediction of the Scriptures Is being verified, that the kingdom of the Lord will be removed to other people, where it will produce good fruit.

ANGELES. Cal.. December 11.?A se vere desert wind storm that In localities approached the magnitude of a hurricane, visited southern California yesterday. Re ports from various sections around Los Angeles tell of a gale lasting almost throughout the day and In places doing considerable damage. The chief l^ury was to the orange and olive crops.

Declared He Carried No Life Policies? Officials of the Company Shared Commissions. NEW YORK, December 11.?An Investi gation of the affairs of the Home Life In surance Company of New York was taken up by the legislative Insurance investigat ing committee today. The first witness called was George E. Ide, president of that company. Personally he carried no life insurance, he said, but he thought some of the otticialg of his company may have received commis sions on their own policies. He was asked by Charles E. Hughes, counsel for the com mittee, to furnish a list of them. Mr. Ide said his company is paying a pen. sion of $1,000 a year to a clerk who was employed since the foundation of the com pany, and is now unable to work. Mr. Ide described the financial operation of his company, and said it makes Invest ments in stocks and bonds through one firm of brokers, and pays them the regu lar commission of one-eighth of 1 per cent. The surplus of his company has been held at about $1,125,000 for twenty years, because he regards that as sufficient and he felt that policj-holders ar? entitled to the accumulations on their policies. Mr. Hughes said all hut 11 per cent of the company's business is on deferred div idend policies. Mr. Ide said the dividends are paid annually to policies so stipulating, but on others the accumulations are ap portioned to each policy each year. The present amount of that accumulation is $1,290,000. A policy holder wlno requests it is told what amount of dividends Is credited to his policy each year. Mr. Ide described in de tail liis company's method of finding and crediting these dividends. An Annual Expose. Mr. Ide said this practice of making an annual statement 1s "an annual expose" of the conduct of the company's business, and Is embarrassing to him. Assemblyman Cox by questions elicited from Mr. Ide that this is a salutary check on the payment of the high commissions for new business, and makes it difficult to secure new business as compared to other companies which do not make this annual expose. Mr. Hughes read and questioned the wit ness about a circular which Mr. Ide had Issued recently in wfhich he said the de ferred dividends plan causes the accumu lation of a Wg surplus wWch, in luis opin oin, leads to a lax cind extravagant condi tion of business because the company is not compelled to account to the policy holder until bis policy matures. Mr. Ide said his company hss met that condition by making Its annual accounting to the policy holders. 

WINTER DRILLS OF WARSHIPS. Display of the North Atlantic Fleet to Be Imposing. Special Dispatch to The Star. PORTSMOUTH, Va., December 11.?The winter drills of the North Atlantic fleet ?will be this year the most Interesting and the display of naval strength the most Im posing that has ever before been possible with the American navy. The battleships Iowa and Kentucky, now undergoing repairs at the navy yard in this city will jendeavous in Hampton Roads on the 6th of January, with the most magnifi cent fleet ever assembled under the Ameri can flag. There will be two battleship squadrons, a flotilla of destroyers and an other division which for lack of ships has never before appeared In the evolutions. Heretofore the only armored cruisers we have had in commission have been the New York and Brooklyn, and on account of their comfort and speed they have usually been assigned to the various squadrons as flag ships. Now, at last, however, there is a distinct squadron of armored cruisers, un der command of Rear Admiral Brownson, the officer who won fame at Rio de Ja neiro with the little Detroit. The plans now contemplate an elaborate series of drills at sea, which will continue from the time the fleet departs from Hamp ton Roads, after an Inspection here by the Secretary of the Navy and Admiral Dewey, to the time it starts north from the Car ibbean in the spring. Every vessel of the powerful fleet Is be ing put in first-class trim at the various navy yards, and when Admiral Dewey takes command in the south he will have under him an invincible fighting force of twelve armored ships of battleship and cruiser class, and with the addition of the destroy ers and the cruisers, a fleet numerically stronger than the entire American navy at the outbreak of the Spanish-American war. The rendezvous of the fleet In Hampton Roads will of itself be one of the most Im posing naval spectacles of modern times, and this* will be the only opportunity afford ed the people of this country to see their navy assembled In full force. Therefore It is believed that there will be many visitors here in January. FIRMS DRIVEN TO CANADA Alleged Alarming Conditions From Tariff Restrictions. CHICAGO, December 11.?Some alarming conditions which are rapidly driving large manufacturing interests from the United States to Canada are to be considered with in a few days by the Illinois Manufacturers' Association. Reports just gathered show that 132 of the leading concerns of the country have been obliged, chiefly on account of tariff restrictions, to establish branch plants in j Canada. Fifteeen of these industries have j headquarters in Chicago. The resulting loss financially Is estimated at upward of $60,000,000, of which .amount Chicago Is represented in the statistics to have.suffered a large proportion. The agita tion "which the Illinois Manufacturers are about to start is expected to assume a form shortly of a national appeal to Congress. The remedy most in favor locally and throughout the country provides for reci procity legislation which will permit of the freer exchange of American and Canadian manufactured products. It is likely that Congress will be asked during the present session to take some steps in this direction. No Army Officer Named Swain. It is said at the War Department that there is no officer in the army active or re tired named Hugh N. Swain. A man of that name, according to press reports, was acquitted of the charge of murder at Hous i ton. Tex., yesterday.

MESSAGE BY WIRELESS U. S. GUNBOAT HIST SENT TO THQ RESCUE. Leak in Ship Apparently Just Abovft the Fire Room Plates?Pumps Kept Busy. jjv NEWPORT, R. I., December U.?A ha!fW finished message, sent Just before the bate teries are supposed to have become ex* liausted. cams here by wireless from tij* Nantucket lightship early today, asking fnf "help from anywhere." Ths message ?a| timed 2 a.m. and was as follows: "Nantucket 6hoals lightship in disres^ Send help from anywhere " Here the message broke off, Th? tTnlte<l States gunboat Hist left her< for the lightship at fl a.m. today. The wind is west northwest and modere ate. The sea is subsiding. As the lightship's design includes water# tight compartments, intended to sav.? net in Just such stres.s as she is now In. thf lighthouse officials declare that there wHl be little difficulty on the part of her ereif It* keeping her afloat until aid can n-ac# her. The lighthouse tender Azalea, whlcij left New Bedford at 7:.'!<> o'clock last nightV should reach the vicinity of the llgMshlg during this forenoon. When wireless messages were received at the naval torpedo station here yest^-rdaf from the lightship reporting that she had sprung a leak and that the water waa steadily gaining, the officials prepared t0? send help. The gunboat Hist was ordered to proceed to the scene, but as she wa# about to start a defect ill her steering geu was discovered, which made It nectssar# for her to have repairs made Immediately Word then was sent to New Bedford, where the lighthouse tender Azalea was 1W ir.g, and that vessel was dispatched o til# lightship. Gunboat Off for Rescue. Early today the steerlug gear of th?i Illaf again was in proper shape and at 0 o'cloojj she left the naval training station undef orders to make the best possible speed td the lightship. The distance she will have to cover Ul about ninety-seven miles. The leak in the lightship's hull, while not definitely located, according to the latest messages, was apparently Just above ibm flre room plates. So rapidly did the water come In, although the pumps were kenfc constantly at work, that late yesterday ail* ernoon the flre room was flooded and thf fires had been extinguished. Wireless com munlcatlon then ceased, and tt was suj posed that nothting further would be hear directly from the vessel, as the dynamo probably had given out. Early today* ho " ever, came the brier, apparently unflnlsh message, again asking for aid. This time 1 is thought the wireless system must, hav* become completely crippled. The wind shifted to northwest late yester* day, and this had the effect of causing lh* great seas to moderate sensibly, so that iestt anxiety was felt here this forenoon for tM lightship's safety. . On board the lightship are Capt. Jorgea* son of Dennis, Mass., commanding; two glneers, three naval electricians, operating the wireless apparatus, and eight seamen. MR. FORAKER ON RATES. | Railroad Legislation Discussed in th# Senate. There was a discussion of railroad ieglg* lation In the Senate today precipitated DJR a bill Introduced by Mr. Tillman, which he explained gave tlie Interstate commerO# commission power 'to fix a maximum rea? sonable rate. Mr. Foraker talked at soma length on the railroad question. He insist ed that the Tillman bill recognised that r^ bates had stopped or could be under th# present law.
