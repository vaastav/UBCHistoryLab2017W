Tliis important paper mates Its appearmce somewhat ahead ol tlmo this morn- n< init, to the fact that it saw the light 18 yesterday In one or two papere that had Surreptitiously procured a copy at Wash- an ington.

Those who desire to be *ut ported up on tho affairs of the country JJJ will read the message in full. It is, liko hit a'I of President llayea' production*, n th< plain and business-like document, replete with valuable statements and suggestions rea in regard to the afTalrs of the country. Iw principal financial feature is its rocom- ** mendation for the retirement of the legal * tender notes, and the replacement of them 1 " by notes that are not a legal tender, such, w" for instance, as the National bank notes. He also recommends the suspension of the wa silver coinage upon the present legal ratio ^ of 412| grains to the dollar, because, as he bill fears, and Is feared by so many others, jus silver will come to be the only metallic wa' currency, it being, as now coined, of loss jJJ| value than gold. Wo doubt whether either of these recommendations will be nct^d upon by Con- ( Kress at this session, because this is the Ore Presidential session, but that we will ulti- Pel mately come to them is hardly to l?e lrft' doubted. iJotli parties will aim to keep a"( ia line with the inflation boom until after J " the elections of 1880. They will be in- to clinert to take the risks of the possible evils Bev to accrue from the indefinite continaance Jur of unredeemed promises to pay, and from au excess of silvor money that is below the q standard of specie in Europe. But Presi- era dent Hayes is not writing for the present to | feeling of Congress,, but for a record Mo on the future pages of the country's reg history. He therefore writes in the spirit in which he expects our present financial situation to be viewed hereafter. will The next important feature of his met- to i sate is lila view of civil service roform. This topic is hardly inferior in import- g anre to any consideration before the coun- ^jjj try. It is too much of a subject, however, cjm to be discussed in our limited space this ^e| morning, and we therefore content our- Me selves by asking for his remarks on this con head the careful consideration of our 111'r rMjer"' _ qui NEIGHBORHOOD NEWS.

OFFICE AMOCIATKI) PitBiH, 1 Chicago, November 30. / To the Editort of the HVafcm Auociateil Prm Fajtcr*: Tlio premature publication of the annual message of the President in Now York, Chicago and Cincinnati Sunday morning compels the ilolivery to you without further delay the copics in the hands of our agents. The faith of the As- . soclated I'ress, which is personally pledged to the President, bus boeu sacredly oh- < served to this moment by all entrusted J i with the care of the message since Thursday. The responsibility for divulging the i contents of this State paper before its pre- ( sentation to Congress rests elsewhere, J and upon other shoulders. Tho rosult of , this publication out of its proper time will t be to compel the officials to submit every- 1 thing hereafter to Congress in manuscript, 1 delay the reports of the press and largely | increase tho. expenses for obtaining such I news, as everything will have to come by 1 wire, thus all papers lose in the end. J Wm. Henry Smith, j General Agent, j Felloic-Citi+en* of the Senate and Iloiue of t JtqireMntatires: c The members of tho Forty-sixth Con- { gress have assembled in their tirat regular } session under circumstances calling for mu* J tual congratulation and grateful aclcnowl- j. edgment to the Giver ot all good for the * large and unusual measure of National [ prosperity which wo now enjoy. Tho most interesting events which have H occurred in our public affairs since my last 8 annual message to Congress are connected f with the financial operations of the Gov- J ernment directly affecting the business in- ? terests of the country. I congratulate 0 Congress on the successful execution of 0 the resumption act, At the time fixed and ? in tho manner contemplated by law, Unl- Jj ted States notes began to be redeemed in 45 coin. Since the first of January last they 1 have been promptly redeemed on preseii- D tation, and in all business transactions, public and private, in nil parts of the country, they are received and paid out as 0 tho equivalent of coin. The demand upon f, the Treanurv for gold and silver in ex- v change for United States notes has been n comparatively small, and the voluntary t, deposit of coin and bullion in exchange n for notes has been very largo. The excess v of the precious metals deposited or ex- (j changed for United States notes over the 8l aiiiuuub m uiiuru omico 

IIUIC3 rcUtJtJmt'U fl is about $40,000,000. 0 The resumption of specie payments has tj been followed by a very. great revival of 0 business. With a currency equivalent in ri value to the monov of the commercial world, we are enabled to enter upon an p equal competition with other nations e trade and production. The increas- e ing demand lor foreign manufac- f( lures and agricultural products has a caused a largo balance of trade in our 0 favor, which has been paid in gold, from a the first of July last, to November 15, to j| the amount of about $50,000,000. Since v the resumption of specie payments there 0 has also been a marked and gratifying im- 0 provement of the public credit. The t| bonds of the Government bearing only J four per cent interest have been sold at n or above par, sufficient in amount to pay 0 off all of the national debt which was re- ^ deemable under present laws. The amount g! of interest saved annually by the process ti of refunding the debt, since March 1,1877, {} is ?14,207,177. The bonds sold were u largely iu small sums, and the number of tl our citizens now holding the public secu- a rities is much greater than ever before, j The amount of the National debt which e matures within less than two years is u $702,121,700, of which $500,000,000 bear c iuterest at the rate of five per cent, and 8l the balance is in bonds bearing six per ,, cont interest. It is believed that this part t| of the public debt can be refunded by the 0 lame of four per cent bonds, and, by the (, reduction of iuterest which will thus be effected, about eleven millions of dollars can be annually saved to the Treasury. To secure this important reduction of in* tl tereat to be paid by the United States, f< further legislation ia required, which, it is e hoped, will be provided by Congress dur- t ing its present session. t: The coinage of gold by the minta of the c United States, during tho last fiscal year 8 was $40,980,912. The coinage of silver dollars, -since the passage of the act for b that purpose, up to ^November 1,1879, was C $45,000,850, of which $12,700,344 have been n issued from the Treasury and are now in r circulation, and $32,300,500 are still in pos- b session of the government. > The pendency of the proposition for b unity of action between the I nited States r and the principal commercial nations of <1 Europe, to elTect a permanent system for t | the equality of gold and silver in tho c recognized money of tho world, loads me t l.to recommend that Congress refrain from f new legislation on tho general subject, t The great revival of trade, internal and foreign, will supply, during the coming I Sear, its own instructions, which may well ? a awaited bejoro attempting further ex- ? perimental measures with tho coinage. I * would, however, strongly urge upon Con- t gross the importance of authorizing the ? (Secretary of tho Treasury to suspend the t coinage of silver dollars upon the present i | legal ratio. Tho market value of tho ail- 1 ver dollar beinguniiorruiy ana largely less than the market value of the gold dollar, it is obviously impracticable to raaintaiu them at par with each other if both are coined without limit. If the cheaper coin is Jurced into circulation it will, if coined without limit, soon become the sole standard of value, and thus defeat the desired object, which is a currency of both gold and silver, which Shall be of equivalent value, dollar for dollar, with the universally recognized money of tho world. 

K1TIRKMKNT OK ORKBNHACKS, The retirement from circulation of UnU ted States notes, with the capacity of legal tender in private contracts, is a step to be taken in our progress towards a safe and liable currency, which should be accepted as the policy and duty of the government, and the interest and security of the people. It is my firm conviction that the issuo ol legal tender paper money based wholly upon tho authority and credit of the government, except in extreme emergency, Is without warrant in the constitution, and a violation of sound financial principles. The issue of Uuited States notes during the late civil war with the oapacity of legal tender between private individuals was not authorized except as a means of rescuing the country from imminent peril. The circulation of these notes as paper money, for any protracted i period of time after the accomplishment i of this purpose, was not contemplated by the framer* of tho law under which ;they were issued. They anticipated the re* demption and withdrawal of these notes at tbe earlieatpracticable period consistent with the attainment of the object for which they were provided. The policy of the United States, steadily adhered to since tbe adoption of the Con* < stitutlon, has been to avoid the creation of 1 a National debt, and when, from neceeaitv l in time of war, debts have been created, I they have been paid off on the return of l peace as rapidly as possible. With this | view, and for this purpose, it is recom* i mended that the existing laws for the ac* i cumulation of a sinking fund Bufllcient to t extinguish the publicdebfc within a limited period bo maintained. If any change of t the objects or rates of taxation is deemed i necessary by Congress, it is suggested that 1 experience has shown that a duty can be c placed on tea and coffee, which'will not t enhance the price of those articles to tbe t consumer, and which will add several mil* r lions of dollars annually to the Treasury, t 

POLYGAMY IN UTAH. F The continued deliberate violation by a ^ large number of tbo prominent and influ* ential citizens of the Territory of Utah of n the laws of the United States for the pros* [. ecution and punishment of polygamy do* j, mands the attention of every department .i of the Government. This Territory has a ?i population sufficient to entitle it to admis* gj lion as a State, and tbe genoral interests . Df the Nation, as well as the welfare of the _ :itirensof the Territory, roqulre its. ad* vauce from the territorial form of govern* n went to the responsibilities and privileges . 3f a State. This important cbango will tc lot, however, beannroved bv tho eountrv .? while the citizeus of Utah in very consi<f- j. arable number uphold a practice which is J condemned hh a crime by tho laws of all 1 civilized communities throughout the world. The law for the suppression of this of* hi encewas enacted with great unanimity st )y Congress more than seventeen years gi igo, but has remained until recently a of lead letter in the Territory of Utah, be- th lauseof the peculiarjdilHcuUies attending E ts enforcement. The opinion widely pre- re railed anions the citizens of 1' tah that the of aw was in contravention of the Constitu- b( ional guarantee of religious freedom. This tli bjectioh is now removed. The Supremo rc 3ourt of the United States has decided the tii aw to be within tho legislative power of tli 'on gross, and binding as a rule of action pf or all who resido within the Territories. There is no longer any reason for delay or co testation in its enforcement. 11 should be ar Irmly and effectively executed. If not *lt utliciently stringent in its provisions it of hould be'amended. and, in aid of the pur- tli lose in view, I recommend that more com- as irehensive and more searching methods aj: or preventing as well as punishing this re rime be provided.-if necessary to secure is bedjence to the law, the enjoyment and ce xercise of the rights and privileges of cit- rij eeuship in the Territories of the United nt tates may be withheld or withdrawn from ra hose who violate or oppose the enforce- re sent of the law on this subject. isi TIIE J.ATE ELECTIONS.

While many topics an f political concern demand great alien- vj, ion from our people, both in the sphere c0 f National and Stale authority, I find no eason to qualify tbe opinion 1 expressed t|, i my last annual message, that no tem- nu orary or administrative interests of gov- m rnment, however urgent or weighty, will po ver displace tbe zeal of our people in de- Jj(l mce of the primary rights of citizenship, no ud that the power of public opinion will CQ| verride all political prejudices, and 11 sectional and State attachments, i demanding that all over our ride territoiy of the name and character .)U f citizens of tlie United States shall mean [>? ne and the same tiling, and carry with hem unchallenged security and respect. ? earnestly appoal to the intelligence and m( atriotisin of all good citizens of every part _ai f the country, however much they may u e divided in opinions on other political ubjects, to unite in compelling obedience . 3 existing laws aimed at the protection of L he right of suffrage.

SERVICE REFORM. V6 In a former message I invited the atteu- mi ion of Congreiis to the subject of the re- to urination of the civil service of the Gov- fai rnment, and expressed the intention of lot ranBtnitting to Congress as early us prac- ou icable a renort upon this subject by tho hairman of the Civil Service Commit)ion. 0 In view of the fact that, during a coniderable period, the Government of V, Vreat Britain 1'os been dealing with ad- J: ainistrative problems and abuses, in vaious particulars analogous to those pre? jv ented in this country, and that in recent rj ears the measures adopted wero undcf- ? tood to have been effective and in every espect highly satisfactory, I thought it lesirable to have fuller information'upon 1 he subject, and accordingly requested tho ^ hairman of tho Civil Service Commission m, o make a through investigation for this " mrpose. The result has been an elaboate and comprehensive report. The report sets forth the history of the jartisan-spoils system in Great Britain. ind of till) rise and (all of the parliament- c0 iry patronago, and of official interference villi the freedom ?f elections. It shows hat after long trials of various kinds of ixaminatlons, those which are eompeti- f,<: ive and open on equal tonus to all, and vhich are carried on under the euperin- ?' endence of a tingle commission, have, with great advantage, boon established as sonditiona of admission to almost every jtBcial place lu the subordinate adminis- re :ratlon of that country and of British f.( India. The completion of the report, awing to the ettent of the labor involved "! in its preparation, and tho omission of J'1 Congress to make any provision either for " [be compensation or tho expenses of the " Commission, has been postponed until * the present time. It is herewith transmit- fJ ted to Congress. " While the reform measures of another " Government are of no authority for us, ^ they are entitled to influence, to the extent to which their intrinsic wisdom, and their adaptation to our institutions and 1 social life may commend them to our con- if lideration. 1Tho views I have heretofore expressed tl concerning the defects and abuses in our si civU administration remain unchanged, o except in so far as an enlarged experience ti has deepened my sonso of the duty both b of officers and of the people themselves to a co-operate for their removal. Tho grave fi evils and perils of a partisan spoils system t of appointment to office and of oflice ten- li ure, are now generally recognized. In o the resolutions of the great parties, in the i reports of departments, in the debates and 1 proceedings of Congress, in the messages I of Executives, the gravity of these evils t has been pointed out ana the need of their t roform has been admitted. \ To command the necessary support, every measure of reform must be based on t common right mil juatlce, and mnit compatible with the healthy eziitence groat partlen, which are Inerilable and aentialin a free State. When the people hare approved policy at a National election, confidei tin the part of the officers they have lected, and of the advisers who, in acoc inre with our political institutions, sho be consulted, in the policy which i :heir duty to carry into effect, is inc pensable. It is eminently proper that tt ikould explain it before the people, as w is illustrate ita spirit in the performance heir official duties, Very different considerations apply lie greater number of those who fill t lubordinate places in the civil servi riieir responsibility is to their superiors ifllcial position. It is their duty tool he legal instructions of those upon whe hat authority is devolved, and their hi itihlic service consists iu the discharge heir functions irrespective of partis; politics. Their duties are the samo, win ver party is in power and whatever po y prevails. As a consequence, it follow bat their tenuro of office should not d end on the prevalence of any policy tie supremacy of any party, but sliou e determined by their capacity to ser :>e people most usefully, quite irrespe ve of partisan interests.

The only jui ound of discrimination id the in ess it i character and capacity he has to raal nit service most useful to the peopl xcept fn eases where, upon just an 'cognized principles, as upon the theor pensions, otiices and promotions ai stowed as rewards for past service sir bestowal upon any theory which di gards personal merit, is an act of injui :o to the citizen, as well as a breach < at trust subject to which the appointin >wer is held. In the light of these principles, it b< mies of great importance to provide jut id adequate means, especially (or ever; ipartment, and largo administrate lice, where personal'discrimination o o part of its head is not practicable, fc certaining those qualifications to wbic inointments and removals should bav ference. To fail to provide such mean not only to deny the opportunity of su rtaiuing the facts upon which the mot jhteous claim to office depends, but, c icessity to discourage all worthy asp: nts, by handing over appointments an movals, to mere influence and favoril 11. If it is the right of the worthies limant to gain the appointment, and th tereat of the peoule to bestow it upoi m, it would seem clear that a wise am st method of ascertaining personal til as for oftke must be an important au< irmanent function of every wiso am at government. It has long sine come impossible, in thegreat offices, fo ose having the duty of uomiuation am puiuuueni, iu personalty examine ml e individual qualifications of more thai imall proportion of those seeking office d, with the enlargement of the civil set ;e, that proportion moat continue to be mo less. In ttie earlier years ot the Governmen e subordinate oflices were so few ii imber that it was quite easy for thos iking appointments and promotions t< rsonully ascertain the merits of candi tes. Party managers and methods hai t then become poweriul agencies o ercion, hostile to the free and just exer 10 of the appointing power. A large and responsible part of the dut; restoring the civil service to the desirei ritv and efficiency rests upon the Presi nt.'and it is my purpose to do what ii thin my power to advance such pruden d gradual measures of reform a9 wil jst surely and rapidly bring about tha lical change of system essential to maki r administrative methods satisfactory t free and^ntelligent people. By a pre r exercise of authority, it is in the powe the Executive to do .much to promoti ch a reform. Hut it cannot be too clearly understood nt nothing adequate can be accomplish without co-operation on the part c ingress and considerate and iutelligen pport among the people. Reform lich challengethegenerally accepted the ies of parties, and demand cliangos ii a methods of departments, are not th >rk of a day. Their permanent founds ina must be laid in sound principles, am an experience which demonstrates thei sdoin and exposes the errors of theirad rsaries.

AW1ITKAHY APl'OINTMEKTS. By laws enacted in 1853 and 1855, am w in substance incorporated in the R< 3ed Statutes, the practico of arbitary ap intmonts 10 tne several subordinat ades in the great Departments was con mued, and examination, aa to capacity be conducted by departmental board examiners, were provided for and mad nditions of admission to the public set ce. These statutes are a decision b ingress that examinations of some sori to attainments and capacity, are essec il to the well-being of the public Bervici 10 important questions since the ennci ent of these laws have been as to th laracter of these examinations, an iiether official favor and partisan inflt ice, or common right and merit, were t ntrol the access to the examinations. In practice, these examinations hav )t always beon open to worthy person inerally, who mi^ht wish to be examir I. Oilicial favoriteism and partisan in lence, as a rule, appear to have designa I those who alone were permitted to g iforo tho examining boards, subjectin ren tho examiners to a prossure from tb iends of the candidates very difficult t isist. As a consequence, the standard < lmission fell below that which the pul B interest demanded. It was also a ost inevitable that a system which pr ided for various separate boards;of exar iers, with no common supervision < niform method of procedure, should r lit in confusion, inconsistency, and itia luate tests of capacity highly detrimei 11 to the public interests. A further at tore radical change was obviously r uired. ELEVATION OK THE SERVICE. In the annual messago of Decembe 570, my predecessor declared that "the i no duty which so much embarrasses tl Ixecutive^nd heads of departments iat of appointments; nor fa there ai ucli arduous and thankless labor impost n Seuators and Representatives as that nding places for constituents. The pi ent system does not secure the best me nd often not even Qt men for the publ laces. The elevation and purification he civil service of the government will iailed with approval by the whole peoF f the United States." Congreaa aocor ngingly passod.the act, approved March 871, "to regulate the civil service of tl Jnited States and promote tho efficien hereof," giving tho necessary author! o the Executive to inaugurate a.civil s< 'ice reform. Acting under this statute, which was i erpreted as intended to secure a sysU be of just and effectual examinations nn ol uniform luperviilou, a number of e en- nently competent persons were seler for the purpose, wbo enterod with * I ( upon the discharge of their duties, j nee pared, with an intelligent appreciation ee- the requirement of the service, the re< rd- lationsoontemplated and took charge aid the examinations, and who, In their t is pacltv as a board, have been known u I lis- "Civil Service Commission." Congr lev for two years appropriated the man ell needed for tho compensation and for t i of expense of carrying on the work ol t Commission. to It appears from the report of the Co he mission, submitted to the President ce. April, 1874, that examination* Inid hi In held in various sections ot the counti ey and that an appropriation of aliout $2 mi 000 would he required to meet the annt wt expenses, including salaries, Involved of discharging the duties of the Cominlsslo m The report was transmitted to Congre tt- by special message of April 18, 1874, wi II- the following favorable comment upon t; ? ? labors of the Commission: "Ifsuatalm le- by Congress, I have no doubt the rill or can, after the experience gained, be lil enforced as to still more materially bene re the public service and relieve the Exec ic- live, Members of Congress, and the hen n- of Dopartments, from Influences prejuJ Id clal to good administration. The rule le as they liavo hitherto been enforced, ha' io resulted benificlallv. as is shown liv il is opinions of the members of tlio Cabin id and their subordinate*) in tlio Department at aud in that opinion I concur." And i a- the annual mcssago of December of tl b- same year similar views are expiesaei or and an appropriation for continuing tl work of the Commission again advised. The appropriation was not made, nm as a consequence, the active work of tli , Commission was suspended, leaving tli 'V Commission itself still in existence. Witl . out the means, tlierefore, of causing qual ;? fications to be tested in any Bysteinatl ,e manner, or of securing for the public set B: vice the advantages of competition upo ;JJ *ny extensive plan. 1 recommended in in f aunual message of December, 1877, th 6 making of an appropriation for the r< J* sumption of the work of the Comraissior s. 

SATISFACTORY EXPERIMENTS, jf In the meantime, however, competitiv ? examinations under many embarrasf ments have been conducted within limits j. spheres in the Executive Departments i; lt Washington, and in a number of the Cut torn Houses and Postoiliccs of the princi e pal cities of the country, with a view t D further test their ell'eets, and, in every in ,r sUnce, they have been found to be a I, salutary as thev are stated to have keci e under the administration of my predecef 8 sor. I think the economy, purity and oi h nciency 01 iuc puouc service would b< lt greatly promoted by their systematic in traduction, wherever practicable, through [. out the entire civil service of the Govern j rnent, together with ample provision io their genoral supervision, in order U it secure consistency and uniform justice. e Reports from tue Secretary of the late q rior, from the L'oHtmaster tieneral, frcn j the postmaster in the city of New York t. where such examinations have been some "] time on trial, and also from the collecto J of the port, the naval officer, nud the sur 0 veyor in that city, and from the postman r ters and collectors in several of the othe \ large cities, show that the competitive Byn 0 tem, whero applied, has, in various wa'ye j contributed to improve the public service The reports show that the. results havt I been salutary in a marked degree, and tha the general application of similar rule cannot fail to be of decided benefit to thi 1 service. 3 The reports of the (Jovernment officers B in the city oE New York especially, bea a decided testimony to the utility of opei . competitive examinations in their respec ] tive ollices, showing that "these exaraiua { tions, and the excellent qualifications o . thoseadmitted to the service through theu have had a marked incidental effect upoi y the persons previously in the service, ant \ particularly upon those aspiring to pro . motion. There has beeu, on the part o j these latter, an increased interest in tin t work, and a desire to extend acquaintanci I with it beyond the particular desk occti t nied, and thus the morale of the entire forci Q nas been raised. * * * The eiamina 0 tions have been attended by many citizem who havuhsd nn onnnrlnnifv r ly investigate the scope and character o the tests and the method of determininj the results, and those visitors have, with \ out exception, approved the methods em . ployed, and soveral of them have publicly If attested their favorable opinion." t Upon such considerations, I deem it nr 9 duty to renew the recommendation con tained in my annual measageof December n 1877, requesting Congress to imko tin 0 necessary approprition for the resumptioi of tho work of the Civil Service Cotuinis il aion. Economy will bo promoted by an r thoming a moderate cotupensation to pei I- sonB in the public service who may pet 0 form extra labor upon or under the Com r mission, as the Executive mav direct. , I am convinced that if a just and ad( o quate teat of merit is enforced for admit _ sion to the public service and in maltin; promotions, such abuses as removals with out good cause and partisan and oilicic interference with the proper exorcise c u tho appointing power, will in a large meat s* ure disappear. > 

I'KHIL OF PARTISAN' AI'POIS'TMENTS. e There are other administrative abuse to which the attention of Congress shouli r? bo asked in this connection. Mere parti d san appointments, and the constant rc e nioval without cause, very naturally lent ' to an absorbing and mischievous politics >' activity, on the part of those thus appoint V ed, which not only interferes with th l* due discharge of official duty, but is in 5 compatible with the freedom of election! t* Nnfe urit limit warrant in ?lw> i.!m? /.I ? eral of my predeceaaora in tho IVealden d tial office, and directly within the law c l* 1871, already cited, I endeavored, by reg 0 ulation, made on tho 22d day of June 1877, to put some reasonable limits t 0 such abuses. It may not be easy, and i 8 may never perhaps be necessary, to detin l* witu precision the proper limit of politics ' action on the part of Federal officers. Bu while their right to hold and freely ea <? press their opinionscaiiuot bequest ionec 8 it is very plain that they should neither b ? allowed to devote to other subjects th ? time needed for the proper discharge < " their official duties, nor to use the autho } ity of their office to enfore their own opir ll* ions, or to coerce the political action < ,J* those who hold different opinions. Reasons of justice and public poliu; )r quite analogous to those which forbid til J" use of official power for the oppression i the private citizen, impose upon tho Go ernment the duty of protecting its office 1(1 and agents from arbitrary exactions. I whatever aspect considered, the practii of making levies, for party purposos, upc the salaries of officers is highly demon* ir izing to the public service and discredit re ble to the country. Though an ofiic iQ should be as free as any other citizen 23 give bis own money in aid of his opinio) iy or bis party, he should also be as free: ad any other citiren to refuse to make su< of gifts, If salaries aro but a fair cotupena e. lion for the time and labor of the office n, it is gross injustice to lay a tax upon thoi lie If they are made excessive in order th of they may bear tho tax, the excess is i be indirect robbery of tho public funds. i]e 1 recommend, therefore, such a revisit ff. and extension of present statutes as sbi 3f secure to those in every grade of officl be life or public employment the protectii cy with which a great and enlightened natii ty should guard those who are faithful in Jr. service. OUR FOREIGN RELATIONS. in* Our relations with foreign countr! >m have continued peaceful. ? dor With (ireat Britain there are atitl unml Milled questions, growing out of tho local ted laws of the maritime provinces and thi> ?al action o( provincial authorities, deemed >re- to be In deroairtion ol rights secured by of treaty to American flahermen. The Colgu ted States Minister In London hu been of Instructed to present a demand for $103.<a 303 U-j, In viow of the ilsmages received ny .he American cltlrena at Fortune Day on the M? flth day of January, 1878. The subject ley has been talcen Into consideration by the be British government and an early reply is ho anticipated. Upon the completion of the necessary m- preliminary examinations, tkb subject ol In our participation In the provincial fisheren lea, aa regulated by treaty, will at once bo rv, brought to the attention of the British 0,- Government with a view to an early and 1(1 permanent settlement of the whole queeIn tlon, which was only temporarily adjlisted n. by the Treaty of Washington. i ?a Efforts have boon made to obtain tho i tli removal of restrictions found injurious to lie the exoortation of iThIi^i i jd Kingdom. i e=* Some correspondence has also occurred ' so with regard to the rescue and saving of ' tit life and property upon the lakes, which i u- has resulted in important modifications of ? Is the previous regulations of the Dominion \ i- Government ou the subject, in the inter* ( s, est of humanity and commerco. ( e In accordance with the joint resolution t 10 of the last session of Congress, commission* a et ers were appointed to represent the Uni- t b, ted .Statos at tbo two International Exhi- I n bitions in Australia, one of which is now* t ie in progress at .Sydney, and the other to be fc 1, held next year" at Melbourne. A desire i: ie has been expressed by our merchants and * manufacturers interested in the important a 1, and growing trade with Australia, that an s io increased provision should be made by v ie Congress for the representation of our in- * \ dustries at the Melbourne Exhibition of c i- next year, and the subject is respectfully f !c submitted to your favorable consideration, n TOE NEW CAULK. a J The assent of the Government has been a y given to the landing, on the coast oi Massa 0 chllBGttH. of A *l?W Mtwl initon*im1nr?? j* atlantic cable between France, by way of q the French island of St. Pierre, and thib j, country, subject to any future legislation t| e of Congress on the subject. The condi* ,\ ? tiona imposed, before allowing this con- t| u nection with our shores to bo established, Q Q are such as to secure its competition with tj ? any existing or future lines of marine ^ i* cable, aud preclude amalgamation there- e 0 with, to provide for entire equality ol >* rights to our Government and people with gl 8 those of France in the uso of the cablo, w Q and prevent any exclusive possession of v j- the privilege as accorded by France to the ^ disadvantage of any future cable comrau- ,, ) nication between trance aud the United Q .States which may be projected andaccotn-. plished by our citizens. Au important re* ei duction of the present rates of cable com- 0| r munication with Europe, felt to be to bur) densome to the interests of our commerce, must necessarily flow from the establish- u( ment of this competing line. - The attention of Congress was drawn to ' 1 the propriety of some general regulation _ !- by Congress of the whole subject of trans- tj. r marine cables by my predecessor in his j8 - message of December 7, 1875, and 1 re- fl. - spectfully submit to your consideration r the imi>ortance o( Congressional action g, '? in this matter. I TREATIES AND OTIIBU PUBEU1N SUTTCIW. IJ 3 Tho questions of grave importance with P t Spain, growing out of the incidents of lii 3 tho Cuban insurrection have been, for the ui 3 most part, happily and honorably settled. It mav reasonably be anticipated that the ti< Commission now sitting in Washington, cc r for the decision of private awes in this pi ! connection, will soou he able to bring its si . labors to a conclusion. The long-standing question of East Flor- w f ida claims has lately beou renewed as a cc 1 subject of correspondence, and may possi- di A bly require Congressional action for its it 1 tlnal disposition. tli A treaty with tho Netherlands, with til f respect to consular rights and privileges, ki 3 similar to those with other powers, nas st ? been signed and ratified, and tho ratillca- sj I tiotia were exchanged on the 81st of July ta j last. Negotiations fur extraditions treat- hi . ies with the Netherlands and with Den- fo a mark are now in progress. ti Some questions with Switzerland, in re{ gard to pan per and convict emigrants, have R j arisen, but it U not doubted that they will ki . be arranged upon a just and satisfactory' vi . basis. A question has also occurred with te l. respect to au asserted claim by Swiss ci municipal authorities to exercise tutelage to f. over persons and property of Swiss citizens zf . naturalized in this country. It is possible m this may require adjustment by treaty. jc ? Willi the German Empire froquont lij ^ questions arise in connection with the sub- tc jects of naturalization and expatriation; St . out the Imperial Government lias con- gi .. stantly manifested a desire to strictly tr .. maintain and comply with all treaty stipulations in regard to them. tl Iu consequence of the omission of Con- s< gress to provide for a diplomatic represen- tl tativo at Athens, the legution to Greece jj has beon withdrawn. Thoro is now no r< channel of diplomatic-communication be- o. !l fvvi.cn llm Ken imimfi-Uo ?? " ? ? u ...w ... w ?v?, mivi UIO ?J" U. if pediency of providing for one, :n some is form, is submitted t? Congress. ri Relations with* Austria, Russia, Italy, o: Portugal, Turkey, and Belgium continue tl R amicable, aud marked by no incident of /.< j eapccinl importance. ti j. A change of the personal head of the ii Government of Kgvpthas taken place. No tl 1 change, however, has occurred in the re- p {\ lationB between Egypt aud the United c< i. States. The action of the Egyptian Gov- o, e ernuient in presenting to the city of New ai . York one of the ancient obelisks, which S j. possess such historic interest, is highly st appreciated as a generous mark of inter- bi . national regard. If prosperity should at,f tend the enterprise of its transportation . across the Atlantic, its erection in a con\t snicuous pottiiiou in the chief commercial o city of tho Nation will soon be accom- * \ plishcd. " e Tho treaty recently made between J apan tl and the United States in regard to the re- " !t vision of former commercial treaties, it is v now believed will be followed by similar P [t action on the part of other treaty powers. y o the attention of Congress is again invited U o to the subject of the indemnity funds ro)f ceived some years since, from Japan and ? r. China, which, with their accumulated in- a i. terest, now amount to considerable sums. 1 )f If any part of these funds is justly due to 0 American citizens they should recoive it J f promptly;.and whatever may have been J [e received by this Government in excess of ? 3f strictly just demands, should in some 0 f. form be returned to the nations to whom re it equitably belongs. J The Government ol China has signified 1 e its willingness to consider tho question of j "n the emigration of its subjects to the United ' j. States with a dispassionate fairness, and to a- co-operate in such measures as may tend ' Qr to prevent injurious consequences to tho < to United Stales. The negotiations are still \ is proceeding, and will be pressed with dill- ? as gence. ' :h A uuestion having ariseti between China a. and Japan about the Lew Chew Islands, ' ir, the United States Government has taken 1 n. measures to inform those powers of its 1 at readiness to extend its good offices for the in maintainanceof peace, if they shall deem it desirable, and find it practicable to avail >n themselves of the proffer. ill mexico and central america. *1 It is a gratification to be able to an)n nounce that, through the judicious and f n energetic action of the military commanlu ders of tlie two nations on each side of the Rio Grande, uuder the instructions of their respective Government*, raids and ies depredations have greatly decreased, and, in the localities where formerly mostdes-1 tractive, have now almost wholly ceased. In view of this result, I entertain a coufl dent expectation that the prevalence of quiet on tho l>order will soon become a<? assured as to justify a modification of the 5resent orders to our military commanera as to crosiinu the border, without encouraging such ?!:- urbances as would endanger the pearo *f the two countries. The third instalment of tho award against Mexico under the Claims ( ommls* sionof July 4,18(W, wns duly paid, ami has been put in course of distribution in pursuance of tho set of Congress providing for tho same. This satisfactory nituation between tho two countries leads tno to anticipate an expansion of our trade with Mexico and an increased contribution of capital and industry by our peopio to the development of the great resources of that country. 1 cmrneatly commend to tho wisdom of' Congress the provision of suitable legislation looking to thU result. Diplomatic intercourse with Columbia is again fully restored bv tho arrival ?>f ? minister from that country to the ignited Suite#. Tins it) especially fortunate in rtew of the fact that tho question of an nter-oceanie canal has recently assumed i new and important aspect, and is now mder discussion with the Ceutral Aiueri:an countries through whose territory tin* ianal, by the Nicaragua route, would have o pass. It is trusted that enlightened tatesmauship on their part will see that he early prosecution of such a work will srgely enure to tho benefit, not only of heir own citizens and those of the Uulted Itates, but of the commerce of the civilRed world. It is doubted that should the rork bo undertaken uuder the protective usplces of the United States, and upon atisfactory concessions for the right of ray, aud its security, by the Central imerican governments, the capital for its omplotton would be readily furnished rom this country and Europe, which ugui^ inning suc:i guarantees, prove inccessible. Diplomatic relations with Chili lmve Iso been strengthened by the reception f a minister from that country. The war between Peru, Bolivia ami ihili still continues. The United States ave not deemed it proper to interposo in ae matter, further than to convey to all :ie governments concerned, the assurance tiat the friendly ollkes of the Government of the United States (or the restoruon ot peace upon an honorable basis will e extended, in case the belligerents shall xhibit a readiness to accept them. Cordial rolations continue with Brazil ad the Argentine Republic, and trade itli those countries is improving. A proision for regular and more frequent mail jmmunicatlon, in our own ships, beveon the ports of this country and the ations of South America seems to mo to oserve the attention of Congress, as an aontial precursor of an enlargement of nrcommerco with them, and an extenon of our carrying trade. A recent revolution in Venezuela has sen followed by the establishment of a rovisional government. This governlent has not vet been formally recogized, an?l it is deemed desirable to await 10 proposed action of the people, which expected to give it the sanction of conitutional forms. A naval vessel has been sent to the amoan Islands, to make surveys and take Dssession of the privileges ceded to the nited States by Samoa, in the harbor of ago Pago. A coaling station is to estab sneu inero, wiitcb will bo convenient anil wful to United States vessels. The subject of opening diplomatic relaans with tioutnania and Servia, now be>me independent sovereignties, is al resent under consideration, and is the ibject of diplomatic correspondence. There is a gratifying increoso of trade ith nearly all European and American luntrios, and it is believed that with juclous action in regard to its development can and will be still more enhanced, and lat American products and nianufacires will And new and expanding marits. The reports of diplomatic and conilar ollicers upon this subject, under the 'stem now adopted, have resulted in ol>ining much valuable information, which eis been and will continue to be laid here Congress and the public from time to me. The third article of the treaty- with ussia, of March IJO. 18(17, by which Alasi was ceded to the United States, prodes that the inhabitants of the ceded irritory, with the exception of the unvilixed native tribes, shall bo admitted t the enjoyment of all the rights of citims of the United States, and shall he aintalned and protected in the free enymont of their liberty, property and region. The uncivilized tribes aro subject > such laws and regulations as the United feted may from time to timo adopt in relrd to the aboriginal tribes of thatcoun)' Both the obligations of this treaty and le necessities of the poople, require that mie ortjanired form of government over le Territory of Alaska be adopted. There appears to be no law for the ar?t of persons charged with common-law flenses, such as assault, robbery, and lurder, and no magistrate authorized to sue or execute process in such cases. Seous difficulties have already arisen from U'unHes of this character, not only among 10 original inhabitants, but among citiins of the United States and other counies, who have engaged in mining, tishig, and other business operations within le Territory. A bill authorizing the apolntnient of justices of the peace and mstables, and the arrest and detention f persons charged with criminal offences, nil providing for an appeal to United uucs courts ior me uistrict of Oregon, in litable cases, will, at a proper time, be lbmitted to Congress. THE NATIONAL FINANCE*. The attention of Congress is called to le annual report of the secretary of the reasury on the condition of the public nances. The ordinary revenues from all sources >r the fiscal year ended Juno 30, 1879, ere $-711,82*,184.46; the ordinary exenditures for the same period were $200,47,883.5:); leaving a surplus revenue for lie year of $0,879,1100 93.
