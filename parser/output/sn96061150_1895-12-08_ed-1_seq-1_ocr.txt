In his candidacy for the mayoralty, Dr. Kinney Is using the argument that In his endeavors to procure the construction of the Astoria and Columbia River Rail road, he had acted voluntarily, and with out compensation, or hope of compen sation. A letter was written by Dr. Kinney whilst he was chairman of the R. R. committee of twenty-one, known as the "Committee of Direction," to Mr. Stan ton, who was here In Astoria endeavor ing to procure from the committee a contract for the construction of the rail road. This Is the nigger In the woodpllo that the balance of the committee tried so hard to And. The letter is in the well -known handwriting of Dr. Kinney, and is as follows: ASTORIA, MARCH 10th, 1894. MR. J. C STANTON : DEAR SIR: I HAVE FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS GIVEN ALMOST MY TSntTuE TIME DEVELOPING WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE GOBLE OR COL UMBIA RIVER ROUTE FOR A RAIL ROAD FROM" ASTORIA.

The hot baths at the gymnasium are flllllng a long felt want, and quite a num ber of business men are talking of Join ing the club on that account The directors of the A. F. C. made a good selection In the new professor, who comes well recommended and is a teacher of great ability, In fact, a man can now learn any branch of athletics from a competent and willing instructor. Last Tuesday Messrs. Campbell, D. M. Stuart, and Feid. Levy were admitted members of the A. F. C, which is grow ing rapidly and wllf shortly have over 200 on its pay roll, which Bpcaks well for the success and popularity of this club. The committee who are in charge of the indoor games decided to change the date from the 15th of December to the 9th of January, which will enable Prof. Kellogg to have a good class of athletes that will give the public a line exhibition. The ItT A. A. C. boys are looking forward to a visit, and take part in the games which will be well contested, as there in always great rivalry between athletic c'ubs when they face each other on the track. The local boys are favored in having such a large hall to practice In, as the other gymnasiums cannot hold 15-yard dashes or mile runs. They have to lie content with bar performance and tum bling. The Multnomah Club are now practic ing Rugby football and intend making a tour of the north. Every time the colle giate game rules are changed, they use .a Rugby one, consequently the game Is getting neater Kigiy, so no doubt in time a bald headed man can play the col legiate game. - Association Football la now atractlng attention In tb Fst. end i r"tt""t.iy qualities are drawing the fair aex te wit nes the games hy thouxand, who readily recognize the difference In a game p'ay td for sport and one played by aiugglng and brutality that is worse than a bull t fight.. i A terrible riot took place recently art j Pittsburg ovr a football game. Slq - I We have received today a new line of holiday presents. Our handkerchiefs laces we are leaders, nave gins was Indulged in to suoh an extent that the game broke up in a rough and tumble fight which was after great diffi culty stopped by. the police. Jim Corbett has shown the white fea ther that so many sporting editors, and latterly a prominent physician, stated the great gladiator possessed, as Jim has blankly refused to fight any more, and so turned the championship over to Pe ter Maher. If my memory serves me cor rectly Champion Jim had an he could at tend to in Jim HalL at -Chicago, In a four round set-to, and it was the opinion of the sporta who saw the affair that Hall, had It been to a finish, would have won. Since then. Fits defeats'! Hall and Maher, and now Hall Is Mihir'a sparring partner, so It looks as if Corbett docs not want any of Maher or Vita's i;ame. Jlin Hall and Joe Choynskl are matched for February and Mahor and Fltaslm mons on the 15th of February, They will oe worth going r. lies to see and thous ands will pay good prices for tickets. Gans defeated George Siddons in seven rounds. Lavigne got the decision over Joe Walcott in 13 ' rounds, and George Dixon could not defe-it Erne In ten rcund and yet boxing is not allowed, so say the governors. Tom O'Rourke bet Bob Tucker $110 that Maher cannot receive the championship, In the way he has from Corbett, and that It goes back to John L. SuHvan: Just how they will decide the wager is hard to say, but O'Rourke is usually correct in all his matches, - B. J. Wefers, the famous sprinter, has been declared a professional by the A. A. U., and uays he will contest the case in the New York courts. "SUNSHINE.' INCOME TAX. Washington, Deo; 7. Representative U. S. Hall, of Missouri, is determined not to abandon the fight for the Income tax. The amendment to the constitution was pre pared and Introduced by Hall yesterday. It is to be known ai the 16th amendment, and Is calculated to make the Income tax constitutional. 1 Strathnevis and Gorsedd Heard From. Passengers and Crew of the Strath nevis on Short Rations, But Will Get Through. San Francisco, Deo. 7. Re-Insurance on the overdue steamer Gorsedd was quoted at SO per cent this morning, and three hours after the posting of the quotation, a' dispatch was received from Port Town send stating that the Gorsedd had arrived all right. The arrival created great ex citement, for of all the whips of the over due fleet, the Gorsedd was the least look ed for. She was 49 days from Singapore for Tacoma, or about 20 days overdue. Re-insurance on the Evandale jumped to 40 per cent today. The Biltlph ship Lord Brassey and the steamer Eskdale, t-f the Northern fleet, are causing the gravest anxiety by their long delay. Special to the Astorian. Port Townsend, Dec. 7. The British steamship St' athnr vis, which was s1 pprs ed to have foundered In the recent No vember gale, in the North Pacific ocean, was spoken a few days ago by the Prlt lh bark John Gambles, which arrived nt Vancouver this morning from Java. The Strathnevis was in a disabled con dition,' 80 miles northwest of Cape F'at tery, being In longitude 145 west, la'ltude 48 40 north, and is on the sailing tack between Puget Sound ard Yokhan"a The Tohn Gambles sent aivofficer ashore down e straits last night, who telegraphed the meagre particulars to this port.

I you seen our assortment STaLll'MIS AT Mill Republicans Fire Their Second Gun in a Royal Manner. THE MEETING WAS CROWDED Some of the Bright Things That the Speakers Told the Electors in the Third Ward. . Last night a large number of Republi cans with all the candidates on the Re publican ticket, went to Uppertown ac companied by the Astoria Amateur Brass Band, and invaded Adair's Bchoolhouse. All Upeprtown was there to welcome them and the voters gave the speakers of the evening a rousing reception that showed how strong was the sentiment In favor of the men who represent all the sentiment and principles most dear to the hearts of the American people. Want of space precludes an extended report ot the meeting. Mr. W. H. Barker presided and introduced the candidates, all of whom spoke vigorously and well on the Issues of the campaign. In addition to the candidates, several other prominent Republicans talked of tho election and tho coming victory. The following are a few of the bright things that were re. celved with enthusiastic applause: C. S. 

GUNDERSON. "Tho amount of subsidy given by the Taylor estate to the railroad has been, criticised. I Invite any Interested per son to visit the courthouse and see in black and whlto on the records of the county the real facts. The Tay'or fnm lly have given one-tenth of the whole subsidy raised. Their contribution la a splendid one." W. H. BARKER. "Mr. Simon Danzlger went up to the room where the men were In session who nominated the "Citizens' " ticket. There were five people there, all sitting on boxes. Mr. Danzlger asked if he could be admitted. The editor of an evening sheet, who was sitting on a box In the middle of the room, renlled. 'No. Tilts Is a PRIVATE CITIZENS' MEETING.' ' . F. L. PARKER. "City warrants are now worth 75 cents. Elect a Republican council and In a year we will have city warrants worth 00 cents." C. W. FULTON. , "This statement that Judge Taylor sen tenced a man to three years for stealing two salmon seems to worry some people. I don't see why it should unless they ore thinking of starting out to steal fish tem selves. This man had been stealing salm on foe over a month and had got away with over 600 of them. Are they honest people who are kicking about this sen tence, of what are they?" JAMES W. WELCH. "I am no Third Termer, gent'rmen. Osburn has been there long enough. He has built a mansion for himself on top of the hill out of the proceeds. Let him get out and give some poor man a cnancc." JOHN HAHN. "Here Is a certificate of my character, gentleman, slpned by Uncle Pom after Ave years' service for the Aug. Here is another signed hy James G. Plains 1 think I can afford to stand asaults upon my character by the editor of the evening sheet, don't you?" C. W. FULTON, "The "Citizens" point with pr'de to the Increase In tliplr license rvtwt'cns. They forget to tell the people that the last legislature raised the price of llq o- li censes from $200 to $400. doubling the'r In come from that source alone. That's why." w. f. mcgreoor. "I am here tonight to say thnt If I an. elected I will do my duty to the best ot my ability, with no favor to any man, and with common sene and tho public welfare for my only guides." DR. J. A. FULTON. "City warrants used to be worth 97 cents. Now nobody will buy them at 75 550,000 of Astoria city bonds all over the $50,000 of Astoria city bonds all over the country and can't sell them." SECRETARY MORTON. Washington, Dec. 7. There bids fa'r to be an interesting contest in congr ss be tween Secretary of Agriculture Morton and the members who have agricultural constituencies, over the distribution of seeds. By virtue of an opinion rendered last summer by Attorney General Olney the secretary has practically done away with the time honored system of grattilUee t the public. He rejected all bids made for furnishing seeds and In October last practically abolished the reed division of the department. Since tils course was made public the members have been plan' nlng to take action to compel the secre tary to carry out this law according to their Interpretation of It. THE NEW MAIL CARKIER. Port Townsend, Dec. 7. James Jackson the educated Indian who U to personally carry the mall from Juneau to Fort Cud ahy, on the Yukon river, arrived here to day on the steamer Wlllapa. He comes down to secure twenty or thirty ttrrng dogs to draw sleds across the mountains o the Canadian postotllce on Forty Mile Creek. This service is merely a private enterprise, being maintained by the min ers, who pay fifty cents a letter. Tie Canaalan government guarantees $37) for ach of the two round trips. The under taking ia considered most hazardous. SHOT IN A SALOON. Colfax, Wn., Dec. 7. In a controversy shlch arose from a disagreement ovr "arvext wages, Pat Dunnlgan ehot and ortally woumb-d Fred Craft, In tbe Star -n'cKjn tonight. Both are lriglo and aged t and 30 yean, respectively. Craft ia a farm hand, and with others was eating In '.he Star saloon, when Dun. Foster Kid Gloves, are the best and cheapest in th of silks--they are the talk nlgan entered and swore he could lick Craft. The latter paid little attention to him and Dunnlgan left but when Craft finished, and entered the main part of the saloon, he was again Insulted by Dunnl gan, who swore by the heavons that he could lick him, whereupon Craft said, "I'll give you a thousand dollars If you can lick me," at which remark Dunnlgan pulled out hla revolver and shot Ctaft In the left temple. Both men were some- i what under the Influence of liquor. KENTUCKY LEGISLATURE. Will be a Tie on Joint Ballot for Senator. Louisville, Ky., Doo. 7. The Democrats won out today in the special election in the 48th legislative district, sending A. J. Parrnll in IhA locrtalntilr tiv n mntnrttv of ins votes over charioa a. Blades, the, Republican nominee. As a result the Kentucky legislature is a tie on joint ballot and the ballotting for a United States senator to succeed Blackburn is likely to result in a deadlock. - On Joint ballot the Republicans and Democrats will have 68 votes each ana the Populists two, and It is pretty well assured that the Populist vote will split. Carroll had refusede his certificate after the November election, because of the se cret withdrawal of Bhrleve, the Repub lican candidate. Carroll who is ex-speaker of the house, declared he could not ac cept an election carrying with It the least suspicion of fraud, and demanded a spe cial election.- Vottrs will do well to study carefully for a few minutes at least the new law under which Astoria will hold her city election next Wednesday. Heretofore at elections in this city It has been law and custom to tratch off or draw a pencil mark through the names of all the can didates for whom the voter did not wish to vote. The new law which la now In effect requires that the voter shall make a cross or something similar in front of I tho name of the candidate for whom he wishes to vote. Tho. designating cross must bo made to the left of the name of the candidate voted for, between the number and the name. Test of the Powers Made. Being Sultan is Technically Correct in Ills Position, But Powers Will Force Issue. (Copyrighted, 1895, by Associated Press.) London, Dec. 7.-Whlle it Is true that domestlo politics- have been utterly dull, the surprises of tho Eastern question have been followed In England with the most interest. Naturally the main point at issue lr the East, throughout the week was the question whither the sultan would o would not grant the permits necessary for extra guardshlps requested by Great Britain, Russia, Austria and Itnly, to pass the straits of Dardenslles. The in- lerest taken In this extra guard. hip question is not so much due to the fact that the poweia consider it necessary to have additional protection fer foreigners within easy reach In the Bosphorus, as it Is the knowledge that it Is really a test of European accord. If the powers bach down It will be a demonstration that the Turk was right in believing that the ac cord of Europe could not last for any 'ength ot time, and (hat the sultan was holding out until eventually a break oc curred. But should the powers remain nrm In their determination to hava addi tional guardshlps In the Bosphorus. it will certainly demonstrate that the ac cord of the powers is capable of with standing a stronger test. The British press naturally demands hat Europe should not recede from the position taken up by the powers, and thai the sultan should be forced to yield by the pressure brought to bear upon him. Authorities, upon international law, how ever, contend that the sultan la technl 'nlly right In his refusal to grant the firmans demanded. A curious statement has been made here that the Japanese government has or dered 18,000 cheap watches from Swltzer 'and, with the intention of present'ng them, instead of medals, to the soldiers who wer engaged in tho war against China. IT IS FALSE." Washington Dec. 7. Mark Hanna, of Cleveland, ha Joined the Ohio delegation looking after the Interest of Governor McKlnley during the meeting of the lie 'lublican committee, and today, speaking of the reports that Ohio had selected anothar candidate than McKlnley, said: ' Ohio Is absolutely united in its sup- nnrt of McKlnley and any reports that another Ohio name will be presented to the national convention are mischevlnus and false. In the moet formal manner the Republican party of Ohio has pre' kiT.tcil the name of Governor McKlnley lo the country as Ohio's choice for the presidency. This was done at the state convention, and specifically announced in the state platform." Hanna was asked as to the statement made by a gentleman named Wood, that the name of Senator Sherman would be presented to the national convention. "That is faM." answered Hanna. fUE EASTERN QUESTION Highest of all in Leavening Power. Latest U. S. Gov't Rc; 6 kJ m JT$J just the thing for city. of the town. BHANAHAN UUOH. THE GERMAN FlliS Criticizes Cleveland's Position on Food Exports. GOVERNMENT 18 WARN5D Not to Take Too Severe Measures Against United States Imports and Insurance Companies. (Copyrighted, 1S95, by Associated Press. Berlin, Dec. 7. President Cleveland's strictures on Germany's treatment of American food products and insurance companies in his message to congress have created a sensation here. The gov ernment thus far, through Its organs, has not repllid to Mr. Cleveland's veiled threats, and the only seml-otflclal state ment has been that of the Cologne Ga ette, on Wednesday last, in which a ref erence was made to the disadvantages un-, der which the German sugar imports to America suffered, and contending that the Inspection of American pork was merely of a nature which did not warrant the differential treatment of German Imports to America. It is added that tho Ameri can insurance companies were only sub jected to the samo regulations as such in stitutions In Prussia, and concluded with the remark that such questions should not be dcolded in a moment of anger, hut settled In a manner agreeable to both countries, after careful considera tion of all that may be said for and against It. It was also stated that there was no doubt that this was also 'Mr. Cleveland's desire. The Berliner Tagoblatt reminds the gov ernment it had been warned not to take too severe measures against American imports and Insurance companies. The Radical Frelsslnlge Zeltung says: Our Industrial interests are threatened all the mare because the agrarian party will not fall to drive Germany into a tar Iff war with America for tho puropso ot excluding entirely American cereals." The action of several states, such as Missouri, regarding German Insurance companies, is keenly watched and the whole matter will be thoroughjy ventilat ed in tho relchstag. Percy Bartholomew, United States con sul at Mayence, haB written a letter to the press in reply to the pulillo state, ments of the president of the butliers' guild there, that American lard Is made from diseased hogs. The consul says. "It all the president's statements are true, nobody in the United States would be alive now,"
