Los Angeles, Cal., Dec. 3.—At the re cent triennial convention of the Prot estant Episcopal church in Minneapolis one of the first matters to receive the sanction of both houses was a proposi tion to divide the diocese of California, and to erect a new see in the southern section of that state, and today the first diocesan convention, called for the purpose of putting this action into legal effect, opened in this city. Clerical and lay delegates were present from the counties of Santa Barbara, Ventura, Los Angeles, San Bernardino, River side, Orange and San Diego, all of which are within the new diocese. Bishop Nichols, who has heretofore ruled over the affairs of the church in the entire state, has chosen the north ern diocese, having San Francisco for its see city; and it therefore becomes incumbent on the convention to select the first bishop of the new diocese. A large number of representative divines have been spoken of in connection with the elevation. First and foremost is Dr. Spalding of St. John's cnurch, San Francisco, who took a prominent part in the convention at Minneapolis, and towered* like a giant among the cele brated orators and debaters in that gathering. Then there is Dr. Daniel H. Greer of St. Bartholomew's church, New York City, who refused a call to become the successor of the late Phillips Brooks in Boston, and would doubtless have been a bishop ere this had he ac cepted. Dr. J. H. Johnson of Christ church, Detroit, Mich., has many friends, but it is doubtful whether he would .accept an election, in view of the fact that last year he declined the bishopric of Indiana. Others favorably mentioned are Rev. Dr. George W. Douglass, formerly of Washington, D. C., and who is now traveling in Europe owing to the ill health of his wife, and Rev. H. B. Restarick of San Diego, who was also a delegate to the recent convention. The convention will doubtless decide to designate the see as the "diocese of Los Angeles." , •
