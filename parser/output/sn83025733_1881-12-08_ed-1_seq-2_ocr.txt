THE PALLAS 1IKKAL1). THURSDAY 3.0KMM , DECEMBER 8, 1831. I! " ,' I it i I PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. BKIvr.r OF THE SEil.ETARY Of TIIK 1NTKKIO. The report of tlio Secretary of the Inte rior, witli accompanying documents, pre sents an accurate account of the business of the Pcrtnif lit. A simimury of it would be too extensive for this place. 1 ask your careful attention to the report itself. Prom inent among matters which challenge the attention of Congress at its present session is the tiiniiKcnieiit of our Indian aflairs. While tins question has been A cause of trouble and embarrass ment from the infancy of t lie government it is but recent iy that any ef fort lias been made for its solution, at once serious, determined, coinisteni, and prom isiiu? of success. It bus been easier to re sort to convenient make-shifts lor tiding over temporary dillicultics than to grapple with the ' irreut permanent problem. and accordingly the easier course has" almost invariably been liursued. It was natural at a lime when the Nalional territory seemed almost il i:. i .:n:...... i- iiiiiiiuoic, anil coiiuuiiimi iiiiuiv mme.ua ,.i acres mr ouisiue ine nounos oi civin.cu ci tlement. that a nolicv should have been ini liated whicii more than aught else.hashcen the fruitful source of our Indian coiindi- cations. 1 refer of course to I he policy of dealing with the various Indian tribes as separate nationalities, ot regulating lliem uy treaty ami snpiuv tions to the occupancy of immense reserva tions in the West, and encourage them to live a snvaee life undisturbed by any earn est and well-directed ell'orts to bring them tinder the inlltiences of conization, and the unsatisfactory results which have sprung Irom 11ns policy arc becoming apparent to all. As tbc white settlements have crowded the borders ot the reserTattons tin Indians have sometimes contended and sometimes, against their will, htiTC been triiuslerreil to other hunting grounds, from which thev have again been dislodged whenever their new-found homes have been desired by adventurers ami settlers. These removals, and the frontier collisions ot which they hare often been preceded, nave leu to ireipient and disas trous conflicts between the races. It is prolilless to discuss here which of them has been chiellv resnonsihlu for the distur bances whose recital occupies so large a space upon tne liages ol our lustorv. He Jiavo to deal with the appalling fact that uioiiftti tnousatuls oi lives havo been sacn heed mid .hundreds of millions of dollars expended in the attempt to solve the Indian problem, it lias until within the past few years seemed scarcely nearer a solution than it was half a century ago. Hut the government has been Vauiiously hut .steadily feeling its way to the adoption of a policy which has already produced gratify ing results, and which, in my judgment, is likely, if Congress anil the KxeculiVe accord in its support, to relievo us Irom thu dilli cultics which have hitlinrtn beset us. For the success of the ellorls now be ,ing made ,to introduce among the Indians the' customs and pursuits of civilized life,' and gradually to absorb them into a -mass of our citizens, sharing their rights ami holding them to their re sponsibilities, there is imperative Heed for legislative action. ,Jly suggestion in thai regard will be chielly such as have been al ready called to the attention of Congress and have received to some extent its con sideration. l-'irst I recommend tho passage of an act making the laws of the various States and Territories applicable to the Indian reserva tions within their borders, and extending the portion of ihe Indian Territory not oc cupied by the live civilized tribes. The Indian should receive the protection of the law, he should bo allowed to maintain in court his right of person anil property, lie lias repeatedly begged for Ibis privilege. Its exorcise would bu very valuable to him in his progress toward civilization. Second Of eiiou greater importance is a measure, which has been freouently recom mended bv my predecessors inollice, and in furtherance of which several bills have been from lime to time introduced in both Jiotics of Congress. The enactment of a geu rral law fcrmitling allotment in severalty, to such Indians at least as deerve oi a reasonable iti.intity of land secured to them ' by patent, and for their own protection, made inalienable lor twenty or twenty-live years is demanded for their present welfare- ami incir permanent-advancement. In return for such considerate action on ihe "part of the (lovernment there is reason to" believe that the Indians, in large numbers, Would bo persuaded to sever their tribal relations and to engage at once in agricultural pur suits. Many of them realize the fact that their hunting days are over and that it is now for their best, interest.! to e.i.,i,.. their manner of life to tho new order of i mugs, anil Dy no greater inducement than the assurance of it permanent title to the soil can they be led in engage in the occu pation of tilling it. The well-attested re ports of their increasing interest, in husbandry justify tho hope and uenei that the enactment of siicii a taiuuo ns t recommend would be nt onco attended with gratifying result. A resort to tha allotment, system would have u direct and nowerfnl lull Solving tho tribal bond which is so promi nent a feature of savage lite and which tends so strongly to perpetuate it. Third I advise a liberal appropriation for tho support of Indian schools he cause of my cotilidont Indict that such a course is consistent with tlie wisest-economy even among ths most uncultured Indian tribes. There is re ported to be a general and nrgent desire on the part of the chiefs and older members for the education of their children. It is unfortunate in view of this fact that during the past year tho means which have been at the command of the Interior Depart ment for the purpose of Indian instruction have proved to be utterly Inadequate. The success of the u)uni ii.i,.i. are In operation In Hampton, Carlisle and Forest drove should not only encourage a more generous provision for the support of mvsu iiisto-oi. n, mit Biiouiu promoto i lie establishment of others of similar 1'luiriii.fii,.

MOIIMOMSM. For many years tho Executive, in his an nual message to Congress, has urged the ne cessity of sirinrent IcL'islalion for tin. mm. pression of polygamy iii the Territories, and especially tho Jurritory of Ctah. The ex isliiig statute for tho punishment of this odious crime, so revolting ;to the louui mi religious sense oi Christendom, lias been persistently and contemptuously violated ever since Its enactment. Indeed, in spite of the commendable ell'orts on the part of the authorities, who represent the I nited States in that Territory, tho law has in very rare Instances been inforced, ami therefore the cause to which reference will be ,P'T",ntJy made, is practically dead letter. The fact that the adherents of the Mormon church which rests upon polygamy ns its corner stone, have recently been peopling In large numbers Arizona, and olU of our West HnJtr!

Your attention is called to a re- t cent opinion of the Supreme Court of the I nited States cxmauimg -its ludmncui oi reversal in the case of Miles, who hud hot n convicted of bigamy in I'tuh. The court refers to the fact that the secrecy attending the celebration of marriages in the Territory makes the proof of polvjamy j very ditllcult, and the propriety is suggested of modilying Ihe law of evi dence which now makes a wife incompe- ! tent to testiliv against her husband. This! suggestion, ns appended, I recommend; also the passage of an act providing that in the Territories of the Cnitcd Slate-, the fact lll.il u woioiio lias occo iiiuiiicii in a o' i"ii "i... . t.-. charged with bigamy shall not dis- 'Hie investigation of all coin onulilv her ns a witness on bis ! iduint.t and lmnishment ol trial for that olleiice. I further recommend legislation by which any per son solemnizing u marriage in any of thu Territories shall be rcouired to give bond, under stringent penalties, tor neglect, or required to file a certificate of Me h mar riage in the Supreme Court of the Territo- rv. Doubtless Congress may devise oilier practicable measures for 'obviating the dilliculties which have hitherto sertion that original appointments should attended the ell'orts to suppress this in- be based on ascertained fitness is not open iquity. I assure vou of my determined to dispute, but the question now In pnie Mirpose to co-operate with vou in any law- : tice. ilowsuch fitness can be most effectually fill ami discreet measures which may be p.-oposcd to that end. Ebl'C.VTION. Although our system of government dies not contemplate that nttion should provide or sup port a system of education of our people, no measures calculated to promote the general intelligence ami virtue upon which the prosperity of our institu tions so great l.depcnds, have ever been re garded with indillcrcnee by Congress or the Kxccutivc. A large part of the public-domain has been from, time to time devoted to the promotion of education. There Is now a special reason why by setting apart the proceeds ot its sales of public lands or by some other course, the (ioveiniiient should aid the work of education. Many who now exercise the right of snll'erage are unable to read the ballot which they east, who have just emerged from a condition of slavery, ami who su.i denly devolved the responsibilities of c iti zens' The country most impoverished bv the war. I have been pleased to lcnrtfrom the report of the Commissioner of Education, that there has lately been a considerable increase of in terest and effort for their instruction, hul all that can he done by local legislation and private generosity should he supple mented bv such aid as can be const i' tit em ally all'ordcd by tlm National (iovernment. I would suggest t lull U nny luml be desig nated to Hits purpose t may he wisely dt trihulcd in diucivnt hlutes, according to the ratio of illiteracy, as by that means those localities which are more in need i such assistance win reap the spina iienciits, OX Adltn -fJ.TI'KK, The report of the Commissioner of Agri culture exhibits tho results ol experiments in which ine Department lias been engaged during tho past year, and makes important suggestions in reference Io the ugricull ural department ot the country, lhestcadv increase of our population mid the consequent addition to the huiiiIm of those engaged in the pursuit of husband rv, giving to tins department il growing ill nity unci importance. The Commissioner suggestions to urge its capacity for greati usefulness deserves attention, as more and more commends itseif to the In terests which it was created to promote O.N I'KXSIOXS. n appears irom t no report oi t tic ( mil missioner ol I'ensiotis that since Isiio, c,s;Vnp original claims have been filed; $I.TH,!1!I of these have been allowed and inscribed on he Pension n have been rejected and abandoned, being thirteen per cent, of the whole nuinbirol claims scllled.

INTlattAb mi'SOVKMPNTS. I advise an appropriation for null Inter- nai improvements as tha wisdom of Con gress may doom to be of public importance. The necessity of improving the navigation of the Mississippi river Justifies a special allusion to that subject. I suggest the adoption of somo measure for tho remedy of the obstruct ions which now impede the navigation of that great channel of com merce. 

TIFWS, ITfl, lo my letter eccepting the nomination for the Vlee-l'residency, I stated that, In my lodgment, no man should be the in cumbent of an ofnee, the duties of which he i IT "!y ?fn" ?,n,lt t0 Perform, who Is lacking In the ability, ndofitv or Integrity, m lb 3 P"'Pfi''l'j''ltratIon of atioh at otnet demand...

The clliciency of such regulation bus been distrust, because they nave scemen io exuu mere roociiuooiu mm abstract tests above general business ca pacity, and even special Illness for the par ticular work in hand. It seems to nic that I lie rules which should tie applied to the management oftlicptiblie service may prop erly conform in uiiiiii to such as regulate the conduct of succcsslul private business. Original apiioiniiuetits should bu based on the ascertained litncss for the ten- , ure of so far by the pr. oi'ice, and should, as practicable, be fitted notion of worthy and cflicicnt all otlicial misconduct .should he tirnmid and thorough. The views expressed in the foregoing are those which will govern my administration of the Kxccutivc oflice. They are doubtless shared by intel ligent and patriotic citizens, how ever divergent in tneir opinions I as io ine nest (urinous oi putting mem uuo ' practical operations. For example the as- ascertained is one w hich lias tor years ex cited interest and discussion. The measure which, with slight variations in its details. has lately been urged upon the attention of congress and tho t.xecutive lias as its prin cipal feature the scheme of competitive ex amination, save lor certain exceptions, which are not here specified. This i .l.ui would allow admission to service only ill lis lowest grade, and would accordingly demand that ail vacancies in higher positions should be filled by promo tion alone. In these particulars it is iu conformity with the existing civil service system of (ileal Ihitain, and indeed thesiic- ecss which has attended that system in the country of its birth, is the strongest argu ment Miich has been urged for its adop tion here. The fact should not, however, he overlooked that there are certain features of the Kuglish system which have not gen erally been received with favor in this country, even among the foremost advo cates ol civil service reform. Among llwm are (Irst, a tenure of oflice, which is sub stantially a life tenure. Second, a limita tion of maximum age at which an applicant can enter service, whereby all men in the midst of life, or older, are, wuu some exceptions, rigidly excluded; third, a retiring allowance oil going out ol olP.ee. These three clement are as important factors ot tbc problem ns any ol t ie others To eliminate them from tlie Knglisli sys tem would cllcct a most radical change In its theory and liracticc. Thi uvnu-i.,1 purpose of t lint system is to induce the ed ucated young men ot the country to devote their lives to public employment, by an as surance that having once ' entered upon it I hey need never leave it and that alter volun tary retirement they shall be the recipients of an annual pension. That this system ns an entirety has proved very successful in tireat liritnin, and seems to" bo generally conceded even by those who once opposed ilsadopti To a statute which should incorporate ail of its essential features I should feel bound to give my approval, hut whether It would he for thu best inter ests of the public to fix upon it as an expe dient for immediate and extensive applica tion, which embraces certain features of the Kuglish systems, hut excludes or ignore) others of eipial importance, may lie seriously doubted even bv those who are impressed, us I am myself, with thu grave importance of correcting the evils which herein present the methods of appoint ment. If, for cxamnlc. the '. nelis i rule which shuts out persons above the age of iwcniv-uve years irom a large number of employments is not lo he made m essential part of our own system, it is ques tionable whether the attainment of the highest number of marks at a competitive examination should hen criterion by which all applications for appoint ment should bo put to test, and under similar conditions it niav also be a question whether the admission to ihe .-rune suimiiii oc strictly limned to its lowest ranks. I here are very many char acteristics which go to make 'amodcl "crvant; prominent among them are probity, industry, good sense, good habits, good temper, patience, order, courtesy, iaei, sen-reliance it in i manly deference to superior pincers and manly consideration mr inietiors. i He absence ol those traits is not supplied i,y Wi,lu knowledge of hooks or by promptitude in answering quest tons, or by any other quality likely lo he brought to light bra competitive cxani amiuation. To make a success in such a contest, then-fore, an indcspensahle condi tion of public employment would very likely result iu the practical extension ol the older applicants, even though they might possess Jpialilications'lar; supe rior to their younger and more brilliant competitors. These suggestions must not be regarded as evidenco of any spirit of op position to tho competitive plan which has been to some ex tent successfully employed already, and which niny hereafter vindicate ll'ie claim of its most earnest supporters. Hut il ought to he seriously considered whether ine application ol some educational standard to persons of mature years and to voung men Iresh from school and college would not likely result In more intellectual pro ficiency above other dualities of ouual or greater importance. Another feat urn of me proposed system is the selec tion, by promotion, of all otllcers of the (fovornment, above lowest grades. rrcrol uo1i a. would fairly ho regarded as exponents of i or m f oi mo executive unit the princi ples of tho dominant tmrtv to afford en couragement to the boilifnl oiihli,. .,,p,. by exercising it, their minds the hope of iMooiouoii, ii mcy Hrc lound to merit It, is much to ke desired. Hut would it hn rulo so riL'iil an to liprniit lio other mmiiwtr ot supplying the Intermediate wants of the service. There are many persons who fill subordinate positions with gient credit, but lack those qualities which aro so requisite for the higher posts of duty, and because the mode of thought mol of one whose presence in a gov ortnenlnl bureau has been long continued are olten so crannied bv routine nrncmlitrn as almost to disqualify liim from Instituting changes required by tho public interests. An infusion of new blood from time to tmio into tho middle ranks of the servieo might lm beneficial In lis results. Tim ol,l..i .i..' discusion is ono of crave Imnortnn rn,n uTiis which are complained of cannot be erniiicnieu ai once; t lie work must be grad mil. Tho present Kuglish svslem is t rrowtti oi years and was not created by a sing e stroke' of tlm tfruoiiivn n nr legislative action.

If Congress should deem it advisable at the present session to establish a competitive test for the admission ol service, no doubt such us have been suggested 1 bhall not deter from giving the measure my earnest support, ami I earn estly recommend that should this be a failure to pass any other act upon this sub ject, that an appropriation of $ii,0o0 per year may he made for the enforcement of section 1753 of the revised statutes. With the aid thus all'ordcd me 1 shall strive to execute the provisions of tho let ter according to its letter, and I um unwilling in justice to the present civil servants of government to dismiss this sub ject without declaring my dissent from tho service, and almost indiscriminate censure with w hich they have heenrecentlvtissiiiled. That they are as a class indolent, inctlicient and corrupt, as a statement which has been often made and widely edited, hut when the extent, variety, delicacy and importance of their duty or duties are considered, the great majority of the employes of the liov ernmcnl are, 'in my judgment, deserving of high commendation. 

MARIXK AfKAIKS. Tne continuing decline of the Merchant Marine of the United Slates is greatly to he deplored, in view of the lin t that we furnish so large a proportion of the freights of tho conimercini world, and that our shipments are steadily ami rapidly increasing, it is a cause of surprise that not only as the navi gation interests are diminishing, but it is less than when Jiur ciports and imports were not half aslurgu as now.either in bulk or value, mere must be some peculiar hitiderance to the development of the inter est or enterprise, anil . energy of American mechanics and capitalists who have kept this country at least abreast of our rivals in the friendly contest for ocean supremacy. The substitution of iron for wood, umi of steam for sail, have wrought great revolt;, tions in the carrying trade of tho world. Hut these changes could not have been ad verse to Americu, if we had given to our navigation interest a proportion of special aid mid protection that has been so wisely bestowed on our manufactures. I com mend the whole subject to the wisdom of Cnneresi, with the suggestion that no ques tion of greater magnitude or further reaching iniporiaiice can engage their consideration. In 1S7.1 tlie Supreme Court of the United States declared unconstitutional that stat ute of certain States which imposed upon ship owners or consignees u lax of $l.,ri for each passenger arriving from a foreign country, or iu lieu thereof required u bond to iiiilcinnil'y the State and local authorities against expense lor future relief in the support of such pas senger. Since this decision the ex pense attending the care and supervision of emigrants lias (alien on the States lit whose ports they bane landed. As a large majority of such immigrants immediately upon their arrival proceed to the inlunil stales and tho territories to seek permanent homes, it is manifestly unjust to impose upon the stale, who.e shores they first reach the- burden it now hears. Fiir this reason, and because of the national impor tance of the subject, I recommend legisla tion regarding the supervision and transi tion of immigrants at the ports of debarkation. 1 regret to state that the people of Alaska have reason to complain that they are yet unprovided withany form of government by which life and property gnu be pro tected.
