THE MESSAQE. The President's Message, which we publish in our paper lo-day, with tho accompanying Proclamation, has been anticipated with un common interest. Kvcrjliody wero anxious lo know what Mr. Lincoln would say about the negro and " reconduction." And on these as well as other matters, he has expressed himself clearly and distinctly. In regard to cniancipa- t'on he is firm its a rock. lie takes no step backward. No slave freed by his emancipation proclamation shall ever again be a bondman, And bis plan for ' tcconstruction " seems to us simple, piacticable nnd just. We tliink it will give very genet nl satisfaction to all loyal and sensible people, and, viitb some modifications perhaps, will be adopted by the country. The terms on which he proposes to receive back the seceded States wo need not here repeat, ns eve ry one will lead them for himself in the Presi dent's own language. 'I he leaders of the re hellion and those who have taken nny pnrt in earning it on, will understand what their fale is to be, and have an oppot Utility to shape their conduct nccoidtnoly. The message gives an encouraging view of our affairs and prospect All danger of foreign interference has passed by.
