TIIK I'HESWKXrS MKHSAOK. Tlio i ortlon of President Cleveland's annual niewmgc which will command the first attention of the financial and business Interests of the country Is that relating to the currency , with which the message concludes. This will be somewhat disappointing to those who have expected from the president 

BOIUC new and valuable suggestions on this very Important subject , to which It has been reported he was giving careful and pa tient study. It seems that the task of formulating a plan for n new bank cur rency system has been left entirely with the secretary of the treasury , and that official presents for the .consideration of congress and the country a modified form of the : plan adopted nt the laat meeting of the association of bankers and known as the Baltimore plan. The president Hlmply indorses tills scheme as In his opinion furnishing a basis for very great Improvement on our present banking and currency system. It Is questionable whether , as a whole , the Carlisle plan Is preferable to that adopted by the bankers. The latter pro vides for a guaranty fund of r > per cent , to be built up gradually , while the for mer requires a deposit with the govern ment In United States legal tender notes , Including treasury notes of 18Xj ! of 110 per cent of the amount of the bank'ti circulation , this deposit to be maintained at all times. As a means of withdraw ing from circulation currency that men aces the treasury gold reserve this re quirement may be approved , but would the banks be'disposed to Issue currency upon such terms ? .Is not a , ' ! 0 per cent guaranty fund excessive and unneces sary , and therefore certain fo defeat the object of the proposed changu , which Is to supply n larger and more elastic circulation ? In addition to the guaranty fund there Is to be a safety fund of f > per cent , for the redemption of .the notes of failed banks , so that undei the plan of Secretary Carlisle the bank ? would be compelled to keep on deposit with the government an amount of cur rency equal to H."i per cent of their iioh Issues. It Is very questionable whothei a great many banks would care to Issiu notes under such conditions. The Car lisle plan proposes to relieve the na tional treasury of all responsibility foi the redemption of bank notes , and ir tills respect will perhaps be more gen rally acceptable than the Baltimore , ichcine , although holders of notes of In olvent banks would secure promptei edemptlon under the latter , which pro Ides that when the guaranty fund slml lot be Riifllc'ent for redeeming sucl lotes they shall be redeemed out of anj noney In the treasury , the same to b < 'oliubnrsed ' when the money Is rcplcii shed. " Another feature of the Car Isle plan will Invite criticism nd that Is the provision that then hall be no national bank notes Ismiet f less denomination than $10. The In : entlon of this Is to make place for mon liver In the circulation , and It wil loubtless be favorably regarded bj iome of the silver men , though It Ii uirdly enough of a sop to induce then o support the plan. The propose ! scheme recognizes the recommendatloi if the democratic national platform fo he repeal of the tax on state bank Is mes , and this will probably comment t to the favor of the southern demo ratio representatives. So far as seem1 ty Is concerned , the Carlisle plan I stronger than that of the bankers' asso elation , but as we have already said I s doubtful whether banks would Isstn currency on the terms It proscribes. The president briefly and pointed ! ; ilefonds the Issue of bonds to replenisl he gold reserve and points out the dlfll cultlos in the way of maintaining th reserve under existing conditions. II says that If these conditions arc nl .owed to continue bonds will be Issuei as often as It becomes necessary t maintain a sufllcleut gold reserve am n abundant time to save the credit o he country and make good the flnancki obligations of1 the government. Thl blunt avowal will very likely subjec the president to some sharp erlticisn .nit his position will be approved b everybody who believes that he has n lilgher duty than that of keeping th inihllc credit unimpaired. Brief spue is devoted to the tariff. The preslden says the new law needs amendment : uiil he Is still In favor of putting cor .uid . iron on the free list , but he doc no more than make a simple state mm : to tills effect , thereby suggesting tlm he has no hope that It will be done. II would be glad to see the different ! : ' duty on refined sugar stricken out of tli law and recommends the abrogation c the discriminating duly on sugar froi countries paying an export bounty. 1 Is probable that congress will do botl thu course of the sugar tr-ust having s- Intensified public feeling against tin arrogant and rapacious monopoly tin congress will hardly dare to dlsrcgar the sentiment In favor of a modlflcatio of the sugar schedule In the Interoi of consumers. Mr. Cleveland Is In fnvc of free , ships and recommends the r peal of the law denying American regi try to foreign built ships owned 1 Americans. There will be very genon agreement with his declaration that tl millions now paid to forelgivers f ( carrying American passengers and pr ducts across the sea should be Uirnt Into American hands. The president does not favor an I crease of the army , but he suggests tin Its effective strength should at least 1 made equal to Its legal strength , th being demanded by the development c Beacoast defense . In this he Is In a cord with popular sentiment , which strongly against an Increase of the arn beyond the legal limit. Provision fi thu construction of additional bait ships and torpedo boats Is recommcnde but there Is no probability that ti present congress will assume the rcspo Mblllty of uolng thin. It is a matt that can wall for such Improvement the revenue of the government as w warrant the expenditure. The review of the work of the sever departments Is comprehensive and tl president approves the recommendatloi of the several heads of departments , 1 devotes a paragraph to n vigorous d fense of tlio administration of the pe slon bureau , buff It will hardly servo persuade the threat majority of unit veterans that the party In power h : really a very friendly regard for the Interests. Nobody Is blind or Indifferent to the fact that pensions have been fraudulently obtained , tint this does not Justify the unjust and ungenerous corra uloplcd bj * the present administration In the matter of purging the pension rolls. That was unquestionably of n character to Justify the charge of un friendliness toward the veterans and there Is abundant evidence that It re sulted In doing a great wrong to many of them. Tlio president commends the report of the strike commissioners , says a good word for civil service reform , and recommends the creation of a na tional board of health. The message of the president Is thu best source of olllclal Information re garding our foreign relations , and the review of these by Mr. Cleveland will be found very Interesting and Instruc tive. The administration hart buou sub jected to a great deal of criticism re garding Its treatment of International affairs , but It Is believed that after read ing what the president submits candid men will be disposed to concede that there Is little just ground for fault finding. The questions that have arisen have been considered and' acted upon with reference to the established policy of thu country , and while some mis takes have been made the results on the whole are satisfactory to those who be lieve In the wisdom and safety of that policy. It Is certainly true that the na tion has lost nothing In the respect of the world by adhering to it. Tlie message is a practical , businesslike - like document , notably free from the peculiar characteristics which distin guish most of Mr. Cleveland's deliver ances , and will repay careful perusal for the great amount of useful Informa tion It contains.

'JJIH THAXSMIXSlSSll'l'l Congressman Bryan made himself prominent as the free silver champion In the TrnnsmlsslssippI congress , and as chairman of the commltteu on resolu tions reported thu resolution calling for the free nnd unlimited coinage of silver and gold at thu old ratio of 11 ! to 1 , "without waiting foi the aid or consent of any other nation on earth , " and succeeded In securing Its adoption after a sharp light. It does not necessarily follow , however , that thu Nebraska delegation to that congress was really committed to the free silver fallacy. Kncli state invited to participate in the transactions of the Transmlsslsslppl congress was entitled to ton votes as a minimum nnd to as many votes In ad dition thereto as there were accredited representatives In attendance. The Ne braska delegation consisted of eight men who held credentials either from the governor or from thu mayors of the dif ferent cities who were authorized te give them. Besides these was Mr Bryan , who was accorded membership by virtue of his position ns representa tive In congress. The ten votes of 'Ne hraska were therefore cast by the nine delegates. AVhen finally the monctarj question was squarely presented for the action of the congress In the motion tt adopt the minority report of the committee mitteo on resolutions a a'd'cu'thlcl ' ; took a conservative stand favoring hi metallism , but only such bimetallism as should be amply protected against t'.u ' depreciation of any money authorize ! ' by law the vote of the Nebraska dele gatlon was found to be divided. Five 01 the members were emphatically In favoi of honest bimetallism , while only four , In eluding Mr. Bryan , were ready to be en rolled under the free silver banner There was one extra vote to be cast bj the whole delegation , but the imijorltj was inclined to be generous with theii associates and agreed to divide' ' It wltl them. The vote of Nebraska , then , 01 the acceptance of the minority report thu report that substantially repudiate * the free and unlimited coinage doctrine was nyfj In favor of thu same to 4V against. Had there been a unit rule ii force Nebraska would have appearo < only In the honest money column. The significant point to which nttcn tion should bo directed Is that the frei silver agitators can no longer depcm upon Nebraska support and that whal ever strength they ever had In Nebraski Is noticeably on the wane. Bryan , th head and front of the free sliver move ment in this state , retires from publl life with the conclusion of the proycn session of congress , his exit dlsturbei by tlio reflection tnat lie was able t carry with him only a minority of th Nebraska delegation In his great pla ; before thu Transmlssisslppl congress. AOT ( HUTU SO CUMFLK'ATKD. The following excerpt from a rocen editorial In the Chicago Uocord afford an excellent Illustration of the mistake Impressions concerning matters of loci' moment that are constantly create abroad by misleading nnd Ill-consldere comment appearing from time to tlm In some of our contemporaries : Ily one of those fantastic legislative el forts which arc occasionally to bs wltcesse In law-making bodies the ctty of Omaha ha not enough money to run Its schools , an the reason It Is In this predicament I chiefly and directly because the Omaha si loons are not sufficiently patronized. * * And until that queer law Is repealed Omali has but one alternative to follow , The clt zons may taketo drink , thereby sccurlii enlightenment and learning for the ! children ; or they may remain abstinent an let the children go untaught. The fate of tli school Is dependent upon the fate of tl saloon. The two are tied together. Of course It Is needless to xfty th : Omaha Is In no such condition and tin the f miners of the Nebraska llqtior lir were by no moans such bunglorrf as tli Record has boon led to believe. It Is n < because of the license law that tli money derived from liquor licenses go ( Into the treasury of the school "dlstrli In which they are procured. It Is'n mai datory provision of the cons'tltutlc that the proceeds of police court flm nnd the sale of licenses of all kinds 1 applied to the support of the publ schools. It has just HO happened tin the money derived In this way has fi a number of years sntllccd with but small addition ml sod by municipal tn : atlou to maintain the public school ay tern of Omaha. As a result , the tax le\ for school purposes has been kept dente to the minimum point , lint the tax lot can always be relied upon lo make i any necessary deficiency. Upon the facts as they are , the re oiling of tlm Record la not only fnlln * ions but (4) ( ) olutcly absurd. The PPQ le of Omit ; Jire not nt all required tote ike to diilil to continue Ily ? work of istructlon * < j r their children In the chools. The license money paid by anana pe djers and the lines paid by Isturbers .otiilhe peace are employed or the salUu > laudable object of foster- ig popular.education. Must thu cltl- ens of Onmji ? all engage In peddling ananas ami combine to constantly dls- irb the pyifa ) In order to secure en- ghtenineiil 'ilntf learning for their lilldren ? Thu complication does not xlst. The OiUahff school board Is con- routed with the same demand for econ- my that Is pressing the school anthorl- os In other cities , but whatever sum Is enlly needed will be cheerfully raised y taxation. Wheat and flour were never so cheap s now. The staff of life is within easy each of the unfortunate ones of earth. S'ow If the price of Omaha meats , fa- ions the world over , could be reduced to ic local consumer the problem of sub- Istenco would bo nearly solved. Needy - ody seems to know why Omaha canned leats should bring the same prices In Nebraska that they do In England. Tlio advantages of the Omaha public brary ought to be one of thu attractive iducemeiits to the people of South Omaha to give serious consideration to he question of annexation.

Under re- "Ubllcan presidents since 1BE5 there hns been inlform reduction of the public debt , with he exception of a slight increase In Grant's second term. The public bonded debt on August 31 , 18G3. aggregated J2.381in30.295. on which the Interest charge was $150,977,693 n year. This debt was In twenty-seven years reduced by $1,796,493,193 , and the Interest charge fell to $22,894,194.

It appears that the defeat of the re pub- lean candidate for governor In California while the republicans elected the other state otllccrs and most of the congressmen and secured a majority In the legislature was due to Kstep's personal unpopularity. He was looked on as the candidate of the fouthern Pacific road , nominated througli ts .Instrumentality , and pledged to Its In- erests. That corporation Is not popular In California , and , as a consequence , Estce suffered. If his party had put up a mar not suspected of being under the thumb ol in odious , grasping corporation ho woulc nave been elected. And If such a man hat been put In nomination on an honest mono ) platform he would have received a tre mendous majority. The republicans blun dered both In their candidate and their plat form.

TIIK T.VITr WITH J- . I'lilladdptila Hccord : The most Important article In the new treaty with Japan , which has Junt been elgtied by Secretary Qresham and Minister Kurlno , representing their re spective governnifiils. Is without doubt that which provides for the abolition of consu lar courts and tor the submission of foreign residents of Japan to the Jurisdiction ot tin- tlve magistrates. This Is a concession to which the Japanese have manifestly become entitled by their marvelous progress In the ways of western civilization. It was a stig ma upon modern Japan to be classified with those barbarous peoples among whom It Is still necessary to maintain the principle of oxtrn-tprrltorlallty. New York Herald : Ily the treaty which was signed In Washington by Secretary Ores- ham and Minister Kurlno , and which will doubtless be ratified by the senate when It convenes , the United States welcomes Japan to the family of civilized nations. It provides for the abolition In Japan of the American consular courts , which arc maintained only In eastern countries with semi-barbarous Ideas as to tlio administration ot justice , and concedes to Japan the sovereign right con ceded to every civilized nation of Jurisdic tion over the persons and property of Ameri cans within Its -own borders. This step Is creditable and advantagrons nlike to the United States and Japan. Though necessary In seme eastern countries , our consular courts abroad are foreign to our Ideas of government and administering Justice. They have been the source of wrongs and abuses which have evoked loud complaint and protest. The United States as well as Japan Is to be con gratulated on their abolition In that country.
