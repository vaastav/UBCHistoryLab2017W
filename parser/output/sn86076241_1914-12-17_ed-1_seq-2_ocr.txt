THURSDAY . EVENING - , DECEMBER 17, 1914 Weather predictions, like some women, are often fair but false. oo ; Rushing the Russians seems to be General von Hinden'ourg's favor ite form of exercise. oo- Perhaps Carranza would be just as happy now. if the Americans hadn't evacuated Vera Cruz. oo ".. , It is all right to urge a stronger navy; it is all wrong to lie about the navy we have, i . . oo . ' Life isn't all beer and skittles, ' but then most people are willing enough to do without the skittles, whatever they inay be. v . oo It is hard to say whether it is more grimly humerous or sickeningly pathetic Germany fining Belgium for violating her own neutrality. oo If the casualty rate of the first four months of the war keeps up. peace may soon be obtained by the simple process of elimination. oo Another outrage that calls for a clarion note from the Oyster of Oyster Bay is Mr. Taft's persistent and pestilential happiness over the election figures. oo "We never have had, and while we retain our present principles and ideals, we never shall have, a large standing army."
