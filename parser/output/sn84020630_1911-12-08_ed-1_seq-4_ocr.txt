The last of the reports of territorial governors has just been issued by the 6r- . V T .v I of interesting documents which nave followed the development of the com- j monwealth for several decades ana contain much of value to the historian and the statistician. Of late years, the reports have been much reduced in size compared with the monumental reports that were made during the Otero administration, each year's re port covering more than 500 pages and bountifully illustrated with half tone pictures and colored maps. This last report of Governor Mills is much less pretentious, covers less than 50 pages. . . .. .... i and yet in its businesslike tone and I'l its SUiieill llguiea, gives a muaiicu synopsis, a complete epitome of the year's progress. Governor Mills reviews concisely injIt g. . u , the opening paragraphsi the major im- . '" ' provements of the year and then gives Law ! Do w Sf some space to statehood and the adop- "ty of the law?

He said that every 10 mills, or almost 31 per cent in two ; year sees thousands of new laws, years is dwelt upon. The reduction ! many of them inspired by partisan or of the bonded indebtedness to less ! private motives. The citizen is be- than a million dollars as the fruit of an economic and wise financial Admin istration, is emphasized. The assess ment for 1911 is shown to be $60,048,- 880, and declared to be on the basis j of only twenty per cent of the real i value. The value of the territorial institutions is given as $2,006,640.58 outside of their land grants, and their income is about $600,000 a year. The total resources of New Mexico . banks is given as $7,039,427, and of the j 0poly is created by Uncle Sam when building and loan associations as,ne grants a patent to an inventor. $1.331 293. During the fiscal year, 183 corporations were authorized to do business in New Mexico and their au thorized capital is given as $46,989, 000, a considerable decrease from the year previous. The public schools, the various ter ritorial institutions, the different de partments of the territorial govern ment, are reviewed briefly, and statist tics are given that show their growth and advancement. The public land grants are enumerated and their ad ministration is reviewed. A chapter is devoted to farming ir rigation, dry farming, water power, stream gauging, good roads, national forests, the stock industry, the nation al guard, mining, game and fish, health conditions and the New Mexico Mus eum and School of American Archae ology. In conclusion, two recommendations are made: An Act by Congress, pep mitting homeseekers to buy public land to the maximum of 640 acres, and an act appropriating sufficient funds to complete the Scenic Highway across the Pecos forest. It must be admitted, that the close study of immigration statistics, of in corporations, the decline in homrstead entries, small increase in assessment, and some of the other statistics, show that despite the coming of statehood, from which such an impetus towards prosperity was expected. New Mexico has not done as well in a material way, in its stock industry, In its min ing enterprises, in the way of new railroads and the influx of capital, as had been expected or as it did in prior years. The general unrest, the politic al agitation, the uncertainty of the fu ture, may have all combined to make the year 1911 one of transition rather than one of material progress and achievements.

In another two months and the leg islature will be in session, with sev- enty-three members, each of them ' with his own ideas about the needs of New Mexico in the line of legis- lation. As a result there will be add ed two or three hundred statutes to the already heterogenuous mass of laws on the New Mexico statute books. Tne demand for laws and more laws, is created by the fiction of abuses that must be remedied by laws, of new wrinkles in legislation that will bring happiness, prosperity, and the millenium for all. Les ne s uctiuj luuay t fletIong y.hich lie's Weekly today speaks of one ot nave resulted especially in a demand for laws to curb corporations, to leguiate them ! and tn nrinrrnl them nut til existence. Cortelyou, in an impressive address wildered and discouraged by their very multiplicity and by their per plexing and often contradictory pro visions. How true this is! Yet the only remedy for abuses, large or small, is more laws, new laws, larg- er statute-books and more work for the lawyers! "There is no such thing as mono poly. It is a fiction, pure and sim- Die The nearest approach to a mon- But we never hear any one complain ing that Edison has made too much money or that any inventor ought not to receive ell the returns he could get from the brains he put into his inventions. "People talK about a monopoly in steel, sugar, oil and other things. Not one of these is controlled, even to the extent of one-half, by the great est of the corporations engaged in their respective lines. "The country is dotted with inde pendent steel plants, a great inde pendent sugar refinery is about to be opened in Philadelphia, while new oil refineries are scattered all over the land. "Fiction! Public opinion is based on fiction. If the yellow newspaper says it is so, the people believe it is so No matter 'f it proves to be un true; that ract is quickly forgotten when the next untruth is uttered. When new fiction appears, the public is impressed by it all the same. It swallows it, and a falsehood travels the world around before Truth can get on its boots to overtake it." Tariff agitation has cost wool and sheep growers of the West $50,000, 000 the past year declares President Frank L. Gooding of the National Wool Growers' Association. That Is a pretty big price for political taut, and it is not the sheepmen alone who pay it, for $50,000.000 . depreciation in any industry or property is bound to affect all business enterprises ad versely and eventually every work ing man. Republican victory next year is essential to sop this agitation and talk from which New Mexico is suffering perhaps more than any other commonwealth.

"President Taft is setting a new precedent in sending to Congress separate messages on each subjec: treated heretofore in the general message that it has been customary for presidents to send to Congress whenever a new session convened. On Tuesday, the president's message was devoted entirely to the trust problem and from the non-partisan standpoint it was an excellent discus sion of the subject to which all par ties can well subscribe without sac rificing any principle. Yesterday's message deals with the foreign relations of the United States government and indirectly emphasi ed the leading position that this na tion has taken in the world and its close contact with problems which heretofore it could afford to ignore. The progress of arbitration is indicat ed although it is admitted that in the matter of the Chamizal zon at El Paso, arbitration proved abortive, Much space is given to the troubles in Mexico and the mobilization of the army in Texas, and the conclusion is drawn that "The policy and action of this gov ernment were based upon an earn est friendliness for the Mexican peo ple as a whole, and it is a matter of gratification to note that this attitude of strict impartiality as to all fac tions in Mexico and of sincere friend ship for the neighboring nation, with out regard for party allegiance, has been generally recognised and has re sulted in an even closer and more sympathetic understanding between the two republics and a warmer re gard one for the other." The crying need of a merchant marine is discussed and at the same time it is said: "The fiscal year ended June 30, 1911, shows great progress in the de velopment of American trade. It was noteworthy as marking the high est record of exports of American products to foreign countries, the val uation being in excess of $2,000,000, 000. These exports showed a gain over the preceding year of more than $300,000,000." Many have thought the United States so pre-eminent in agriculture that it could "feed the earth" with out asking .much odds of the rest ol the world; and yet, according to the secretary of agriculture, we imported in 1911 the very considerable value of $697,000,000 worth of things taken from the land. Snow Failed to arrive Although the weather bureau had predicted snow for last night and today, the day dawned cloudless. But the weath er bureau is a persistent cuss and now predicts snow for tonight and to morrow.

It is becoming evident that some of our older orchards are not produc ing as abundantly as they did ten years ago. There are too many short crop years, and inspection of the or chards discloses the reason in the lack of the vigorous appearance which the trees once had. The greatest fault, however, is in the abnormal growth of wood and this is the very neglect against which we have been preaching for many years. A 200-acre orchard in Otero county is a terrible sight Just because this precaution has not been followed and the flight of each year makes the .trouble more complicated for the trimming should be done while the limbs are small, says the Denver Field and Farm. Then, too, as a rule all trees in this country are planted too closely and their roots are interlacing and fight ing for what there is to eat. It is evident that the problem of fertilizing out orchards must be taken up seri ously and it is truly a great problem. We do not know how to solve it. We wish we did. Surface face treatment is comparatively easy and if it were only the surface with which we have to deal nobody need worry. But most of our orchards on irrigated land are bound to run away with themselves in their ravenous growth. The main part of their root-feeding system is many feet under ground. How to get nourishment to a starving- root ten feet under the surface which has con sumed all the material within reach we have not yet discovered, but have an Idea that the question may be solved by using some soluble fertiliz ing material in the Irrigating water. WORK DONE BY GOVERNMENT So Far Approximately 14,000 Families Have Been Furnished With Suit able Farms In West. Approximately 14,000 families are now residing on farms watered by ir rigation canals, built by the govern ment in the last eight years. That means a population of about 25,000 added to the cities, towns and villages in this irrigated country as a direct result of the government's work. So we may truthfully say, in speaking of what the government's reclamation bu reau si doing, that it is a process of em pire building, says the Omaha Bee. It may be urged that the process Is one of elimination, that the people are simply taken from one .part of the United States and transported to an other part. Even if that were wholly, instead of only partially, true it would still argue nothing against, but every thing for, the achievement It is remarkable, too, how rapidly towns and communities spring up from this irrigated soil. Farmers must have their markets close at hand, their centers of social and spir itual culture and knowledge, and as soon as the government gets through platting its farm land it lays off its town lots and they are eagerly bought up and towns built upon them. And these towns are being built on the foundation of the experience of pros perous and successful people and com munities in other parts of the country, therefore, wisely and substantially built LIVE STOCK NOTES. It is a mistake to overfeed or un derfeed. Do not forget that the hog is a grazing animal. Protein in the food is the muscle building material. It is a mistake to feed constipating feed with nothing to correct it. .Grass becomes less frlatable to Silver Mesh Bags-Leather Shop Bag oca o msruTes an rornia seeu. Ordinarily it is a mistake not to feed the liquid befortf the solid food. If tbe hogs are not fed in a clean place, free from dust and mud, it is a mistake. The fall of the year Is a critical time in the management and care of the sheep flock. Animals need food to butid up bone and muscle and repair the wear and tear on their bodies. The lamb crop of each year is a particularly important consideration with the sheep farmer. In the corn belt hogs furnish one of the most important means of mar keting the corn crop. In breaking a colt it is best to hitch him to a log or a sled for the first two or three times. It will pay any farmer of good Judgment and intelligence to raise high-grade or pure-bred draft colts. One of the first essentials of man aging the sheep flock, in the fall of tbe year Is to provide proper shelter. The cold rains and damp nights of the fall season like those of spring, are a source of constant danger to sheep. The farmer who lives in town should not trust entirely to his hired man; he is likely not to make a suc cess of it. A well-balanced ration is that kind and quantity of feed which will pro duce the best results at the least pos sible expense. See that the hogs have comfortable quarters now and the months to come. Failure here will impair the usefulness of the herd. ' . One need not wait a minute if they so desire, but may begin feeding from tbe top of the silo as Boon as tbey have finished tilling. Pure bred stock cannot be handled in the same shiftless and careless manner that scrub and common na tive stuff is generally dealt QUITE PROMISING.
