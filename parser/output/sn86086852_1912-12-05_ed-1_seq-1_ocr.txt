WARNINB WORDS TO NATIONS President'* Message to Congress I* Expression of Pride In Work Done Abroad by Administration. Washington. Doc. 4, Glorification of "dollar diplomacy'* was the dom inant note of President Taft's fourth annual message, Striking features of the paper were; Note of warning to European pow ers that hy Indirect means continue to discriminate against American trade. Strong defense of the diplomacy of the administration, which is char acterised as "dollars vs. bullets.** Expression of pride In the enormous expansion of American trade, at tributed to the foreign policies of this administration. Appeal to congress to uplift the great foreign policies of America above mere questions of partisanship. Request for joint action by con gress and the executive to open now markets for American industries. The message Is the llrst of a carles of such communications which the president will make to congress in the early days of the session, and deals entirely with the foreign rela tions of the United States. Insists on Just Treatment. Keglnuing with the usual reference to the existing good relations with foreign powers, the president ad.ls that these have been strengthened by “ a greater Insistence upon justice to, American cltlxeus or Interests, wher ever it may have been denied, and a stronger emphasis of the need of a mutuality la commercial and other relations." For the Hist time In Its history, ■ays the president, the state depart ment has obtained subslinitially the most favored nation treatment from all the countries of the world. There fore, ho says. It Is only natural that competitive countries should view with some concern the expansion of our commerce. Hence the warning: "If In some instances the measuros taken hy them to meet it are not en tirely equitable, a remedy should be found.” || T Recommends Graduated Tariff. To this end the president strongly recommends the enactment of the bill recommended by Secretary Knox last December, permitting the govern ment, Instead of Imposing the full maximum rates of duty against dis criminating countries, to apply a graduated scale of duties, up to that maximum of 25 per cent. President Taft makes the direct Charge that the terrible events re corded In Nicaragua recently, the use less loss of life, the devastation of property, the bombardment of the principal cities, the killings and the tortures and suffering, “might have been averted hud the department of state, through approval of the loan convention hy the senate, been per mitted to carry out Its now well-de veloped policy.” "In Central America the aim has been to help such countries us Nica ragua and Honduras to help them selves.'’ says President Taft. Monroe Doctrine and the Canal. While they are the Immediate bene ficiaries, the profit to the United Btutes is two-fold, he adds. The Monroe doctrine Is more vital In the neighborhood of the Panama canal, and such countries should be relieved of the jeopardy of heavy foreign debts likely to provoke International complications. The message concludes with an earnest appeal to congress to co-op erate with the executive In Its efforts to apply the old principles of diplo macy which have governed the coun try to the momentous new situations of today, when America llnds Itself at the threshold of her middle age us a nation "too mature to continue In Its foreign relations those temporary expedients natural to a people to whom domestic affairs are the sole concern."
