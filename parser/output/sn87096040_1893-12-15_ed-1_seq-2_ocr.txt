SYNOPSIS I2MIWACING THE SALI ENT POINTS. Important Matter* DImiiimhI Hnd Rw.oiimieiulritloiift Mailt'—TUe Wll •011 llftll ml or noil—Tlit* Hawaiian Matter Will lie the Subject of a Special Mc-HfUfce. Washington, Dec. 4.—President Cleveland's annual message, which was rend in con gress soon ii/ter ttiut body convened (it noon for Its iltty-tbird regular schkIoii, Is as follows: To the Congress of tlie Uuitcd States: Tim constitutional duty which requires I lit president from tluie to time to Rive the con gress information of the state of the Union and recommend to their consideration such matters as he shall judge necessary is fit tingly entered upon by commending to the congress a careful examination of the detailed statements und well-supported rec ommendations contained in the reports of the heads of departments who are chiefly charged with the executive work of the government. Iu an effort to abridge this communication iik much as Is consistent with Its purpose, 1 shall supplement a brief reference to the contents of these depart mental reports by the mention of such executive business and Incidents as are not embraced therein, and by such recommend tlons as appear to be at this particular time appropriate. While our foreign relations have not at all times during the pnst year been entirely free from perplexity, no embarrnsslcg situ ations remain that will not yield to the spir it of fairness and love which characterize a truly American foreign policy. Of the outbreak In IirazU the president suys: The struggle Is between tne estab lished govt rnment, which controls the ma chinery of administration, and with which we maintain friendly relations, and certain officers of the navy employing the vessels of their command In an attack upon the national capital and chief seaport, and lacking, as it does, the elements of divided administration, I have failed to see that the insurgents can reasonably claim rec ognition as bellgerents. Thus far the posi tion of our government has been that of an attentive but impartial observer of the un .'ortuuate conflict. The questions affecting our relations with Great Britain have been treated in a spirit between the two governments with a view to such concurrent action as will make the anard and regulations agreed upon by the Bering sea tribunal of arbitration practi cally effective, and It is not doubted that Great Britain will co-operate freely with this country for the accomplishment of that purpose. The dispute growing out of the documentary tolls imposed In the Welland canal upon cargoes of cereals hound to and from the lake ports of the United States was adjusted by the substitu tion of a more equitable schedule of charges, and my predecessor thereupon sus pended his proclamation Imposing discrim inating tolls upon British transit through our canals. A request for additions to the list of extraditable offenses covered by the existing treaty between the two countries is under consideration. A Special Hawaiian Hninge. It is hardly necessary for me to state that the questions arising from our rela tions with Hawaii have caused serious em barrassment. Just prior to the Installment of the pres ent administration the existing government of Hawaii had been suddenly overthrown and a treaty of annexation bad been ne gotiated between the provisional govern ment of the islands ana the United States and submitted to the senate for ratification. This treaty I withdrew for examination, and dispatched Hon. James H. Blount of Georgia to Honolulu as a special commis sioner to make an impartial Investigation of the circumstances attending the change of government and of all the conditions bearing upon the subject of the treaty. After a thorough and exhaustive examina tion Mr. Blount submitted to me his re port, showing beyond all question that the constitutional government of Hawaii had been subverted with the active aid of our representative to that government and through the Intimidation caused by the presence of an armed naval force of the United States, which was landed for that purpose at the instance of our minister. Upon the facts developed, it Beemed to me the only honorable course for our govern ment to pursue was to undo the wrong that had been been done by those representing us, and to restore as far as practicable the status existing at the time of our forcible intervention, with a view of accomplish ing this result within the constitutional limit of executive power and recognizing all our obligations aud responsibilities grow ing out of any changed condition brought about by our uujustltiable Interference, our present.minister at Honolulu has received appropriate instuctlons to that end. Thus far no information of the accomplishment of any definite results has been received. When received they will be promptly sent to cougress, together with all other informa tion at hand, accompanied by a special ex ecutive message fully detailing all the facts necessary to a complete understanding of the case, and presenting a history of all the material events leading up to the present situation. The Trcuanry Department. The secretary of the treasury reports that the receipts of the government from all sources during the fiscal year ended June 80, 1893, amounted to f4ttU716.5Gl.94, and Its expenditures to $459,374,674.29.

The amount of gold exported was larger than any previous year In the history of the government, amounting to $108,680, .844, and exceedlug the amount exported dur ing the preceding year by $58,485,517. The sum paid from tne treasury for sugar boun ty was $9,875,130.88, an Increase over the preceding year of $20,835,309. It is estimated upon the basis of present revenue laws that the receipts of tne gov ernment for the year ending June 30,1894. will be $430. 121,365.38 and Its expenditures t28.000.000. 458,121,365.38, resulting In a deficiency of On the 1st day of November, 1893, the amount of money of all kinds In circulation, Included In treasury holdings, was $1,718,544,682. an increase for the year of $112,404,947. Estimating our population at 6T,426,000 at £he time mentioned, the per capita circulation was $25.49. On the some date was In the treasury gold bullion amounting to $96,657,273, and sliver hellion which was purchased at a cost, of $126,261, 553. The purchase of silver under the law of July 14, 1890, during the last fiscal year, ag gregated 54,008,162.59 fine ounces, which cost $45,531,874.53. The totnl amount of sil ver purchased from the time that the law became operative until the repeal of Its pur Chasing clause, on the 1st day of November, 1893, was 168,674,590.46 line ounces, which cost $155,930,940.84 between the ls,t day Qf March, 18T3, and the 1st day of November, 1803, the government purchased under all laws 503,003,717 fiqe ounces of sliver at a 1 cost of $516,622,948. The silver dollars that have been coined under the act of July 14, 1890, number 36,087.2S.'I. Till1 sclcnlorage arising from such coinage was 0.077.008.89 leaving on hand In the mints 140.699.760 fine ounces of sliver which cost $126,578,218. Our totnl oolaaco of all metals during the last fiBcal year consisted of 97.280,875 pieces, valued at $43,685,178.80, of which there was $30,038,140 In gold coin, $5,343,715 in sliver dollars, $7,217,220.90 In subsidiary silver coin, and $1,086,108.90 lu mlnor coin?. Dup. ing the calendar year 1892, the production of precious metals In the United States was estimated to be 1.596,875 fine ounces of gold, of the commercial and coinage value of $33, 000,00, and 58,000,000, fine ounces of sliver of the bullion or market value of $50,750,. 000, jjjid of the coinage value of $74,989, 000. It Is estimated that on the 1st day of July, 1893, the metallic stock of money In the United States, consisting of coin nud.bulilon, amounted to $1,213,559,169, of which $597,. 697,685 was gold and $015,861,484 was sil ver. One hundred and nineteen national hanks were organized during the year ended Oct. 31. 1893,' with a capital of $11,230,000. I Forty-six went Into voluntary liquidation and 158 suspended. Sixty-five of the sus pended banks were Insolvent, elghty-slx re sumed business and seven remained in the liands of .bank examiners, with prospects of Ippeeay reauaptlon. Of the new banks or ganized fbrjtar-four were located In the East Mis states, fbrty-ttrie ft'est of 4he Mississippi river and thirty-four In the Central and Southern states. The total number of na tional banks in existence on the 31st day of October, 1893, was-3,79u, having an ag gregate capital of $095,558,120. The net in crease in the circulation of these banks during the year was $36,886^972. Silver l'oreliaae Repeal, The recent repeal of the provision of law requiring the purchase of sliver bullion by the government as a feature of our mone tary, scheme has mado an entire change in the complexion of our currency affairs, and I-do not doubt that-the ultimate result of aW action will be most, salutary, and, fir reaching.' 'In' the nature ef things, however, tt' is impossible to -know at this time pre cisely What conditions will be brought abont by the change, or'what. If any, supplement ary legislation may' in the light of sudh conditions, appear to be essential or ex pedient. of course, after the recent flnan gal perturbation, time Is" necessary tm tne AtabllMiment o! business c5nfl3eoee. When, howevw, through this restored con fidence the money which has been fright ened Into li.mrdlng places is returned to trade auit euterprlce, a survey o( the sit uation will probably disclose a safe path leading to a tiei luauently sound currency, abundantly HufUcleut to meet every require ment of our lnciv:tsing population aud of liUKliifHs. In the pursuit of this object wo should reHolutely turn away from alluring nnd temporary (.•xpedlents, ilctcrmlned to be content with, nothing ess thnn a lasting and coupiehcnsivt! financial plan. In theso dicumstauces 1 am convinced that a rea sernble delay In dealing with this subject, instead of being injurious, will increase the niol-abllltles of wise action. PuatoMee Department. The report of the postmaster general con talus a detailed statement of the operations of the postolilcc department duTing the last fiscal year, and mucli Interesting luforma tiou touching this im|ur!:int 1.ranch of the public service. That there wa» a larger dis crepancy thnn usual between the postofllco receipts and expenditures is the expected aud unavoidable result of the distressing stringency which has prevailed throughout the country during much of the time covered by the postmaster general's report. At a date when better times were anticipated it was estimated by his predecessors that the deficiency on the 30th day of June, 1893, would be a little over $1,1)00,000. It amounted, however, to a little over $0,000, 000. At the same time, and under the in fluence of like anticipations, catenates were made for the current iiscnl year ending June- 30, 1894, which exhibited a surplus of revenue over expenditures of $872,245.71 but now, In view of the actual receipts and expenditures during that part of the cur rent fiscal year already expired, the present postmaster general estimates that, at its dose, Instead of a surplus There Will Be a Deflcleacy of nearly $8,000,000. The postoffloe receipts for the last fiscal year amounted to $75,896, 933.10 and Its expenditures to $81,074,104.90. This postofflce deficiency would disappear, or be Immensely decreased If less matter was carried free through the malls, an item of which is upward of 300 tons of seeds and grain from the agricultural department. The total number of postofflces in the United States on the 30th day of June, 1893, was 68,403, an increase of 1,284 over the preceding year. Of these 3,360 were presi dential, an increase in that class of 204 over the preceding year, i-orty-two free delivery offices were added during the year to those already existing, making a total of 610 cities June 30, 1893. Ninety-three other cities and towns are now entitled to this service un der the law, but it has not yet been ac corded them on account of Insufficient funds to meet the expense of its establishment. The railway mall service not only adds to the promptness of mail delivery at all of fices, but It Is the especial instrumentality which puts the smaller and way places in the service on an equality In, that regard with the larger and terminal offices. This branch of the postal service has, therefore, received much attention from the postmaster general, and, though it la gratifying to know that It is in a condition of high efficiency and great nsefnlness, I am led to-agree with the postmaster general that there is room for its further Improvement. The Xnvy Department. The report of the secretary of the navy contains a history of the operations of his department during the past year and ex hibits a most gratifying coudltion of the personnel of our navy. Tie presents a satisfactory account of the progress whlcn had been made in the construction of ves sels and makes a number of recommenda tions to which attention is specially in vited. During the past six months the de mands for cruising vessels have been many and urgent. There have been revolutions, calling for vessels to protect Ameri can Interests la- Nicaragua. Gautemala, Costa Rica. Honduras, Argentina and Bra zil, while the coaditlon of affairs In Hono lulu has required the constant presence of one or more ships. "With all these calls upon our navy It became necessary, In or der to make up a sufficient fleet to patrol the Bering sea under the modus vivendi agreed upon with Great Britain, to detail to that -service one vessel from the fish commission and three from the revenue ma rine. The following vessels of the new navy have been completed and are now ready for service: The double turreted coast de fense monitor Miantonomoh, the double turreted coast, defense monitor Monterey, the armored cruiser New York, the pro tected cruisers Baltimore, Chicago, Phila delphia, Newark. San Francisco, Charles ton, Atlanta and Boston, the cruiser De troit, the gunboats Yorktown, Concord, Bennington, Machlas. Castlue and Petrel, the dispatch vessel Dolphin, the practice vessel Baucroft and the dynamite gunboat Vesuslvlus. Of these the Bancroft, Ma chlas, Detroit and Castlue have been placed In commission during the current calendar year. The following vessels are In progress of construction: The second-class battleships Maine and Texas, the cruisers Montgomery and Marble head and the coast defense monitors Terror, Puritan, Amphitrlte and Monadnock, all of which will be completed within.one year the harbor defense ram Katahdln and the protected cruisers Co lumbia, Minneapolis, Olympla, Cincinnati and Raleigh, all of which will be completed prior to July 1, 1895 the first-class battle ships Iowa, Indiana, Massachusetts and Oregon, which will be completed Feb. 1, 1896, and the armored cruiser Brooklyn, which will be completed Aug. 1 of that year. It Is also expected that the three gunboats authorized by the last congress will be completed in less than two years. Immigration. The superintendent of immigration, through the secretary of the treasury, re ports that during the last fiscal year there arrived at our ports 440,703 Immigrants. Of these 1,063 were uot permitted to land under the limitations of the law, and 577 were returned to the countries from which they came by reason of their having become public charges. The total arrivals were 141.034 less than for the previous year.. The admonitions of the last two years touching our public health and the demon strated danger, of the Introduction of con tagious diseases from foreign ports has in vested the subject of national quarantine with Increased interest. A more general and harmonions system thun now exists, acting promptly and directly everywhere and constantly operating by preventive means to shield our country from the In vasion of disease and at the same time having due regard to the rights and duties of local agencies, would, I believe add greatly to the safety of our people. Sea Coant Defenxei. It is gratifying to note that we have be gun to attain complex results In the com prehensive scheme of sea coast defenses and fortification entered upon eight years ago. A large sum has been expended, but the cost of maintenance will be Inconsider able as compared with the expense of con struction nnd ordnance and at the end of the current calendar year, the war depart ment will have nine 12-inch guns, twenty 10-inch and thirty-four 8-Inch guns rendy to be mounted on gun lifts and carriages, and seventy-tlve 12-Inch mortars. The munuf:n-»ure of heavy ordnance keeps pace with current needs, bnt. to render these guns available for Ihe purposes they are designed to meet emplacements must prepared for them. 1'rogress has been made In this direction and It Is desirable that, congress by adequate appropriations should provide for the uninterrupted prosecution flf this necessnry work.

AKrieuKlirr, The report of the secretary of agriculture will be foitul exceedingly interesting, es pecially to tli»t large part of our citizens Intimately concerned in the agricultural oc cupation. On the 7th day of Marol),'-U93, there was upon Its pay rolls 3,4"/) employes. This number lias bceeu reduced to 1,850 per sons. Ill view of a depleted public treasury and the imperative demand of people for economy In the administration of their gov ernment, the secretary has entered upon the task of rationally reducing expenditures by the eilmiu'.itibu from the pur rolls of all persons uot needed tor an efficient conduct of the affairs of the department .fiuring the first quarter of the present year the e* ponies of the department aggregsted'$34$r J7U.76, as iigalnst $402,021.42 for the. oorr^ jponding period of "the fiscal year, ending June 80, 1893. The secretary .ipakes «lpar- eht hi* Intention to continue this rats re duction by submitting estimates for the next fiscal year less by $994,380 than those for the present year. The amount "M the appropriation for the bureau of aulmal industry for tho current fiscal year Is $856,000. The estimate for the ensuing year is $700,000. The regulations of 1892 concerning Texas fever have been en forced during the last year, and the large stock yards of the country have been kept free from Infection. The total number of inspections of cattle for export dhrlng tho past fiscal year was 611,'542. The exports show a foiling off of about 25 per cent from the preceding year, the decrease occurring entirely in tho last half of the year. This suggests that the falling off may have been largely due'to an Increase In the price of American export cattle during the year .ending June 30,1893. Bxporta of inspected pork aggregated 20, 677,410 pounds, as against 38,152,874 pounds for the preceding year. The falling off in this export was not confined, however, to inspected pork, the total quantity exported in 1892 being 665,490,016 pounds, while In 1893 It was only 527,308,695 pounds. The exports of agricultural products from the United States for the fiscal year ending June 30. 1892, attained the enormons fig ure of $800,000,000 in round numbers, being 78.7 per cent of our total exports. In the last fiscal year this aggregate was greatly reduced, but, nevertheless, reached $015, 000,000, being 75.1 per cent of all American commodities exported. A review of our agricultural exports with special, reference to their destination, will show that in al most every line the United Kingdom of Great Britlan and Ireland absorbs by far the largest proportion. Of cattle, the total exports aggregated in value for thejlscal year ending June 30, 1893, $26,000,000, of which Great Britlan took considerably over $25,000,000. Of beef.4roducts of all kinds, our total exports were $28,000,000, of which Great Britlan took Sf The Pension Bureau. On the 30th day of June, 1893, there were on the pension rolls 966,012 names, an in crease of 89,944 over tho number on the rolls June 30, 1892. Of these there were seventeen widows and daughters of revolu tionary soldiers, 86 survivors of the war of 1812, 5,425 widows of soldiers of that war, 21,518 survivors and widows of the Mexican war, 3,882 survivors and widows of Indian wars, 284 army nurses and 475,645 survivors and widows and children of deceased soldiers and sailors of the "War. of the Re bellllon. The latter number represents those pensioned on account of disabilities or death resulting from army and navy service. The number of persons remaining on the rolls June 30, 18S&I, who were pen stoned under the act of June 27, 1890, which include also pensions oil account of death and disabilities uot chargeable to army -service, was 459,555. The uuniber added to the rolls during the year was 123, 634, and the number dropped was 33,690. The first payments on pensions allowed dur ing the year amounted to $33,576,549.98. This Includes arrears or the accumulation between the time from which the allowance of the pension dates and the time of act ually granting the certificate. Although the law of 1890 permits pensions for disa bilities now related to military service, yet: as a requisite to Its benefit a disability must exist In Incapacitating applicants' "from the performance of manual labor to -'ii -li a degree as to render them unable to won,,t-i .sedition of this law.

This has had the effect of limiting the operations of the law to its intended purpose. The discovery having been made that many names had been put upon the pension fcoil by means of wholesale and gigantic frauds,' the com mission suspended payments upon a num ber of pensions which seem to be fraudulent or unauthorized pending a complete exami nation, giving notice to the pensioners li) order that they might have au opportunity to establish, If possible, the justice of their, claims, notwithstanding apparent'invalidity. I am unable to understand why-frauds in' the pension rolls should not be exposed and corrected with thoroughness and vigor. Ev ery name fraudulently put upon these rolls is a wicked imposition upon the kindly sen timent in which pensions have their orlgn.' The Indiana.

Nothing so Importaht claims our atten t'en and nothing so dearly, presents Itself As both an opportunity and a duty—an op- tQ fiu? $24,000,000. In the year 1839 the congress appropri ated $1,000, to be taken from the patent office funds, for the purpose of collecting and distributing rare ana Improved varie ties of seeds and for prosecuting agricult ural Investigations ana procuring agricult ural statistics. From this small beginning the seed division of the department of ag riculture has grown to Its present unwieldy and unjustifiable extravagant proportions. During the last fiscal year the cost of seeds purchased was $06,548.61. The remainder of an appropriation of $135,000 was ex pended in putting them up and distributing them. In each state and territory an agricultural experiment station has been established. These stations, by their very character and name, are the proper agencies to experiment with and test new varieties of seeds, and yet this indiscriminate and wasteful dis tribution by legislation and legislator con tinues, answering no.purpose unless it be to remind constituents that their representa tives are willing to remember them with -gratuities at public cost. Civil Service Reform. The continued Intelligent) execution of the civil service law and the increasing ap proval by the people of its operation are most gratifying. The recent extension of its limitation and regulations to the em ployes at the free delivery postofflces, "which has been honestly and promptly accom plished by the commission by tne hearty co-operation of the postmaster general, is an immensely important advance in the use fclness of the system. I am, If possible, more than ever con vinced of the Incalculable benefits conferred by the civil service law, not only in its effect upon the pnbUc service, but also, what is even more important, in its-effect in elevating the tone of political life gen erally. Since 1886 congress has at each session authorized the building of one or more ves sels, and the secretary of the navy pre sents an earnest plea for the continuance of this plan. He recommends the authori zation of at least one battleship and six torpedo boats. While I am distinctly in favor of consistently pursuing the policy we have inaugurated in building up a thor ough and efficient navy, I can -not refrain from the suggestion that the congress should carefully take Into account the num ber of unfinished'vessels on our hands and the depleted condition of our treasury in considering the propriety of an appropria tion at this time to begin new work. observe the gratitude of our fellow citizens, a duty- imposed upon us by our oft-repeated professions and by the emphatic mandate of the people.

If nobility may be estimated In dollars, the mnle is a nobler animal than the horse, says the New York Sun. Yet there are no autumnal mule shows, nnd even If there were It Is hardly probable that flower ndorned young women wonld make a prac tice of patting the prize animal. The onlv way to pat a mule, according to the Texas code. Is with a fence rail or a board. The man who culh-i-ted horse and mule statistics for the census report shows that the average prleo a mnle_ is $7 more tliau the average rlcc of a horse. -The ordinary mule in Carolina, which owns about ho.OOO of the long-eared lieasts. Is worth about $90: the average price of a horse In the same state Is aliont $70. Texas probably lias more mules (aliout 200.000) than anv-other state. The average price is about '*41, or nearly twice the value of Texas horse. In Missouri mules are worth about $7 more and In Kentucky about $3 more than horses. Only ?i few states have no rnules, or so few that the statistician didn't make a note of them. One of these states is Rhode Island, which the mule driver of Texas doubtless would think is not any too large a pastur age and play ground-for a festive mule of Southern blrtli. Oregon Is the only state, where horses lirl.ig higher prices than mules. The ordinary mule out there Is worth $46 nnd the horse $51. The figures for nlCallfornla are: Mules, $07 horses, $46. In roiinsylvnnln, where mules, famous for longevity, are timcli used In the .mines, they bring about $86: horses, $67. In this state there arc seventy times as -many horses as there are mules, which number about 14,000. A New York mule is worth $91 nnd a horse $76. Mules are prized more in New Jersey than In any other state, the average price being nbont $106. or $30 more than horses. Illinois has about- 140,000 mules, or more than any other Western state.
