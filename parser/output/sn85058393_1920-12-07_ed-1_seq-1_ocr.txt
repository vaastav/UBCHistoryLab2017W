LINCOLN QUOTED " 'Let us have faith that right makes might and In tha! faith let us dare to do our duty as we understand it.' A sentence Immortal because it embodies in a form ef utter sin.plFltv and purity the essential faith of tho nation, the faith In which it vvas Con ceived and the faith In which It has grown to glory and power. With that faltlv. and the birth of a nation founded upon it came the hope Into the world that a new order' would prevail throughout the affairs of mankind, an order In which reason anel right would take precedence of covetousness an dforce, and I believe that I express the wish and purpose of every thoughtful American when I say that this sentence marks for us In the plainest manner the part we should play alike in the arrange-j ment of our domestic 'affairs and in our exercise of influence upon the af fairs of the world. By this faith, and) by this faith alone, can tho world be 1 llft.ij out of its present confusion) and despfJIr. 

FAITH PREVAILS. "It was this faith which prevailed over the wicked force of Germany. You will remember that the begin ning of the war came when German; people founel themselves face to face, 1 with the conscience of the world and realised 'bat right was everywhere ar rayed against the wrong that their government was attempting to perpe-1 trate T think, therefore, that It Is true to say that this wis the faith which won the war Certainly this, is the faith with which our gallant, men went Into the field and out Upon, the seas to make sure of victory. "This l-i the mission upon which democracy came into the world. De- j mocracy Is an assertion of the right; of the individual to live anel to be treated justly as against any attempt on the iart of any combination of I individuals to make laws which will overburden him. or which will destroy, his equality among his fellows In the matte,- of right or privilege, and I! think we all realize that the day has come when democracy !s being put upon Its final tes-. The old world Is, Just now suffering from a wanton rejection of the principle of democ racy and a substitution of the princi ple of autocracy as asserted in the ; name, but without the authority and sanction of the multitude. This is j 1 he time of all others when democracy should prove its purity and its spirit ual power to prevail H i surely the manifest destiny of the United States to lead in the attempt lo make this spirit prevail HOW l S CAN Ml "There are two ways in which thei United Slates can assist to accom plish this great object First, by of- forlng the example within her own borders of the will and power of de-j mocracy to make ami enforce laws which are unquestionably Jus' and which are erual in thlr ail m Inlstra tion laws vvaich secure its full right to labor and yet at the same, time safeguard the integrity of property, and particularly of that property which in .l. vot.d to the development of Industry and the increase of the necessary wealth of the world. Sec ond, by standing for right and Jus tice as towards individual nations. The law of democracy is for the protec tion of the weak and the Influence of every democracy In the world should be for the protection of the weak nations, the natiort which Is strug gling toward Its right and toward its proper recognition and privilege In the family of nations. VNNOT REF1 BB ROLE. The United States cannot refuse this role of champion without put ting the stigma of rejection upon the great and ilevoted men who brought Its Bjovernmenl into existence and es tablished it In the face of almost universal opposition and intrigue, even In the fate of wanton force as, for example, against tho orders In council of Great Britain and the arhl trarv Napoleonic decrees which in volved us In what we know as the war of 1SU'. I urge you to con ,i,i. r thai the display of an Immedi ate disposition on tho part of con gress to remedy any injustices or . vlla that may have shown themselves In our own national life will afford the most effectual offset to the forces of chaos and tyranny which are play ing so disastrous a part In the or t uncs, ..f the free peoples of more than one part of the world. The United Siat. s Is of necessity the sample de Mui. i'ai "I the wen Id and the tri umph of democracy depends upon Its success. ' 1 t ROPE Ki t O BR1 SLOW. "Recovery from tho disturbing and sometimes disastrous effects of the late war has been exceedingly slow on the other side of the water and has given promise, I venture to say, of early comple tion only In our own fortunate country; but even with us the r- covery halts and 1 impeded at times ami there are immediately serviceable acts of legislation which U seems to mo Wo ought to attempt, to assist that recovery and prove tho Indestructible 1 ecuperative forco or a great governmont of tho people. BUDGET sWlEM URGED "One of these Is to prove that a great democracy can keep house os successfully and in as buslnoss-llke a fashion as any other government. It seems to mo that tho first step to wards proving this is to supply our selves with a systematic method of handling our estimates and expendi tures and bringing ihem to the point where they will not be an unnoces- BBBBaflj sary strain upon our Income or ne- , -it.ite unreasonable taxation, in other words, a workable budget sys tem. anel I respectfully 'suggest that two elements are es-eentlal tei such a system; namely, not only that the proposal of appropriations should be In the hands of a singles bodv such as a single npprnprlat'.ons committee In each house of the congress, bu also that this body should be brought inte such cooperation with the de- partments ef the government and with the treasury of th- United States! as would enable it to act upon a com- j plote conspectus of the heeds of 'he, frovernment and the resources from which it must draw- i s Income REASON FOR VETO. "I reluctantly vetoed the budge: bill passed by the last session of the I congress because of a constitutional I objection The house of representa tives subsequently modified the bill In order to meet this objection! In the revised form 1 believe that the bill ' coupled wlih action already taken by tho congress to revise Its rules anel procedure, furnishes ihe foundation for an effective national budget sys tem. I earnestly hope therefore, that one of the first steps taken by the present session of the conct'cSS Will be to pass tho budget bill FIN y i s 

IMPROVED. ' The nation's finances have shown marked improvement during the past year. The total ordinary receipts of f. 094.000,000 for the fiscal your 1920 exceeded those for 19.19 by 11.642. -000. 000, while Ihe total net ordinary expenditures decreased from $1!.3H. 000,000 to $ C . 4 0 3 , 000,000. Tho gross public debt. Which reached Its highest point on August 31. 19! 9. when It vvas '.'. r.Pii.ofni , h,-,,i dropped on No vember 30, 1920, to 24.lTo.000,000. There also has been a marked de crease m hob lings of government war securities by the banking Institution1! of the country as well as In the amount of bills hebl by tho federal reserve hanks secured by government war obligations. TM fortunate re sult has relieved the hanks unl left them freer lo finance tne n Is pf ag riculture. Industry and commerce. It has been due in large part to the re duction of the public debt, especially of the floating debt, but more par ticularly to th Improved distribution of government securities among per manent Investors. UD1 R J ST Hi is "The cessation of the government's 'borrowings except through short term certificates of Indebtedness has been p. matter of great consequence to the people of the country at large, as well as to the holders of Liberty bonds and Victory notes, and has hail 1 an important bearing on the matter of effecthi- credit control. The year has been characterized by the pro gressive withdrawal of the treasury from the domestic credit market ami from a position of dominant Infill I ence in that market. The future course will necessarily depend upon I the extent to which economies are practlceel and upon the burdens plac I ed upon the treasury, as well as upon industrial developments and the main- tenance of tax receipts at a sufflclent- 1 IV High lev el. BIG FLOATING DEB1 j 'The fundamental fact which at I present elomlnates the govern mcnt's , financial situation is that seven and ; a half billions of its war indebted ness mature Within the next two and in half years. Of this amount two and a ha'.f billions are floating debt I and five billions Victory notes and ' war savings certificates. 

FISCAL PROGRAM. ' The fiscal program of the govern ment must be detei mined with refer ence to these maturities Sound pol icy demands that the government ex penditures he reduced to the lowest amount which will oe-rmit the various services to operate efficiently and that government receipts from taxes and salvage b" maintained suft'n ientlv I high to provide for current require ments Including interest and sinking I fund charges on the public debt and at tho same time retire the floating jdebt and part of the victory loan be fore maturity, with rigid economy, '.Igoro us sil operations and ade quate revenues from taxation, a sur plus 01 euireni reccipis oer curi'li' I expenditures can be realized and should be applied to tho fleiatlng debl I All branches of the government should I co-operate to see that this program is realized. F( F.s.siTY OF ECONOMY. "1 cannot over-emphasize the neces sity of economy In government appro-; prlatlons and expenditures and the I avoidance by tho congress of practices I which take money from the treasury, by indefinite or revolving fund appro-1 I prlatlons. The estimates for the prea-! lent year show that over a billion dol lars of expenditures were authorised by the last Congress In addition to the amounts shown In the usuul compiled, statements of appropriations. "This Strikingly illustrates the hn portnnce of making direct and specific appropriations. The relation between the current receipts and current ex Ipendltures of the government during tho present fiscal year, as well as dur lQg tho bust half or the last fiscal year, has been disturbed by the extraordln iary burdens thrown upon the treasury I by the transportation act. 111 connec tion with the return of the railroads' Ito private control, over IGOO.OOO.OOu i I has already been paid to the railroads under this act $250,000,000 during1 ;the present fiscal year; and It Is esti nnted that further payments aggre-1 gating possibly 1660,000,000 must still 1 be made to the railroads during the I current year. It Is obviouH that those) largo payments have already seriously! limited the government's progress In retiring the floating debt. TAX LAW
