ARIZONA WlliS OVER THE WAR DEPARTMENT THE TAX COMMISSION ORDERS TAX REFUNDED At the city council meeting Tuesday night, a communication from the Tax Commission concerning a claim by the Mountain States Telephone, and Telegraph Company, for a refund of a part of a tax recently paid ,was rtwd. It stated that the State collects all taxes from telephone and telegraph lines and the proportion of the tax due to cities and towns and counties is paid them by the state. The town, therefore, has no right to levy a direct tax, and the tax already collected by the town is illegal and is to be re funded. A motion was carried that the re fund, amounting to $13.64, be made. The communication also stated that the Town had no legal right to col lect an occupation ax from the tele phone company. Manager Bunton of the company, stated .however, that his company would pay the occupation tax to the present time and hereafter would allow the town the use of three telephones free of charge in lieu of an occupation tax. ' Mr. Bunton stated that the free use of these three phones was in the nature of a contribution for the sake of good fellowship. 

PHOENIX, Dec. 2 ler of currency of the United States, George E. Downel, has recently hand ed down an opinion in the matter of the payment of members of the Na tional Guard companies that are as signed to certain special duties by the adjutant generals of the states, that relieves the secretary of war and the division of militia affairs of the United States army of one of the things that has caused more embar-1 rassment than any other matter with which they have to deal, and that is the disbursement of funds, provided for the national giJard by enactment of congress and allotted to the various states, according to the number of congressmen each state has. It has been the custom for the dis- busements to be made by warrant through the disbursing officer detailed from the national guard, but all of these warrants have been made sub-, ject to auditing by the war depart ment. If for any reason the auditor for the war department withheld pay ment then the states were out. This , situation happened once too often, and the kick, which finally knocked over. the complex structure, came from Ari zona, having been made by Colonel Charles W. Harris, the adjutant-general of the state, who as Captain C. W. Harris, disbursing officer, paid out certain moneys upon order from him; self as adjutant general.

Although Arizona has only two thirds of the population of New Mex ico, yet, it has more large towns than this state, as is indicated by the postal receipts for the past fiscal year just made public by the postoffice de partment. Of nine cities whose re ceipts exceed $20,000 a year, six are located in Arizona. Arizona postof- fices in that class had more than double the receipts! 1 of New Mexico postoffices above the 20,000 mark, to-wit, $247,473, as against $JL13,798 in New Mexico. The twenty postoffices with receipts of more than $10,000 a year in two states rank as follows, and at the same time indicate -the twenty largest towns: Phoenix $96,568 Albuquerque 63,29.8 Tucson 48,280 Bisbee 32,589 Roswell ; 26,5S4 Douglas : '. I 26,417 Santa Fe 23,916 Prescott 21,885 Globe 21,734 Raton s 16:530 East Las Vegas1 . 14.782 Silver City 14,013 Clifton 12.179 Deming 1 12,089 Yuma 11,853 Flagstaff . 11,803 Clovis 11,184 Miami 11,114 Tucumcari v . . 10,484 Las Cruces ; 10,058 The receipts are the money derived from the sale of stamps only. In other words, Albuquerque has grown to be three times the4 size of Santa Fe, Tucson twice the size, and Phoenix more than four times the size of the oldest city of them all, which thirty years ago was the Jargest town in the two commonwealths,- and had a greater population than either El Paso or Colorado Springs or than both taken together, while forty years ago it was larger than Los Angeles and fifty" years ago larger than Denver, and there was a day when it was the largest town in what is now United States and Canada.

President Wilson's message, deliver ed in person, to congress yesterday, is the briefest regular message ever sub mitted by a president to congress, and has many salient features for. the American people to ponder o'er. Vlctoriano Huerta, dictator of Mex ico, is denounced as a usurper. It is made plain that pretended govern ments such as his will not be counte nanced or dealt with by the United States. "Huerta's power and prestige are crumbling and his collapse is not far away," says the president. , ' Congress is told that the country awaits with impatience for the enact ment of the currency bill and the sen ate is urged to concentrate on it until the matter is disposed of. The president devotes a considerable portion of nis short message to a rec ommendation for the enactment of laws which will facilitate rural credits."; Congress is urged to enact laws which will not make it necessary for the gov ernment to resort to such extraordi nary expedients as the distribution of deposits in Western banks to help move the crops. More explicit legislation aimed at the trusts and supplementing the Sher man Anti-Trust law is recommended. The president promises a special mes sage a little later onthis subject. A presidential primary with the re tentions of party conventions to draw nlatforms and carry out the wishes of the people expressed at the primary is recommended. The president recommends that leg islation affecting the Philippines be drawn with a view to the ultimate in dependence of the islands. A territorial government for Alaska is recommended by the president. Legislation looking to improved con ditions for mine labor is recommended. A fair and effective employer's lia bility act is among the recommenda tions. Legislation relating to safety at 'sea, now pending in the house, is also recommended.
