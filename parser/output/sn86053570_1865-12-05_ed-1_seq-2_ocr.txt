Thli docunent la not only his reguLr Anna mes- (, but It must alio bo rlewed aj the In augural of President Johssox, ilno tbla li the first session of Congress assembled sub sequent to tbo assassination of President Lucolh. , Seldom has a Statt paper been more anx iously looked for than thli, and, from a hur ried rerlew of lta content!, we venture to predict that no menage, ilnee the formation of the Oorernment, will be more thoroughly read, erltlclsed, and debated by all daises of people, at home and abroad. It leemt to tu that It moit be everywhere approved by the wise and thoughtful who lor their coun try, lore liberty, and desire to Me the Con itltutlon perpetuated Inviolate and the Union of the Statei preserred forever. The President, after eiprenlng thinks to Almighty Ood for the preservation of the United Statei, and paying a touching and jut tribute to the lamented Lijcolk, pro ceeds at once to announoo with frankness the principles whlea shall guide bis conduct and their application to the present state of affairs. The message discusses with clearness the formation of the Union, and shows that it was intended to be perpetual ; also the framing of the Constitution, developing the truism that it contains within itself ample resources of preservation; that it has power to enforce the laws and puniik trzasok ' This part of the message is worthy of the elosest attention of the statesman and the devoted thoughts of the American student throughout the land. No State can nullify the laws of 'the Union. "The sovereignty of the States, " is the language of the " Con federacy," and not the language of the Con stitution of the United States. The President explains clearly, ably, and elaborately bis views of the mutual relations of the Constitution and the Slates. In this explanation be unfolds the principle on which he has sought to solve the momentous ques tions and overcome the appallng difficulties that met him at the very commencement of bis administration. The President eombats the idea of consid ering the late rebellious States as so much conquered territory. He thinks such a pol Icy would endanger the purity of the general administration and the liberty of the States which remained loyal. The policy of mili tary rule over a conquered territory Implies that the late rebel Inhabitants thereof hare ceased to exist. The President thinks that the true theory Is that all pretended aots of secession were, from the beginning, null and void. If any State neglects or refuses to perform Its oDees, there is the more need that the general Oorernment should maintain all Its authority, and as soon as practicable resume the cxerolse of all Its functions. On this principle President Jon.ison has acted. The President reviews his record in the work of restoration by a very concise and Interesting statement. In exercising the power of pardon the President says he has taken every precau tion to connect It with the clearest recogni tion of the binding force of the laws of the United States, and an unqualified acknowl edgment of the great social change of con dition In regard to slavery.whlch has grown out of the war. He also alludes to the step he has taken to restore the constitutional relations of the States by Invitation to them to participate In the high offlee of amending the Constitution the adoption of which re unites us beyond all power of disruption, and U "a pledge of perpetual loyalty and peace." Having brought the States to the doors of the two branches of the National Legisla,: lure, ne uavet it to tin member t of thole ttro Jodiu to "judge of the elttunt, returns, and qualifications1 of their own memleri' Thus the President, after -faithfully doing his own part of the great work of restoration, with out trenching upon the Legislative branch of the Government with even a suggestion, he leans upon It oonfidlngly, trusting In Its wisdom and good Judgment. We call speoiaJ attention to the President's remarks on the subject of treason and his Sorts) to have traitors tried for that high crime, lie asks the early attention of Con gress to the subject to (he end that, treason. befog a crime, traitors should be tried and punished and the questlonJudlelafTy settled, and the honor and dignity of the Government sustained, , Oa'theJnbJeet'or maklnrthe freedman electors, the President asserts thai he was guided by the Constitution Itself. He thinks the States should control the subject them selves, for the very good reasons which he mbsi ably lays down. He urges Congress to tee to It that the frtedmen for good faith requires it be secured In their liberty and property, their right to labor, and tnelr right to claim the Just reUraot their labor. lie thinks the tuVjtcl should be kept aloof from all party strife, and be dispassionately treat. I. He opposes the Idea of removal and col onisation of the freedmen. lie would rather encourage them to honorable and useful In dustry. The President then proceeds to review the various reports of the heads of the several Departments, to whloh we call special atten tion. The President's statement about the reduction of the Army and consequent ex penses Is highly Important and Interesting. The President declares that It has been and will be bis constant aim to promote peace and amity with all foreign nations and Powers. The President's allusion to the nnparal leled conduct of Oreat Britain In furnishing the rebels from her workshops the'materials of war with which to strike at the life ofhls nation, is Arm, decided, and dlgnlled. lie docs not advise legislation on the subject at present, but declares that "for the future friendship between the two oountrtes must rest on the balls of mutual justice." On the subject of the Invasion of Mexico by the forces of the French Emperor, the President says : "We should regard It as a great calamity to ourselves, to the cause of good government, and to the peace of the world, should any European Power challenge the American people, as It were, to the de fence of Republicanism against foreign In terference." The Presldentconcludes his first great state paper to Congress with a brief and eloquent review of the history of the country, exhib iting the wonderful development of its re sources, its strength and greatness. We congratulate the President, Congress, and the people upon, the wonderful exhibit made In this masterly paper, which Is as fin ished In the elegance of its diction as it is elevated In Its tone and firm and statesman like in Its treatment of all the subjects with which It dealt.

This loDg-wished for and anxiously ex pected document was, in accordance with law. delivered to the Speaker of the House of Representatives to-day, with the other public documents. From an Inspection of It. we are prepared to aay that it Is one of the most Important State papers which has been produced In our national history, making Its appearance, as It docs, at the most critical period of our financial progress. The gravity of the situ ation; tho Immense consequences dependent upon a proper or Improper administration of the finances of the country the tremendous responsibility devolving upon a fiscal minister at the present time all appear to be fully realised by the Secretary; and we have, as a result, a calm, carefully digested and digni fied report, honorable alike to htm and to the country. The public debt, the currency, and the revenue are fho principal topics discussed, and while no special novel views are pre sented or doubt rul financial theories ad vanced, these subjects are bandied In a thor ough manner, evincing patient research and conscientious presentation. The Secretary combats with considerable force the right of Congress, in time of peace, to Issue obligations for a circulating medium aj money, and to make these obligations a legal tender; and, notwithstanding their con venience In tome respects, recommends that the work of retiring the legal-tender notes should be commenced without delay, and carefully continued until all ore retired. Gold and silver being the only proper meas ure of value, the cessation of their use as currency, and the substitution for them of irredeemable paper money, hare contributed la no small degree to tho present Inflation In prices, and consequent danger of financial convulsion. These positions are clearly en forced, and a succinct view presented of the causes of the crisis of 1837 and 1857, which irere attributable to a condition, financially speaking, similar to that now existing. Some of the popular objections to a reduction of the currency are answered with clearness and precision. In view of tho fact that the longer contraction la deferred the greater will be the difficulty of preventing a financial col lapse, the Secretary rcoommends that Con gress declare that the compound interest notes shall cease to be a legal tender from tbe date of their maturity, and that Congress authorise him. In his discretion, to sell Uni ted States bonds bearloir. an Interest not ex. ceeding six per cent., redeemable and paya ble at such periods as may be conducive to the public interest, for the purpose of re tiring not only compound interest notes, but the United States notes, or plain legal tenders. Tbe National Debt is considered as repre sentine a portion of the accumulated wealth of the country, and though a debt to the nation, It Is capital to the citizens. While more than two thousand millions of dollars hare been loaned by the people to the Gov ernment, no branch of useful Industry has suffered from the investment. Notwithstand ing a devastating war has been carried on lot tour years by tne uovernment, freely and loyally sustained by the people of the north-' ern States, still the larger portion of the country has, since I860, progressed both in wealth and population. The public debt. however, Is viewed as a burden upon the resources of the country, as anti-republican In Its tendency, and as adding to the power of the Executive in Increasing federal pat ronage, and it Is contended that the work of removing It should not be long postponed. As to tbe manner in wntcn tbe debt shall bo paid, the Secretary sees no way of accom- pllshing It but by an Increase of the national Income beyond the national expenditure. In a matter of so great importance as this, ex periments are out of place. The plain, beaten path of experience Is tbe only safe one to tread. The first step Is to fund the obligations of the Government, which are soon to mature, and the second to provide for raising revenue necessary to pay the in terest on the debt, and a certain amount an nually for the reduction of the principal. On the 31st of October last, the publio debt, Including funds In the Treasury, amounted to $2,80$, 549,437.65. The receipts for tho fiscal year, Including balance in Treasury July 1, 1864, amounted to $1,808,532,533.24, and the expenditures for the same period were $1,897,674,224.09, leaving a balance In tbe Treasury July 1, 1865, of $858,309.15. The Increase of the public debt for the year was $941,902,537.04, The receipts for the quarter ending Septem ber 30, 1665, Including balance In Treasury July 1, 1865, are $440,226,770 27; the ex penditures $373,068,254 83, leavinga balance October 1, 1865, of $67,158,515.44. Inclu slve of this balance the Secretary estimates the receipts for the remaining three quar ters of the fiscal year at $372,658,515.44, and the expenditures for the same period at $484,653,402 64, leaving a deficiency of $112,104,947.20. The estimated receipts for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1867, are $396,000,000, and the expenditures, accord ing to estimates, will be $284,317,181.88, leaving a surplus of $111,682,818.12. During the months of September and Oc tober the public debt was diminished to the amount of about $13,000,000. Tho Secretary recommends that he be authorised to sell bonds bearing interest at not exceeding six per cent., to meet any de ficiency for the present fiscal year, to reduce the temporary loan, to pay certificates of in debtedness as they mature, and to take up any portion of tbe debt maturing prior to 1869 that can be advantageously retired, A calculation as to the time in which the na tional debt could be cancelled by the appli cation of $200,000,000 annually to its pay meat, shows that if funded at five per cent. It would be liquidated, principal and Inter est, In a little over twenty-eight years; and If funded at five and one-half per cent. It would require thirty-two and one-eighth years for its extinguishment. Measures looking toward Its payment in this manner are recommended It Is suggested that the credit of the five-twenty bonds would be Im proved, both at home and abroad, if Con f;ress should declare that both principal and nterest be paid in coin. Taxation by the States of national securities Is warmly com batted, and it Is oontended that It would he unwise for Congress to grant to the States the power of taxing securities which may be hereafter Issued The subject of Internal Rerenue receives consideration at tbe hands of the Secretary, and although not so fully treated as the cur rency and public debt, yet the suggestions and recommendations are such as will meet the approbation of the country. A oommls ion consisting of three persons, appointed In accordance wun a recent law oi uongress, Zlll li " iwu.vu,, hM been in session for some months revisb-fte Itxetjfc and eoDsldlrlng tho wbolc itthjoct of InUrnU taxation. They have not yet raported, but it" Isfundentood to be their optnl&n that no radical change should be made la our present system, fn reference to tho recently rebel lious States, the Secretary recommends that the collection of Internal' rertnae taxi In those States accruing previous to the estab lishment of collection cCV bo Indefinitely postponed; that salei of property under the dlreet tu law bo suspended until tho States shall hare an opportunity of assuming tho payment of the tax assessed upon them; and that alt transactions In thou fiut.. M-h may be Invalid by reason of the non-use of ibamps, pt .(gained as tar as It Is In the power of Congress to legalise them. The reciprocity treaty with Great Britain Is glanced at, and It Is suggested that after Us expiration In March next, no further trea ties of this character be entered Into, as it Is thought they tend to embarrass congressional legislation on the subject of revenue. A liberal policy Is recommended In regird to the mineral lands owned by the Oorern ment, and it Is thought that an absolute title In fee should be substituted for the Indefinite possessory rights or claims now held by miners Oar revenue marine being adapted for a time of war rather than peace. It Is recom mended that vessels of the larger class be sold, and the proceeds applied to the pur chase of others of a different and lighter draft. Our marine hospital system being consid ered as not altogether satisfactory, it Is rec ommended that such hospitals aa are not needed be sold. The report of the Comptroller of the Car. rency shows that 1,601 national banks had been organised up to October 31, 1803. It Is recommended that these banks be compelled to redeem their notes at one of tbe three principal cities of the country. It Is expected that the anticipated withdrawal of a portion oi me unuea oiaies notes irom circulation, not to speaa oi me resumption or sneoie nav- menti, will so reduce the circulation of tho Northern banks as to afford the South all the piper currency they may need. The condition of tbe Mint, the Coast Sur vey, tne boucitors Department, and the public buildings Is reported as favorable. Commercial Intercourse with the States in Insurrection has been carried on as well as the difficulties Incident to it would permit: and it Is estimated that there will be secured to the Government not less than two hundred thousand bales of cotton ax captured and abandoned property. The report closes with an earnest recom mendation for Increased compensation to the employees of the Treasury Department, es pecially those who occupy positions of trust and responsibility, and requiring an unusual degree of talent and ability for their per formance. Report of the Commies loner of Inter nal Revenue. One of the most Important reports In the annual budget is that of Commissioner Rol lins, of the Bureau of Internal Revenue. The Commissioner explains, In beginning, that Hon. Joseph J. Lewis having resigned July 1st, and his successor, lion. William Ortun, on Noember 1st, ho bad but little time for the preparation of a complete re port. He says: "It Is a matter of sincere congratulation that, thus far, tbe people of this country have so patiently borne tho burden which has been put upon them, and have so freely contributed of their substance to fill the Na tional Treasury. With few exceptions, the demand of the tax collector has been met promptly and willingly. And when It Is rec- ollected that tbe present generation only know by tradition, or by reference to obso lete statutes, that taxes nave ever been Im posed in this country upon articles of their own manufacture, and tne objects or internal traffic, or upon the various crafts or profes sions in which they are employed; and when, too, It Is considered that the revenue thus collected for the single year ending June 30, 1865, amounts to a sum nearly or quite equal to all the recelp'ts of this Government, from whaterer sources except loons and Treasury notes,) from Its organization to tho war of 1812, and when It Is further considered that this amount was contributed at a time when tbe commercial marine of the country bad been nearly destroyed, and more than a mil lion of hardy men were withdrawn from the productive pursuits of life, we may not only be justly proud that tbo national strength has been fully equal to the burden Imposed, but that It has been borne so quietly and so willingly. 

AGGREGATE HECBiTTS. Tho aggregate receipts of Internal revenuo for the fiscal year were 18C3 1864. 1865. 441,003,102 93 0116,850,872 44 $211,120,129 17 These amounts are exclusive of the direct tax, or tax of twenty millions of dollars upon the lands of the country, which has been partially paid In various ways, and the duty upon the circulation and deposits of National Banks, which In 1863 was paid to tho Comp troller of the Currency, and has since been Said to the Treasurer, but are Inclusive of rawback and sums refunded which In the several years were as follows: Drawback.

COST Or COLLECTING) TBI RITBRCR. The costs of collecting the public revenue Is naturally a matter of no little solicitude to the Secretary of the Treasury, aa It Is one ef vast Im portance to the country. A people heavilr subjected to taxation will carefully ecrutlnlie the expenditure of the Gov ernment, especially so faraa they relate tfthe collection or the reTenne ther ira tsixorf tn nrn. It may not be unsatisfactory to submit In this connection a tabular statement of tbe eoste, from time to time, of collecting the revenues of ureal uniain ana ireiana, taxeu largely from the work of J. R. MeCaJloeh, Eq , upon " Taxation and Funding." The per cent age cost of collecting Inland rev enue, after deduction of drawbacke,ln the fol lowing vears. was (in the 100) i 1M0-41 5 5a. ld.upon 26,231,182 1860-61 313 1 42,019,133 The per centage coat of collecting cut to ma, ac cording to the nmt authority, fbefore deducting tbe drawback!, lie , In the following years wast In 1840-1 6 8s 8&d upon 26,341,813. la 18501 6 13s upon 22 019,784. la 1860-1 4 6e 3d upon 23, 276, 250. The actual annual cost to our uovernment for tbe collection of its customs for several years, cannot be determined with accuracy, becauee the expensea of revenue cutters, performing tbe duties of vessels of war, have been paid from the appropriations forcastome, as have other charges connected with commercial Intercourse, and abandoned property. In insurrectionary districts. They will, however, It is believed, not fall celpts ; a per centage not above tbe average for many years past, lo thle country, and, as ft will be observed, much below the cost lu the United Kingdom, for either of tho years above given.

The receipts from distilled spirit for the mouths here reported exhibit no evidence of the amounts consumed, nor of the comparative productiveness of tbe se feral rates of duty; as 92,702,257.72 of that reported In 1865 (July, August, and September, 1864,) accrued from the lmoosltlonof tweotv or slxtv cents per gallon. Tbe same Is true of tobacco; as 91.766,616 79, or more man tnree-quarters oi tne wnoie amount reported la 1865, were derived from the low rates of duty prior to the statute of June 30, 1864. I confldentlv exnect that the recelDte of this office for the current fiscal year will not be lese taan i,i(,wv,uw. Report of Che Comptroller of the Cur rency. The report of the Hon. Freeman Clarke, Comptroller of the Currency, states since the last annual report from this office two hun dred and eighty-three banks new banks have been organised, and seven hundred and thirty-one State banks converted into national associations, making the total number or ganized to November first sixteen hundred and one; of which six hundred and seventy nine were new banks, and nine hundred and twenty-two were conversions from State banks. Submitted with the report Is a statement of the respective States and Territories In which each bank Is located, the paid-in cap ital, tbe currency delivered to each, and the bonds deposited with the Treasurer to secure their notes. Also, a detailed statement of the affairs of each bank on the first Monday of October last, with an abstract of their condition on that day; an abstract of the condition of all the banks on the first days of January, April, and July, 1855, together with the names and compensation of the clerks and other employees, and the total ex- Knses of the Bureau for the fiscal year end g June 30, 1865. One bank bas voluntarily gone Into liqui dation, and has been closed under the pro visions of the law, viz First National Bank of Columbia, Mo ; circulation outstanding, $11,090; circulation redeemed, $78,010. Lawful money bas been deposited with the Treasurer for the redemption of the out standing notes of tho above-named bank, and the bonds withdrawn. Tho First Na tional Sank of Attica, N, Y , has failed,- and a relitver avnotnUd to close BO lis Affairs. Its outstanding circulation; none of. which nas neen presented ror redemption, is t,vuu, which Is secured, by six and five percent. bondi r, m i Under tbe seventh , section of tbe act amending the act to provide Internal rere nue to support the Government, nearly all of the State banks have voluntarily changed Into national associations, and It Is a grati fying fact that this transformation has been accomplished without deranging the business of these Institutions, or a floe ting essentially the volume of bank note circulation. The amount of national banks notes In actual circulation on the first day of October last was $171,321,003. With tho addition of fhe State banknotes, legal tender notes and fractional currency! national bank notes In UUU UUtj J9i 

IB0UVU. BUU unnuuni vuuvuv; yet to be Issued to banks, makes a total of $1,083,452,233. Deducting Stato bank cir culation how outstanding that will be retired about as lbst as national currency Is Issued to converted banks, $78,867,575; also, the amount of " compound Interest notes " con verted Into 5-20 bonds since the 1st of Octo ber last. $14,417,329-$123,284,004; the amount men ioie as ine avauaoie currency of the countrr Is $960,107,328. To ascer tain the amount of actust active circulation there should be deducted from the last-mentioned sum, the amount ot national currency delivered to banks, and not then In circula tion national circulation not delivered to banks; amount or legal tenaer notes neia ny banks. Including $74,201,847 eompound In terest notes; compound Interest notes, other than those held by banks, mostly held as In vestments by Insurance and trust companies and savings banks, less say $10,000,000 In actual circulation, and currency in the treas ury of the United fitatosi making a total of $4917,323,097. Which will show tbe actual circulation to be $160,844,229. Tho Northern States will not ask for the amount of circulation to which their capital entitles them. Bonds have been deposited to entitle the banks now organized to $244, 754,125 of circulation only. In no event will the limit of the act be exceeded. Whatever may have been the Intention of tbe trainers or the federal constitution in respect to the measure of value to be used tn the transaction of business during a time of peace ana in tno ordinary now or events, there Is ample justification for a departure from a metallic currency and a bank circu lation redeemable In specie on demand, In the necessities of the country as superin duced by the unparalleled civil war through which the nation has been called to pass. Now, however, that tho emergency which called for this departure from first principles bas happily been surmounted, It would seem to be the dictate of sound policy to return,as speedily as the financial condition of tbe Government and the business interests of the country will allow, to a more normal con dition of the currency, so that tbe pecuniary relations subsisting between onrsolres and othes nations may be placed upon a more harmonious basis of value. The evils resulting from an irredeemable currency are too well known to require enumeration. They should be tolerated no longer than absolute necessity requires. By a gold valuation of our Imports and exports, the balance that has accrued against this country during the four years previous to the 30th day of June last, Including the Interest on American securities held abroad fmrohased within that time, and also taking nto due consideration the difference between the standard of our own and that of foreign gold, (nine and three eighths per cent.,) has been $308,000,000. By reason of the probable falling off In the export of coin, and the Increased amount of interest to be paid abroad, It Is estimated that the accruing balance during the present fiscal year will amount to $120,000,000, making a total for fire years of $428,000, 000. Our only resource to pay this gold balance against us has been and still Is tbe sale of our securities abroad. Tbe amount required, if sold at an average discount of forty percent., will be $713,000,000, and the annual Interest at six per cent, will bo $12,780,000. The discount of forty per cent, wilt amount to $285,200,000, every dollar of which will bo an entire loss to the country. As the first step to be taken towards a re duction of the Government Issues used as currency would indicate the conversion of all Interest-bearing legal tender notes Into 5-20 six per cent, bonds, It Is believed that the slight contraction caused by such conversion would be scarcely perceptible, more espe cially at this time, as It Is not probable that more tnan nve per cent, or tne wuolo issue is now in active circulation It would be elm ply exchanging one security hold as an in vestment for another. In view of this demand that will nn doubtedly be made for an increase of the na tional bank circulation, and as a gentle mode of further reducing the volume of legal ten der notes. It Is suggested that the national currency act be so amendod ns to allow an Increase of tbe limit to $400,000,000 on con ditions only that all the banks be required to redeem their notes In New York, Boston or Philadelphia, and also that an issue of six per cent. 5-20 bonds be authorized to the amount that It will require to secure the ad ditional circulation under the provisions of tne act, wnicn uonas the banns, when or ganized, shall purchaso as each may require of the Secretary of the Treasury at such fair rate as he may, from timeto time, prescribe, but not less than their par value, and pay for the same In the United States legal tender notes, and all notes so received shall be can celled and destroyed. It Is believed that from a few sources a revenue can bo raised sufficient to meet the Interest on the public debt, pay the ordinary expenses of government, and contribute thirty millions ot dollars annually to a sinning fund that will pay the national debt In thirty-two years and a half. ine tarm can be so aaju&tea as to produce one hundred and twenty millions of dollars; one hundred millions can be raised on whisky, malt liquors, and domestic wines; fifteen mil lions on tobacco; one hundred and twenty five millions on cotton; fifteen millions from stamps; from licenses twenty millions; and irom tne premium on tne surplus or gold, after paying interest on bonds, ten millions, making, In the aggregate, four hundred and fire millions of dollars: a sum probably ono hundred millions In excess of the amount that will be required under an economical administration of the Government, leaving a large margin on the above estimate for re ductton. The estimates, however, of tho rerenue derivable from the soveral sources Indicated are not the result of loose conjec ture, but each Is founded upon a careful in quiry In reference to past productions and revenue under the existing law. It is estimated that the cotton crop the next year will amount to between two and a half and three millions of bales. A tax of ten cents per pound on two and a half mil lions will produce one hundred and twenty five millions of dollars. It Is reasonable to suppose that tbe annual crop of cotton, after two or three years, will equal in amount the average of the crop for a few years previous to 1861, which was about four and a half mil lions of bales. A tax of eight cents per pound on that quantity would produce one hundred and eighty millions of dollars; a sum more than sufficient to pay the intereston tbe pub lie debt after the entire amount Is funded. The license and stamp duties could be dis pensed with after the next fiscal year, and it Is to be hoped that after that period no more Income will be derived from premium on gold Three-fourths of the crops of cotton and to bacco are exported, that proportion, there fore, of tho tax on those articles would be paid bv foreign oountrles, and to that extent contribute to the liquidation of the public debt and relief of our own people. By thus restricting the subject of revenue to a few articles of general production, tho cost of collection would be generally re duced bv tbe dlSchariTfl'of a wbola armv nf .. . ?: . ... f.7" assessors.- collectors, &q. as neuaer puouo ViVr.Tri'iWufia Potior &oi toniilUtlUal tight tin it Pf tent allow the taxation of natltnal banks' fo 0Ute and local purposes.

A penalty should be Imposed npon baiki for Issuing notes with (tho engraved md printed signatures of the officers, Tbe greet est protection against counterfeiting Is founl tn the written signatures of tbose through whom the bills are nttered. Mr. Clarke strongly recommends tbe re moral of , the Bureau to New York ttjy by which o large amount ofmoney would be eavedi-neaxly $200,000 la express charges alone. Unless all possible guards which Ingenuity can devise be thrown around the currency, It will soon, bo' difficult to distinguish the spurious from, the genuine Issue, and banks will be as likely 10 redeem the former as those of tbelr own promulgation. Whatever hostilities the national banking system may have encountered tn Its first In ception, It is no longer denied thnt tt bas entrenched Itself strongly In the feelings, as It has commended Itself to the convenience and Interests of the whole people. While, In conclusion, It Is allowed me to congratulate Congress and the country on the popularity which the national banking system has achieved, I would add the hope that these Institutions may never become subject to the schemes and practices of po litical parties, but that In them and through them the publio faith and credit may be up held, and the prosperity of the country greatly promoted. Fhe euan Clarkb, Comptroljer of tbe Currency. The report Is an able one, and contains many valuable suggestions. It Is very lengthy, and we havo endeavored to select the most Important points, which we here give to our readers. Iteport of the Secretary- of the Nary. Secretary Wells' report fills thirty-four printed pages, In which the grand perform ances and the satisfactory condition of our navy are succinctly and modestly set forth. The capture of Wilmington and its defences, the fall of Charleston and Mobile enabled tho department to reduce the actual naval force very materially, and tbe reduction was promptly accomplished. The reports says : About the lit of May orders were Issued to further reduce the squadrons in our do mestic wators one-half. Near the close of that month a further diminution was direct ed, so that the entire force retained In com mission should not exceed one hundred yes sols. In the early part of July another and still further reduction was made, leaving but thirty steamers, which, with receiving store ships, composed the entire blockading sqaad rons on the Atlantic and the Gnlf. On the 3lst of July the Fotomao flotilla, which, under Commander F. A. Parker, had rendered active service, was disbanded. " The Mississippi squadron, comprising at one time about one hundred steamers, was gradually reduced, and on the Isth of Au gust wholly discontinued. Acting Rear-Admiral Lee was relieved, and Commodore Liv ingston, who had acquitted himself with en ergy at tbe Norfolk station, and subsequently at Cairo, was intrusted with the duty of dis posing of the vessels and closing up the affairs of that squadron. The reduction of tbe blockading force In volved also a curtailment of the number of squadrons. In June, therefore, the North and bouth Atlantlo squadrons were consoli dated into one, known thereafter as the At lantlo squadron, commanded by Acting Koar Admiral Radford, who, on the 28th of April, had succeeded Bear Admiral Porter In com mand of the North Atlantlo squadron. Rear Admiral Dahlgren was detached from the command of tho South Atlantlo squadron. and hauled down his flsg at Washington on the IZtbof July. Acting Roar Admiral Radford, having been appointed commandant of the Washington navy-yard, was succeeded by Commodore Joseph Lanman tn the command of the At lantlo squadron on tbo 10th of October. The consolidation of the East Gulf squad ron, commanded by Acting Rear Admiral Stribllng, and the West Gulf squadron, under Acting Rear Admiral Thatcher, was also consummated, and thereafter this force was known as the Golf squadron. Acting Rear Admiral Thatcher remained In command, and Acting Rear Admiral Stribllng returned to Boston Tn July. Besides the vessels composing the several squadrons, others are In commission In va rious capacities. Tbo James Adger Is stationed at Aspinwall; tbe Michigan is as signed to the .northern lakes; the Sabine Is employed as an apprentice ship; the De Soto is the West Indies; the Massachusetts and South Carolina are still continued as supply ships for the squadrons on the coast; the Constitution, Macedonian, and several others are connected with the Naval Academy; and twenty vessels are used at the nary yards as receiving-ships and tenders; so that there are actually In commission at this time, at homo and abroad, one hundred and seventeen ves sels of all descriptions, whloh jiumber, should the exigencies of the service permit, will be still further reduced. In January, while Rear-Admiral Porter was engAged before Wilmington, affairs on James ther assumed such an attitude, In volving the welfare and security of tbe army by a demonstration on the part of the rebels with their armored rams from Richmond, that It was deemed important to send thither immediately an officer of ability and experi ence, Vice-Admiral Farragut, then In Washington, was selected for this special duty, and on the 24th of that month pro ceeded to James river for that purpose. The threatening demonstration below Rich mond was not long maintained, and the oc casion having passed, Vice-Admiral Farragut was relieved from this special service on tho 2d of February. A special squadron of vessels, consisting of the Vandorbllt, Tuscnrora, Powhatan, and the turreted Iron-clad Monadnock, left Hampton roads on the 2d of November, un der the command of Commodore John Rodgers, destined to re-enforce the squadron In the Pacific. In withdrawing a large naval force from active service, in disposing of tbe vessels, in discharging or detailing to other duties their officers and crews, in making provision for a large surplus of ordnance ammunition and stores, great labor has of course devolved upon tbe department and Its bureaus. Some idea may be formed of the extent of that labor from tbe fact that there were in the several blockading squndrons In January last, exclusive of other duty, four hundred and seventy-one vessels and two thousand four hundred and fifty-five guns. There are now but twenty-nine vessels remaining on the coast, carrying two hundred and ten guns, exoluslro of howitzers. Disposition has been made of all tbe others. Some of the vessels are laid up In ordinary, some with tnelr crews are on loreign service, out many have been sold, and. with most of the men that wero actively engaged in hostile opera tions, are now employed In peaceful opera tions. As soon as our domestto troubles were ever come, the duty of attending to our Interests abroad prompted the re-establishing of the fnrin sin iitnlrnni which had been suspended The European, the Brazil, and the East In dia squadrons have been organized anew upon as economical a soale as Is consistent with their efficiency, the interests oi com merce, and a proper regard for our position as a nation. , . . . . These squadrons, with another which Is soon to be put In operation In tho West In-
