PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE Review of the Affairs of the Nation. Our Relations with Foreign Powers. POLYGAMY AND KU-KLUXISfcI T!IE WASHINGTON TREATY Washington, Dec. 4.—Tlu following i- the presidiut's niessnge delivered to Congress to-day, at noon: Toth* Smoh and House of Reprwntatices: In addressing my third annual message t o tlii? law-waking branch of the Government. : i gratifying to be able to stale Ibat during the past year success ba- generally attended tho efforts to execute all the laws found upon the statute books. The policy ha.-- been not tv> enquire into the wisdom of laws already . tL-iod. but to learn their special intent and enforce thorn accordingly. The past year has, under a wise Providence, I con one of general prosperity to the nation. 1: has, however, been attended with wore than the usual chastisements in loss of life awl property by storm and tiro. These disasters have served to cull forth tho host elements of human nature in our country, and to develop a friendship for us on tho part of foreign na tions, which goes far towards alleviating the di-tress occasioned by the calamities. The be nevolent who have so generously shared their means with tho victims of these misfortunes will reap their reward in the consciousness of I,uving performed a uobh act, and in receiving the grateful thanks of the men, women and iuldren whose sufferings they have relieved. Foreign It. lotions. The relations of the United States with for ign powers continue to be friendly. The year has been in eventful one in witnessing two raat nations, speaking one language, and ( l one lineage,settling.hy peaceful arbitration, disputes of long standing, and liable at any mie to bring these nations into bloodshed and a slate of conflict An example has thus been set which, if suc cessful in its final issue, may he followed by other civilized nations, and ho the final means c! returning to productive industry millions of men maintained to settle the disputes of nations by the bayonet anil broad-sword. Thr Washington Treaty. I transmit herewith a copy of the treaty al ruled to, which has been concluded since the . Ijonmment of Congress with Her Britannic Majesty, and a copy of the protocols of tho conferenced of the Commissioners by whom it was negotiated. This treaty provides methods for adjusting the questions pending between the two ua tious. Various questions are to be adjusted by arbitration. I recommend to Congress, at an early day. to make tho necessary provi sions for the tribunal at Geneva, and for tho several commissioners on the part of the United States called for by tho treaty. His Majesty the King of Italy, the President of tho Swiss Confederation, and His Majesty the Urapornr of Brazil, have each consented, on the joint request of the two powers, to name an arbitrator for the tribunal at Genova. I have caused my thanks to be suitably ex pressed fur the readiness with which the joint request has been complied with by the ap pointment of gentlemen of eminence and learning to those important positions. His Majesty, the Emperor of Germany, has been pleased to comply with the joint request of the two governments, and has consented to act as the arbitrator of the disputed Costar boundary between the United States and Great Britain. The controlling parties in (ho treaty have ndertakeu to regard as settled, between them -elves, certain principles of public law for vluch the United States have contended from ho commencement of their history. They ’:ivo also agreed to bring these principles to the knowledge of other raartimo powers and > invite them to accede to them. Negotia tinns are going on as to tho form of the note I v which the invitation is to be extended to the powers. t recommend the legislation necessary on *hi- part of the United States to bring into peration the articles in the treaty relating to the fisheries, and to the other matters touch ing the relations of the United States towards he British American ijossessions, to become rathe as soon as tho proper legislation -nail be had on tho part of Great Britain and - possessions. It is much to be desired that this legislation may become co-operative be fore the fishermen of the United States begin to make tbeir arrangements for the coming season. 1 have addressed a commnioation, of which i copy if herewith transmitted, to the govorn - 1 New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio. Indiana, Michigan, Illinois and "Wisconsin, urging upon the governors of those states, respectively, the necessity of activity on their part to cany into ■ Toct the object of tho article of the treaty, which contemplates the use of the canals on • ther side, connected with tho navigation of the lakes and rivers, forming the boundary, terms of equity, by tire inhabitants of both ■entries; and it is hoped that the importance ■ f the object, and the benefits to flow there from, will secure tho speedy approval of tho legislatures of the states concerned. Tlic North western Boundary, 1 renew the recommendation for an appro , nation for determining the trite position of the isth parallel of latitude, where it forms ; e boundary between the United States and e British North American possessions, be ■ cn tbo Lake of the Woods and the summit of the llocky Mountains.

Treaty of Commerce vvitli Italy. '1 he ratifications of the new treaty of com merce between the United States and Italy have Keen exchanged. The (wo powers have agreed in then treaty that property at sea shall be exempt from* capture iu ca-e of war bet voen the two powers. The United States have spared no opportunity of incorporating this rule into the obligations of nations. Imcrlnm Claims Against Spain. The Forty-tirst Congress, at its second sos sion, made an appropriation for the organiza tion of a mixed commission for a ijudieating upon the claims of citizens of the United States against Spain, growing out of the in surrection in Cuba, t hat commission has since been organized. 1 transmit a copy of the correspondence relating to its formation and its jurisdiction. It is to be hoped that this commission will afford the claimants a complete remedy for their injuries. It has been made the agreeable duty of the United States to preside over a conference at Washington between the plenipotentiary of Spain and the allied South American republics, which has resulted in an armistice, with the reasonable assurance of a permanent peace. Relations with Russia. The ultima e friendly relations which have so long existed between the United state- and Russia continues undisturbed. The visit of the third son of the Emperor is a proof that there is no desire on the part of his govern ment to diminish the cordiality of those rela tions The hospitable reception which has been given to the Grand Duke is a proof tnat on our side we share the wishes of that gov ernment . The inexcusable course of the Russian Min ister at Washington rendered it necessary to ask his recall, and to decline longer to receive that functionary as a diplomatio representa tive. It was impossible; with a just regard for the dignity of the country to permit Mr. Cat acazy toVontiimc to bold interviews with this government after his abuse of government officers.and during his persistent interference, through various means, with the relations be tween the United States and other powers. In accordance with my wishes, our gov ernment has been relieved of further intercourse with M. Catacazy and the man agemont of the affairs of the imperial legation has passed into the hands of a gentleman en lirely unobjectionable RT:i(ions with .Inpan. With Japan we continue to maintain inti mat.- relations. The cabinet of the Mikadahas, since the close of the last session of (longress, selected citizens of the United States to serve in offices of important departu onfs of the government. 1 have reason to think that this selection is due to an appreciation of the disinterested ness of the policy which the United States have pursued towards Japan. It is our desire to continue to maintain this disinterested and just policy with China an well as Japan. The Comm Troubles. The correspondence transmitted herewith shows that there is no disposition on the part of this government to swerve from its estab lished course, prompted by a desire to put an end to the barbarous treatment of out ship wrecked sailors on the Corean coast. 1 instructed our Minister at I’okin to on deavor io conclude a convention with Corea, for securing the safety and humane treat ment <>f such mariners. Admiral Rogers was instructed to accompany him. with a sufficient force to protect him in case of need. A small surveying party, sent out on reaching the count, was treacherously attacked at a disadvantage. Ample opportunity was given for explanation and apolugy for the insult, and neither came. A force was then landed, and after an arduous march over a rugged and difficult country. the forts from which the outrage had been committed, w ere gallantly assaulted and were destroyed. Having thus punished the crim inals and vindicated the honor of the Hag, the expedition returned, finding it impracticable under the circumstances to constitute the desired convention. I respectfully offer the correspondence re lating thereto therewith submitted, ami leave the subject for such action as Ckut gress may see lit to take. Relation-, with Mexico ami South America. The Republic of Mexico has not yet repealed the very objectionable law establishing what is known as the Frozen Zone, the frontier of tht> United States. It is hoped that this may yet be done, also that more stringent measures may be taken by that republic for restraining lawless persons on the frontier. 1 hope that Mexico, by its own action, will soon re lievo the government of the diffi culties experienced from these causes. Our relations with the various republics of Central and Houth America continue, with one exception to bo cordial and friendly. I recommend action by Congress regarding to the overdue installments under tin- award of the Venezula claim commission of ISC6. The internal dissensions of tins government present no justification for the absi nec of ef fort to meet their solemn treaty obligations. The rat ideation of an extradition treaty with Nicaragua lias been exchanged. Emu net put low in Brazil. It is a subject for congratulation that the gn at Empire of Rrazil has taken the initiatory steps toward the abolition of slavery. Our relations with that empire, always cordial, will uaturalh be more so by this act! It is not too much to hope that the government of Rra zil way hereafter find It for its interest, as well as intrinsically right, to advance toward entire emancipation more rapidly than the present act contemplates. Its true prosperity and greatness as a nation are to be found in the elevation and education of its laborers. Slavery in Spani.lv Colon Its. It is a subject of regret that the reforms in this direction, which were volun tarily promised by the statesmen of Spain, have not been carried out in its West Indian colonies. The laws and regulations for the apparent abolition of slavery in Cuba and Porto Rico have left the laborers in bondage with no hope of release until their lives be come a burden to their employers. Ami TK an* Owning Slaves. I desire, to direct vonr attention to the fact that the citizens of the United States are large holders, m foreign lands, of this species of property, forbidden by the fundamental law of their alleged country. I recommend to Congress to provide, by stringent legisla non, a suitable remedy against the holding, ow ning or dealing in slaves, or being interest ed in slave property on foreign lands, either as owners, hirers, or mortgagers of the United States. Cuba. It is to be regretted that tbo distari mice in the island of Cuba continues to be a source of annoyance and of anxiety. The existence of a protracted struggle in such close prox imity to our own country, without apparent prospect of an early termination, cannot bo other than an object of concern to a people who, while abstaining from interference in the affai s of other powers, naturally desire to see every country in the umiisturl od enioy nn-nt of liberty and the blessings of free insti tutions. O n naval commanders in Cuban water. bave been instructed, incase it should bee -me necessary, to sp re no effort to prefect the lives and property of h ua trie American citi zens and to maintain the dignity of the flag. It is hoped rh.'.t all pending questions with - i ha*- hitherto gu: > . tit- ’-*■ p>-s its Diplein ; • , lioi.v with < hlna and , - In. neuey of our diplomatic relations with Japan and (. hint. at. 1 to further in retaining the good opinion of those people and to secure to the United B:ates its share of the commerce destined to dow h'tween thee© nations and the balance of the romraercial world. 1 earnestly recommend that an appropriation he made to support, at hast, four American youths in each of these countries to severe in the official family of our minister there. Our representative wonld then be placed on an equality with the representatives of Great Britain, an 1 several other powers. Vs now situate.l. our representatives in China and Japan have to depend for interpreters and translators, upon the natives of these coun tries, who know our language imperfectly, or procure for *he occasion the services of em ployes of foreign business houses, or the in torpretors to other foreign ministers. Piicllic Steamship Lines. I would also recommend liberal measures for the purpose of parting the American line of steamers now plying between San Fran cisco and Japan and China, and the Austral ian line, at most our only remaining lines of ocean steamers, and of increasing their ter vice. I Iu Tariff on Tuxes. I recommend that all taxes from internal sources he abolished, except those on spiritu ous, vinous and malt liquors, and tobacco in its various forms, from stamps. In read justing the tariff. 1 suggest that a careful es tiinato he made of the amount of surplus rev enue collected, under the present laws, after providing for the current expenses of the government, the internal account, and a sink - ing fund; and, that this surplus be reduced in such manner as to afford the greatest reve nue. There are many articles not produced at home such as medicines and compounded essences, from which but little revenue is derived, but which outer into general use. Such articles 1 recommend to be placed on the tree lists. Should further reduction prove advisable, 1 would then recommend that it be made up on articles which can hoar it without disturbing homo productions, or reducing the wages of American labor. I have not entered into figures, because to do so would bo to repeat all (bat is laid before you in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury. The present laws f. r oolloolin ■ revenues pay collectors too imall salaries, but provide for shares in all seizures, which, at principal )ffuts of entry particularly raise the compensation ol these officials to a lan . sum. It has alv, ays Boomed to me as if this system must at times work perniciously. It holds out an inducement to dishonest men, should such get possesion of those offices, to be lax in their scrutiny of goods entered, to enable them finally to make large seizures. Your attention is respectfully invited to this snbejet. The \iitioiiul 11. lit. The national debt has been reduced to the extent of 38(1,067,12(1.80 during the year, and by the negotiation of national bonds at a lower rate of interest, the interest of the public debt has been so far diminished that now the sum to he raised for interest account is nearly ♦ 17,000,000 less than on the Ist of March, 1860. It w as highly desirable (hat this rapid diminu tion should take place, both to strengthen the credit of the country and convince its citizens of their entire ability to meet every dollar of liability without bankruptcy; but in view of the accomplishment of these desirable ends, of the rapid develop ment of the resources of the country, and its increasing ability to moot the large demands, and the amount already paid, it is not desira bio that the present resources of the country should continue to he taxed in order to con tinue tnis rapid payment. 1 therefore reconi mend the modification of both tariff and inter nal tax laws. (lulil anil the Currency. Continued fluctuation in the value of gold, compared with the national currency, has a most damaging effect upon the increase and development of the country, in keeping up prices of all the articles necessary im every day life; it foster- a spirit of gambling prejn dicial alike to national morals and *.o national finances. If the question can he met as to how to get a fixed value to our currency, that value constantly and uniformly approaching par with specie, a very desirable object will Lo gained. The Army. For the operations of the army in the past year, the expense of maintaining, estimates for the ensuing your, and for continuing sea coast and other improvements conducted un der supervision of the War Department I refer you to the accompanying report of the Secro tary of War. I call your attention to the provisions of the act of Congress, approved March 2d. isfi!). which discontinues promotions in staff corps of the army until provided for by law. I recommend that the number of officers in each grade of staff corps he fixed, and that when ever the number in any one grade falls below the number so fixed, that the vacancy may be filled by promotion from the grade below. I also recommend that when the office of thief of corps becomes vacant, the place may be tilled by a selection from theeorps in which the vacancy exists. The report of the Score tary of the Navy shows improvement in the navy, and efficiency of the naval force,without material increase in expense of supporting it. This is duo to the policy which has been adopted and is being extended as fast as our material will admit of using smaller vessels as cruisers on the several stations. By these means wo have been enabled to occupy at once a larger ex tent of cruising ground, to visit more frequently the posts where the presence of oiii dag is desirable and generally to discharge more efficiently the appropriate duties of the navy in time of peace without exceeding the number of men or the expenditures authorized , by law. During the past year, the navy has, in ad dition to its regular service, supplied the men and officers and the vessels of the coast snr vey, and has completed the surveys autfioriz ed by Congress of the Isthmus of’ Darien and T chanutepec; and under like authority has sent out an expedition completely furnished and equipped to explore the unknown ocean of the North. The suggestions of the report as to the no ces-ity for increasing and improving the ma terial of the navy, and the plan recommended for reducing the personnel of the service to a peace standing by the gradual abolition of cer tain grades of officers and redaction of others, and the employment of some in the service of the commercial marine, are well considered, and deserve the attention of Congress. 1 also recommend that all promotions in the navy above the rank of captain be by selection instead of by senority. This course will se cure in the higher grades greater efficiency and hold out an incentive to your officers to improve themselves in the knowledge of their profession. The p'resent cost of maintaining the navy, ami its cost compared with that of preceding years, and estimates for the ensuing year, are contained in the accompanying nqiort of the Hecretary tf the Naw The Post OIH c. The enlarged receipts ,f the Poet Office De part men t, as shown try the accompanying re port > f the Postmaster General, exhibits a c vit ing inerea-e in that branch < f the pub fi service. It is the index of the growth of education and of the prosperity ol the peo iagiii , vigor and stability of republics, with a vat tc-rrit -n like ours, much of it spar-ely popn- Ir is , ! at jqfsoni to Ve expected that this era and approach to (bis end from year to yea; t- entit.dfTitly relied ftn. and the da;, is not far the Government will prove a touch greater blessing to the whole people than it is now. The suggestions of the Bust master (ioner.J ' for improvements in the department preside I j over by him are earnestly recommended u ; your especial attention, especially fho ilocn monts favotahlo to the consideration of a plan ■ for uniting the telegraph system of the United Staton with the postal system. It is believed that by such a course the cost ' of telegraphing could tie much reduced, and I the service as well, if not hotter, rendered. It would secure the further advantage by ex tending the telegraph through portions of the country whore private enterprise avrll not con I struct it. | Commerce, trade,and above all the efforts to bring a people, widely separated, into a coin | inanity of interests, are always henettttod i-v Ia rapid communication; and education, iho I grand ground-work of Republican institutions, is encouraged by increasing these facilities, to gether with speedy news from all parts of the country. The desire to reap the benefit of such ini provements will stimulate education. 1 refer yon to the report of the Postmaster (leueral ! for full details of the operations of lust year, and for comparative statements of results wiin former years. Vlic Pul.lie I.nulls, 1 renew my recommendations that (ho pub ( lie lauds bo regarded as a heritage to our i children, to he disposed of only a-* reunited for occupation and to actual settlers. Those already granted have been, in great part, dis ' posed of in such a way as to secure access to the balance by the hardy settler who may wish to avail himself of them; hut caution should lie exorcised even in attaining so de i suable an object. Educational interests may well he served liy the grant of the proceeds of (ho sale of public lauds to settlors. Kiluc itt tonal. [ Ido not wish to ho understood as rocom mending in the least degree a curtailment of what is being done by the general government for the encouragement of education. Die re port of the Secretary of the Interior, submit ted with this, will ive you information, col lected and prepared for publication, in regard i to the census taken during the year 1870, the operations of the Bureau of Education for the y ear, the Patent Oltice. the Pension Ollico, tli ■ Land Ollico anti Indian Bureau. Agile it II u 11'. The report of the Commissioner of Agricul ture gives the op ations of his department for the year. As agriculture is the ground work of our prosperity, too much importance cannot he attached towards labor; and his dw partment is in the hands of an able he* I,with able assistants, all jealously devoted to introducing into the agricultural productions of (he nation all the useful products, adapted to the various climates and soils of our vast territory, and to the giving of all useful infor nintion as to the best method for the cultiva tion of plants Quietly but surely the agricultural bureau is working a groat Nation al good, and if liberally supported the more widely its influence will be extended, and the loss dependant we shall bo upon the products of foreign countries. Sa In i-leg. The subject of compensation to the hoods of bureaus and officials. bolding positions of responsibility and requiring ability and char acter to till properly, and one to which your attention is invited. But few of the oflicials i receive a compensation equal to the respect a 1.1 c support of a family, while their duties are such as to involve millions of interest. In private life their services demand compensa tion equal to services rendered. A wise economy would dictate the same rule in the | government service. ttovcrniui it< Kijii iimi. 1 have not given the estimates for tho sup port of the government for the ensuing year, nor the comparative statement between the expenditures for tho year just passed and the year just preceding, because all these liginvs are contained in the accompany ing reports, or in those presented directly to Congress, Those estimates have my approval. i’l.lltli at Dikiiliilltli M. More (ban six years having elapsed since the last hostile gun was fired bet ween the en emies then arrayed against each other, one for the perpetuation, tho other for the demol ition of the Union, it may well be considered whether it is not now time that tho disabilities imposed by the 14th amendment, should he removed. Jl does not exclude tho ballot, hut only requires tho disability to hold ollico of certain classes. When the purity of the ballot is secure, majorities arc sure to elect officer* reflecting the views of the ma jority. Ido not see the advantage or pro priety of excluding men from ollico merely. They were before the rebellion of standing and character suiliciont to ho elected to posi tions requiring them to take an oath to sup port tho constitution, and admitting to eligi bility those entertaining precisely the same view s but of less standing in thuir communities. It may be said that the former violated an ! oath while tho latter did not. Tho latter did not have it in their power to do so. Ifthev had taken tins oatli it cannot be doubted they would have broken it. as did the funner class. If there are any great criminals, distinguished above all others for the part they took in oppo sition to the government, they might, in tho Judgment of conquerors, lie excluded from such an amnesty. This subject is submitted for your careful consideration. The condition | of (lie southern stales is unhappy, not such as all trim patriotic citizens would like to see; social ostracism for opinions sake, personal violence and threats towards persons on tertanung political views opposed to those on tertamod by Iho majority of the citizens, pie vents immigration, and the flow of much need ed capital into the states lately in rebellion. It will lie a happy condition of country when the old citizens of these Htatcs shall I take an interest in public affairs, promulgate the idea honestly entertained, to vote for men representing their views, permit the freedom | of the press and ballot to tlmse entertaining different political convictions. Tin- Diutrirt of < ilumbln. Under the provisions of the act of Congress approved February Zlst. IH7J, a territorial government was organized in tho District of Columbia. Its results have Unis far fully realized the expectations of i:s advo cates. Under the direction of tho territorial officers a system of improvements has been inaugurated, by means of which, Washington is rapidly becoming a city worthy of the Na tion's Capitol, the citizens of the District hav ing voluntarily taxed themselves to a large amount, for the purpose of contributing to the advancement of the seat of government. I recommend liberal appropriations on tho part of Congress in order that tho government may bear its just share of the expense of ear rymg out various system of improvements, (fori rnnirnl Hiillillngk in (Tilcugo, By tlie great lire in Chicago the most im portant of the government buildings in that city were consumed. Those horned had al ready become inadequate to the wants of the government in that growing city, and looking to tl e near future were totally inadequate. 1 rcc iinmend. therefore, that an appropriation lie made immediately to purchase the remainder of tho entire square >on which tin; burned budding stool, provided it can be pim-ha-e iat a fan valuation, and provided the legislature of Illinois will pa • a law authorizing its occupation for govern ment purposes, and also make an appropri. tint of as much money as can he properly u pended towards the erection of new buildings during this fiscal year. 1 in mlgrat ln. rantd, ig norant of our laws and habits, and coming mi , t.: ountry annually, ban practiced upon them so mum rutm .uul flagrant that I suggest pougiorieional action for thoir protection. It seems to tue the affair is a sub ject of legislation b\ Congress. I cannot now state as fully as I desire the nature of the complaints by emigrants of the treatment they receive, but will endeavor to do so dur ing them :-sion of (..'engross, particular)■' if the subject should receive vour attention. Tin Ku-iUux I,au, There has been imposed upon the executive branch of the government the execution of tin- act of boneless, approved April ittitii, ls7l, and commonly known as the Ku'-Klux law. lr. a portion of the state of (South Carolina the necessity ol the course pursued will he i 'lento list rated cy ,'he report or the cotnntihsion to iuvestigi.te ;,ju hern outrages. Under the provisions of the above net 1 issued a proclamation calling the attention of the poo'.ile of too United States to the ante,and declaring my reluctance to exor cise any of the extraordinary powers thereby conferred upon tue, except in case of im perative necessity, but making known my purpose to exercise such powers whenever it should become necessary to do so lor Ibe put p so of securing to all citizens of the Uni tod States the peaceful enjoyment of the t ights guaranteed to them by the constitution and the laws. After the passage of this law. information was reu'ived front time to time that eombtna lions of the character icteric I to in this law ex isted and were powerful in many parts of the southern states, particularly in certain coun ties in the state of South Carolina. C ireful investigation was made, and it was as certained that, in nine couulii of that statu such combinations were active and powerful, embrae.ng a sufficient portion of citizens to control the local authority, and having, among other things,the object ol depriving the eman cipated class of liic substantial hem-tits of freedom and of the privilege of too free polit ical action of those citizens who did not sym pat hue wit h their views. Among tin ir opt rations were frequent scouring* umt occasional assassinations, generally perpetrated it night In disguised persons, the vicious in almost all case* being citizens of different political senti iiients from their own, or free jtersona who had shown u diapoHilion to claim equal rights a ilh other citizens Thousands ol inoffensive and Well dl“- poscii citizens were the sufferers hy tin., lawless vto lonor.
