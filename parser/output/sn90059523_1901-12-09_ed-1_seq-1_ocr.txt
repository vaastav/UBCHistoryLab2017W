Constant and persistent advertising is a sure pre lude to wealth.—Stephen Girard. VOL. XXIV.—NO. 343. ROCK AHEAD FOR A. F. OF L QUESTION OP INDUSTRIAL Oft TRADE AUTONOMY MUST BE SETTLED yiTAL POINT AWAITS ACTION Brewery Workmen and Mine Work era' Organizations Are Due to Precipitate a Warm Con teat at Scranton 'ARGUMENT ON JUBISDICTTON SCR ANON, Pa., Dec. S.— Notwithstand ing that this was Sunday many of the delegates to the convention of the Ameri can Federation cf Labcr, now in session in this city, did not cease their activity, the day being given up to the transac tion of committee business. A majority of the committees organized and not a few of them took up questions that will engage the attention of the convention during the coming week. The executive council, which is composed of the presi dent, the six vice presidents, the secre tary and the treasurer of the Federation, went into session early and did not ad journ until long aftc-r noon. The session was secret and nothing was given out for publication. One of the busiest men among the dele gates was W. D. Mahon, of Detroit, pres ident of the Amalgamated Association of Street Railway Employes. He was in fre quent conference during the morning "with local labor leaders who are direct ing the street car strike in this city. It is probable that Mr. Mahon and President Mitchell, of the Mine Workers, will be delegated by the executive council to take Charge of the strike. The convention will remain in session for the next six days and will have a very busy week. Two hundred resolu tions, touching upon nearly every ques tion in the labor world, have been pre sented for action. The committees will make reports on them as rapidly as pos sible, but it is not likely that more than half of these will be reported from the several committees. 'the Vital iiuc.sjii.il. What is looked upon by many of the delegates as the most vital question that ■will come before the convention -is that of trade autonomy. The brewery workmen and the Mine Workers' delegates prob ably wHI be the storm center on this question. Both of these trade unions want industrial autonomy; that is, they advocate that all trades in one industrial establishment should form one organiza tion for the better advancement of the condition of all. They also announce that they will oppose trade autonomy to the bitter end. The miners, in their argument cay that if a handful of engineers or firemen employed in a mine should strike it would cause the mine to be closed end thus throw out of work hundreds of men who have no grievances. If all trades of the mines were united under one head, the Mine Workers say that •friction could be avoided. Those who advocated trade autonomy claim it would be fatal for them to enter such a com bine and that no good result could come from an amalgamation of that character. ■ The autonomy question is likely to be introduced by either the firemen or engi neers, which organizations are contest ing the rights of the Brewery Workers and Mine Workers to force firemen and engineers employed In those places to join the Brewers or Mine Workers" unions. - The matter of trade jurisdiction is also fexpected to cause a long discussion par ticularly on the part of the Woodwork ers, who make the point that trades such bs pianomakers and woodworkers should come into the latter's union instead of them having an independent organiza tion. 

HEAD OF DAVE FAGIN (COLORED DESERTER FROM TWEN TY-FOURTH INFANTRY WILL, FIGHT NO MORE HAS BEEN DECAPITATED ■Native Scouts Kill the Black Anvil ijiry of the Insurgents ana Take His Head for Identifica tion Purposes MANILA, Dec. B.—Native scouts from Benhagon, province of Nueva Ecejo have killed David Fagin, the American negro deserter from the Twenty-fourth in fantry (colored), who for two years has been leading Filipinos against the Amer icans. The native scouts decapitated thc-ir prisoner. The head, however, was identified as that of Fagin. They recov ered his commission in the Filipino" army. Fagin had on his linger a ring of Fred erick Van Alstaetter, of the engineers, Tvho was captured by Filipinos, sup posedly under the command of Fagin himself, Oct. 8, 1900. Fagin has been re ported killed on several occasions. The authorities are satisfied that former statements of his death were erroneous and that he has now been killed. A military commission sentenced the Filipino general, Isidore Torres, to be Bianged, after finding him guilty of order ing the assassination of Corporal Field ncr, of the Twelfth infantry at Malolos, province of Buluacan, last October. The sentence of the commission has been dis approved by Gen. Chaffee, who finds that the commission had reasonable grounds to doubt whether Gen. Torres personally ordered the assassination of the Amer ican soldier. Gen. Chaffee thinks that the high rank held by Torres in the In surgent army would be sufficient to pre vent such unmilitary action on his part. The case of Patterson, the English man, private secretary to Sixto Lopez, ■whom efforts were made to deport from Manila after he had landed there with out swearing allegiance to the Lnited States, is still hanging fire before the supreme court. Patterson's attorneys claim that their client once having land ed was beyond the jurisdiction of \V. Morgan Schuster,, collector of customs for the Philippines, who has been trying to effect Patterson's expulsion. Editor of Smart Set Dead.

Special to The Globe. BUTTE, Mont., Dec. B.—A persistent rumor is current that the large hold ings of the Amalgamated copper stocks of Mrs. Marcus Daly and the Daly es tate have been thrown on the market, causing the disastrous decline in that stock. Montana holders have lost heav ily in the slump of the last few weeks. It is said that Mrs. Daly, in addition to the large block of stock that came to the estate from the late Marcus Daly, was persuaded to invest heavily in the stock on her own account at the time of the consolidation of the Boston com panies. When the stock began to de cline, it is said, she sold, and the es tate also unloaded at a loss of more than $1,000,000. . PAID FOR HER LIFE SETTLEMENT OP A PECULIAR SUIT IX INDIANA Reward for Drowning Wife Is Paid by a Hnsbnnd Only After a Court Gets Action. Special to The Globe. WABASH, Ind., Dec. B.—Augustus Hammond, of this city, a commissioner appointed by the Wa'basha circuit court to sell the farm of Mrs. Sarah Highly, near Mier, to settle a peculiar law suit, yesterday closed up the matter and pai.l to Marion Rutherford and William Miller about $400 for saving the life of Mrs. Highly. In January, 19iw, Miller and Rutherford were driving along the bank of a swollen creek near Mier, when they were attract ed by cries for help proceeding from the stream, a moment later Highly rushed up to them and said his wife, in a buggy, was out in the creek and would drown unless quickly rescued. "I'll give you men $1,000 if you save her," he said, ond Rutherford and Miller, at the peril of their lives, rushed in and brought the woman to shore. Subsequently they called on Highly to make good his promise, but he refused and assigned his farm to his wife. Suit was then brought by Rutherford and Miller, and the case was brought to Wabash county, where judgment was rendered for the full amount. The de fendants, however, got an injunction re straining the plaintiffs from selling the; farm under execution, and some time ago it was decided to compromise. Mr, Hammond was made commissioner, and he sold the property today to Mrs. Noyes for $3,500, paid a $455 mortgage, and p^id Mrs. Highley $2,448, out of which she settled the costs and the balance of 5450 is turned over to Rutherford and Miller. YOUNG CORBETT IS GOOD M'GOVERX'S CONQUEROR REME3I BERS HIS POOR RELATIVES. Special to The Glofce. DENVER. Dec. B.—One of the first in vestments which "Young" Corbett, the featherweight champion, will make with his newly acquired earnings will be the purchase of a house and lot for his family here in Denver. The Rothwell family consists of father, two sons and two daughters. The mother is dead and as all of the other children are younger than Will, who has just passed twenty-one, the family is largely dependent upon the earnings of the young pugilist. The purchase of the home will be the champion's first step toward putting the family in much im proved circumstances after years of self denial, and he promises that they will not want so long as he can keep his present good fortune. 

KNOCKED INTO RIVER. Railroad lirakcman'B Head Smashed l>y a Bridge. Special to The Globe. LA CROSSE, Wis., Dec. B.—While a Milwaukee train was crossing the Black river drawbridge about 8 o'clock this morning, George Mink, a brakeman re siding in Winona, was knocked from the top of a furniture car into the river fifty feet below and all efforts to recover his dead body have been fruitless. He was missed at River Junction and a switch engine from this city was ordered to the scene. The top of the car - upon which he stood was splattered with blood, as was the bridge which he struck in the fall to death. His cap was found on the bridge, smeared with blood. Drags are being used, but owing to the swift current the body probably has been carried a long distance from the bridge. During recent repairs on the bridge the guard ropes at the entrance have been removed. MR. FORD HAS RESIGNED FIRST RESPOXSE TO PRESIDENT'S RECEXT ORDER. DENVER, Col., Dec. B.—Charles D.

Dr. Hiram Thomas, head of the People's church, followed with a prayer for the women and children in South African prison camps. Then followed short ad dresses by Judge Theodore Brentano and Judge Murray F. Tuley, chairman of the Chicago branch of the American Transvaal league, under the auspices ot which the meeting was held. There were 500 people on the stage when Mr. Cockran, the orator of the evening, arose, and bowed in recognition of tlie tumult of applause, which greeted him. He said in part: Mr. Cockran'g Ideas. "However men may differ about the invasion of the South African republics, all are agreed that the restoration of peace is in the highest degree desirable. There are but two ways by which the war can be terminatetd—either the Boers must surrender, or the English govern ment must abandon the attempt to sub due them. It is quite generally assumed that the resistance of the Boers cannot be successful, and if this be true, they would not be justified in continuing a struggle which involved fruitless loss of life and waste of property, even though the losses inflicted on their enemy were tenfold greater than what they suffered themselves. Bloodshed which is useless Is always indefensible. But is it true that the resistance of the Boers is hopeless? Since the fall of Pre toria it certainly has not been fruitless; it has been justified by most important results. Lord Salisbury's position that nothing but absolute surrender would be considered hds been abandoned, and to day the burghers could secure almost any terms short of complete and ex plicit acknowledgment of their inde pendence. As their resistance has not been fruitless, neither is their struggle for independence hopeless. On the con trary, if their resistance be prolonged for a few months, tne abandonment of the struggle to subdue them by Great Britain is inevitable. Appropriations Hard to Get. "This statement is not based on any special information concerning the war, but on the conviction that it will be impossible for the government to secure the passage of many more war appro priations through the house of commons.

B.—The outlook on the stock exchange was somewhat brighter during the past week owing to the mes sage from President Roosevelt, the speech of the Prince of Wales and the unexpectedly heavy captures in South Africa. These latter also helped the market for mining shares, and Kaffirs rose slightly, on indefinite predictions of the termination of the South African war. The money situation was satisfactory and there was no prospect of stringency in New York, Paris and Berlin bills, while after the first of January the cus tomary cash returns from the monetary centers promise easy money for several weeks to come. It is thought this prom ised situation, combined with the present low price of all stocks, will stimulate both investment and speculation. The volume of business to date is still limited. American securities were lethargic, in spite of the improvement of Wall street. Home rails had a bright er outlook on improved traffic reports, and the promises of the directors to in crease economies as well as the effi ciency of the roads during the coming year. The silver situation is still critical, al though silver has recovered slightly from its lowest quotations. The future of silver is said to depend entirely upon whether the United States refrains from pressing further sales. Consols strengthened considerably dur ing the week on the report that tne next government loan would tak^r-jihe; shape of Transvaal 3 per cents, guaranteed by the British government. A

MARSHAL GRIMSHAW AR RESTS F. A. MAYER, OF YOKO HAMA AND NEW YORK TEIP TO LONDON INTERRUPTED AVith His Japanese Wife, Mayer Was on a Pleasure Jaunt Aronnd the World CHARGE OF FRAUD IS ALLEGED The round the world tour of Frances S. Mayer, late of Yokohama, Japan, came to an abrupt ending shortly before 5 o'clock yesterday afternoon, when United States Marshal Grimshaw arrest ed him on a coast train on a charge of forgery in connection with the issuance of some debenture bonds in Japan. Tha marshal acted upon telegraphic orders from the attorney general at Washing ton and knows nothing of the crime the man is charged with and Mayer himself professes to be just as ignorant of the nature of the charge. Mayer was accompanied by his wife, a comely Japanese women with a strain of German blood, two small children and a Japanese man servant. He Is now a guest of Sheriff Justus, at the county jail, and Mrs. Mayer,the children and the serv ant are at the Merchants in a state of perplexity. Ever since Mayer left Japan last month United States officers and Pinkerton men have been on the lookout for him, and despite the fact that he was traveling on a ticket through from Japan to London made out in his own name, it remained for Marshal Grimshaw to arrest him on the coast train yesterday afternoon on simply a telegraphic description. The marshal met the train at Minne apolis and notified Deputy S. J. Picha to be at the St. Paul station to take charge of the man. Mayer acknowledged his identity and submitted to arrest very calmly and upon the arrival of the train here was taken in charge by the deputy, who took him to the county jail. Little can be learned of Mayer, except that his home was in New York before going to Japan and that he did news paper work there. He was also interested in the insurance business and lately was instrumental in organizing a large steam laundry at Yokohama, in which. Ameri can, German and Japanese capital was interested. He was a director ol the company and also a large stockholder, but according to Mrs. Mayer he never took any active part in the management of the laundry. Mayer has not much to say about' his arrest or even about himself, and some of the few things he did say were not in accordance with statements made by his wife. He said he had been in Japan about two years, and that he was going to London with his family to settle there. Mrs. Mayer says they were on a 'trip around the world, and that she has known Mayer in Japan for about five years. ' When seen last night by Th c Globe at the county jail Mayer was uncommunl. cative.claiminghe knew absolutely noth ing of the charge upon which he was arrested. He said: "I don't know what the charge is nor who made it. Mr. Grimshaw simply show ed me the telegram, and I went with him. He has treated me very considerately in the affair, but I can tell you nothing that will throw any light on the mat ter. I have been in Japan about two years and have done some newspaper work there, mostly in the nature of cor respondence. I became interested in the laundry business there and was a director and a large stockholder in a company that was organized by European capi talists. I have severed my connection PRICK TWO CBNTS-^S?vii?"<S™ with the concern, however, and when I left everything was in the best of con dition and I cannot imagine that there is anything in this connection that has caused my arrest. I am on my way with my family to London where I had intended to locate. I am traveling on a through ticket in my own name, and I don't think If I wag conscious of any wrongdoing that I would be traveling in my own name by a direct route, do you? That is about all that I can say^ for 1 really know no more in the matter so can say no more." Mayer is a well dressed and well ap pearing young man, apparently about thirty years of age. He talks well and has evidently had considerable business experience. He claims New York as his home and says that he did newspaper work there for some time. He feels it :s all a mistake and is apparently in earnest when he says he knows nothing of the charge. He will have a., hearing before United States Commissioner Spencer today and will no doubt be held to await proceed ings on the extradition treaty between Japan and this country. What Mrs. Mayer Says. Mrs. Mayer, a vivacious and handsome Japanese woman, with a dash of German blood in her veins, was seen by The Globe at the Merchants last night. She appeared in a dainty kimono, and though greatly disturbed by the events of the day consented to talk of her hus band's arrest. "I am entirely at sea as to the reason for his arrest," she said in perfect Eng lish. "I know there has been some aw ful mistake. I know it is impossible for the charge to be true, and I cannot con ceive who is at the bottom of this affair. Mr. Mayer sold out his interest In the laundry and we are on a trip around the world. "I am afraid though," she continued with a faint smile, "that our plans will be entirely upset and I may see my na tive country sooner than I expected. Al though I know that Mr. Mayer will eventually be found to be quite blame less of anything irregular or criminal. I ™ alone in a strange country and a strange city with two small children, so you can imagine that this is a severe shock to me."
