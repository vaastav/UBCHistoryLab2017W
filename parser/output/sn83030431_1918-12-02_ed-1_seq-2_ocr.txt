Plan to Quia President. "Republicans have been busy for the past two or threo days looking up precedents and parliamentary law to cover the situation whon tho Presi dent Is before Congress. Many of them are of the opinion that under tho procedure which guides Congress tho President Is presumably there to be Interrogated. They believe that If tho Speaker recognizes a member of the House while the President Is there any queries not distinctly out of order may be put to the Presldenfthrorfgh the Speaker. If It Is done, which ap pears highly doubtful on account of the circumstances, the president can not well avoid .some sort of answer. The procedure which will bo fol lowed. If It Is finally, determined to question tho President on his mission abroad, would be governed by the standing rules of the House. Inthe view of parliamentarians, any member of the Hons could interrupt the President at any point In his speech by merely arising and. say.tnr "Jlf, Speaker," , ,, .

It Is believed that in thevent of the attempt to question the President It will be done by a member of the House, as the Senators will be In the House chamber as guests of the lower body. Should a Representative wish to make the attempt the procedure would be as follows: "Mr. Speaker," Speaker Clark "For what purpose does the gentleman rise?" "T6 ask If the President of tho United States will yield to permit an Interrogation." , The Speaker would then state whether he would recognlws the Rep resentative for that purpose. The questlQjjr would then be repented to tho President himself by the Speaker and the President could then yield or not as he saw fit.

It is said the President has heard j of the questions ' which Republican ' Representatives hail, prepared to pro pound to him and might refer to them In his address.

FourthIs the President going to J commit the nation to a policy of free trade In view of tho last elections? Fifth Whether the President realty believes that he reiiresents the feeling of the American people in view of the repudiation of his leadership and whether ho still pretends to pose as the soul of American leadership? Up to a late hour It luul been Im possible to ascertain definitely whether any or all of the questions would be asked. It was said that Republican leaders. Including William Howard, Taft and others, were counselling strongly against U.

"Against my will they sent mo to Norway," William is quoted as hav ing safd.

"But when I heard that the British fleet had put to sea I returned of my own accord. They had nearly caught me.

Boukhomlinoff, nusslan Minister of War, during the investigations which occurred after ward, which he later altered to the statement that he had not ordered real mobilisation, but only readiness for mobilization.

Tut lUouu, Dec. 1. According to a! Dutchman who has Just arrived In j Holland. Hamburg is entirely in the hands of plundering Bolshevik soldiers ' and sailors. He said he gave a good dinner and 200 marks each to three ' memlfers of the Soviet in order to ob tain a passport. At the frontier the of-'! flclala refused to recognize the pass-1 port, necessitating bribes of several ' hundred marks more. Every policeman in Hamburg, he , said, is accompanied by a Bolshevik guard armed with i evolvent und a , knife. He says the people expect their , tyranny will cease when the soldiers ' from the front return nml ihnt f, r.-.,.. ' ular democratic government then will bo established. Meanwhile, he says, the .Red Guard bullies are extorting frightful taxes from the people.

The supreme . army command apparently proposes to remove the military headquarters from i Cassel to Berlin, ignoring tho Berlin 1 uovernment 'a orders. The Potsdam Soviet has resolved to use the rooms in tho ra&lle as a. remedy for want of dwellings. Tho Independent Socialist party in Berlin has refused to Join the majority Socialists In a refusal to oervpt the Bavarian ultimatum demanding the resignation of Dr. Solf and others. The split between the libert group and the ' Haase group therefore is decisive. Tho VcMtlcho lleitung learns that ' Hamburg sailors entered Herr Ballln's i office November 8 and demanded the surrender of the building for the pur poses of tho revolution. Herr Hallln who previously had been affected with heart trouble, also had Just reed the ' armlstltc conditions, and had u stroke of paralysis, from whloh ho died.

GERMAN ELECTION DATE IS PROTESTED Called Too Early to Adopt Socialist Policy. By the, Aloclnttd Frttt, Biruk, Dec. 1 In tha opinion of the Majority Socialists and tho bour geois, according to Via Frclhclt, tho date, February 16. fixed by the Council of People's Commissioners for holding an election to tha Constituent Assem bly, Is too early. It Is maintained that more time is needed to put into effect a pure Socialistic policy. The Independent Socialists have stated the threatened separation of the Rhine Province and Bavaria makes It imperative that an early election be held. Tho bourgeois and Socialistic press agreo tho Soldiers' and Workmen's Congress, which meets December 16, will accept tho election date. Dele gates to the Congress will be chosen In haphazard fashion. The Berlin Ex ecutive Committee of te Soldiers' and Workmen's Council, which called the Corvpress, Is said In some quarters to have little real authority outsldo Ber lin. Anybody at any nlace calling ltlf a Soldiers' and Workmen's Council will be nblo to send delegates. The control of credentials will be difficult, and tills has led to fears In certain tactions that the Congress will be packed. - Even optimists are discouraged by the apathetic attitude of the bourgeois and the untiring nctivity of the Spartacus Group, or Radicals. Dr. Hnrtmann to-day handed to Dr. W. 8. Solf; the aerman Foreign Sec retary, credentials to tho peace con ference as representative of the German-Austrian republic. AiiBTKHDAM, lec. 1.
