The forest must yield to the increasing demand for tobacco ground. The nutting day may come around, but the nut are not there; but bare fields, unsightly with tho stub of tobacco stalks, t.r at roo in every direction.

And the bluffs and bill, that used to fill our idea of rnonutains, have apparently dwindled down so that we can almost look over their tops. We find a few of the old residents here, and atill fewer of those of our own grneration. They are cattcrcd or gone, and we wander almost among strangers. But we came to one place where we found oursclf surrounded by old friends and acquaintances it was in the grate-yard! Principal among tho improvements going on here, is the new school-bouse, a large, three-story brick, which is approaching completion, aud which will be one of the finest school buildings in the State, outside the larger towns. The ex perience here has been that of every other part of the country, with but rare exceptions. The men who conceived and carried through the pro ject for a decent aud sufficient school-house, have been treated to denunciation aud abuse; and ev ery crop failure or scarcity of money, for years tj come, will lie laid to that school-honsc, The Odd Fellows have rcri-nfly established a Lodge here, which is in a flourishing condition, and they have io usually nice' and cosy Lodge Boom.

Fanaticism particularly political fanaticism would not, aa a nsual thing, be supposed to be conducive to building np a country; yet it is a fact, that some of the best improvements, not on ly in this place, but in other towns, and through nut the country, in the Counties of Preble and Montgomery, are the result of political fananti rlsm. This is how it was: Vallandigham, of sainted memory, was the Democratic God in tbi section of the State, During the war, when greenbacks were plenticst, and everybody had their pockets full, especially Democrats of the Whiskey aud other Rings, Vallandigham made it a religions duty to warn all Democrats that in a very short time greenback would not be worth pocket-room; and he advised them to get rid of the trash as speedily aa possible not to put it in equally worthless Government Bonds, but to in vest it in real estate, houses, aad other safe property., Vallandigham being the only God whom they ever did obey, and this advice being la accord with their hatred of the Government, they mad basto to follow the advice. Costly farms were purchased, fine business blocks were built, palatial country residences were erected, and mills, opera houses, hotels, Ac., were reared. Many spent all tbsir greenbacks, and went in debt. The crash did not come, tint the time did when greenbacks were net o plenty? Very many of tho public-spirited individuals were financially ruined, and others wcregladto sellout their prop erty at a heavy sacrifice; and all of thrm are a keen to grab the hated greenback aa ever they were to touch the hem of Vallandigham'a garment. Though the builders are bnsted, the buildings re main, as ornaments to tho town or country, or as monuments aud reminders that the wnrldcannot yat dispense with the services of the Fool-Killer. They complain as much of hard times here as with US iu Kansas. Money is scarce, and produce low. They alooraaaplaiu greatly of high taxes. From the Treasurer's notices posted about, we And that the taxes in the country range from 8 to 10 mills; while iu towns, where they have munic ipal governments, school-houses, aim other things, to increase the taxes, it ntns np, in some instanc es, to 17 and 16 mills. We wonder how they wonld fancy a regular thing of 40 to 30 mills f The Kpizootir disease is raging here, the same aa at every other olace in this region. Even the doctor hare to travel afoot, with their bag over their shoulders, to ere their patient. This is productive of queer results. For instance, Doc Hnggins, like Kalstafl, Is getting at and old, and cannot foot it far. The conaenne ice is, hi pa tients in the country are all getting" well.

News reached na, to-day noon, of the death of Horace Greeley. 'The 'reception-of the newa shows, more clearly than .anything else, the cause of, his disastrous defeat. The Democracy, who composed the balk of hi supporters, had no af fection furhim, and bat little respect. They seem to regard his death, nokore seriously thau the act of throwing away a quid of tobacco, after ex tracting all the filth, or tho core' of an apple, af ter getting all the good off of it that they wanted. They do not appear. to' regard it aa more than an ordinary event, and show, no sorrow or regret.

(The death of Horace Greelsy will atarlle the country; for, although known to be iu a critical condition by his most intimate frisuds, tho people generally did not dream that his case waa serious. But the fact has liecn developed, that he was virtually in a private lunatic asjlnin for several weeks before his death. The Presidential campaign killed him, as it will any man who submits to the ordeals through which a candidate is required to pass. Itelyiug upon his strong constitution, they forgot that editorial labor and the fatigues of a great cam paign, although both severe, are of entirely diff erent natures. But the physical exhariatiou he might have recovered from. It wr, the mental wear and tear that proved,. fatal. Blinded by ambition, be forsook his priuciesand his friends, and united with those wLose principles he had condemned, and whom, he despised while affilia ting with them, in the wild, hope or reaching the Presidency. Me knew that his own election would be fatal to the welfare of the country, and the inauguration of a system of plunder and dis grace never known in the annals of the nation. Yet ho was willing to, indict all this upon tho country, to secure the' Presidoncy. That he was partially insane before the election, is shown.by his incoherent ravings against the party to which had always belonged, and his fulsome flattery nf those who had but lately attempted to destrnv the Government. His vagaries may jrow be accounted for, upou the. belief thai his brain. long overtaxed, was prepared for insanity npon ine nrst occasion oronusa pressure. Tho extra ordinary fatigue to vlichewaasubjected, thenn precedentcd Majority by which he waa repudia ted by Vno people, and the death of his wife, oc curring about the same time, were too much for him, and the catastrophe came.

We have no means of knowing what strength hs has, or to what extent his chances will be affected by the fact that Leavenworth" already has a&nator; but for uprightness of character, for purity of life, both public aud private aud for cmiucnt ability, the State of Kansas does not posses bis superior.

ALABAMA CLAMliC r 'When Congress adjourned in June last a qnes tion had been raised by-Great Britain, and was then pending, which, for a time, seriously imper illed the settlement, by a friendly arbitration, of the differences existing between this government and that of her Britanie Majesty; and which, by the treaty of Washington, had been referred to the tribunal of arbitration which met in Gene va, Switzerland. The arbitrators, however, dis posed of the question which had Jeopardized the whole of the treaty, and which threatened to in volve the two nations in most nnhsppy rela tions toward each other, in a manner entirely satisfactory to the government, and in accordance with the views and the policy which it bad main tained. The tribunal, which had convened in Geneva in December, concluded ita laborious ses sion on the fourteenth day of September last, on which day, having availed Itself uf.tbediscretinn ary imwer given to it by the treaty, to award a sum iu gross, the tribunal made its decision, n hereby it awarded the sum of 15i00.000 in gold as the indemnity to be paid by Great iiritai" to the United.

THE SAN Jl'AS BOUNDARY QUESTION. By the third and fourth articles nf the Treaty of Washington, the respective claims of the United States and of Great Britain in their con struction of the treaty of the 15th of Jnne, 184S, denning the boundary line between their respec tive territories were submitted to the arbitration and award ef his Majesty the Emperor of Germany to decide which of those claims is most in accor dance with tho true interpretation of the treaty of 181G. His Majesty the Emperor of Germany haviug been pleased to undertake the arbitration, has the earnest thanks of this Government and of the people of the United 8tatesfor the lalior, pains and care which he has devoted to the con sideration of this long pendiugdiffcrenco. I have caused an expression of my thanks to be commu nicated to his Majesty. Mr. Bancroft, the repre seutative of this Government at Uerliu, conducted the case and prepared the statement on the part of the United States with the ability that his past service justified the public in expecting at his bands, A a member of the Cabiuetat the date of the treaty wbieb ha giveu rise to this disens sion between-the two governments; as the Minis ter to Great Britain when the construction now pronounced unfounded was first advanced ; and as the agent and tho representative of the go era menttopresetittb? case aud to receive the awards, be has been associated with the question in all of ita phases, and in every stage has manifested a patriotic zeal and earnestness in the maintenance of the claim of the United States. He is entitled to mnch credit for the success hich has attended the submission. After a patient fnvestigatinu of the ease, and of the statement of each party, His Majesty, the Emperor, on the 21st day ef October last, signed bis award in writing, decreeing that the chum of the government of the United Mates, that the boundary line between the territories of Her Britanio Mtjesty and the United States should be drawn through Haro channel, is most in accordance with the true interpretation nf tho treaty concluded on the 15th of Jnne, 1848, be tween ine agent or tier untanic .Majesty and of the United States. A HAPPY CONCLUSION. Coiiies nf the case presented on behalf of each government, and of the statement in reply to each, and a translation of the award, are trans mitted herewith. This award confirms the United States in their claim in the important arehipsllgo of islands lying between the Continent and Van couver's Island, which for twenty-six years since the publication of the treaty, Great Britain has consented, and leaves us for the first time in the history of the United States as a nation without a question ef disputed boundary between our ter ntory and the possession, of Great Britain on this continent. It J my. grateful duty to acknowledge the prompt and spontaneous action of Her Majesty's goventaaant in giving enert to the twin, in antie"An of an v request from this coverument. and mPts the reception in the L'uited States of the award signed by the Emperor. Her Majesty haa 'given instructions for the removal of her troops, which bad been stationed there, aud for the cessation ef all excise or claim of jurisdiction, as as to leave the Uuited States exclusive posses sion of the lately disputed territory. I am grate ful to be able to announce that the orders for the removal of the troops have leen executed, and the military Joint occupation of San Juan has ceased. Teh islanda are now in the exclusive possession of the United States. It now becomes necessary iu complete the survey and determination ef that portion of the boundry 4ine through the Haro channel npon which the commission .which deter mined the remaining part of the line were unable to agree. I reooajiaend the appointment of a commission to act Jointly with" one which may be uaaaeu ojrner jiajesiy lor insi purpose. TBI ALASKA BOUXDART. ErteDee of the difficolties attending the I determinatioa of onr admitted line of boundary after the occupation of the territory andiUset- iicucui or uiosn owing allegiance to the respec tive governments, points to the importance of establishing by natural objects or other monn- bicuu, iae actual une between the territory acquired by purchase from Russia and the ad joining possessions of her Britanie Majesty. The region is now so sparsely occupied that no conflicting interest of individuals or or jurisdic tion are likely to interfere to the delay or em barrassment of the actual location of the line. If deferred until th population shall euter and occupy the territory, somt t rival contest of neigh bor may again array the two governments in antagonism. I therefore recommend the appoint mentof a commission to act jointly with one that may be appointed on the part ef Great Brit ain to determine the line between oar territory of Alaska and toe coterminous possessions of Great Britain. THE TREATY AND THE FISHERIES. In my last Annual Message I recommended the legisUtraa necessary on the part of the United State to bring into operation tbe articles nf the Treaty of Washington of May, 1871, relating to the fisheries aad to -other matter touching the relation of the United State toward tbe British North American rusmasions to become operative so soon a the proper legislation should ho had on the part of Great Britain and it possessions. That iagialationa had not then been had, and duriug the session of Congress "a question was raiscdwhieh fur a time trusted a doubt whether any action by Congress in1 the direction indicated wonld become important. Tbia question has siuce been dtsiosal of, awl 1 hare received no tice that the Imperial Parliament and the legisla tion of tho Provincial'tioveniaient. have passed laws to carry, the pruvisiorra-oCtbe treaty, uu the matters referred, toy iuto operation.. I therefore recommended yonr early adoption of the legisla tion, in the same direction, aecaetary.ou the part .of this government. - . u. a. xormax xmcxbabt.

To this end I re comtneud that a supplemental appropriation be made. KELATIokg WITH THANCX, GERMANY,' RUSSIA, ETC.

Preparation arc making for the Int: national Exposition to' be held during ttjj nuic year, in Vicuna, on a scale of vcrr- .ci.:,nagunude. Tho tendency of those expositions is iu the direction pf advsueei' civilisation, and in the elevation of indust-y and labor, ami of the increaso of human apuiucss, as well as of greater intcrcmrso and good will between nations. As this exposition s to bo tho firet which will havo been held iu Eastern Europe, it is believed that American in venture aud manufacturers will be ready to avail themselves of the opjiortniiity, for tho presenta tion bf their productions if encouraged by proper aid and protection'. At tho last session of Con gress authority wa given for the appointment of one or more agents to represent till, govern ment at the exposition. The authority tliui giv en has been exercised, but in the absence of an appropriation there is danger that the important uenciit n men ine occasion anonis win, iu a large degree, bo lost to citizens of the United States. I recouiincud the subjest strongly to yonr consid eration, and also recommend that au adequate appropriation be made for the purpose. To fur ther aid American exhibitors at Vienna, at the Exposition, I would recommend, iu addition to the appropriation of money, that the Secretary of the Nary be authorized to fit up 'two naval vessels to transport lietwcen our Atlantic cities and Trieste, or the most couteuient port of Vicu na and back, their articles for exhibition. , OCR RELATIONS WITH MEXICO. Since yonr last session the President of Mexi can republic, distinguished-by his high charac ter and by his services to bis country, has died. His temporary successor basnow been elected with great nnauimity. by the people, a proof of confi dence on their part iu his patriotism and wisdom, which it is believe! will lie continued by the re sult of his administration. His particularly de sirable that nothing should be left undone by tho government of either republic to strengthen their relations hs neighbors and friends. It is mnch to be regretted that many lawless acts continue to disturb the quiet of the settlements on the border between our territory and that of Mexico, and their complaints of w mug done- to American citizens in various parts of tliecountry, are made. The revolutionary cordition in which tho neigh burin' republic has so long been imolved, has in some uecres contributed to this disturbance. It in to bo hoped tbfltjwitlLa more snttled rule of order threngb the republic, n hich may be exac ted from tne prrseht government, the acts of which just complaint is mads, cease. THE 

MEXICAN OITR.MJUS. The proceedings nf the commission niidrr the conentiou with Mexico, of the Cth of July, 18ti8. on the subject nf claims, have niifortnnatcly lioen checked by all obstacle, for the removal of which measures have lieen taken by the two miv- cruments which, it is believed, will prove suc cessful, f The commissioners appointtnl pnrsnant to the joint resolution of Congress of ibe 7th of May last, to inquire into thrdepmlations nf the Texas frontiers, have diligently made investigations in that qnarter. Their report npon this subject will be communicated to you. Their researches were necessarily incomplete partly on account of the limited appropriation made by Congress. Mex ico, on the part nf their government, has appoin ted a similar commission to intestigate these out rages. It is not announced officially, but the pressof that country states that the fullest in vestigation is desired, and that the co-operation of all parties concerned is invited to secure that end. I therefore recommend that a special ap propriation lie made at the earliest dar practica- ble to enable the commissioner on ilie part of the United Stairs to return to their labors with out delay. THE SPANISH CUBAN WAR. It is with regret that I have again to anmimicc a continuance of the disturbed condition nf the Island of Cuba. No advance toward the pacifica tion of the discontented part of the population has been mad', while the insurrection has gained no advantage, and exhibits no more of the ele ments of power, or nf the prospect of ultimate success than were exhibited a year ago. Spain, on the other hand, has not ncccedcd in its re pression and the parties stand apparently in the aame relative attitude which tbev have occupied for a Ions time past, This content has lasted for more than five yej.rs. Were it Keen at a distauce from our neighborhood, we might be indifferent Jo ita results, althongh humanity ciuld i.nt be unmoved bv many of its incidents, wherever' it maynccrir. It is, however, at our door lb.it the conflict is transpiring. I cannot doubt that tho continued maintenance of slaver' in Cuba is among the strongest inducements to the contin uance nt tms write, A terrible wrong is the ua tnral cause of a terrible evil. The abolition of slavery and the introduction nf other reforms iu the administration of the government In Cuba could not fail tejnyanco the restoration of peace and order. It is especially to lie hoped that the present liberal government of Spain wilt volun tarily adopt this view. The law of emanclpat Ion which was passed more than two years since has remained nuexcutnt, in the absence of regulations for its euforcoieut. It waa but a feeble step toward emancipation, but it wa the recognition ofrfglt; aud jva hailed as ucb. and exhibited Spain in ffarraotrylwitlr scatimeuls of humanity ana justice, and lusyrapaty with the other pow ers of the christaio and civilized world. Within the past few week the regulations for carrying out tbe laws of emancipation hare been an nounced, giving evidence f the sincerity of the intentions of tbe present government to carry iu-" to effect the law of 1870. TUK 

CUBAN SLAVS TRADE. I hare not failed to urge the consideration of ine wisuora. inn policy ssa the Justice of a more effective syatem for the abolition of the great evil which oppressed a race, aud continues a bloody and destructive contest dose to onr bor ne". we'l the expediency and tbe justice of coucediaga reform to which the propriety is not qoesrinued. Deeply' impressed with the convic tion that tbe continuance of slavery is one nf tbe athra , nf !.& &....& f .1... I...... conditio in Cuba, I regret to believe that citi zen m tne united states, or those claiming to be ucb, are large holder in Cuba of what ia there claimed a property, bat which is forbidden and denounced bybe laws of tbe United States. They are thaa, in defiance of the spirit of onr own laws, contributing to the continuance of this distressing and sickening contest. In my last anuual message I referred to this subject, and I again recommend sneb legislation as may be pro per to denounce, and, if not prevent, at least to discourage, Aaicricau citizens from holding or dealing in slave. SOUTH. AMERICAN CONVENTION. It is gratifying to announce tbe ratification of ine convention tameladert, nnuer ine auspice or inn government, between epatn oa tne one pan and allied repaUics of the Pacific on the other, providing tor an armistice, bare been exchanged, a copy of the instrument i herewith submitted. It ia hoped that this may be followed by a perma nent peace lsstweea the same perUea. THE Mirnl AMEBCAX STATES.

It ia with regret, however, I announce that the government or Venezuela baa made no further payments on account of the awards under the convention of the 35th of April, 1866. ThatBe public is understood to be now almost, if not Tim inU'qa,Il?d- Iti hoped, therefore, that twill lose no time In providing for the unpaid balance of its debt to the Uuited States, which having nginatedin injuries to it citizen by the euezuelan authontles, and having been ac knowledged to a treaty, in the most solemn form known among nations, would sewn to deserve a preference over debts of a different origin and contracted iu a different maimer. This subject Is again recommended to the attention of Congress for such action as may be deemed proper. RELATIONS WITH JAPAN. " Onr treaty relations with Japan remain un changed. An imposing embassy from that inter esting and progressive nation visited this coun try during the year that is passing, but, bcTii unprovided with powers forthe signing of a con" ventiou in this country, no conclusion in that direction. as reached. It is hoped, however, that the interchange of opinion which teok place duriug their stay in this country has led to a mu tual appreciation of the interests which maybe promoted when the ret iaion of the existingtreatv shall be undertaken. Iu this connection, I re new my recommendation nf one year ago, that, to give importance and add to the efficiency of our diplomatic relations with Japan and China, and to further aid in retaining the god opinion f these people, and to secure to the Uuited States its share ef commerce destined to flow be tween these natious and the balance of the com mercial world, an appropriation be made to sup port at least fonr American vontbs in each nf these countries to serve as a part of the official family of our ministers. Our representatives wonld not even be placed npon an equality with the representatives oC " iiriiam or iu some oiuer powers as no minated.

TOE TERRITORIES. I renew the recommendation roado on a prei eus occasion of the trancfer to the Department of the Inter.br, to which they seem more appro pnatc'j to belong, of all the lowers aud duties !S relation to the territories with which the De partment of State is now charged by law or bv custom. AMERICANS ABIIOAD- Congress, frrnn the beginumgof the govern ment, his wisely mailn provisions for thu n'lief of distressed seamen in foreign countries. No similar prevision, however, bas heretofore lieen made for the relief of onr citizens iu distress abroad other than seamen. It is iiuderstiHMl to lie customary with other governments to author ize consuls to extend such relief to their citizens or subjects iu certain cases. A similar autburily and an apiiroprinlioi. to carry it into effect are recommended incases of citizens of the United States. It is well known that onr citizens resort to for eign countries iu grc.it numbers. Though sonic oi iueiu arc aoio iu oear ine expenses incident to locomotion, there are some who, through acci dent or otherwise, become M-nniless, and have no friends at homo able to Mirror them. Persons in this position must either perish, cast themselves mwni ine i-uarn.v oi loreigiiers, or no relieved at thnprhnte cost-ofouronn officers who usually, ecn with the most lienevuleut dispositions, havu nothing to spare for such a purine. Should the authority and appropriations usLed for lie given, care will be taken to carry the lienefi. cence of Congress into effect m that it shall Hot be unnecessarily or unworthily bestowed.

REDUCED EXPENDITURE. With the great reduction of taxation by the acts of Congress at its last session, the expendi ture ofthe guYemment iu collecting the revenue will be mnch reduced for the next nVeal year. It is very doubtful, how e er. whether an v fnrthee reduction of so exations a burthen upon onr people will bo practicable for tbe present, at all events. As a measure of justice to the holders of the nation's certificates of indebtedness, I would recommend that no more legislation lie had on Ibis subject, unless it be to correct errors of omis sion or commission in tun present laws, nntil sufficient time lias- elapsed to prove that it Tan lie done and atill leave sufficient revenue to meet the current expenses of tbe government, to pay interest nn the pnblie debt, and provide for tbe sinking fund established by law.
