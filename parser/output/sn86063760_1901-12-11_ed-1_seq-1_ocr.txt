VOL XVI MANNJNG, S. C. WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 11, 1901 NO. 19 A GAY DECIVER, The Last Escapaci cf Ca3-in A N. Freeland, MARRIED A YiUNG GIRL Urider an Assumei Ntme N m BaIrg Hunted by DatectiveS, Havirg De.camped Wtta Bride's Jzwa;ry. A ltter from Sumier to The State dated D.e. 3, says: Oat on the ;id< Atlaruc, sever&i months ago, a ma and woman met. The woman wa young, pretty and attractive, the ide of her milionaire father's heart. Tu man was a dashing, captivating - felles with the mar nrs of a cavalier. The se quel of the meeting is a brchken heart ed father, a young woman's blightec ife, and a wrecked home. The villisi n the story was a orcatime re-ident o this city sod the people of Sumter have an interest in the story because of thiE fact. He is Capt. A. N. Freeland, who fa many years was S trutted and respect ed emloye cf the Atlantie Coast Line with wh'ch corporation he held a posi tion for 20 or more years. Durirg tbie last eight or ten y as of his raitreat life hrfilied th3 posinic of road raste and had cnarse ot the iorence- Colum bia divition, one of the most. importan on the system. He was sum6ry dismissed from this position and a2 explanstion wa never n.ade as to the cause for his re moval, but at the n1!4e rumors wer current that he was cowned 3c:se : immorsl cnduct. Capt. Freel:ua remained in this citi which he had mse his home fo; e many years and wih which he had be come identtiid by businezs and soia ties, he having married here and aoqna: ed oonsiderable property. At this t:m he was looked upon- as a fair, hones man and was respected in the buseiesi world. He held a prominent pace ii the Masonic loage and otheIr fraterna societies. Shortly after this discharge by the railroad compar;y he engaged in busi ness, firat as a member of the firm o! Freeland & Roan, dealers in ohina arc glassware, and subsequently became , member of the fi:m of the Ducker 6 Buitman company, of which he was fo a time the president. It was at thi: time that the eyes of the community were first opered to the real charactei of the man, although for several yc ar there were rumors aflbat that he was not straigbt in his business dcaing It was while prsident of the Dueker (5 Bultman company that -.e borrowed a: the money that he could induce the ,banks to advance on such collateral a! he could offer and the erdorsements o: friends, and left the city, desertirg hi wife and family, leaving them, it wat .reported at the time, ill irmdv:d for, For a year or more alter this no on in Sumter knew anything about hit movements, although diihgents if firt were made by those who had euffered financial. loss thtiough him, to locatt him. He was reported to have beei seen in neighboring Scaied On severi occasions, bu all efforts to find his 'were xutile. He vohuntarily openet communication with those wi.o had had to pay his dishonored notes, a~d in: short time returned to the city anc made settlements of such claims ai oculd have been colho'ed by Icga! prc cess-the others went unpaid. He wa arrested at the instance of one par : with whom he refused to settle, but the evidence was, not strong enough t< convict and the case was dropped. Again he left Sumter and was gon for some months, returning only to at tend the funeral of his wife, who diet suddenly. He spent a few weEks here and when he left took nll the money he could ob :ain by any means from hi: childrer:-money in some :sitence that hid been earned by hattd wczk From that time until the smrva1 of th: N~ew York detective nothirg was know: of his a hereabouts and no uneC e4ed The detective visited this city toin vestigste the past life of A.

LOVZ FZAST Our Senators Glare at Each Other in Washington. TLa Tashing'on Post in its pictures of the U ited States eUators on the openirg day of c.ngress contained the followir-g: "Ther. were two senators Who d!d not sharc largely in the geneial ex ethange of felicitations. On the Repub iican ide, Sonator Wellington of SMary Iand wandered around in lonelinesi. He went into the clonkroom and then came out again; he sat down at his desk and then walked out by himseil. Oa,sionally he shook hands with so'ne one, but gonersIly he was greeted only wIvith a ned. Oa the Democratic side Senator McLiurin of South Carolin., who has esponeed neari aI. thc Ebe pablican doctrines, sat in solitude, his hands folded and his eyes turnod up ward toward the occupants of the gal leries." Another Washington paper said: "Senator Lodge, hands in trousers pcckets and slimmer than of yore, came in with the bald headed Bacon, fresh from the Philippines and loaded with information. 'enator Tillm.n, as ferrcious as evcr, glared at his colleague, MXLaurin, as he took his seat. When the M Laurin resolutinn was objected to, Mr. T. :man griantd with delight, while Mr. MeLaurin scowled." FACE TO FACE. The Waitington correpondent of the New York Sun says President Roosevelt opened the South Carolina interestate and West ladian ex;ositicn bY iressing an electic button in the White House. The eremony took Place in the so-called n: room, or telegraph cffci, in the presence of Senators McLeirin and Tdlman, Re piesentatives E Cit of the Charleston distriot, and severalotners. Immedia. tely aftter touching the telegraph key, wiich set the exposition =schinery in X c3, -he president sen s message of congratulation to the president of the air. I hen, turning to the sena tors, ne said: 'I most csrneotly wish the greatest poss::e luck for the expcsition," Then there was some informal con versationi. "fhere is more history around Char !eston than any other piaoe in the United S:ates," remarked Senator Till man. 'ontn Caroina is long on mik 'rg history tut ri-er sbrt on wris ing i t." you are not at all slow in quot g 't," replied the president. On, no, w s keep our windbags in ;retty good c:d," said Mir.

TILLMAN TICKLED. Washington dispatch to Philadelphia Ltdger: Senator McLturn of South Carklina asked leave to send to the desi : resoluon for which he askea immediate conideration. It was arns olution providicg for the free entry of rnicis intended for exbibition in the Chalesi.on exposition and Lhe transfer of exhibits now at Buffaio to Charles ton. The clerk started to read, when Senator Hoar arose and oijected. He said it was parliamentary etiquette, at ieast in the sernate, to forbear to trans act any busineus whatever until Op p,.reunity had been given fer the presi cent's message to be received and read, :nd ho should ooject rnot only to the recolution of the senator from South Carohina, but to the consideration of any business until after the mesitage had been read. Mctaurin bit his lip and flashed at the re bake. Ben Tijlman put his hand to his face to hide the broad sile that diffased itself over his expansive countenance, and for 15 min utes he chuckled and snickercd in poor ly suppressed delight at the discom fiture of his errant colleague. By this time the opening seson of the senate in the fity-seventh congress was 20J minutes olQ. There being rno more business, a recess was taken fur ha~f an hour. BEING WATCHED. The Savannah1 News says the ountry ;ill keep ats eye on the senators from SantZh Carolina. It is an op::n secret that senator Tiliiman has been taking a cally craught of vitriol a::d eating a quarta of a pound of sulphur for des sert with eaoh dinner for the last sev eral months, in anticipation of the time vhen he would be able to face Mc Laurin on the floor of the upper house.

THE MESSAGE Of Presidtnt Thocdore Roosevel to Congress. A! INTERESTING DOCUMEN1 Raftrs to Questions of the Ds) arid Gives His Ideas as to Rernedies Fcr Gorrect ing Evils. The president in his annual messzgc to congress says: The congress assembles this year un der the shadow of s great calamity On the 6Jh of Sa;tember President Kc Kinley -as shot by an anarchist whil< attending the .Pan-American exposi tion at Baffalo and died in that city on the 14th of that month. Or the last seven elected presidenti he is the thizd who has bten murdered and the bara recital of this fuet i sufficient to justify grave alarm among all loyal American citizens. Moreover, the ciroumtauces of this, the third as sassination of an American president have a peculiarly sinister significanes Both President Lincoln and President Garfield were killed by assassins 0: types unfortunately not uncommon i history. President Lincoln falling victim to the terrible passions arouset by four years of civii war and Presi dent Garfield to the reveagefui vrnit3 of a disappointed offioe seeker. Presi dent Mclinley was killed by an utter ly deprae-i criminal belonging to tha bo'y ol cirminals who object to al] governmets, good and bad alike, whC are ataiast any form of popular lib erty ii it is guaranteed by even th< most jus sa h baral laws and who ,re as hottile to the upright exponen- vf a free peroue's sober will as w' the tyran nizsi and irresponsiole despot. 

ANARCHY AND ANARCHISTS. The president continues with a eublgy ot Mr. MIKinley, then turns tc the djoet of Usrchy, denuoncing its doctrine6 and preaohers. He aE: I earnestly recommend to the congress that in the exercies of its wise discre tion it should take into consideratiot the coming to this country of anarch ists or persons professing priaoiples hostile to all government and jastify ing the murder of those placed in au thority. uch individuals as those who not long ago gathered in open meeting to glorify the murder of King Hum bert of Italy perpetrate a crime, and the law should insure their rigoroas punishm nt. They and those like them should be kept out of tbis couatry. and if found here they shoald be piomptly deported to the country whenec th ey came, and farreaching provision shculd be made for the punishmoat of LjEe who stay. No matter calls more urgent ly for Lne wisest thought of the con gress. A 

SUBJECT FOR VEDERAL COURTS. The federal courts should be given jurisdiction over any mau who kills or attempts to kil the president or any man who by the constitution or b law is in line of succession for the presidency, while the punishment for an unsuccessful attempt shotdid be pro~ portion to the enormity of the offense against our instimutions. Anarchy is a crime against the whole human race, and all mankind should band against the anarchist. His crime should be mrade an cffense against the law of nations, like piracv and that form of man stealing known as the slave trade. The president next considers busi ness conditions which he finds bignty satisfactory. He continues: The tremendous and highly complex industrial development which went on with ever accelerated rapildity during the latter half of the nineteentb cen tury brings us face to face at the be ginning of the twentieth with very serous social proelems. The old laws and the old customs which had almost the binding force of law were once quite suffient to regulate the accumu ation anu distribution of wealth. 'Snco the industrial changes which have so enormousiy increased the produc ive power of mankind they are no longer suffiient. 

TRADE COMBINATIONS. The growth 0t cities has gone o:n be yond camparison faster than the growth of the country, and the up Duiding of the great industrial centers has mernat a s:aruing increase not merely in thle aggeste ef wealth, bu; in th.e numboer very la-ge indivicua] and espectily of very iarge corporate ounes. Th creation of th-ee Lreat oroate fortunes has not Deen cue to tae tufi nor to aLy other govern mentei acaon, but to ng..urai causes in te DmieILs worid, operausng :ai O~Ca eon..rr asi eey opeinte in our own. The pic.cs ha s roused mouch an tagong a reat p'art of wticeh is wa y a ut warrant. It is not trur tat as u- sea have grown richer the p;oor have grown poorr. 0' .1.sh cen cay, never betere has th' averagt :ne tihe g rkr 'e 'amer, t maaI zacrer, teen so w il off as in tha cu::ry ;jd at Lthe pretent ut1e. lier accatoaL1on of wealgh, yet t rm-i na a imn euua~ed in aga.ms. buriacss eo se n~comu~LL tly on condmoan or con cr-:ng im Sneom~ful enier..risc oi the type &Al ztnfia si alma~ ean oniy exr.t it ne conditions are sucai as ao .if..r grea; pnzes as the rewards of suess. REASONs FOR CAUTION. The president adds tha~t there ar; many reaon for caution in dealiol wLb corpomicos. Hle etys: The same buies candi'ions whiot have prodtucrd ine grea. aggregatioLm of corp':rate and individual wesitn have made them very potent fc'.rs in in n ratioiim commercial competition. Mrsever, it cannce too cften b pointed GLut that to strike wrth igacra violence at the interests of orne set o! men aimot inevitsbiy endans~ers thre itrests of a.X'. The fundamrental rulh in c.u: national life-the rule whichi un c erlies ali others-is that, on the whoen and in the long r an, we shall go up o: down together. The mechanism of mcdern businea is so deiate that enreme care muns :s taken not to interfere with it in a rpirit of rashness or ignorance. In dealing with business interests, for the government to undertake by crude and t l considered legisation to do what may turn out to be bad, would be to in cur the risk of such farreaching nation il disaster that it would pe preferaOle .o undertake nothing at all. The men -who demand the impossible or the un desirable serve as the allies of the forces with which they are nomizally at war, for they hamper those who would endeavor to fiad out in rational fashion what the wrongs really are and to what extent and in wbak manner it is practicable to apply remcdie8. HOW TO 

CORRECT THE EVILS. All this is true, aid yet it is also true that there t re real and grave evils, one of the obief being overeapitaliz3 tion beaause of i-s nany baleful con srquences, and a resolute and practical ef)rz must be =ade to correct thee evils. It is no limitation npan prcparty rights or freedom of contract to require that when men receive from government i the privilege of doing business under corporate form. which frees them from individual re. p ribility and enables them to call in.o their enterprises the capital of the public., they sLall do to upon abso!utety truthfut representa tions as to the value of the pz. pzrty in which the espital is to be investal Corporations engaged in interstate acm merce should be regulatcd if they are zound to excrcise a license working to the public in jury. It should be as much the aim of those who seek for social betterment to rid the business world of crimes of cUnning as to rid the entire body politic of crimes of violerco Great corporations exist only becuse they are ereated ana safeguarded by .)ur institutions, and it is therefore our duty to see that they work in harrony with these institutiors. PUBLICITY THE FIRST ESSENTIAL. The first esseni.-1 in dctermi-ing how to deal with the great iadvotrial c.mbinations is knfledge of the ao s -puolicity. In L, interest of the pub lie the government should have tab right to irspect and m.:nine the work ing of the great corporations engsged in interstate business. Publicity is the only cure remed3y whi:a we can now invoke. What further remedies are needed ia the way of governmental regulation or tszation can only be de termined after puolicity has been ob tained by process of law and in the course of administration. The first .equisite is knowledge, full and com p'.ete-knowledge which may be made public to the world. Arificial bodies, such as corporations and joint stock or other associations, depending upon any statutory law for their existene or pu;i!eges should be subject to proper governmental super vision, and fail and acaurate inforcaa Lion as to their operations should be made public regularly at reasont.ble in t:v'als. The large corporstions, commoaly called trusts, though organized in one tate, always do business in many states, often doing very little business in the state where they are incorpora ted. There i'S utter lack of uniformity in the state laws about them, and, as no state has any exclusive interest in or power over their acts, it has in prac tie prcved impossible to get adeqiate regulation through state action. Tnere fore, in the interest of the whole peo ple, the nation should, without inter fering with the power of the states in the matter itself, also assume power of supervision and regulation over all cor porations doing an interstate business. AMEND CONSTITUTION IF NECESSARY. When the constitution was adopted, at the end of the eighteenth century, no human wisdom could foretell the sweeping changes, alike in industrial and political conditions, which were to take plane by the beginning of the twentieth century. At that time it was accepted as a matter of course that the several states were the proper au thorities to regulate, so far as was then necessary, the comparatively insignifi cant and strictly localized corporate bodies of the day. The conditions are now wholly different, and wholly differ ent action is called for. I believe that a ha v can be framed which will enable the national govern ment to exercise control along the lines above indicated, prolting by the experi ence gained through the passage and administration of the interstate com merce act, if, however, the judgment of the congress is that it lacks the con stitutional power to pass such an act then a constitutional amendment shoul be submitted to confer the power. Theie should to created a cabinet of fieer, to be known as secretary of comn morce and industries, as provided in te bill introducrd at the last session of the coDgress. It should be his povice to deal with commerce in its brQ det sense, including among many Iothsr things whatever conocrns labor and ali maters aff:eting the great buisi nes corporntions aAd our merchant marine. LABOR. The president decunres that ho re gards ir necessary to re-enact the sJ'2i nese exciusion law. In regard to leebr he sases that the government ecu:d provde in its c*~iusea:s that alt rozck snccb done user - fair" condi~in' as that all ni~iht work should be tor biuen for women a.A children as wl a exceseve overi..e. lBe conftiente2: Verygat go;: h.: bacn and will be I.ip'se D y ~aiOons or u-n o was.:a-rkers when managd a tii foreacught su wti ca0- tbey co.moine in i--tence ~upan tseir orir rights with la ab'ding respeot for the rights cf' ohrs ?The display of these qualities in auch bodies is a duty to the nation Ino iess than to the associations themn selves. Finally, there must also in many cases be action by the govern mnt in order to safeguard she rights and irnterests of all. Under our consti uion there is much mere soo;e for 1such action by the nation. But on Ipoints such as those touched on above Ithe national government can act. He asserts Uhat the immigration laws are unestisfactory and that a law should be enacted to keep out Dot only anar chists, but persons of a low moral ten dency or cf unsavory reputation and Ithose who are below a certain standard of een otio iiness to enter our indus trial fidid as campotitors with Ameri an laber. THE 

TARIFT AND RECIPROCITY. The president declares that nothing could be more unwise than to disturb thesnessaa interest of the country by any general tariff change at this time. He adds: Yet it is not cnly possible, but emi nently desirable, to combine with the stability of our economic system a sup plementary system of reciprocal bene fit and obligation with otler nations. Such reciprocity is an incident and re sult of the firm estab ihment ar d pres ervation of our present economic poli cy. It was Epeiially provided for in the present tariff law. RLeiprocity must be treated as the handmaiden of protec-ion. Our fust dulty is to see that the prutection grant ed by the tariff in every ease where it is needed is maintained, and that. reci procity be sought for so far as it can safely be dore without irjury to our home industries. Just how fs this is must be determined socording to the individual case, remembericg always that every application of our tariff poli cy to meet our shifting national rnceds must be conditioned upon the cardinal fact that the duties must never be re duced below the point that will cover the difference between the labor cost here and abroad. The well being of the wageworkera is a prime considera tion of cur entire policy of economic legisiati. &0a 

NEED FOR WIDER MARKETa Subjecs to this proviso of the proper protection neceassary to our industrial well being at home, the principle of re ciprocity must command our hearty support. The phenomenal growTh o; our Export trade emphasizes the urgen cy of the ne:d for wider markets and for a liberal policy in dealing with for eign nations. Wzatever is merel; pet ty and vexatious in the way of trade restrictions should be avoided. The customers to whom we dispose of our surplus prodaoIs in the long run, dt reetly or indirectly, purchase ose sur plus products by giving us something in return. Their ability to puruhsse our products shodld as isr as possible be secured by so arranging our tariff a: to enable us to take from them those prozneus which we can ue without harm o on ovia iadu3triea and labor or the us0 Ef which will be of marked benefit to us. It is most important that we should maintain the high level of our present prosperity. We have now reached the point !n the development of our inter ests where we not only able to suppiy oar own markets, but to prada'ce a can santly growing aurplus for which we ust fiad markets abroad. To secure these markets we can utiliz3 existing dnties in any esse where they no longer needed far the purpose of protec.ion, r in any case where the aricle is not produced here and the duty is no longer neceseary for revenue, as goivig us omething to offer in exahange for what we ask. The cordial relations with other nations which are so deira ble will naturally be promot.ed by the course thus required by our own inter esIe. The natural line -f developmezt for a policy of reciprocity will be -In conneo ion with those of our productions which no longer require all of the sup port once needed to establieh thera upon a sound basis and with those oth ers where either because of natural or of economic causes we are beyond the reach of aucessaful competition. I ask the attention of the senate to he reciprocity treaties laid before it by y predecessor. THE 

MERCHANT MARINE. The condition of the American mer hant marine is such as to call for im ediate remedial action by the con ress. It i3 discreditable to us as a na tion that our merchant marine .should e utterly insignificant in comparison o that of other nations whichgwe over top in other forms of business. We hould not longer submit to conditions uder which o:.Iy a trii ing portion of ur great cemmerce is carried in our wn ships. To remedy this state of hings would not merely serve to buita p our shipping interests, but it would lso result in benefit to all who are in erested in the permsnent establish nt of a wider market for Americsn roduets and would provide an auxili ary force for the Davy. Ships vtork jar teir own countries just as railfoads ork for their terminal points. Ship pings lines, if establishea to the prinai psi countries with whioh we havs delings, would bo of political as well s commercial benefit. From every standpoint it is unwise f or the United ates to continue to rely upon the shps of ciompecing nations for the dis ribution of our goods. It should be naie advantageous to carry American goods in American built ships. At present American shipping is un der certain great disadvantages when at in competition with the shipping .f foreign oounaties. Many of the fast foreign steamships, at a speed of four teen knots or above, are suosaizec, ed all oar ships, sailing vessels sad tamers alike, cargo comries of slow speed anid mail carries of high speed, rve to meet the fact that the original ost of "ruilding American ships is greater than is the case abroad; tbat the ages paid Americaxn oefcers and sea men are very rmuch higher than tho~se pad the offiers and sea men of ieroign ompeting countries, and that the anard of living on cur ships is far :'rior to the standard of liviaig on he shics of our conmercial rivais. Ojr governent should take such action s will remedy these inequshuies. The merican merchant. marise shoull bn eeord to the occan. 

TINANCIAL. The passage of the act establiehing o as the standard i-nney has, it is ciared, been shown to be timely and bdicus. The president adds: In maroy respects the nation1l bank ig las furnisnes suffiient liberty for tae proper exercise -of the barsing funtion, bar. tnere seems en be nee d of better safeguards againss the de raning influence of commercia! crises an nuaneial pauies. bioreover, the uency of the coun-y should be mde responsivo to t~he demaneds of our onstic trade and eemmeros. LEonomy in expenditures is urged. Amendment ct Lhe interstate commeree act is advieed to insure the cardinal provions of that aet. The work car tied on by the department cf agricul tur is next considered and praised igly. The president then turns to forest preservation a'nd irrigation of arid lands, saying that both are highly necessary. He would put all the work in connection with the forest reserves in charge of the bureau of forestry. 

IRRIGATION. The president continues by tracing th cnanection between the forest re serves and the rater r-upply. He says: The forests are natural reservoirs. By restraining the sireams in flood nnd repienehing them in draught they make potsible the use of waters other wise wasted. 'They prevent the soil from washing and so protect the stor. age rescrvoirs from filling up with sit. Forest conservation is, therefore an essenjial condition of water corser vation. The forests alone cannot, however, fully regu'ate and conserve the waters c the arid region. Great stcrage works are necessary to equaliz 3 the flow ol strzama snd to save the flood waters. Their ecastruction has been cor clu sivelv shown to be an urdertakIng too vast for private effort. ,Nr can it be best ac iemplisi d by the individual states acting alone. The government should consruat and maintain these reservoirs as is oces other public works. Where their purpose is to regulate the flow of streams, the water should be turned freely in the channels in the dry s jason to take the same course ander the same laws as the natural gow'. The reclamation of the unsettled arid public ltnds presente a different prob lem. Here it is not enough to regulate the fjw of.stresms. TLe object of the govErament is to dispose of the land to settlers who will build homes upon it. To accomplish this object water must be brought within their reach. The pionetr settlers on the arie pub lic dcmain chose their homes along streams from which they could them selves divert the water to reclaim their holdinge. Such cpportunitiCs are prac tically gone. There remain, however, vast areas of public land which can be made avilable for homestead settle ment, but only by reservoirs and main line canals impracticable for private enterprise. These irrigation works shoald be built by the nationil govern ment. The iatds reclaimed by them should be reserved by the government for scusa ;etdlers. and the cost of con stiuction ehould, so far as possible, be repaid by the land reclaimed. The dis tribution of the water, the division of the streams among irzigatcrs, should be lett to the setders themselves in eniormity with state laws and with out interference with those laws or with vested rights The declaration is made that in the arid states the only right to water which should be reacguized is that of use. The president sajs that the doc trine of przvate ownership of water apart from land cannot prevail without causing wrong. 

INSULAR PROBLEMS Insular quescions are next treated. In Hawaii our aim must be to dvelop the territory on the traditional Amer ioan lines. Porto Rico is declared to be thriving as nover before. The atten tion of congress ia called to the need of legislation concernirig the island's pub lic lands. In Cuba it is sated that much progress '-s been made toward putting the independent government of the island upon a firm footing, and it is declared that indapeadence will be an accomplished fLet. The president addi: Elsewhere I have discussed the ques tion of reciprocity. In the case of Cu ba, however, there are weighty reasons of morality and of national interest why the policy should-be held to have a peculiar application, and I most ear nestly ask your attention to the wis aom, indeed to the vital need, of pro viding for a substantial reduction in the tariff duties on Cuban imporis into the United states. In dealing with the Philippine peo ple we must show both patience and strength, forbearance and steadfast res olution. Our aim is high. We do not desire to do for the islanders merely what has elsewhere been done for trop ic peoples by even the best foreign governments. We hope to do for them what has never before been done for any people of the tropis-to make them fit for self government after the fashion of the really free nations. The only fear is lest in our overanx iety we give them a degree of inde peudence for which they are unfit, there by inviting reaction and disaster. As fast as there is any reasons'te hope that in a given district the people can govern themselves self government has been given in that district. There is not a locality fitted for Eelf govern ment which has not received it. But it may well be that in certain csses it will have to be with drawn because the inhabitants shows themselves unfit to exercise it; such instances have already occured. In other words, there is not the slightest chanes of our failing to show a sufficiently humanitarian spirit. The danger comes inl~he opposite direc tion. 

TROUBLES AHEAD YET. There are still troubles ahead in the ishnads. The insurrection has become an affair of locti banditti and maraud era, who desetve no higher regard than the brigaads of portions of the o:m world. Eaocu:agement, direct or indirecz, to those insurrectos stands on tue same footing as cocogragement to hcsile kdians in the days when we sti.l had Ih?sn wars. The presidert declares that the time has come for addiinal legislation for the Pmlippa~es. He says: It is necesn3ry that the congres should ;aa haws by which the re scurces of Lte isiards c-an be developed so tut franeisee (?or hmiredl terms i year ) can be g:.atetd to companies do ing busine.:s in !hem ar.d every encour agement bie given to the inconing of businees men of every kind. It is ur ge ntly mceemry to cnact suitable laws oeahr-g with general transportation. mimtng, beims, currncy, Lomesd andi the use andt osneship of t:.e lands ad timber. Three irwe will give fiec play to industrial en:erprise, and the commarcial deva~op-nent which wil1 surely follow will aff.ord to the people of the islands the best proofs of the sincerity of orir draire to aid t'o.
