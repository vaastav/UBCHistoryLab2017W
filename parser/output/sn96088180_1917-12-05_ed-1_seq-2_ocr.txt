THE MESSAGE On first reading, the president's message to congress brings out two point with startling clearness: There I to be no thought of peace until an absolute victory Is won; and the burden of the task is to rest on the shoulder of the United State. This declaration will have the . hearty support of the people of the country, Irrespective of political party. The president's ringing dec larations are genuine American and not partisan. There can be no two opinions of that question. But this brings one face to face with the probable fact that the war la far from an end. It indicates years more of awful struggle. The fact that it Is a struggle between freedom and slavery only emphasizes the fact that it Is a fight to the death. The concensus of well-informed opinion is that Germany must be beaten into submission be fore a world peace is possible, and i that Is a consumation not yet in sight, though its final arrival Is ab solutely certain. The president makes it plain that the country should devote itself sole ly and unreservedly to the business of making war. He Is right. Any action, any proposed policy, that can In any way lessen the progress of America' war preparations and war prosecution, .should he shoved to one side without hesitation. War is the business of the hour, a statement that is true of the Individual Ameri can as much as it is of the country as a whole.
