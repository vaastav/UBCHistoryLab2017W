COST OF STATE ROADS Some Figures of Interest to All Interested Good Roads in There lias been considerable dis cussion of the policy of state aid to counties in roaa building, and the question will be one of the important ones in the next legislative session. There has been criticism of cost, it being claimed that roads could be built cheaper by old methods. State aid involves to some extent state supervision, and that is irksome to many. The following figures, com­ piled from the records, show the actual cost to the county of the state road work, and may possibly change some opinions. They will be worth study.

Warner, founder of the local Merchants State Bank, and for several yeais a resident of this city, had a narrow escape from drowning while ice-boating on White Bear lake last Saturday, being saved only by the heroic efforts of his son, Allyn, aged 17 years. Mr. Warner is. a brother of Mrs. C. H. Brown and Miss Lucy Warner of this city, and with his family visited here Thanksgiving day with his sisters. All will admire the bavery of the youth, who. after saving himself from a watery grave, re­ mained to save his father. The St. Paul Dispatch has the following story of the accident: Ice-boating on White Bear laep was the cause of two accidents Saturday and Sunday last, one of which. at least, came within a hair-breath of being a fatality. H. A. Warner, banker, of White Bear, lies ill in bed but happy that he is alive to tell the story of his rescue by his gallant son. Father and son were out ice-boating on the lake Saturday when a sudden saual drove the ice boat, tilted up on one skate, into the open water off the point of Manitou Island. The momentum was such that the men were separated from the ooat, and had to swim for it. Allyn Warner, 17 years old, suceeding in lifting himself on the ice but Mr. Warner could not find a piece of ice firm enough to bear his weight. Mr. Warner called to his son: "Allyn, there's no use of both us dying, get away from the anger spot. Allyn was not built that way. Finding he could not grasp his father's hand without exterme danger he took off his overcoat and threw the end to the struggling man. As soon as the weight of the elder man was hauled up on the edgeot the ice it gave way Four attempts, with his father's life at stake, did young Warner make and four times the ice foiled his efforts. The fifth time, however, they had reached a part of the ice field that was firmer and he was able to haul his father over the cracking ice till he reached firm ice. Father and son. shivering with cold, but full of gratitude for their deliver­ ance, walked two miles over the ice to the home of Casper Bloom, where the usual restoratives in such cases were used. The two were taken to Mr. Warner's home at White Bear. Dr. Francis, coroner at White Bear, at­ tended the two all day Sunday and today they are both able to be up. "I had given up all hope of ever trotting ottt, said Mr. Warner.
