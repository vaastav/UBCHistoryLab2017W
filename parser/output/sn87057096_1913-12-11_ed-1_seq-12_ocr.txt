THi: MESSAGE OF STATES MAX. President Wilson's first annual message to congress is remarkable alike for its broad statesmanship and lofty patriotism, and for its brev tty and abiding good nature. Taft flabbiness and Roosevelt ranting are alike absent. The president thanks congress for good work already done, even while setting it new tasks he expresses his pleasure at being associated with a body of men devoted to the interests of their country and he manages to pack his unhurried courtesy and a broad review of the "state of the union" into less than 4,000 words. To those who remember the Niagaras of language that used to descend on congress at the beginning of every session, this last fact must seem the most, amazing of all. With all his courtesy and good humor, President Wilson makes no cheap play for popularity. Indeed, he leans backward rather than seem to bid for applause. When speaking of the imperative need of legislation to improve farm credits, he is care ful to state that American farmers do not desire and must not receive any special privilege. Truly, times have changed since the days when special privilege was accepted as the natural order of things and when the only question at issue was to distri bute government favors in such wise as to buy more support for the ad ministration. As forecast by the Journal, Presi dent Wilson insists on the steady consideration and early passage of the currency bill, and holds that the regulation or suppression of trusts is the supreme task of his administra tion and of the present session of congress. He says: "I think all thoughtful observers will agree that the immediate service we owe tlie business communities of the country is to prevent private monopoly more effectually than it has yet been prevented." The means by which this result is to be secured will be discussed in a special message, but the president pauses long enough to make one fact clear. He wants the Sherman anti trust law to stand. Further trust legislation must supplement and clar ify that statute, not emasculate or re peal it. This is in sharp contrast to the Roosevelt plan of pulling the teeth of the Sherman law and leav ing an all-powerful executive to classify and deal with "good" and "bad" trusts at his pleasure. Perhaps the part of the message which gave President Wilson most pleasure in the writing is that which deals with our foreign relations. He points out that the nation is not only at peace, hut is leading in the move ment to make peace the normal and stable condition of the world. Thir ty-one countries, comprising four fifths of the population of the earth have given their assent in principle to the plan to complete investigation and publication of all facts relating to a controversy before a resort to arms. This by no means banishes the possibility of war, even among nations thus agreeing but it is step in the right direction. President Wilson deals with the Mexican situation in language which must give small comfort to would-be dictators and believers in govern ment by concessions. "Mexico has no government. The attempt to maintain one at the City of Mexico has broken down, and a mere military despotism has been set up which has hardly more than the semblance of national authority. It originated in the usurpation of Vic toriano Huerta, who. after a brief at tempt to play the part of constitu tional president, has at last cast aside even the pretense of legal right and declared himself dictator. "There can be no certain prospect of peace in American until Gen. Huerta has surrendered his usurped authority until it is understood on all hands, indeed, that such pretend ed governments will not be counte nanced or dealt with by the govern ment of tlie United States." Those few sentences will do more to end the perennial revolution of a certain part of Latin America than all the bullying of all the powers. Taken in connection with President Wilson's Mobile speech, in which he denounced government by concession aires, they constitute a new declara tion of freedom and charter of order for the whole western continent. There is not space to do more than glance at other distinguishing fea tures of the president's message, though the Journal will discuss some of them at length in later editorials. His recommendation of legislation to improve farm credits has been notic ed. He calls for the enactment of a national presidential primary law, and wishes to change radically the makeup of national conventions. He points out that conservation must provide for the use of natural re sources, not for the mere locking up of the same. He wants a govern ment railroad in Alaska, better sup port for the bureau of mines, a rail way employers' liability law and he pledges the nation to advance toward complete independence of the Philip pines by cautious but unfaltering steps. It is the message of a statesman and a scholar, of a patriot who is big enough and wise enough to seek no unfair advantages for his country, of a man of peace who is no whit afraid of fighting, of a president who considers himself the servant of all the people, not of any particular class.—Chicago Journal.

SUMMER IN WINTER. Worse for business than tariff un certainty, worse than fear of war, worse than exhausting depression that no one can explain, and in some respects than mild-eyed panic, is summer weather in winter. With November and December temperatures all the way from Medicine Hat to Eastport ranging in the 60 and 70 s, what of apples de caying, potatoes sprouting, cheeses mildewing, and beets, turnips and onions withering? What of great stocks of heavy clothing, flannel underwear, yarn socks, hobnailed shoes, rubbers, ear muffs and furs with which countless shelves are loaded, while customers expected are going about in Coney Island raiment? What of the diversions of winter (or which costly preparations have been made but for which few have an appetite? What of investments undertaken and big loans contracted in the rea sonable expectation that things would be this year as usual? With industry and commerce ad justed to seasonal changes, when summer is protracted into winter, what commercial calamity can equal it When nature itself puts an embar go upon trade, where is the states man or economist who can propose a remedy? With May appearing in December, the slowing down of business is as easily explained as the flight from a seaside hotel on the first appearance of frost. Money and hopes are em barked in winter enterprises with no winter at hand. We might as well be at the equator with a stock of mit tens and chest protectors, or at the north pole with a roof garden. It is late but not yet too late for recovery. Symptoms of it will not be seen first on the exchanges or in the activities of lawmakers. They must be looked for in the movement of the mercury, downward.—New York World. A PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY. President Wilson makes the novel and interesting suggestion that candi dates for the presidency be nominat ed in primaries and that the conven tion in national politics be made ex actly what it is in Missouri state poli tics—a gathering of nominees to for mulate a platform. Whatever may be the fate of this suggestion, one thing is beyond dis cussion. That is that the old type of national delegate—the man who won his election by the pulling of wires and then went to the national convention with no object except to advance his own political schemes by liis voice and vote—is a thing of the past. He is as out of place in politics, as progressive citizens now under stand it, as a dodo would have been in the poultry show at the Coliseum last week. The American people demand to day that the nomination of a presi dential candidate be a true and exact reflection of the popular will. This demand is not to be resisted, and the public will smash any organization or any machine that stands in its way. Whether the direct presidential primary is to come or not it would take a prophet to divine. We have today the instructed delegate, who goes to the convention simply to reg ister the will of the voters of his dis trict. Whatever may be the final plan, the victory for popular choice as against boss choice is already fought—and won. Why, even the re publicans are about to reform'—St. Louis Republic. $1,108,681,777. This is the sum total of the appro priations asked of congress by the various departments for running the government during the next fiscal year. It is 539,255,066 less than the Taft administration demanded for the present fiscal year, and is so far responsive to democratic pledges of economy. But it is $22,864,067 more than the last republican con gress actually appropriated, and is so far a very bad response. The need of a co-ordinated budget system is again shown by this pitch forking together of department esti mates. Left to itself and in rivalry with others, any department of the government will be apt to exaggerate its needs, under whatever party con trol, and the more exaggerated it is tlie better it will hope to fare at the hands of congress. In this case a mockery is made of democratic criti cism of republican extravagance. It is now in order for a democratic congress to take the figures and cut them to the quick. There can be no good reason why the total should exceed or equal the billion dollar mark. Standard Oil is not cutting the price of gasoline in order to drive the independents out of business, as has been maliciously charged. Mr. Rocke feller is simply trying to brighten the Christmas of the automobile owner. One of the cotton mills at New Bedford has declared an extra cash dividend of $400,000 and will in crease its stock by $800,000. Pre paring, of course, for ruin under the low tariff. By advocating the direct nomina tion of candidates for the presidency, President Wilson shows the republi cans a remedy for their southern delegate trouble. The Clinton Advertiser says: 'There is only one thing grander than a man who can trust you a man who will trust you." The Iowa City Republican thinks 'it is good to have another White House wedding, to remove the recol lection of Alice." Assemblyman Sulzer of New York has filed his statement of election ex pense and we venture to say that it is truthful. ii&$ir* 0 A Manicure Sets 

WASHINGTON LETTER. Washington, D. C., Dec. 8.—Spec ial Correspondence.—Three Iowa vis itors in Washington in the last few days made confident predictions that the democrats "will elect the next United States senator and the next governor in Iowa, and the returning republican congressmen admit that the situation their party faces in the state is a hopeless one. Several things have combined to bring about this situation. As to the senatorship the predictions of democratic success are based on the following factors: The continued division in the re publican ranks and the certainty of a third ticket in the field, drawing its support from the progressive re publicans. Senator Cummins' action in bolt ing the Taft ticket last year, dis pleasing the regular republicans. His vote against the Underwood tariff bill, virtually a vote for the continuance of the Payne-Aldrich law, which he had denounced, and a vote against the income tax, which he had favored. Senator Cummins' attack on Presi dent Wilson of assuming party leadership, which is the thing the public indorse most in the president, while he had criticised Taft for being led instead of being the leader, which by the way, was the cause of Taft's overthrow. Democratic leaders feel that Sena tor Cummins has further alienated the regular republicans, has displeas ed the progressive, republicans by failing Senators LaFollette and Poindexter in supporting the Under wood tariff reductions and is further displeasing them by advocating the reform of the republican party by means of a convention, called by the same national committee which split his party, and made up of delegates the majority of whom would be as standpat as the delegates at the Chi cago convention, and as willing to further any reforms except upon grounds purely of political expedien cy which means little to the progres sives of the party who see principles at stake and not politics. Added to this are the senator's at tacks on President Wilson, who popular with Iowans of all politic beliefs for the record he has made in the White House. National com mitteeman W. J. Wade, who has been in Washington the past week, de clares that the democrats accept the senator's challenge in raising the Wilson issue, and that they will go before the people on the president's record in the White House and will ask that a democratic senator and democratic congressman be elected from Iowa so as to strengthen the president's hands. "If," Judge Wade declared, "thete was any force in the arguments the republicans used to make that a minority congressman had no opportunity to do anything for the people of Iowa, there is as much force now and the people will best serve their interests by sending men to congress to join the dominant party and help the president carry oat the reforms he has planned." Judge Wade also declared that tho THE 

LEON REPORTER, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 11, 1913. W eSANT Fountain Pens Kodaks Thermos Bottles Nylo Chocolates Pennants Safety Razors Hand ^Traveling Cases Mirrors Hair Purses Card Cases Brushes fact that the farmers continue to get high prices for their products is an evidence that there was no founda tion for the assertions that a tariff reduction would work to the injury of the farmer. Claude R. Porter and Dan Hamilton expressed similar views of the political situation at home. As to the governorship, members of the republican delegation in con gress, who have returned after visit ing in their districts report hopeless party outlook. "The Iowa man who goes to the polls at the spring primary after pay ing his taxes, increased from 20 to 30 per cent by a republican state ad ministration, will not be in a pleasant state of mind toward this administra tion," one of them said. "And he will not be in any more pleasant state of mind when he goes to the polls in November after paying the second half of these increased taxes. More over he will find that in many cases railroad taxes have been reduced by a big figure, while adjoining farm lands have been increased." This is progressing in a way not at all to the liking of the man who pays the taxes. The capitol grounds exten sion is another matter of widespread condemnation in the southern half of the state and Gov. Clarke and the other state officers will suffer for it. One of the Iowa republican members said the congressional elections would be affected when the republi can candidates were asked to take a stand either supporting or con demning the officials responsible for the increased taxes. While the re publicans face this hopeless outlook, the democrats are in fine feather, with a popular president carrying on a program of popular reforms and re ceiving the united support of the Iowa democratic delegation in the house. President Wilson is receiving uni versal praise and widespread support for his primary plan advocated in his able message at the opening of congress last week. President Wilson favors the nomination of presidential candidates at primary elections and the use of the conventions after the primaries "only for the purpose of declaring and accepting the verdict of the primaries and formulating the party platforms." His plan of hav ing these conventions made up of the nominees for congress, the nominees for vacant seats in the senate, the senators, whose terms have not clos ed, the national committees and the candidates for the presidency them selves, it is agreed, would be the soundest step for the inauguration of popular government and would guarantee the success of the popular choice of the people. At the same time this would charge the men the people elect with the responsibility of framing the platform on which they would again go befoxe the peo ple at the election. There is no doubt that a presiden tial primary law will "be enacted dur ing the Wilson administration, as well sua the currency and anti-trust legislation and farm credit la.w to which th» administration is pledged.
