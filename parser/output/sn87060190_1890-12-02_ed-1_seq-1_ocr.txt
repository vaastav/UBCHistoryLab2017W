Another Le;nl Kxecutlon In the Annex of the Ohio I'enltontlnry. Columbus, O., Dec. 2. Ellis Miller, of Union county, was hanged in the an nex of the penitentiary here shortly after midnight last night. Miller re mained cool and firm to the la3t, and died with a " God bless you all; I hope to meet you in heaven " on his lips. He dropped seven feet six inches, and did nof make a perceptible motion of either arm or leg after the fall. It was twenty seven minutes after the drop fell before life was pronounced extinct by the physicians, death having resulted from btrangulation. Miller's cose was never brought bo fore the state board of pardons, aud but little elfort was made to save his life after sentence had been pronounced. His crime was peculiarly heartless and cold-blooiljd, and without any of the circumstances which often mitigate the commission of murder. Ho had been a cruel husband, dissipated and worthless for many years, and finally in his drunken frenzy drove his wife from home. She tooK refugd with her sister, who lived near by, and the fact that this sister gave shelter to his wife brought upon her the enmity of Miller. Passing the house Miller met his bi9tor-in-law, and. without a word of warning, shot her so seriously that sho died within a few hours. His arrest, trial, conviction and finally his execution last night were the result of his bloody deed. Stole 81,200 Worth of Diamonds. New Albany, Ind., Dec. 2. The res idence of Samuel S.

News has just reached here of an outrage com mitted by Spanish smugglers on the Port Sanitary inspector in Charlotte harbor. His name is Morri3 Cochran, an appointee of the ssate board of health. He boarded a Spanish bdiooner, and when asked to show his papers the crew beized him and threw him overboard, afterward cutting his boat loose. With much difficulty he reached the shore. The schooner sailed off, and her name could not be learned. Mate Health Officer Torter has made an official complaint to the treasury de partment and the marine hospital serv u e, besides notifying the state depart ment, thai Spanish vessels are contin ually violating inU-i national law and treaty obligations by fishing in Florida waters inside the marine league limit. Cuba has p'aced a h.gh duty on Ameri can fish, and this with violations of law has bioken the exp rt fish business from Key West, which formerly am iunt ed to $100,000 or more annually, and the state health board asks for a coast patrol.

The accident on the Mercer county pipe line that deprived this city of natural gas two days last week occurred on S. B. Freshour's farm near Covington, Miami county, about twtnty-six miles north of here. A sec tion of the twelve-inch main, twenty c ne and three-quarter feet, burst with a terrific report that was heard for miles, and the farmers of all that neighbor hood were greatly alarmed, fearing a general blowup. At the instant of the explosion a great blue cloud of gas shot into the air and spread over the farm like an umbrella. The heavy pipo was ripied its full length, bent into V shape, thrown seventy-five feot up, then falling, buried itself eighteen inches in the ground. The scene was like that of a volcano in eruption, scattering clods of earth and dust and lead from the couplings over the area of an acre, and leaving an open trench or crater nearly one hun dred feet long. This left only an eight inch pipe line to supply Dayton, Piinui, Troy, Springfield, the Nation il milit home and state insane asylum, lne small line being then overtaxed, an ac cident resulted that still further crip pled the supply of those c ities and insti tutions.
