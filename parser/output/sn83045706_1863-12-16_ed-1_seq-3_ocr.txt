WILLIAM rfTTt lTnw . in -Utt, 1 11 IHHHHHHBMHBaMBMM ! The PresMeat and hi Favorites. In tkj Housa of Representatives, on Wednesday last, Mr. Foote, if Tennewee, submitted (he follow ing remarks on that part of the President's message in wnie&.ne ascribes our defeat at Chattanooga to the want of courage on the oart of our boons. The Presiderrtjn defiance of the wishes of the whole country, retains a favorite in command who has lost Tennessee, a part of Georgia, and a Dart of North- Carolina ; and when inquiries are made as to the cause of the late great disaster at Lookout, hd when very one is looking toihe President for the truth on the subject, he tells the "country that his favor ite is not to blame, but that the' responsibility for mo toss ot mat battle res ts on a portion of our brave troop ;, But to the remarks oFGen. Foote: Mr. Foote moved. tv n4 inun.. i..t committee to whom mi .mrarrA k. n.:- of the President's message relating to military af fairs be instructed to enquire into the cause of our late disastrous defeat before f!htor, ... certain whether it was owing, as iffcrmaliy stated I oy tne President in his message, to the want of valor 00 P of our army, or to other causes. Mr. Foote read from the President's message that . portion wtach alludes to the late battle before Chat-1 wuuoga. ne saia be took issue with the President or with any one else who would charge our army1 with a want of valor. . A more valiant body ol men the world never saw. He charged the Presi dent with the responsibility of that defeat, and he could prove it ; When Bragg was in Kentucky.be WW then he was incompetent and should be retired fonjtba army. . At the battle of Perryrtttaj-waen lie ppoBe divide his army, a military council- mama .MJ.ir.i. . - . . r . . w . " "a uuicersproiestea against It - ore tnan nme months ago he had, with a number of his coireagoes,'the whle delegation from his' State waited upon the President and respectfully entreated him to remove General Bragg and place Joe Johnson in command of that army. What was the answer? It was not for him to say, but the country knows. He had been through the army in Tennessee-he had visited dl the camps he had talked with all the officers and h ut a feeling of distrust with Bragg. His army Tiad no confidence in him. Ha hri di-in... .n hi officers out of the army. He had made a martyr ol n eJjad "roniated the gallant Breckinridge. He was soonstituted that he could not agree with his officers. He was on bad terms even with Hardee. ; This was well known. He had seen a letter from Bragg to a member of Congress a fact which could not be disproved in which he said that he could not command that army efficiently unless he could get rid of twelve Brigadier-Generals and a regiment of field officers. The President had persisted in keeping Bragg in office against the protest of both the army and peo ple. So he did with another favorite of his Pern b'erton. Although the Mississippi Legislature re--pudiated Pemberton, and charged the loss of Vicks burg to him, all the President ever did was to order a court martial, which never did any thing but meet for two days. Pemberton was still dear to the President . Ho was his bosom friend. While he was here the President had entertained him in his house. Nor Was this all What must be do, when be goes South, but to take Pemberton along with him. Wherever he went, Pemberton was with him. When he visited the army in Tennessee, and re viewed it, he passed before our men with Pember ton on his side, but he was glad to know that, on passing a portion of the army, a murmur rang along the lines, and the men pointed at Pemberton saying, " There goes the traitor that sold Vickburg." Just before the battle before Chattanooga Xhe President agreed to dividing and weakening the army by detaching Longstreet' s command, although the enemy in front were, before Longstreet was sent off, far superior in numbers to our army. Our army had beeat. left but forty thousand men, as he learned officially at .the War Department while the enemy s force was estimated at one hundred-to one hundred and ten thousand. Had Longstreet's command hot been sent away we should, in "all human probability, hive won the battle. The President's visits to the army bad never brought out any good. They, bad only been productive of disaster.. Had he nevfer have gone up to the army after the first battle of Manassas our troops would hare taken Washington. The. President ordered Bragg to fight the battle of Murfreesboro', and here again was theQbult of his military counsels. Would to God- he would never visit the army again. ' The Present had charged the atmy with a want of valor, but he charged the President with gross misconduct in retaining his favorites in office, and with partialities and prejudices, which, if persisted in longer, will prove fatal to pur cause. Mr. Fcotesaid that the President had charged his (Foote'e) constituency with a want of valor, and he wanted the facts in the case. If he was the only man in the House who had the courage to cast a vote of censure on the President, for maligning our brave army he should, at least, exercise that privilege-Mr. Milesv of South-Carolina, suggesting that the subject had best go to a select committee, for en quiry, Mr. Foote withdrew his resolution." The Scheme of the Secretary of the Treasury for the Relief of the Fiaances of the Govern- ' meat and the Improvement of the Confeder- . ate currency. ' The following is the scheme suggested bv Mi. Memmin ger, in bis report to Congress, for the relief of the gorern ment finances aod the improvement of the Confederate , currency, which, notwithstanding the crowded condition -ot eur columns, we present to our readers : 

SCHEME PROPOSED. 1. That Congress forthwith authorize a loan of 11,000, 000,000 in six per cent, bonds, the principal payab e in twenty years, the interest semi-annually ; to be extended hereafter, from time to time, so as to consolidate the whole public dtbt ; 2. That the Secretary of the Trevsnry be authorized to sell at par as many of the said bunds as will be sufficient to take up tbe outstanding currency and to pay the appro priations made by Congress. . 8 That tbe deposit of Treasury notes on account of the said loan may be received at the Treasury or any of its depositories, or by Commissioners to be appointed said deposits to be in sums of one hundred dollars, or in sums of which me hnndred is a perfect divisor. 4. Certificates shall be issued for such deposits, which sha.l entitle the holder to bonds, for the amount, with in terest from tbe date of deposit If the deposit be made in . the month of January, tbe bonds issued for tbe same shall be exempt from the tax of 5 per cent, for tbe present year, hereinafter mentioned; if made iu tbe moojh of February, ther shall be exempt from one-half of the tax; and if made in the month of Mirch; ther shall be exempt from ooe- burth of tbe said .tax. . iimcers, goiaiers, ana sesmeo, m service, shall be entitled to exemption from the whale tax for sums paid at any tune before April 1st, 18tfl. 8. A tax of 5 per cent stall be imposed on all property: and credits (other than the hew issue of aotes hereinafter mentioned) which may be held on the 1st ef April hext, to be paid on the 1st of July, one-half in Treasury notes and one-ba f in coin, or in the coupons of the bonds issued for j '6. Incase the coupons should advance in the market to j a premium exceeding i per cent, any iax-pvr auan oe 'permitted to pay his tax in treasury Aotes of the new is sue, with 25 "per cent added. 7. Wilhin six months a new and improved issue snail be made ot two hundred millions of treasury notes, in sub stitution fo- that amount of old issues, and all the old is ues st all be ar.celled, and the faith of the government is pledged not to increase said issues. 8. Notice shall be given to the holders of treasury notes, (other than the said two hundred millions.) requiring them to present their notes at the-Treasury, or at some of the depositories, on or before the 1st ity of April next, and rfr ceive payment thereof in b mds of the said consolidated loan, or in default thereof tbe notes not so brought in shall cease to bo current or receivable at the Treasury for du. but shall remain evidences of tbe debt payable by the Con federate States according to their tenor. ' ; 9. In the States beyond the Mississippi the time men tioned in the last clause shall be extended until the 1st '10. Six months more shall be allowed all holders of treasury notes to come in and register and verify their Botes as demands against the Treasury, and exchange the same for a certificate of debt ; or if they prefer to keep the notes the name of the holder shall be endorsed thereim, after which' tbe said notes shall be negotiable only by spe cial assignment, and all notes not so registered within the same time shall be barred from any further claim on the tiArrholder of a bond of the Confederate Stales may convert the same into one Of the bonds ander the this loan ; the 8 per cent.- bonds at par, and the others at a proppr ate rate ; and the loan shall be extended so as to abso rb all bonds which may be offered in exchange. ...,. 12. Tbe interest coupons of this loaashall be held equiv-. alent to specie in all future dealings of the govern men t and shall be accepted in payment of any tax hereafter made payable in coin. " i. a iS. The faith of the government is pledged to make aae onate provision forthe payment of the principal aod inter-, est of the said loan by the continuance of the tax mention ed in Article o,nntit a census shall be taxen, after wnien like provision Sbsll be made by direct taxes or by duties on iBTOorta and exports.

" ' ' "; ': Mr. Worth has issued as few treasury notes as possible, but has used Confederate currency in all his transactions when not positively directed by the Legislature to pay outvtreasury notes. .The result is that while the treasury notes of other States are only at par, North-Carolina uhfundahle. treasury notes(onesandtwo)aresellingattwoforohe, and the fundables at 250 to 260. In this, as well as many other respects that might be mentioned,he has ex hibited eminent judgment and ability as a financier ; ' and it is fortunate for the State that she has such an officer in this crisis! We make the following extracts from Mr. Worth's report: -' THE 

STATES INDEBTEDNESS.- Exnibit A, shows the bonds outstanding against the State, for what purpose, by what authority, and at what date issued, when due, and amount. - The amount of these bonds is $21,132,000, but in this sum is embraced $1,500,000, deposited in England as collateral security for the delivery of cotton,' which the State has contracted to, deliver, there. The State has purchased and has oh hand cotton probably worth as much, st the price agreed on, as Ihe debt we owe in England. The first class of bonds mentioned in this Exhibit, amounting to $53, 000, 1 do not find mentioned in toe reports of my predecessor. They are overdue, and I. was not aware that they were in existence until a number of the class were presented for payment . At what time they fell due I am unable to state, not having been able to find any entry in the office showing, the date of their issue, or the number and amount issued. JThey are registered bonds j and J find in the office a book in which the holders of these bond i tave receipts for the semi annual iatft-ati Trnm hich it appears that the total amount Df Mem was $370,000. The books show the payment of $317, 000, leaving unpaid $53,000. - . v - - Since the 1st of January last, I have Bold to the banks, six per cent, bonds, falling due January 1st, 1893, at par, to the amount of $2,665,500 :in pay ment of this amount due to them Tor temporary loans ; and as a means of supplying the Treasury in January and February last, I sold to the Com missioners of tbe Sinking Fund, at gar, out of tha same class of bonds, to. the amount of $970,500; and to others at an average premium of 3 per cent to the amount of $120,000. . - : The income of the Sinking Fund will probably be much more than sufficient to pay the bonds fal ling due in 1864 and 1865. x -: -: The Farmers' Bank and the Bank of Washington say they have invested as much of their means in stocks as their, charters authorize them so to invest The latter bank, through its president,' assures me of the willingness' of the bank to receive the bonds of the State if its charter were so amended as to authorize it The latter expresses a preference that the debt remain as it is, but says it compelled to take payment in Confederate currency or the bonds of the State, that the latter will be preferred. ' I made known to the Banks of Wadesboro', the Miners' and Planters' Bank and the Branches of the Bank Of Cape Fear at Salem and Washington, in the early part of the year, my readiness to pay them in Confederate currency or the 6 per cent. ' bonds ot the State, at par, at their option, and re cently repeated the notice. The Bank of Wades boro' postponed, in the first instance, to make any decision, and does not respond to tbe second notice. One of the directors of the Miners' and Planters' Bank has lately assured me that they Would shortly -present the note held by that Bank, and take State bonds, and the two Branches of tlie Bank of Cape Fear, upon a second notice to them some weeks ago,' reply that the subject has been referred to the principal Bank, from which I have received no an- ' swer. All tbe other Banks have accepted the State bonds in satisfaction of the debts due them for, tem porary loans, amounting to $2,665,500 ; the Branch of the Bank of Cape Fear, in this city, filed a pro test, which was communicated to you at the Extra Session in July last. . ; ..

As they all command a considerable pre, mium over Confederate notes, if I were to pay them to such claimants as might prefer them, the whole 1 of them would be exhausted before I could use the Confederate noteH, and the debts of the Sate'Uin-' necessarily increased. This policy will be continued in future unless your Honorable body shall other--- . a a an offwtt to its indebtedness, the Stale holdi,! the bonds of the following Corporations, with which j oho has Axrti&nseu ner ooaus : .- - .

WEDNESDAY, ' DEC. 000. - The 41,500,000 sent to Europe, as collateral .security of cotton debt, in arriving at the real in debtness of the State, should not be considered asa debt, because the State owns cotton, supposed to be. isuffieienttopay.thedebb- . . - In this connection it should also be borne in mind that the Commissioner's of the Sinking Fund hold State stocks to the amount of $1,519,000, and Con federate 7 per cent bonds to the amount of $8.00,-. 000, and, besides the interest accruing oil this Fund, ' .it is being rapidly, increased by dividends from Bailroads. - . . , . '".' I have endeavored to co-operate in every legiti mate way with the Commissioners of the Fund in investing its income. 'The judicious manner in which it has been managed, and -its rapid increase, derived from our large Investments; in works-ol internal improvements, gives the best assurance to the holders our bonds ' that they will be punc- -toally paid at maturity, and constitute one of the chief elements of the. high premium hich oar bonds command in the market . The Commissioners of this Forid will probably report to you more fully during your session. -. ' , . IONATIC ASYLUM. "... v ?' ct tne ret "ssionjof yourijljpnorable body, -the sum of $125,000 was appropriated to the support of the Lunatic Asylum for the years 1863 and 1864, " provided the aggregate amount for such year .shall net exceed the sum of $62,500." Owing to the depreciation of the currency, this Sum proved tcr be insufficient for the support of the Institution. Tbe drafts of the Executive Committee for the fiscal year ending September 80th, 1863, which have been paid, amount to 7ao&7iradheuce the 80th Septem ber, 1863, their drafU have been paid to amount of $45,000, It has happened before, that the Treasu rer has had to tetoitrrresponslbility of orer-pay. ing the appropriation for the support of this Insti tution, and subsequent sessions' of tbe general As sembly have ratified such payments. " At a period when currency and prices are so de ranged, it is impossible tomake estimates with rea sonable approximation taQuraSyJ and it is a bad practice for the TreasurertS pay money not author ized by law. I hope -the General Assembly will either authorize the Executive Committee to draw for suqh sums as they deem necessary, or make such other provisions as they may deem best to avoid the -eviL APPROPRIATION FOB THE SUPPORT OP SOLDUBS PAW ... -LIES. ' This appropriation of $1,000, OOO contemplated the payment of the whole sum at once. In January and February'last there was not enough money in the Treasury to meet other drafts on it, and the on ly means of raising this amount would have been' the sale of State bonds to an amount so large as would have been likely to depreciate their value in market Believing that the object of the appropriation would be as well accomplished by paying this ap propriation in four equal instalments, and that in this way it could be met without recourse to the sale of State bonds, I have adopted this co.urse ; and to save expense and inconvenience to the County Courts, I sent them drafts -quarterly, and notified" them that if they would inform me in what bank it would be most convenient to them to receive the money, 1 would place funds in such bank to meet the drafts. The banks have obligingly co-operated with me in carrying out this plan. These drafts have all been issued,, but many of them have not been presented fox payment The same is. the case as to the warrants of the Comptrol ler in favor of the Chairmen of the Board of Super intendents of Common Schools. It is believed that tbey are withheld in the hope that at some future period payment may be had id better currency. 81TTLEMSNT OF TDK STATE'S CLAIM AGAINST THB ' SOUTHERN CONFEDERACY. Under the authority of the 5ib section of the let providing ways and means for supplying the Treas ury, ratified 20th December, 1862, I appointed P. H. Winston, Esq , of Bertie, to collect the debt due to this State from the Confederate government As soon as the vouchers could be put in order by the State Auditor, he went with them to Richmond and ' entered upon the duty, and has since diligently prosecuted it Much of ij has "oeen passed upon, by the Confederate Auditor, tind die work is now pro gressing, and it is expected that at an early day a considerable part of the amount advanced by the State in payment of her' troops will be paid, and that the whole claim will be passed upon by the auditing officers at an early day. It consists of a vast number of items, sustained by a great many vouchers, not always in the best shape, and neces sarily requires much labor and research. THE PAYMENT OF OUK EIGHT PER CENT. BONDS. Not having succeeded in collecting anv of the foregoing cTaim from the Confederate government, I have not felt authorized to notify the holders of our 8 per cent bonds, of my readniuess to pay them, or to give them 6 per tent bonds, if they should prefer them, in exchange for the 8 per cent, bonds. The salaries of the two clerks in this department are less than they should-be if they were paid in specie. They are the cashiers of the department, and upon their fidelity and skill depends tbe accura cy -of the accounts to be kept in it True economy requires Jthat they should at all times be paid a liber al salary.'? Their present compensation is totally in adequate to their support . - It must be manifest to any one at all acquainted With the duties of this department that it ought to have two contiguous rooms : one for the Treasurer and one for the clerical force. I respectfully submit it whether another assignment of the rooms of the capitol cannot be made to effect this end without detriment or inconvenience to any other department . The office hours of the Treasury, as now pre scribed by law, are from 9 to 12, and from 2 to 5 o'clock. .Nearly all the payments are made by checks, on the banks, which, close at 2 o'clock in the afternoon. Tbe time from 12 till 2, when tbe office - is now closed, is much more important to the pub lic than from 2 till 5 p. m. Thdcleiks should have some time, with closed doors, to make up the cash account, post the books, &c I respectfully submit that it would be more convenient for the public, and that the duties of the office could be better per formed if tbe office were required to be kept open from 9 o'clock a. m. to 2 o'clock p. m., and closed afterwards. ' The act of 1856, chap. 16,. authorizes the hold ers of State bonds to have them registered. Very many avail themselves of its provisions. 1 respect- : fully submit that the assistant clerk of this depart meddought to be allowed asmall fee for this service, , to be paid by the party requiring such registration. ';. " ' " ? ub cuBJtiicr. ; It is manifest that if something efficient be not speedily done vastly to diminish the volume of Con . federate currency, that it will soon cease to Answer the purpose of money. Tne Confederate Congress alone can furnish the remedy, If the disease be capa ble of cure, it seems to me to .be certain that it Will not be found in any plan which savors of repu- diatiorior in voluntary funding. If it be possible to reduce the circulation to a tolerably healthy state, it must be done by taxation ; and if funding consti tute a part of the plan, it should be done at a very low rate Of interest- I recommend taxation to raise the means to meet anv considerable aDDroDriation : you may deem it expedient to make. I deem' tbe ways and means now provided sufficient to meet present appropriations, if the currency shall not grow worse, and if the demands of the military de partments of the State shall not be greater in the future than they have been the past year. Every Sheriff promptly paid the public taxes due pn or before October 1st 1863, amounting to $1,- 808,899 93, excepting the sheriffs of the following .counties, .which are believed to in possession of the enemy, to wit: Beaufort Hyde, Chowa Perqui mans, Washington, Gates, Carteret. Pasquotank, Currituck. Camden. Jones, Craven and TyrrelL - The Sheriffs and tax collectors throughout the State acted with commendable promptitude under your act oL the extra session ,in July last ; and $1,564,100 was received in time, and funded in 7 .per cent, bonus pf the confederate ataies. mYO
