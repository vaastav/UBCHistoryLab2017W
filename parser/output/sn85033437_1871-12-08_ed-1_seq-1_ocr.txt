Speaker iiianie'ii appointments 1 t t OUR WASHINGTON LETTER. The President's Message and how Received The Ilonse Committees and their Im ' portance Miscellaneous Items. ' ' Correspondence KnoxviL'e Chronicle. Washington, D. C., Dec. 4, 1871. The assembling of Concrress to-dav served to draw to the city an immense number of visitors. The galleries of both Houses were filled. . The event of the day was, of course, the l'resident's message. It was read to both Houses from manuscript, and before it was read, it may be said that but a very few knew of its contents. As I said in a pre- vious letter, it was me president's own work. As I telegraphed, it was received with enthusiasm by the President's friends and with evident surprise by his oppo nents; It is so eminently sensible and business like, deals so reasonably, temper ately but sagaciously . with all , questions that it has met with less criticism than any message for years. The President ev idently intended anticipating his enemies. He is so extremely reticent that they were unable to divine nis sentiments. They believed lie would oppose general amnesty, coldly refer to civil service reform and let the Southern Unionists fight their own battles. Upon these points. therefore his opponents have been dwell- incr with peculiar force. Imajrine their chagrin, therefore, when on every one of their positions the President spoke out fearlessly and. pointedly, and stole their thunder. There is but one expression here amongst Republicans, and that is that the messago must satisfy every reasonable man and make the President stronger than ever. . 

HOUSE COMMITTEES. Next ill importance to the the announcement of the House commit- mittees. There has been much discussion concerning - tnese, as - your readers well know. There has, been more interest and anxiety concerning them this session than ever before. The House Is large and legis lation is increasing so fast that more and more ' does; it become necessary for that body to depend upon the Committees. All important work in Congress is done in the committee room. I he su meets lor legis lation are so numerous, the bills introduced so many in numuer, and me puonc ana private applications for aid so fast multi plying that the responsibility of commit tee-men mcreases. It may not be gener ally known to your readers, but it is the fact, that it is utterly impossible for a Con gressman to examine with any kind of care, a fraction even, or the laws proposed and claims of, every kind presented. His dependence, therefore, is upon the laborious and honest examination of all such matters by; the proper committees. The whole held of legislature and appro priation of public monies is therefore di vided into subjects. Thus there are in the House some iorty- seven Lornmittees. Tney cmuraco every subject upon which Congress will be re quired to act. When a bill Is introduced or a claim is presented, it is at once referred to its appropriate committee. Then it is carefully examined, and compared with former laws or similar measures fending. Its weak points are eliminated and its provisions reconciled with the organic law. .- If it is a claim its merits are thor oughly canvassed. .When a committee af ter this examination, reports favorable, me members of the House, as a rule, accept the conclusions as right. ? If the commit tee is divided, or the proposed measure is important, it is discussed in the House. But generally Congressmen depend upon committees to protect them from being imposed upon by frauds, or; rroni voting for an unwise measure. The committees are therefore important bodies. A Con rrroaamon'a InfluonpA nnd useful npss de- pends almost entirely upon his position on the committees.-"i?" r -.n Thus the chairman of the Committee on Wavs and Means is generally regard ed a3 the leader of the House. Now he rather divides his high position with the chairman of tlie Appropriations committee, which being a privileged committee, al ways entitled to the noor and always sure to be heard, as without appropriations of monev 1 the whole machinery of govern ment stops a very honorable position. These two committees are tee most im portant, and" a' position "on either one of them is considered a high honor. Ybii have them before vou and can see how they are constituted. Honorable Horace Maynard stands secorid'on "Ways fetid Means, a very important and honorable post."

Pure water is essential to the thrift of an animal in any condition, and largely so to one feeding on rich and concentrated food, r What farm ers ordinarily term "swill." contains a ffood deal of water, but we should prefer to give tne water Dy leseir, anu lveeii-n-out of the other food except what is desir able to give it consistency. Sour milk or whey is good for fattening nogs to a cer tain extent, but ought not to take the place of water as a sole drink. I - il. A . -v A r T OlKl 11 1 I I! I 11 I ia . I TL Spreading Manure in the Fall. A neighbor was Querying what he had better do with his barnyard manure, of which he had a large quantity. It was piled in the yard last summer, and he wished to apply it to a held intended lor corn next vear. "Was it best to let it re main in large piles till next spring or draw it on to the fields this fall and distribute it in small heaps to be spread just before ploughing, or draw and spread it evenly this tail ? We should draw it to me neia. "We should draw It to the field now while the ground is hard, and time is not as.val uabie as it may be next spring r then we should spread it evenly, provided the sur face is not so steep as to be subiect to wash ing by the winter and spring floods.. If it is we should prefer leaving' it in small piles to be spread as soon as the frost is out next spring. We have lound lrom experi ence that much greater benefit is derived from manure if it be applied to the sod in the fall than if it be put on only just pre vious to ploughing in the spring. There is no loss by evaporation or fermentation, and the only thing to be guarded agaist is washing, especially during a sudden thaw, which moves a great deal of water over frozen ground, and this, even, is not as large as many suppose. The advantage gained by fall' manuring comes from the abstraction' of the strength of the manure by the rains aud melting snows, and the deposition of it in the sod or sur face of the soil. It is" then ready for tbe plant to use immediately, which thus gains a vigorous growth early in the season. It would be a good plan to harrow the field after the manure is spread, as this assists to distribute it evenly aud brings it closer to the surface. American iCuraL Home. Mrs. Lincoln'.'
