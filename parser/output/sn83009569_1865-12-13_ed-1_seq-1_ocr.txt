It makes four different Stitches with the same ease, and with as littlo machinery as others make one. Besides, it has the reversible feed motion—a uniform self-regulating tension of thread and no springs, cog-wheels, or cams to get out of order. WE CLAIM FOR THE FLORENCE THE FOLLOWING ADVANTAGES Over Any and All Seicing Machines. It makes four different stitches, the lock. Knot, Double Lock and Double Knot, on one and the same machine. Each stich being alike on both sides ol the fabric. It has the reversible feed motion, which enables the operator, by simply turning a thumb-screw, to have the work run either to the right or left, to stay any part of (he same, or fasten the ends of the seams, without turning tho fabric. Changing the length of the stitch, and from one kind of stitch to another, can readily be done while the Machine is in motion. Every stich is perfect in itself, making the scam secure and uniform. It is almost noiseless, and can be used where quiet s necessary. Its motions are all positive.- there are no springs to get out of order, and its simplicity enables the most inexperienced to operate it. I It will not oil the dress of the operator, as all the machinery is on the top of the table. It is the most rapid sewer in the world, making 1 five stitches to each revolution. Its stich is the wonder of all, because of its com- j bined elasticity, strength and beauty. It does the heaviest or finest work with equal fa- i cility, without change of tension or machinery. ' Every machine has one of Jenclc's Patent Hem- j mers attached, (the right to use which we control.) enabling tho operator to turn any width of hem de sired. ; There is no other Machine which will do so large a ! range of work as tho "Florence." 1 It docs not require finer thread on the under side than it does on the upper. I The needle is more easily adjusted than in any ' other Machine. I It will sew across the heaviest seams, or from one ( to more thicknesses of cloth, without change of ten sion or breaking of thread. I It is fully protected and licensed by Elias Howe, 1 Jr., and his associates, and our own letters patent. J To avoid the strain on the eyes, bent posture, close application, and fatiguing care, heretofore necessary on a large proportion of work done on sewing ma- ; chines, we now furnish each Machine with "Barnuin's i Self-Sewer," which guides tho work itself, and is of 1 incalculable value, especially to inexperienced ope- J rators. While possessing the above, and many other ad- , vantages, the Florence is sold at corresponding prices \ with other first-class machines. I THE FLORENCE COMPANY LOCK-STITCH MACHINES. The only Machine having the Reversible feed- , movement, was awarded the highest premium, gold medal, at the late exhibition of the American In stitute. COPY OP REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON SEWING MA CHINES : Tho Florence Sewing Machine Company, 505 j Broadway, for the best Family Sewing Machine. Reasons: 1. Its simplicity and great range of work. 2.

Pamphlet fmiiMftwtf wlWAWtai NEWS OF THE DAY. t'OSGHF.SS, The proceedings in Congress yesterday were quite interesting, and from the manner in which matters were handled evidence is afforded that work is meant. In the House.Mr. Raymond, of New York, rose to a question of privilege and presented the cre dentials of Congressmen elected from Tennessee, and certified by Governor Brownlow, moving their refer ence to tho special committee of fifteen authorized by Mr. Slovens' resolution. Mr. Stevens raised a point of order which was over ruled by the Speaker, and the credentials were re ceived by the House and read. Considerable debate ensued, the Democratic side of the House claiming that tho representatives had been elected in a consti tutional manner, and that their credentials should take the regular course, and be referred to the Com mittee on Elections. Mr. Raymond said there were circumstances which rendered it proper that the claims of the members from Tennessee should receive early consideration from the House. The conduct of that State during the rebellion, and her attitude toward the Govern ment at present, entitled her, in his opinion, to this consideration. Several propositions were made by other members, but the resolution was finally agreed to —136 yeas, 41 nays. Mr. Eldridge, of Wisconsin, offered a resolution, declaring, in substance, that no obstacle should be raised to prevent the States lately iu rebellion from being legally represented in Congress. The call for the previous question was lost by yeas 35, nays 108. — Finally, Mr. Stevens, of Pennsylvania, offered a reso lution inviting the Tennessee delegation, as private individuals, to the floor of the House, which was adapted. After a spirited discussion in the Senate between Mr. Anthony, of Rhode Island, Donlittle, of Wis consin, and Fesscndcn, of Maine, the House resolu tion that a coinmitteee of fifteen—nine from the House and six from the Senate—be appointed to in quire into the condition of the late so-called Confede rate States, and report whether they, or any of them, are entitled to be represented in either House of Congress, with leave to report by bill or otherwise, was adopted by a vote of 33 to 12. Mr. Crcsswell, of Maryland, voting in the affirmative, and Mr. John son in the negative. FKO.II EUROPE. The steamship Teutonia, from Southampton, with one or two days' later advices, has been signalled, but up to the hour of going to press this morning her news had not eomc to hand. From our foreign files by the steamship Asia, we learn that the action of the Spanish Government in Chili lias met witli condemnation even in Spain it self. Tho Epoca of Madrid condemns the action of the government, and strongly urges the necessity of conciliating rather than offending the re-United States of America. All the indications are that Spain, as already reported, has suspended fourther action against the Chilian republic. Tho escape of Stephens, the supposed Fenian Head Centre of Ireland, proves to havo been a more mys terious affair than was at first supposed, and it will be seen by the letter of our Dublin correspondent that important results are expected from this event. A notable article had appeared in the Paris Debate condemning tho French aggression in Mexico, and putting the argumentnm adhomincm in rather a forci ble light. GENERAL NEWS. For the week ending the 19th inst., there will be 148 patents issued from the Patent Office. Thirty-five acres of land, in Catonsville, Baltimore county, were sold yesterday fur $14,000, to Mr. A. Gould. Jr. Official information of the ratification by North Carolina of the Constitutional amendment has been received in Washington. Intelligence at the State Department indi catcs that the British Government is likely to recede from the position taken on the indemnity question. The one-armed guerilla. Berrv, captured on Saturday at Louisville, near Bloomfiold, Ivy., was hanged yesterday. Official advices were received in Washing ton yesterday, from Mexico, favorable to tho Liberal cause. The Imperial troops aro constantly falling back toward the city. Mayor Lincoln, of Boston, was re-elected, yesterday, by 2,000 majority. On the same day James B. Blacken was chosen Mayor of Worcester by nearly the same majority. Both gentlemen are Republicans. Col. Horace Capron, of the 14th Illinois cavalry (formerly of Maryland), has been brevettcd Brigadier General by the President, for gallant and meritorious conduct during the war. An order to muster out all officers of the Veteran Reserves is being prepared. A bill is also being prepared in Congress to make this corps part of ! the regular army. Mr. Murdoch, the distinguished tragedian, ( is recovering from his sudden attack of illness, but , may not bo out for some days yet. He is stopping at , the residence of Mr. Philp, in Washington, where he , is receiving the kindest attention. t The Nashville Banner contains an account of a party of guerillas committing depredations upon the residents of Lavcrgne, Tennessee. They held tho town for an hour, but were finally dispersed by the military. An effort in the Virginia Legislature to in- j validate the election of Messrs. Underwood and Segar as Senators of the United States from that State, seems to have failed, the resolution question ing tho legality of the offices being laid on tho table. The Petersburgh Index thinks that before 1 the Virginia Legislature exerts itself to get R. M. T. Hunter pardoned, the State should give "the full ' weight of her united, and, ifncccssary, cxciusivcclaim for the extension of that privilege to her most illus trious living son, Robert E. Lec." ] The Rev. Dr. Van Bokkelin is about re- t turning to St. Timothy's Church, Catonsville, of which he was tho founder and rector for more than 1 twenty years, and has resigned the rectorship of St. 1 Stephens' Church of this city, which he has held for some time past. ( The English press continue to denounce the severity practiced in the suppression of the Ja- • maira revolt. When the Asia sailed only four hun dred negroes were known in England to have been executed. Later advices received in New York j make the number fully three thousand. It is now considered settled that 53,000,000 will soon be raised for a railroad from the Western 1 Maryland Railroad via Hagerstown to Cumberland, thereby opening up another outlet from the Mary- 1 land coal region to Baltimore. It is said that this i road is of great stragctic significance. Everything on the stock list was dull yes terday, excepting Governments. Gold sold at 144% i @141)4 for small lots: large lots at 145, closing at 145. ( A small lot of silver commanded a premium of 40 cts. The transactions in Governments reached $76,000, the ' whole list showing an improvement of % to %. A Richmond paper says that some of thA i leading capitalists of the North, arc visiting Rich mond, and seeing the condition of affairs in Virginia, have begun the formation of "Loan Associations," i with sufficient capital to make liberal loans. The Richmond Republic says that the Uni ted States Commissary Department in that city has i issued to destitute citizens, since the 12th of last June, 520,400 rations, and is now issuing 11,000 rations per week. After the 15th inst., the issue is to be discon tinued. A prize fight for a purse of two hundred and 1 fifty dollars took place on Monday at St. Ronan's ! Well, near Flushing, Long Island, between Young Siddons of the Eastern District of Brooklyn, and Barry, the Kid, of New York, in which, after twenty fivo rounds, the former was declared the victor, j About one hundred and fifty individuals of thesport- , ing fraternity witnessed the contest. Dr. L. Gibbons, lately Assistant Supervising i Special Agent of the Treasury Department at Mobile, with Mr. Dexter, committed suic ide in that city on last Sunday morning, by cutting his throat with a razor. Ilis friends immediately summoned surgeons, but to no purpose; he died iu less than two hours. — His remains were to be sent to Boston, his former 1 place of residence, for interment. A leading Congressman from New England, says a Washington special, had an interview with the President on Saturday, when the latter expressed his belief that Congress and the Executive could har monize on a plan of reconstruction. The President, however, expressed his fears that, under the lead of Mr. Stevens, the House would take a position which it could not hold. A despatch was received yesterday morning at the office of the Provost Marshal at Washington, stating that Capt. Walbridge had reached Charleston with Duncan, who was commissary sergeant at An dersonville. Duncan was accused of complicity with Capt. Wirt. The captain turned Duncan over to the authorities at Richmond. R. B. Winder was turned over to the military authorities of Richmond. Va.; and Gee was turned over likewise to similar authori ties at Raleigh, N. C. The Tribune's Washington special corres pondent of yesterday says a good many of the South ern aspirants to seats in Congress have left. The Tennesseeans still hold out. The Virginians were to meet in caucua on Monday at the Ebhit House, to consider the question whether it would be more profitable for them to go or stay: but. for some rea son, they did not get together. They are not likely, however, to bear up much longer against high prices in the hotels, and hopes of admission indefinitely deferred. From the report of James Pollock, Director of the United States Mint, Philadelphia, we learn that the deposits and coinage of the fiscal year just closed, exhibit a very satisfactory increase over those of the previous year, and everything thus far indi cates that the present year will be largely in excess of the past. The amount of bullion, in value, re ceived at the Mint and branches, during the fiscal year, was as follows Gold, $31,065,349.74; silver, $1,183,405.23; total deposits. $32,248,754.97. From the profits of the bronze and nickel coinage the Mint has transferred to the Treasury of the United States du ring the fiscal year $400,000, and a few weeks after the expiration of the year the further sum of 

SIOO,OOO was in like manner transferred, the fund remaining being sufficient for all the purposes of the coinage. It is suggested that from this nickel alloy a five-cent coin eould easily be made, and which would be a popular lubititut! for tto fIT not Bote, WEST TEUERIPH KK i TO THE I DAILY COMMERCIAL.

Hon. Alexander 11. Stephens peremptorily declines the candidacy for the U. S. Senate. C. J. Jenkins, recently elected Govcrnorof Georgia, sent a communication to the Legislature on the Bth, declining inauguration at present, and appointing the loth of January for that purpose. The Savannah lfcrald contains Provisional Gov ernor Johnson's message to the Legislature, in which he entreats them to bring forward their prejudices and animosities, and offer them us a sacrifice on tho altar of our common country—that we may once again present the happy spectacle of "brethren dwel ling together in unity." The House of Representatives have instructed the Judiciary Committee to report a bill securing to per sons of color the rights of property, the right to sue and be sued, and to testify in court, A resolution was introduced in the Legislature ap pointing commissioners to visit Washington to ascer tain what steps are necessary for Georgia to secure a State organization and to the people their rights and privileges as citizens of the United States.

MILLF.DORVILLE, Ga., Dec. 11.—The Senate have passed a bill regulating contracts betweon master and servant. If for over one month, it must be in writ ing; work hours to be from sunrise to sunset and ser vants to be responsible for damaging the masters' property; wages forfeited by leaving before expira tion of contract. The employer may discharge for disobedienoe, drunkenness, immorality, want of respect or for leaving service; enticing servants away. Misde meanors to be punishable with a line of §4OO or im prisonment for four months. The House refused to consider the resolution fixing a day for tho election of United States Senators by a vote of 90 to 56.

Railroad ArrlilentH-Kuggagc Far Rum* od, Ac. SUNRURY, Dec. 11. —An accident occurred yester day morning, about four o'clock, ten miles west of this place, to the express train on the Philadelphia and Fric Railroad, which left Eric on Saturday af ternoon. By some accident, as yet unexplained, the baggage car caught fire and was totally consumed, together with all the baggage of the passengers. The train was stopped and the locomotive and other cars separated from the one which was on fire, and in this way no damage was sustained by the passengers, nor were the other cars injured. The amount of loss is unknown. The mail train going west on the same road, on Saturday, came in collision with a freight train, near Williamsport.

The London Times has the following account of the escape of Stephens; "The Head Centre of all the Fenians of Ireland, Mr. James Stephens, alias Power, who was appre hended only a fortnight ago. has just escaped from Richmond prison, probably by the connivance of some of the prison officials. As the government has offered £l,OllO for his recapture and £3OO more for in formation, he will probably be soon again in custody; but the event is likely to cost suspicion on the fidelity of an important body of men, and to increase the caution with which the Irish government deals with these troublesome conspirators. Stephens, who has been raised by the Fenian authorities, or has raised himself, to the office and diraity of chief of the Re publican plotters, was, we believe, originally con nected witb Mr. Smith O'Brien, and learnt treason in the school of the rebels of 1848. He has, however, only emerged into history since the scheme formakinglreland independent by Amer ioan aid has been formed on the other side of the ocean. As a man endowed with more than the usual Fenian education, be took the lead, and attained at once the high position which, unless he succeeds in making his escape from Ireland altogether, is likely to give him an unpleasant pre-eminence in punish ment, But for the present he seems to have baffled justice. While the lawyers of the Queen's Bench were discusing the question of a certiorari at a length which encumbers our columns, Mr. James Stephens moved a more effective certiorari himself, and postponed his trial before the Special Conumwian by the Simple ; expedient of brnnns prison. , 

WEDNESDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 13, 1865. I The Resources of the North. The array of figures presented in the report of the Secretary of War must certainly, if nothing else has. convince the lato insurgents of their utter folly in making war upon the North, and dissuade them from ever again essaying rebellion and a separate confederacy. When the war ended Secretary Stan ton informed us wc had between six and seven hun dred thousand troops in the field, not to mention four hundred thousand more who were in the service, though not in the field: while the insurgent annics which surrendered numbered, all told, one hundred and seventy-four thousand. In other words, after the war had continued four years, the North was enabled,' without any seeming difficulty, to send four men into battle to "every ono which the South could muster only with the most herculean exertions. While the former continued to swarm with able-bodied men, polling a larger Presi dential vote in 1564 than in 1860, the latter was com pletely stripped of all her arms-bearing population. Unable, each one of them, to whip four Yankees, the overthrow of the Southerners was, and would be, in another such contest, only a question of time. The Secretary's report likewise shows that our re sources in material were in keeping with our resources in men. When the struggle closed, our Government granaries were full to overflowing, and there was suf ficient war material on hand to prolong tho contest, Mr. Stanton says, fully three years. Whatever any dissatisfied portions of the country may hereafter attempt to do, it is very evident that they will never make war upon tho General Govern ment. —A.)■ Commercial, Encounter with Smugglers. Tho Commissioner of Customs has received infor mation that recently two detective officers of the custom-house had an encounter with smugglers on the Canadian frontier. The facts are these:—On re connoitering the beach of the lake some distance above the light-house, Captains Morgan and Shep pard discovered a man. woman, and boy, who were evidently picketing some smuggling expedition.— They proceeded to capture these parties, and remove them quietly to a safe place more remote, where one of the parties stood guard while the other watched the beach. They soon discovered two boats ap proaching the shore cautiously, and as no signal of danger warned them off, they proceeded to land. It turned out that the boats had two men in each, three of whom were well armed with loaded muskets. At a signal the one standing guard over the cap tured picket joined his comrade, and they proceeded to take possession of the party and their boats. After a short resistance three of the men, two with mus kets, were arrested, the others escaping. The boats wore found to contain six half-barrels and one ten gallon keg of whisky. While Captain Morgan was proceeding with the men to the watch-house, several parties interfered with him, and the men were en abled to make their escape. The two muskets cap tured wore well loaded and percussioned, ready for action. One is of English and the other of Russian manufacture. One of the boats is nearly new, and both arc in lino condition. A Curious B|iretiU'lc in a Prolcslant 4'llU roll. [From the Liverpool Times.] On Sunday, the 19th, an unusual ceremony was witnessed at St. Lawrence's Church, Norwich. A cope had been purchased by a Cambridge undergrad uate, and at his wish it was presented and duly dedi cated to God's service, in 'a particularly impressive manner. The usual procession of choir and priest entered the church for even-song headed by the cru cifix. At the rear, immediately Before the thurifcrs, the cope was carried by the deputed person who acted for the thurifers. At the bottom step of tho saera rium the cope was presented to him with these words: 'Reverened father, in the name and on behalf of tho donor, I present this cope for use by the priest in this c''ureh of St. Lawrence on all occasions." The priest received it with these words: "We re ceive this cope to the glory of God and for the use of this Church of St. Lawrence, in the name of the l'atlier, and of the Son, and of the lloly Ghost. Amen." The priest then duly presented it on the altar, and incensed it; after which suitable vehi cles, responses, and a prayer were used. Then the priest was invested in the cope, and remained so till alter the "Magnificat." The cope is of rich gold and white brocatclle, with crimson and orphreys and hood. An unusually large congregation was present on this occasion. tetter from Gen. ■icaiireciii'il. Gen. Beauregard has written the followiug letter to V Eeo d. Italia : NEW

BEAUREGARD, Are Green Carpels Injurious to Ilonltli? The fears entertained by some persons that the use of carpets with green tints is injurious to health, may be dismissed when they know the results of chemical examination. The green used in the manufacture of carpets is not the poisonous color respecting which so much has been said and published. The carpet green is dyed with fustic and tho sulphate of indigo, neither of which are injurious to health or life. The poisonous green is only applied to paper and some cotton fabrics; never to silk or woollen fabrics. The poisonous green (Schule's French green) consists of arsenious acid and the sulphate of copper oxidized, and is used as a paint and a dye for vegetable fabrics. Chemists have not yet learned how to appiy it to wool or silk, anil it is too expensive to be so applied. The dust of all woolen carpets, however, is unfavor able to health.

EFFORT TO REMOVE THE MINT.— It is said that another effort will be made in Congress this session to have the Mint removed from this city to New York. The machinery for accomplishing that pur pose is already in operation, quietly but vigorously; and as influences which have heretofore been in op position to the scheme are understood to have been won over, the chances of its success now are mate rially increased. The project is backed up by a pow erful monetary interest —an interest which every day's experience admonishes us is not to be dispised any more at Washington than anywhere else.— Ph ila. Ev.

There is another chapter to the story. After that time, during the winter she made shoemaking a kind of secondary business till about the 15th of April, when she commenced on a six months' contract, with noth ing to hinder but her ordinary household work; and I find, by examining the books of her employers, that with the help of her boy to do the pegging she has earned in six months in bottoming thick half-double soled boots, three hundred and forty-six dollars ($346.)

BILLS FROM TITF. HOUSE. The Chair laid before the Senate several bills from the House, which were respectively referred to their appropriate committees. The Chair also laid before the Senate the House bill regulating certain courts in tho District of Co lumbia. Pending the discussion on the reference of this bill, the Senate, at 2.45 P. M„ adjourned. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.— The House was called to order at the usual hour, with Speaker Col fax in the Chair. Prayer by the Chaplain, Rev. C. B. Boynton. The Speaker laid before the House several commu nications and petitions, which were referred to the respective committees. BOUNTIES TO SOLDIERS. Mr. Wilson, of lowa, offered a resolution that the Committee on Military Affairs be instructed to en quire into the expediency of requiring by law the payment of such bounties to United States soldiers who served in the late war during the years 1861 and 1862, equal to those received by volunteers in 1864 Agreed to. THE TENNESSEE REPRESENTATIVES. Mr. Raymond, of New York, moved to suspend the rules of the House in order to present the credentials of members from Tennessee, certified and signed by the Governor of that State, certifying that certain persons therein named were duly elected representa tives under the laws of the United States. SdMr. Stevens held it was not a privileged question. That as the Representatives from Tennessee had been refused admittance to seats in this House, no action could be taken upon their credentials. The speaker decided it to be a privileged question. Mr. Raymond said he proposed simply to bring these papers before the House, subject to any action or reference that this House thought best. In his judgment many considerations ought to be listened to in order that the question of her representation should be had 111 this Congress, lie moved the reference of the credentials to a Select Committee of hlteen. Mr. Bingham, of Ohio, hoped tho gentleman would withdraw his motion and that the matter would be referred to the Committee 011 Elections, with in structions to inquire whether the State of Tennessee has organized a Constitutional State Government, republican in its form, to conform with the require ments of the Constitution of the United States. Mr. Finck, of Ohio, hoped that all previous motions would be withdrawn and that the claimants for seats present their credentials and be sworn in. Mr. Bingham asked the gentleman from New York (Mr. Raymond) to withdraw his resolution referring tho credentials to a select committee, and that it go to tho Committee on Elections. Mr. Raymond declined to have its reference made to Committee on Elections. Mr. Rittcr, of Kentucky, said that as there was no objection to the legitimacy of the credentials, it was a plain proposition whether the gentleman, Mr. Jlay nnrd, who has been a member of this House, shall be entitled, with his colleagues, to seats upon this floor. They had received a certified legal election in Ten nessee, had been regularly elected by the people, and at present there were no contestants for their seats.— He thought the question of admitting or rejecting them ought to be finally settled to-day. Mr. Raymond had no particular objection to its reference to any committee, but thought it proper, in due respect to the opinion of others, to refer them to a select committee to insure speedy action. Mr. Smith, of Ky., thought the proper reference would be to the Committee on Elections. 11c eulo gized the position taken by Mr. Maynard in suppres sion of the lato rebellion, and the loyalty maintained by the Tennessee people in thoir advocacy of the prineiples'of the government, and their concurrence in all of the Constitutional amendments, as acts which made it the imperative duty of Congress to admit the.delcgation or representatives. The House refused to refer the credentials to the Committee on Elections by a vote of 110 ayes to 40 nays; but referred, by a vote of 126 to 41, to a Select Committee of 15. Mr. Stevens introduced a resolution that Mr. Mavnard and his colleagues be invited to occupy scats in tho House, pending the examination of their claims. Mr. Brooks, of New York, said he would object to the resolution unless it was so amended as to include the names of all the Southern representatives. Mr. Stevens refused to amend hiß resolution, and it went over according to tho rules. NO 

AUTHORITY FOR SECESSION. Mr. Etheridge, of Wisconsin, submitted the follow ing resolution: Resolved, That there is no warrant or authority in the Constitution of the United States for any State or States to secede, and that all resolves or ordinan ces to that end or for that purpose, are absolutely null and void, and that the war naving defeated the attempt to thus divide and break up the Union, it is of vital importance to the Republic and to ail the States thereof, that the States recently in revolt and each and every one of them should resume their ap propriate and Constitutional position and functions in the Union without delay, and to this end lay ing aside ail party feeling and all personal or other animosity, waiving all minor differences, and seeking earnestly to maintain and preserve the Union of our fathers, we will cordially sustain [and support the President in any audi all Constitutional efforts and policyof restoration, believing that there by the political, commercial, financial and general prosperity of the whole country will be most sub stantially and permanently subserved. Debate springing up the resolution went over. 

TENNESSEE REPRESENTATIVES AGAIN. Mr. Sloan, of Wisoonsin, introduced the following resolution, which, on motion, was laid upon tho table. Ayes 90, nays 65. Whereas, N. G. Taylor, Horace Maynard, N. B. Stokes, E. Cooper, W. B. Campbell, S. M. Arnold, J. R. Hawkins and J. W. Leftwicn, having maintained their allegiance to the United States throughout the late rebellion, some of them bearing arms in the United States Bervioe, appear to have been elected by the people of Tennessee to represent certain Congres sional districts thereof, and are now present with their credentials claiming seats as members of this House, therefore Resolved, That said claimants be allowed the privi lege of the floor of the House pending their claims to seats. Mr. Cobb, of Wisconsin, submitted the following resolution: Resolved, That until otherwise ordered, Messrs. N. G. Taylor, Horace Maynard, N. B. Stokes, E. Cooper, S. M. Arnold, J. R. Hawkins, and J. W. Liftnich, be invited to occupy seats in the hall of the House of Representatives. Mr. Wilson, of lowa, moved that the resolution be laid upon the table, and the question being put it was decided in the negative—yeas 41, nays 124. The question then recurring on the demand for the previous question, it was seconded and put, and de cided in the affirmative—yeas 133, nays 35.

NEW YORK, Dec. 12. 1865. The "Fair Fenian Fight for Freedom," (which may be seen in all its alliterative absurdity any evening at A\ ood Minstrels.) seetns fast degenerating into a Kilkenny squabble over the spoils. When the Fenian Brotherhood were few in number and their incomo could be counted by a very modest number of hun dreds, the members were secret and honest; but now that the Society has increased to mammoth dimen sions, and the "root of all evil" fills its coffers to overflowing, the Demon of Strife appears to have en tered its councils, and to be proving a far more for midable foe than British policemen. It would seem 1 'Lit a portion of tho Fenian Senate to the number often) has been in session in this city during tho past week over the misdeeds of the President, John O'Mahoney (the founder of the organization), and B. D. Ivillian, tho Sccretrry of the Treasury, which cul minated, on Saturday, in their impeachment and the election of a new President. A national Con gress has been vailed to meet on the 2d proximo, when the entire subject will submitted to its action. Meantime, the F. B. is divided into O'Mahoney and anti-O'Mahoney factions—the former being in tho majority in this section; and altogether, it is "a very pretty quarrel as it stands." In addition to the charges against the President and the Secretary of tho Treasury, it is alleged that an Irish editor of this city, who was sent on a mission to Ireland with a draft for £SOO, and important dispatches in his pos session, was, on his arrival there, induced to lose the latter by the persuasive power of British gold. In this state of affairs the further existence of the Fenian organization depends simply on the problem whether oither .Senate or President can command a sufficient majority in the approaching Congress to crush the other. Should the two factions, however, prove equally matched in strength or nearly so. the Brotherhood would be irretrievably rent asunder, and the very slender hope of freedom for the Irish' through the efforts of their countrymen on this side tho water, go out in utter darkness. The single pain ful reflection connected with this subject is that many hard-working and deserving persons must have part ed with money they could ill spare, to minister to the ambition and love of display of a few. If we mistake not. the Fenian Brotherhood will hereafter be re membered by its many victims as a veritable South Sea delusion. There is but little novelty iu the literary world at present. Publishers are issuing handsomely illustra ted editions of standard authors, and will not enter upon new enterprises until after Christmas; mean while, several of our popular authors are at work on books, which will be ready for the spring trade.— Among them may be mentioned Bayard Taylor, who has a novel about half completed. He has deserted his rural home in Pennsylvania and taken rooms in town for the winter. Our talented poet. T. Baily Aldrich, recently led to the alter a Miss Lillie Wood man, the Rev. Dr. Bellows, officiating. A new edi tion of Mr. A.'s poems has rccentlv been issued, and his merits generously acknowledged by the critics. Mrs. Stoddart's 7'iro Men has also been well spoken of—better, in fact, wc think, than it deserved. Even The Bound Table took- it up tenderly, but that is probably owing to the fact that the husband of the author, Richard Stoddart, is one of the fiercest re viewers on that journal, and the "velvet paw" treat ment of his wife's ambitiously bad book was doubt less adopted in deference to his feelings. Your readers will understand that wemake no assertions, but sim ply suggest that when Tie Ihmnd Table glosses over the defects of a book so peculiarly open to criticism as Two Men, there is: probably a reason for it. Mrs. S. is undoubtedly the possessor of talent of no mean order, but it lies not in the direction in which she seem? to suppose. The descriptions of nature in Two Men are the gents of the book, and the regret of the reader is that there are as few of them—the author wasting her strength in a vain attempt to throw the halo of romance over impossible charac ters and a very ordinary caseof seduction. If some ono could succeed in convincing Mrs. Stoddart that she is not a second Charlotte Bronte, and that her intellect is incapable of creating an American Jane Eyre, they would do both that lady and the public a real kindness. Our city is in the full tide of the "season," although balls and parties have scarcely yet been inaugurated. As the Opera leaves us this week there will be abun dant opportunity for holiday preparations. The high life, appear noF?o d af'recV, v 1V e iUsl igU t Js^, e 'ii n, - d ' [ i best or any other society. Although everything is "dear," every thing is bought, and not by tho affluent only, but by John Noakes, whose wife spends on each .Saturday iilgtit nearly aa much rn-. ho husband ful merly earned in a fortnight. When this is to end is not easy to predict, but that a change appreachcth all the portents foretell. It is to be hoped, however, that tho contraction of the currency anil the return to specie payments will be so gradual as to be prac tically imperceptible, and that thousands of our mer chants may not bo ruineil and the industry of the country paralizcd by a wide-spread pecuniary con vulsion. The problem to be solved is whether even our able Secretary of the Treasury will ho potent to control the forces his predecessors and the inarch of events have set in motion; and wlicther lto can pur sue such a policy as shall ensure a gradual and safe return to a nominal financial condition. Should any of yourrcadersbcinthecity on Thursday evening next, they should not, if at all musically or charitably inclined, tail to attend thememorial concert forthebenefit of the widow and orpliansoftho late Vin cent Wallace, at the Academy of Music. Mr. Wallace, although a foreigner, lived long enough among us to claim the amenities, ifnot therights, of citizenship, and his untiring industry while here in addingto our stock of good piano-forte music deserves the gratitude of all lovers of the divine art. which can be manifested by uniting in the present effort to place his family beyond the reach of want. Contributions from those who cannot personally be present at the concert may he sent to Mr. Ilenry C. W atson, one of the commit tee having the matter in charge, at the office of tho Tribune. The weather here continues unusually mild for tho season, and, with coal at present prices, it must bo considered a providential blessing of no trifling mag nitude. Should the entire winter prove of this char acter, as the wise in such matters predict, the differ ence in the consumption of fuel and the less amount of suffering among the poor, will be cause for devout thanksgiving to the christian philanthropist. You may well congratulate yourself and your readers that the very Strong divorce case —which, with its disgusting details, is duly paraded in our journals—did not occur in your city. Seduction, and, in fact lewd crime in various phases, are spread,before the public, aud the ac-ounts doubtless read by per sons who would feel indignant if accused of perusing tho viler class of French novels. But few French novels can, however, equal it in obscenity, while the fact that the parties implicated arc well-known residents and the Statements strictly true give it a zest that the most licentious factions seek in vain I" imitate. Wlicther a respectable journal is justified in such publications is a question I do not cure at present to enter upon; but, in its discussion, it should be re membered that our daily press are first of all nctr papers, and thus compelled from their character to bo accurato "maps of busy life." In the street-car collision case mentioned in my last, the coroner's jury brought in a verdict censuring the two drivers and the conductor of the passenger car. and they were held to await tho action of the grand jury. So far so good, but wc havo faint hopes that an indictment and a criminal prosecution will follow. Mean time, street accidents arc multiplying with frightful rapidity. On Saturday evening, Mr. Ilas sam 0. Lovell, a merchant, who had been dining at Delmonico's down-town restaurant, while attempting to cross Broadway, near Rcade street, was knocked down by the pole of a stage driven at a furious pace, and almost instantly killed, his head being crushed by the wheels. A frieud of mine, who followed the unfortunate gentleman nut of the restaurant, saw the murder, and assures mo of the details. The coro ner's jury brought in a verdiet of accidental death! I believe I only casually referred last week to the accession of Thurlow Weed, to the ranks of our Me tropolitan journalists asco-editorwith Mr.Raymond, of the Times. Mr. Weed seems destined to become another example of the force of routine, and the ne cessity that spurs on so many of our workers to labor when all pleasure, save that negative one of compul sory occupation, must have ceased, until, exhausted nature refuses to further exercise her functions and the slave of habit falls dead at his post. The King of the Lobby has surely attained both that age and competency which aregenerally held a sufficient war rant for escaping from the iron yoke of business life, to spend the last years of existence in well-earned re tirement. For no inconsiderable part of a century has Thurlow Weed labored at the political oar. and, from the humblest beginnings, risen to be a power in his State and party. An immense influence has been his to wield, and after so many years of intense thought, successful scheming and restless personal activity, his busy brain seems to disdain repose as much to-day as when the fortunes of its possessor were still unmade. The present announcement of his connection with the Times is only the public notification of a long accomplished fact. The copartnership between Messrs. Weed and Raymond is. in reality, an affair of months, and our State politics have already given evidence of its existence. Indeed, we consider that Mr. Raymond has already proved himself an apt disciple of his astute preceptor, and the Veteran cannot but be gratified at the progress of so promis ing a pupil. 

GLAUCUS. DARING AND EXTENSIVE BURGLARY—FROM SIX TO TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH OF JEWELRY STO LEN.—One of the most daring and successful robbe ries which has taken place in our city for several years occurred on Saturday night last, when the manufacturing jewelry establishment of Messrs. Baldwin A Co., on Franklin street, was entered by burglars, the safe forced open, and from six to ten thousand dollars, in gold, silver, and precious stones, carried away. Having gained access to the store, the burglars at once commenced operations upon the safe, and succeeded in taking it entirely apart, with out using powder, ami made good their escape with their plunder, including a great variety of articles used in the business, together with a large amount of finished jewelry, necklaces, bracelets, Ac. Some of the jewelry had been ordered for England. A quan tity of refined gold and silver was stolen, with sev eral watches.— Newark IN. J.) Advertiser, Wtli. NEW STAMPED ENVELOPES.— Tho postal laws for bid, under heavy penalties, the carrying of letters outside the mails, unless enclosed in Government stamped envelopes of a denomination sufficient to cover the amount of postage chargeable thereon.— Heretofore parties desirous of sending valuable and other letters by express have found some difficulty in complying with the law, as the envelopes supplied by the Postoffice were often insufficient in value to cover the postage, and the addition of the adhesive stamps, to supply the deficiency, was not recognized as fulfilling the requirements of the statute. In order to remedy this difficulty, the department has now issued envelopes of the denominations of nine twelve, eighteen, twenty-four, thirty and forty cents, which, with those already issued, will meet, it is thought, all the wants of the public. DISEASE.— Several fine fattening hogs have died in town during the last week, from the present hog epidemic. In several instances entire broods of shoats and pigs have been carried off.

On that day he will preach a farewell sermon to the con gregation of St. Stephen's Church, on Ilanovcr street, near Barre. After the resignation of Dr. Van Bok kelin was made known to the congregation of St. Stephen's Church, the vestry held a meeting, and passed a series of resolutions expressive of their sin cere regret on account of his severance from 3aid church as rector, but acknowledging that he did but obey his calling in resuming the charge of theehurch, of which lie was the founder, and so many years the pastor. The vestry also acknowledged their obliga-' tions to the Rev. Doctor for his faithful, zealous and efficient labors, made more so on account of his hav ing labored gratuitously, thus enabling the church during his administration, to pay off about $2,000 of her debt, concluding with the assurance that their prayers would follow him. Rev. Br. Dalryinplc has been elected by the vestry of St. Stephen's Church to fill the vacancy occasioned by the resignation of Dr. Van Bokkelin, who will be gin his ministerial labors on the Ist of January. 1866. The newly elected rector has been for several years connected with the University of Maryland, School of Arts, holding one of the most important positions in that Institution. ST. JOHN'S COLLEGE, ANNAPOLIS.—Dr. Ilenry Bar nard, the newly elected President of this venerable institution, has lhad a conference with the college trustees concerning a plan for reorganization. Yes terday he was in this eity, and in company with Hon. Alexander Randall and Rev. Mr. L. Van Bokkelin, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, had a long interview with Governor Swann, who expressed great interest in the cause of public instruction, and especially as connected with St. John's College. The subject of the State Normal School was also taken into consideration, and it is understood that proposi tions will be made by the trustees of the above col lege which may lead to the location of the Normal Schol in the city of Annapolis, instead of Baltimore, as at first contemplated. The difficulty experienced in procuring a suitable building in this city for the use of the Normal School will doubtless cause its re moval elsewhere, and it is stated beside that there has been li* tie spirit manifested by those having the matter in charge to locate it here. Dr. Barnard is the editor of the American Journal of Education, and was formerly Chancellor of the University of Wisconsin, and being a gentleman of practical ex perience as well as high literary attainments, is well suited to fill the important trust imposed upon him as President of St. John's College.
