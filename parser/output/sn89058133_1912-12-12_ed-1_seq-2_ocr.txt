Since con gress has convened the Democrats have been making plans for carrying out the party's pledges i and the Republicans, who have by no means, los hope, are seeking means to hold their party to gether and restore it to power in the next election. The last campaign was bitter and acrimonious, but the dinner given in the house restaurant, by speak er Clark to ex-speaker Cannon, may be taken as indicative of the friendly so. cial feeling existing between members of the two parties. The senate has begun the trial of Judge Archbald, the ninth impeachment trial of a federal Judffe in our history. In only two were there convictions. This case grew out of charges that Judge Archbald took advantage of his official position In becoming inte-ested in the purchase of property from per sons who were, or were likely to be, litigants before his court. But it is said there was no attempt to get the property for less than its fair value. Conggressman Sulzer, governor-elect of New York, is one of the leading fig ures In the house, He hopes, before leaving Congress for his new duties as governor, to see bills passed extending the principle of civil service to our dip lomatic corps; to have the government buy suitable quarters for these repre sentatives; to have an -international prison reform association, established; to bring about an international confer ence for devising measures to prevent marine disasters; and to have a dis tinct department of labor with a cabi net officer at its head. In anticipation that the income tax amendment will 60on be 'ratified by the necessary number of states to make it part of the constitution, Congress coik templates imposing a direct tax upon all incomes above five thousand dol lars, and bills for this purpose have been already drawn. It is pointed out that such - a tax would suppely needed revenue that will be lost by tarriff reductions to be made in the extra session of Congress next spring. v . .v The position of .the' United States as a world power is exhibited in President Taft's message to congress. He forci bly asserts that "the fundamental for eign policies of the United States should be raised . high above the onfliet of partnership and wholly dissociated from differences as to domestic policy. In itsforeign affairs the. United States should present to the world a united front. The Intellectual, financial and industrial interests of the country and the publicist, the wage earner, the far mer and citizen of whatever occupation must co-operate in a spirit of high pa triotism to promote the national soli darity which is lndispensible to national efficiency and to t..e attainment f nat ional ideals." The social season in Washington will be shorter' than usual this winter. Raster comes early, Lent begins Feb. 16, and until mat, time there will be a rapid succession of brilliant social e. vents. President Taft has appointed Maj. T. L. Rhodes, of the army, and Lieut Commander J. W. Timmons, of the navy, his social a:ds. Maj. Rhodes, it wilt be remembered, is the successor of the late lamented Maj. Archibald Butt who lost his life In the week of the Titanic. Maj. Rhodes has also re cently become a master mason In the lodge of which Maj. Butt, at Augusta. Georgia, will bear the design of the Great Seal of the United States the Seal of the state of Georgia, the coat i of arms of the Butt family, and an ap propriate masonic emttlem. Maj. Butt's lodge has accepted the invitation of the Memorial Committee to select and pro vide this emblem. . The suggestion of President-elect j Wilson, that the ceremonies of Inaugu ration be postponed until late In next ! April, is not given ft hearty reception by those in a position to speak with ; authority. They say that the ceremony i without the significant feature of indue-; tion of the President Into office, ana without the -presence of the cetiring President, would be meaningless ana dull. Congress will also be in extra session.
