In County Jail for Failure to Prose cute for Theft. Speaking about a right, real-down, hard luck story, Frank Masklin, who is now confined in the county Jail, deserves, at least. an honorable mention. Macklin lives on a farm near Kossville and came to Topeka one afternoon lastTeek to see the sights of a big city. He waited about up town until after dark, and then inea himself to the red light district to do the town and see what he could see. He came, he saw, and was taken in. He im bibed in the combination of vitrei and carbolic acid, which the bartenders dis pense in that part of the city, and very early next morning, when he came out of it, he was confronted with a face he had never seen before, and, upon looking over his assets, discovered that he was minus of everything of value which he had started with. Macklin immediately bethought himself of the police force and at once started for the station, awakening all of the sleeping policemen along the way. He told his story, at first claiming that he had been robbed of $40, but finally reduced his loss to $10, and charged that this amount had been appropriated by Miss Jessie Grady. Upon the irformation furnished hy him, the police landed the lady in question, only to rind that the complaining witness had fled. This enraged the police force, whose slumbers had been broken by the complaining witness, and they proceeded to get busy and located him at his home. He was brought to the city and to be sure that he will be on hand to prosecute the case when it is called, he was locked In the county jail, where his chance ac quaintance, who he accuses of "frisking him." was confined. This morning the scenes shifted. The woman in the case was released on bond, while the com plaining witness still languishes in jail, pondering over the brand of justice which he has met while in search of the pleasures of a city.

Men Chosen. 

POOLER AT THE HEAD. Would dire Him Captaincy of First Team. Selection of Second Contains Some Surprises. Coach E. C. Quigley, of St. Marys, has officiated for every college foot ball team in Kansas during the past season, "While reviewing the season at the National hotel yesterday he made public his "all-Kansas'" team. There is perhaps no one better quali fied to make up the "all-Kansas" than Mr. Quigley. He has had oppor tunity to sea the inside workings of all the teams and has seen all the teams both in the early part and at the close of the season. According to Coach Quigley, five Washburn men, five Kansas univer sity men and one St. Marys man con stitute the first "all-Kansas" team; on the Fecond team he places three K. I), men, one Washburn man, three St. Marys men, one Normal man, one Ottawa man, one Agricultural college man, and one Falrmount man. His teams follow: First Team Second Team. Center. Brown (Washburn) Dye (Ottawa.) Guards. Reed (K. U.) Heintzman (K. V.) Strickler Uv. U.) Iserman tSt. Marys.) Tackles. Donald (K. T") Forde (State Normal.) Brunner (K. U.) Hill ( Washburn Ends. Walsh est. Marys) Rouse (K. TT.) White (Washburn.) White K. U.) Quarter. Pooler (K. IT.) Maynard (St. Marys.) Halves. Millice (Washburn.).. Corcoran (St. Marys. Caldwell (Washburn. ).Iielden(Fairmount) Full. Williams (Washburn).. Sholtz(K. S. A. C.) Mr. Quigley says: "Hope of Wash burn and Hart of K. U. would make a bid for the second quarter if eligible. Myers of K. U. and Haughey of Wash burn could not be considered on ac count of not participating in a suffi cient number of games. "The captaincy of the first team goes to Pooler and Sholtz of Manhattan gets the honor on the second eleven." Of course nobody can pick an "All Kansas" team which will suit every body. Coach Quigley of St. Marys is no doubt better fitted than any other man in the state for this particular job. His selections for the first team are likely to provoke less opposition than for the second. It is generally admit ted that Kansas university has the strongest line, and Washburn the strongest backfield, and. Ibis Is . pracr tically the alignment which Quigley makes. He also recognizes the weak ness in the K. V. and Washburn ends, by crowding out White and Rouse of K. U. and Haughev of Washburn. There will no doubt be a kick from K. U. about the omission of Rouse, but at the same time, Quigley has probably selected his superior In Captain Walsh of St. Marys, who has ben the main stay of the Catholic team. For the second team, it is perhaps natural that Coach Quigley should in cline a little toward the members of his own team at St. Marys. On the general showing made by St. Marys, as compared with the strong- teams of Faii-mount. Normal and Manhattan, it may be that the right of St. Marys to three places on the second team may ce enauengea. JPairmount and the Ag ricultural college, it would seem, have ground to contend that it has not been given the representation that their showing Justifies. St. Marys and the state normal, on the season showing, are about equal in strength, while the Agricultural college is a little stronger rnan eitner. rne Normal beat St. Marys, when St. Marys was somewhat crippled, 11 to 6. Then the Agricultural college beat St. Marys when both teams were full strength, by a score of 10 to 5. Then the Agriculturists beat the Normal 10 to 5. Meantime Fairmount had gone down before the farmers by a score of 11 to , which was a larger score than Washburn had been able to make against the Wichita team. All of these team scores seem to in dicate that the Agricultural college was at the head of the second division teams, and naturally the question arises why it gets but one man on both first and second teams, while St. Marys has four. Manhattan would probably insist that Mallon should be given a place at half back, and Cunningham at quarter. As a matter of fact, Mallon played the star game in the farmer'st hardest battle of the year, against Kansas university. Mr. Quigley endorses the plan of try ing the new rules in the Washburn Fairmount game on Christmas day and will be an interested spectator. STUDENTS CLUBBED.

Where Suicide Is Common. A Russian correspondent was talking about Siberia. "In that strange land," he said, "the strangest thing is the suicidal tenden cy of the Chuckchees. Among the Chukchees, actuallv. suicide, is one or the most common forms of death. "The Chukchees live in northeastern Siberia. They are small and copper colored. They dress in skins and ride reindeer. Tallow and raw kidnevs are their chief delicacies. In every Chuk- chee house hangs- a death coat. "A Chukchee does not kill himself bv his own hand. He appoints his near est relative his wife, son or daughter to do the deed. And the delegate never rebels, never declines this sad and hor l ible task. "Innumerable are the causes of sui cidejealousy, an incurable disease; melancholy, poverty and so on. "I know a man who was prosperous and apparently happy. Suddenly a de sire for death seized him. 'In three months,' he said. 'I will go home to my fathers.' And he calmly settled his af fairs and at the apopinted time bade bis wife to knot a cord about his throat and his two sons to pull upon the cord until he should be strangled. He died, they told me, joking. "The death coat, which hangs in ev ery Chukchee house, has a hood. It is for use in suicide. The hood bides the facial contortions of the dying. "There are Chukchee families where in suicide is hereditary, wherein it is a point of honor for the sons to kill them selves, a natural dath being regarded in such families as disgraceful and scan dalous, a sign of the most unpardon able cowardice. "Three Chukchees, despite their suici dal tendency, are a happy and healthy people, moral, truthful, brave and tem perate." Cleveland Plain Dealer. Knew AH About Solomon. A little girl who attended regularly a Sunday School where the interna tional lessons were taught went one afternoon to the class of a playmate and heard catechism questions for the tirst time in her life. She was asked several questions and was mortified not to be able to answer thein. "Who was the first man?" So answer. "Do you know who Xoah was?" A shake of the head and the question was passed on. Finally the teacher said: "Did you ever hear about Solomon, dear?" Here was an acquaintance at last and the little girl's face broke into smiles. "Oh. yes." she replied, confi dently: "I know him all the way through. 'Solomon Grundy, born on Monday.' Want me to say the rest?" Washington Times. Sorry He Spoke. Thedore C.
