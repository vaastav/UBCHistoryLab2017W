The President's Message President Wilson's message to Congress is a disappointment to those who were expecting a masterly solution of after-the-war problems. The only big problem discussed is that of the railroads, and on this topic the president merely advocates that they revert back to private owner ship, and that Congress at once take up a study "of the question. The'nation expected an exhaust jve discussion of the many factors involved in trying to restore the carriers to private owner ship after months of federal control. The presi dent says: "I frankly turn to you for counsel upon it. I have no confident judgment of my qwn." His tribute to the American soldiers and non combatants for their whole-hearted co-operation in fighting and in producing the weapons of war is a sincere expression of the president. It is worded in the masterly style of the chief execut ive. This high sentiment is weakened considerably by his explanation of why it is necessary for him to attend the peace conference. He offers no reason why the senate was completely ignored and why he, single-handed and alone, must shoul der the whole responsibility of the momentous factors involved in drawing up the final terms of the treaty. If the American people, on his own admission, unflinchingly supported him during the war per iod, it would seem appropriate and fitting that the president would consult their wishes regard ing the peace terms, or at least show them the courtesy of respecting the body to which the 'founders of the republic entrusted treaty mak ing authority. Public Ownership No Panacea Under this caption the Indianapolis Star dis cusses government ownership of railroads, re citing the experience of European governments with railroads, and concluding with the proposi tion that private ownership of railroads in Amer ica with sensible regulation is preferable to fed eral control. The editorial follows : Mr. Charles E. Hughes, speaking before the Institute of Arts at Columbia University, sound ed a note of warning against government owner ship and control. He explained that government ownership tends toward inefficiency and char acterized as enemies of liberty those "whose in terests lie simply in extending the activities of government so as to embrace all industry." The problems he discussed are not untried and should be viewed in the light of experience elsewhere. Canada, our next door neighbor, has had bit ter experience with government ownership. It recently has been forced, as a war emergency measure, to extend its railway holdings, but that was not from preference on the part of the people. The government lent its credit to the promoters of some of the great lines that were extended into the unsettled Northwest. Then the war came and killed the business those roads planned to get and the government had to step in to pro tect the tens of millions it already had invested. Canada years ago spent millions of dollars in the construction of lines into the maritime pro vinces and later leased those lines to private cor porations to operate. Manitoba became so ob sessed with the public ownership idea a decade or more ago that the government took over the elevators for the farmers and took over the tele phones in the province. The experiment was a failure in each case and both the elevators and the telephones were turned over to private op eration. .The experience of European nations that have tried government ownership of railways has been almost uniformly disappointing. The govern some years before the war took over the Western Railway of France and at the end of four years the net revenue had fallen to $5,350,000. The lowest any year under private ownership was $13,750,000. Belgium had under discussion in 1914 the proposal to turn its state railways over to private corporations in the interest of effi ciency. The government railways in Russia, in Scan dinavia and in other parts of Europe never were conducted as effectively as similar roads under private ownership. American advocates of gov ernment ownership cite the low fares on some lines in congested areas. Those are third-class fares. First-class costs as much or more than in this country. Americans would not stand for third-class nor the quality of service that is given on the governmental railways of Europe. This country has the greatest network of railways in the world. We have enjoyed rates and service that are marvels to strangers from abroad. All that was developed under competi tion and by business rivalry. Much of the pro gress our railways made was in the face of ham pering legislation from states and nation. The railways should not be permitted to do as they please, but if they are given a square deal, as business institutions, they will provide better ser vice and at less cost than the public can hope to get from the numbing influence of bureaucratic government ownership. Courtesy "I: From the Los Angeles Times. AM just finding out the big reason for the success. or certain pusiness men, remarKea a "cud re porter of Los Angeles. "In one word it is courtesy. As a rule the big man that I go to for information is the very soul of kindness. Sometimes I have asked very simple Questions of clerks and office boys and have been insulted for my pains, but I have seldom been rebuffed by a clerk's employer, even when I have asked apparent ly embarrassing questions. I do not think this is because clerks and office boys are at heart any worse than their employers, but it is probably because the latter, having had more experience, have learned that it is good busi ness as well as a source of great satisfaction to be polite." The "cub" is right Moreover, courtesy in the office boy is a mighty good start toward the position occupied by his boss. Dinner "Shut that door!" yelled the rough man. "Where were you raised, In a barn?" The man addressed meekly and silently complied, but the speaker looking at him a moment later observ ed that he was in tears. Going rver to his victim he apologized. "Oh, come," he said soothingly, "you should not take It to heart because I asked if you were raised in a barn." "That's it, that's it." sobbed the other man. "I was raised in a barn and It makes me homesick every time hear an ass bray." The painter Raphael was busy at work when an impecunious confrere entered hastily and said: "You remember that florin 1 just borrowed from you?" "Yes, I do. I am surprised that you do. though." "Well, I came to say I need another. That was insufficient to pay my lodg ing bill." Raphael handed out the other florin somewhat ruefully, saying: "I know what business your de scendants, should you have any, will follow." "What?" asked the impecunious one. "Retouching old masters." The scientist was giving a lecture, during which he said the sun was gradually losing its heat, and that in seventy million years all beneficent effects from it would be lost. "Pardon me," said a man in the audience, nervously, "how long did you say it would be before this ter rible calamity would occur?" "Why, about seventy million years," repeated the scientist. "Thank heaven!" exclaimed the questioner, wifh a sigh of relief. "I thought you said seven million." .
