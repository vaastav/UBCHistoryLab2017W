THE SITUATION. With ihe exception of some heavy firing be tween the outposts of both armies there was no fighting on the Rappahannock yesterday. Every thing was quiet, and the terrible conflict of Satur day ia not yet renewed. Our troopB were busy yesterday removing the wounded to the river aide, lest the ent-ruy should shell the city when the battle is renewed. The rebels, meantime, are actively engaged strengthening their defences. At one time yesterday they made a feint to attack General Franklin's forces, but did not accomplish it. Beyond tl is slight demonstration there was no evidence of a design to renew the contest. The weather continued clear and salubrious, and the roads were again in line condition. Since our army crossed the river they have captured fully J seven hundred prisoners?stragglers in the city, j sharpshooters on the river bank, and others taken in front of the w orks. ? j We give to-day a fine trap of the scene of ope" ; ration* around Fredericksburg; but, for reasons j which will be immediately cc mprehe ided by our j readers, we omit the location of the Union bat teries. An additional list of casualties will be found in our columns to-day, showing a heavy loss, especially among our officers, in the fight of Saturday. On Sunday night, about eight o'clock, a body of rebel cavalry uudcr Major White, about three buudred and twenty-five strong, made a dash into Poolesvil'.e. Md., and attacked a small body of Union troops, numbering about thirty-five men of ficott's cavalry, who were stationed in a wooden building. After the bonne wa.- set on lire, and j the Union tr< ops had made the best resistance i they could, tlicy sunendercd and were at once paroled. The rebels lost two killed atid thirteen wounded in the skirmish. On our aide the loss was only one killed and two wounded. Various rumors were afloat yesterday, circu lated by the Philadelphia papers, regarding the movement* of General Bauks" expedition; some of them to the effect thaUie bad landed at Wintou, N.C.; had taken command of the army of the Blarkwattr; had formed a junction with the troops at Suflidk. and was advancing upon Weldcn uud Petersburg. The probability of these statements may be judged from tho fact that th? brig Pcdto Sanchez Hoi/, from Cuba, which arrived her? yesterd?' reports having spoken tho Che Kiung, one of General Banks* vessels, bound southward, on the Ath iu-t., sbort twt nty-Qvr miles southeast of Cape Hatters*; nti-1 on the text dny, the Gth, she passed five more large steamers, going in the aatnc direction. The United States -team gnuboat Bienville also artived here yeeterdny from Port ftoynl, 8. C., bringing In tow the gunboat K. B. Hale In a dis abled condition. The officers of the Hale report hav ing passed four steamers and a brig, all heavily lad'-w with troops, bound iuto Port Royal, on tht morning of the 10th io?t., when she was leaviuu ti nt harbor. The landing of General Banks' troops ai Wlnton, N. C., on Friday or Saturday is thrt" out of the question. It Is known Unit the trans port Thames, wLli four hundred men of the fine Hundred and Fourteenth New York regitin nt, wa, glaabled and put into Port Royal, whore she wal gaademncd as un?caworUiy by Uoneral Hrannnu. qh fotcet newt Suffolk are not idle. Almo-t every day General Di* sends out a reronnoitering party to the Blackw ater. On Thursday last Gene ral Ferry made an advam e towards Zuni and en gaged a rebel force. After aome aevere fighting he captured a captain and several privates. The ?ndden swelling of the river prevented hia plana from being fully carried out. r ! CONGRESS. A large amount of business was transacted by Congress yesterday, but we have only space for reference to the most important proceedings. In the Senate, Mr. Davis, of Kentucky, offered a resolution, which was laid on the table, declaring that after it had become manifest that an insur rection against the United States was about to break out in several Southern States, James Bu chanan, then President, from sympathy with the conspirators and their treasonable projects, failed to take the necessary and proper measures to pre vent it; wherefore he should receive the censure and condemnation of the Senate and of the Ameri can people. A resolution requesting the Presi" nent, if not inconsistent with the public interests, to transmit to the Seuate the report and accom panying documents of Hon. Rervedy Johnson as C ommissioner of the United Statetf during last summer at New Orleans, was adopted Mr. Wright, of Indiana, offered a resolution, which was also adopted, that the Committee on the Judiciary be instructed to inquire into the expediency of providing by act of Congress that any loynl citizen of the United States, who has sustained damage from the troops of the States engaged in the present rebellion, may set off such damages against any claim or demand against him in any action at law by any such rebellious States, or the agcuts or trustees of snch States, or in any ease where such claim or demand is for the use or benefit of such States. A resolution in structing the Committee on Foreign Relations to ipejuire whether some method cannot be devised to manifest the sympathy of Congress with the suflering Lancashire operatives, was ordered to be printed. The resolution calling for information relative to arbitrary arrests in Delaware was taken np, and Mr. Davis made a speech, arguing that the President had no authority, under the constitution, to make such arrests. After an executive sessiou the Senate adjourned. In the House of Representatives a resolution, declaring that in the judgment of the House there should be no legislation changing the existing laws providing for the payment of interest on the pub lic debt in coin, was adopted by a vote of eighty one against twenty-four, and a joint resolution that the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States be and is hereby authorized and empowered to pay in coin any portion of the bonded public debt maturing and falling due previous to the first day of January, 1864. was referred to the Com mittee of Ways and Means. Mr. Colfax introduced a bill to reduce the duties on paper from thirty five down to ten per centum. It was referred to the Committee on Ways and Means. Mr. Noell, of Missouri, introduced a bill, which was referred, to procure the abolisliment of slavery in Missouri and provide compensation to loyal owners. A resolution was Hdopted instructing the Committee of Ways and Means to inquire info the expediency of revising the tariff, increasing the duty on foreign goods not of prime nocrssity, so that tire importation of foreign goods shall not exceed the amount exported of American growth and manufacture, exclusive of specie. A resolution endorsing the President's emancipation proclamation was adopted by a vote of seventy eight against filty-one. The Army Appropriation bill wns reported and made the special order for Thursday. The first proposition for peace was in troduced by Mr. Conway, of Kansas, who offered a resolution in effect dissolving the Union, and ac knowledging the independence of the Confederate States. It was laid on the table?Mr. Conway being the only one who voted in the negative. In Committee of the Whole, Mr. Cox. of Ohio, de ivered a speech on the topics of the President's Message and the removal of General MrClellan, and at the conclusion of his remarks the House adjourned. 

MISCELLANEOUS NEWS. A highly interesting and entertaining lecture, illustrating the manners and customs of the Ja panese. the nature of their country and its various productions, was delivered at the Stuyvesant In stitute last evening by Dr. Maegowan. The audience was select and appreciative, and the lec ture. of nearly two hours' duration, met with their entire and hearty approbation. The lecturer has been for nearly twenty years a resident m China and Jcpan, and increased the interest of his re marks by exhibiting specimens of the natural and artificial productions of Japan. The Tammany Society met last evening at Tam many Hall, and after the usual preliminary busi ness,Captain Doyle, of the Tammany regiment, appeared be.ore them, with the once beautiful flag which was presented by the society to this regiment, when the greatest enthusiasm prevailed. Captain Doyle, in a brief address, showed that Old Tammany was ever loyal to the Union, and, after appropriate responses by Grand Sachem WaUrbury and others, a motion was made to de posit it in the archives of the society. No elec tion tor treasurer having taken place, on account of other importanCbusmess, the warriors adjourn ed for the celebration of Jackson's birthday. Mr. Boole offered a preamble and resolution at the Board of Aldermen, last evening, containing wholesale charges of mismanagement, extrava gance, fraud and corruption against the Central Park Commissioners, and proposing to give the management and control of that institution into the hands of the Street CommLsioner, for which purpose he asks for an appropriation of $2"?,ooo. A regular meeting of the Board of Council men was held last c\ cuing, when a large amount of routine business was transacted. The Board adopted a resolution that the Governor of the .-tate be re-pectfully requested to memorialise Cougn -s, now in session, for an increase of twen U -five per cent on the pay 0f the rank and file and line officers of all regiments from this city and Mute now serving in the Army of the United States. The Board then adjourned until this af ternoon at four o'clock. The Board of Excise for this city and connty will h ild its flft-th and last session for granting i licenses to sell liquors on Thursday, the 1-uk Instant, at one o'clock P. M., in the City Hull. Inquests were Ukeu in four actions yesterday agninst Fernanda Wood, brought by members of the Metropolitan Police, for alleged assault and battery dndng the conflict between the old and 1 tlo n-srpolico in 1857. The enita were not de- ! fended by Mr. Wood, and verdict was given in 1 ouch case, for ?4,000. An action firs balance of >2,200 on a charter ; party was commenced in the Superior Court yes t- rday, in which Mr. Russell Sturgia, a gentleman ! somewhat nilx. d up with government war con- j tracts, is pi lintiff, and the well known honse of Hpoford A Til -ston defendant*, it appears that HQ-*,poo was paid by the United Statei govern ment fur the a*" of the transport ship Marlon, til >ugh they h id the privilege <?r purchasing her ' out and ont for *100,000 after the first voyage. On Sunday a telegraphic rablo was to be Inid across tue Hudson river, about three miles above W est Point, to take the place of the masts across which the wire* havu been stretched heretofore at ; Butter Hill. T'n ? cable is two thousand eight liun- 1 ?Ir-'d feet lone, and is a piece of the celebrated A'lantif cable. The Hudson river is again free irom obstruction, and on Hiiturday night eight towe, containing one hundred and sixty loaded hosts, left Albanv for I XT ? r New York. A large number were also coming down from Troy. In the Court of General Sessions yesterday Judge Hoffman delivered a charge to the Grand Jury on the subject of arbitrary arrest* of citi zens. In concluding he aaid it may not be possi ble to prevent entirely the unlawful seiaure and removal of citizens of our State, bat it is possible to^convict and punish those who, in this respect, 8hall be found guilty of a violation of our laws. The report conies from Memphis that the Union gunboats hate again commenced the bombard ment of Vicksburg. The New York Tenth regiment (militia) will leave Albany this morning for this city, and cm bark for the Banks expedition. J. Wesley Greene. Jeff. Davis' peace envoy, has been arrested in Chicago for obtaining goods un der false pretences. The stock mmkei was dull and lower yesterday?the feature being a general unwillingness to do business. Money was worth 0 per cent. Uold closed at 1317, a 132, and exchange at 145,ta'. The bank statement shows an increase of $l,460,0i"itt in loans and $1,087,819 in deposits, and a decrease of $?,"4,U4 in specie. Cotton was neglected yesterday, prices were nominal Hour, wheat and corn wore very dull and heavy. Pork and lard were plenty, heavy and declining, while beef was less active. A moderate business was reported in sugars, whiskey, hops and tallow, but most other articles were extremely quiet. There were hoavier freight en gagements effected, but at lower rates. From Fredericksburg?The Two Armies Comparatively Q,uiet Yesterday. As with us in New York, so at Fredericks burg yesterday, the day was bright, warm and beautiful. The weather and the roads were highly favorable for active military operations; and yet, beyond some irregular artillery dis charges at long range, the day passed off quiet ly between the two great hostile armies in full view of each other. On our side, however, the care of the wounded and the necessary prepa rations for a more formidable and regular as sault of the enemy's lines than that of Satur day made it a busy day, while the enemy were as industriously employed in strengthening their defensive works and in all the precau tionary measures suggested for a vigorous re sistance From all the information we have from the field, we conclude that the heavy batteries of General Burnside, with a very few exceptions, are still on the high ground on this side of the Rappahannock, from which they can make very little impression upon the rebel earth works along the crests of the hills beyond the city on the opposite bank. It is probable, therefore, that before he next assails the rebel defences General "Burnside will transfer at least a considerable number ?f his heavy guns to the other side of the river, and sufficiently near to silence the rebel batteries, preparatory to an. other advance of his infantry to carry tbem by storm. We have no doubt^of his power, by means of his artillery to demolish, the enemy's works, from the great advantage which he pos sesses over them in the number, calibre and improved construction of his heavy guns and their projectiles. It is probable, therefore, that some days may elapse before another movement is made to carry the enemy's positions. The attempt of Saturday, we think, shows that they cannot be carried by our infantry until we shall have silenced their enfilading batteries by an overpowering bombardment. Meantime the question recurs, why is it that i General Burnside has not been provided with j troops sufficient in numbers to enable him, with an overwhelming pressure, to turn the flanks of General Lee while occupying the bulk of his forces to protect his centre? We oannot answer. We only know that if the heads of the War Office had determined upon reinforcing General Burnside to the extent of fifty thousand men. and upon a supporting diversion, by wav of the James river, by another army of one hundred thousand men, that both these things could have been done without abandouing or endangering any point of great importauce which we occupy elsewhere within the rebel lious States. We know, too, that a double movement of this description upon Richmond, in speedily securing -the heart of the rebel lion." would immensely facilitate alt our de signs in every othor quarter; but why this crushing combination of forces has not boon adopted is a mystery which we cannot unravel, ! Wc hear, however, that a formidable movement towards Richmond, by way of Suffolk and Petersburg, is in active progress; but that the forces of the Banks expedition are connected with it is news which we apprehend is too good to be true. It delighted this city yesterday; but it is news which needs confirmation. As will be seen, from a lending article which we copy from the Richmond Ernniiner upon the subject, the rebel leaders of that city are in a state of alann at the enormous magnitude of our land and water combinations and forces which are advancing upon them around the entire circle of the rebellion. But the atten tion of the loyal twenty-three millions of our people Is fixed upon Richmond and upon the army of General Pu inside, and should the rea sonable demands and just expectations of these loyal people be disappointed In another loug, doubtful and exhausting campaign for Rich mond. the administration will be held to a fear ful accountability. We earnestly admonish our patriotic President that the attention of the country is fixed upon Richmond, and that upon the speedy success of our Ariny of the Totomac depends, in all probability, the success of his administration. Re volition in Japan.?Accounts received by way of Ban Francisco to the 25th of October make mention of a revolution having been ef fected there favorable to foreigners and rcstric. tive of the power of the Tycoon. We am left kt the dark as to the immediate causes and ob jects of this movement; but It is to be inferred that another cowurdly attack made on a party of Kngiish people by the retainers of one of the high princes of the empire, in which one gen tleman was literally out to pieces and two others sorcrely wounded, has had something to do with it. There was a lanre number of Kn*> j T. llsh, French and Dutch men-of-war in the port of Yokabama at the time, and, though no action was immediately taken bf them in the matter, It is not Improbable that, subsequent to the de parture of the vessel that brings the announce ment, euch demands for redress were unitedly made by them as afforded to the party favora ble to the foreign interest an opportunity of insisting upon a relaxation of the restrictions imposed upon trade. The news will be receiv ed with satisfaction by all who have an interest, present or prospective, in opening up the re sources of this exclusive empire. Th? Fight at Fredericksburg?Awful Hespomalblltty of the War Depart* meat. The nows which we published yesterday and publish to-day from the Rappahannock is highly creditable to our able generals and gallant troops, but far from honorable to the War De partment or hopeful for the country. With brilliaut deeds of arms, and with the most ter rific fighting, the enemy is still In possession of his strongholds, and we have failed to dislodge him. Buruside has done all that a skilful com mander could do. the subordinate officers have acquitted themselves like heroes, and the rank and file of our army have fought with an ob stinacy and a determination almost without a parallel in the history of war. Yet. from the advantages possessed by the enemy, the assault upon his works has been unsuccessful, and thousands of brave3 have fallen in vain. The truth may as well be told?the finest army that ever trod the earth, possessing superior arms, large and small, and with all the appli ances and resources of war at command, has suffered a deoided repulse at the hands of a half naked, half starved, half armed foe. The easy crossing of the liver on Thursday was a suspicions circumstance, which the subse quent event? have only too well explained. The rebel General-in-Chief saw the advantage of the position which the authorities at Washing ton threw into his hands, and he made good use of the opportunity. This route to Richmond was the very one which the insurgent chiefs de sired our government to splect. It abounds with natural difficulties, and the War Depart ment has permitted the enemy to add so many artificial obstructions that the campaign in Vir ginia this winter is likely to prove a failure. The story of this campaign is the story of the Chickahominy, Harrison's Landing and Antio tarn repeated. Reinforcements were delibe rately and pertinaciously withheld from MeClel" lan previous to the seven days' battles before Richmond, which reinforoements would have placed him in possesion of that city in a few days and saved thousands of livos. The same is tnie of the situation at Harrison's Landing- ; After the terrible battle of Antietam, which , won by his skill, saved Washington and caused the enemy to retreat over the Potomac, needful supplies were withheld from hiiu, which pre vented the rapid pursuit of Lee; and when he was at length in close proximity to the foe. and would have compelled hiin to fight or abandon Richmond, he was suddenly removed from the command of the army. The strong probability is that. had he been permitted to continue his own course, he would have been in possession of the rebel capital within a week. But he was stripped of his command for political reasons by the imbeciles at Washington, and the base of operations was changed to Aquia Creek?a course betraying the samo vacillation and blind groping in the dark which had been previously exhibited in the case of McDowell's army. McClellan was ordered to advance by the valley of Virginia towards Gordonsville. That plan is aban doned, and another is substituted which is still worse, and which no military man of ability would have ever recommended. MeUlellan's own plan was the route of the James river?a plan which will probably yet have to be adopt ed if Richmond is ever to be taken. Burnsid<> was appointed McClellan's succes sor, and was directed to proceed to Falmouth, opposite Fredericksburg. The bridges had been burned down. Instead of having the ma terials for the repair of the railroad from Aquia Creek to Fredericksburg ready, in order for the speedy transportion of supplies, nothing had been done when General Burnsidearnvod.and, worse still, the pontoons for crossing the river were not there. This red tape neglect was so flagrant as to cause General Ilurnride himself to repair to Washington to remonstrate with "the powers that be" For ten days their arrival was delayed, which gave the on?niy ample time to concentrate bis forces an-1 to erect strong fortifications on the hills behind Fredericksburg Had the pontoons been at hnnd when Bnrnside reached Fal mouth be would have captured Fredericks burg without a struggle, occupied the heights beyond without any difficulty, and probably would have been in Richmond bofore now, had a supporting movement at the same time been made on the James river The ground behind Fredericksburg wus thou unfortified, and the city was held only by a handful of rebels. The delay was fatal; and Lee could ask no gr?ater advantage than the crossing of our army in the face of his works?an army with a river close at its back to ent off its retreat in the event of ? disastrous defeat, and an enemy before it which oould either giro bat tle or safely retreat, according to circumstances. The result is re pulse, great loss of life, and probably greater loss in the future. The War Depart ment is accountable. The country is thorough ly aroused, and, in view of tho direct and fear ful responsibilities of the government to the people, we trust Mr. Lincoln will lose no time | in putting an end to a career of imbecility which is mining tho nation and bringing it into contempt with tho civilixud world.

She had in tow the propeller Thames, ladon with four hundred men or the One Hundred and Fourteenth New York regimcut, Colonel Smith. Tb .-se troops are a por tion of tbn expedition of Major Geucral Banks, but put Into this iKirt on account of an accident to the machinery ol the Th?m?e They sailed from Hampton l'.oads, in com pany with twelve other vessels, on Thursday, tho 4tb inat. On Friday, while at. iut three miles astern of the Ericsson, the Thimes hoi.-ted a signal of distress, and Captain IkJwber at ouco put hb vossul about and wont to her rollef. The wind waa blowing very fro-b nt the time, aud shortly afterwards ln< reaped to a gain, which lasted throughout the following day. At two P. M. on Saturday, In latiludo 34 dogroes 44 minntse, longitude 70 degrocs 10 minutes, the hawser connecting the two vessels was part - ed, when Harry Darclay, the first oiUcor of the Ericsson, with larlng intrepidity and at tho risk of l.*j0g th0' lives of himself and crew, succeeded lo k.weriug a boat and getting the hawser again on board. The effect of the gain was foarful. In her disabled condition the Thames was rolled and tossed about to such an oxtent that for a time It was thought she would go to pieces. The rations of tho troops were thrown overboard, and the hod-of tho water casks rnockod in, to Itghtoa bor. While Mr. Bar clay was endeavoring to reooonect Uio vossola Uioy col lided, the Erkssaon losing two of her boats, and tho Thames sustaining serious injuries in her bows. Tho risking of the lives of four hundred men ta a steamer like tbo Thatnoc is an oulraga which calls for Uw loudest coodotanation. A board ot survey, apjminted by General Rrannan, made an examination sf the ves-el yes terday , and they report bor to tie utterly un-enworthj. Her sides are ccnstriictod of pine, and are so frail as to bo positively unsafe. Mhe was l.ullt silbsr fi?r service In smooth water, or, what is more likely, to bring ra Gey Into the irackeu of hor owners by her she to the gov rn ment. it waa the purpose of Colonel Uttlejohn, who Is in command of the brigade, of which tho.'e forcoa arc a portion, to transfer the troops on board the Thames to some other steamer at this port an! proceed at once to their destination; but tbe insufir clunt means of transportation at Gouoral Bran, nan's command roodered such a plan ,m practicable,and so O olonol Smith's detachment remain hers, while the Eric-sou, having rop'onlsbod hor supplies of coal and water, has gone on to overtake Hi# balance of the expedition at tho appointed place of r end as reus. The secret of Uenoral Rinks' destination has been well kept. No one on b *?rd oilher the Ericsson or the Thames was ante to impart it. Ruth vessels were under sealod ordsrs, not to ho opened till after pawing Port Royal. I surmise, however, that the nsxt arrivals from tho Gulf will rovosl the whereabouts of General Ranks' forces, and that Uis capturs of Mobile is to be among the more im portent items which tbny will bring. A little feud lias arisen In Beauinrt between Genera' Bixton and tbe foroeo of the Tenth Army nor pa. Last week, during the abseuoo at Fornsndlna of Unaeral Bran can and f'olonel Good. the latter of whom is in command of Ml. Duces on Port Royal Island, Colonel Richard While* of Uie Fifty.fifth Pennsylvania, was temporarily placed In authority. Ry his ooiumund a stable, used by some of General Sax ton's employes, was torn down. General Sax ton remonstrated, and I loam that hard words -?owed dl any rath, Mm General nrosnmed noon hi" rank to place Colons! Whits tn arrest, and to assume ths control of the ?Hilary forces Upon ttsworri Urannaa'a retain, taat Muaday, Ueaecal Boston preferred against Colonel White several charges, among which are "conduct prejudicial to good order and military disci pltne" and "conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentle man." Geueral Rntnnan, while denying the right of Genera! Saxton to exercise any authority over the troops, has, nevertheless, ordered a general court martial to be convened, and the following officers, comprising the de tail of theoourt,are to day trying the oaee:?Brigadier General Torry, United States Volunteers; Colonel T H. Good, Forty seventh Pennsylvania; Colonel H R. Guhs, Ninety-seventh Pennsylvania. Colonel .T D Rust, Eighth llaiue. Colonel J. R. Hawley, Seventh Connecticut Colonel Edward Metcalf, Third Rhode Island artillery, Lieutenant Colonel G. W. Alexander, Forty seventh Penn sylvania; Lieutenant Colonel J. F. Twttchell, Eighth Maine, Lieutenant Colonel J. H. Bedell, Third New Hamp shire; Major Gausler, Forty seventh Pennsylvania; Major John Freoee, Third Rhode Island artillery-Captain J. P. S. Gobtn, Forty seventh Pennsylvania, Judge Advocate. Among the officers of the corps the act of General Saxtoa is generally deemed a usurpation on his part; and, inas much sa this opinion is to be either sustained or out weighed by the Court, a good deal of Interest is mani fested in the trial. The ferry boat John Adams, from Boston on the 25th sit., arrived here safely on Monday evening, after a rough and tedious pas-age Hho has been purchased by the Navy Department, and will prove very serviceable is the shallow waters of tbe Souihern coasi.

Mr. Conway's menta tion h to dissolve tbe Union and entablsh peace worn tabled by a powerful majority. It has been predicted for some time that the Arst proposition of peace with tho relicts would comi from the anti-slavery radicals; but tbo proposition to swa3b tho Union altogether was hardly export-.d in Congress Mr. Pendleton, of Ohio, banded in a revolution of In quiry, which would have pro luced some commotion If a battle was not impending on the war path to Richmond.
