[SFKCtAL DISPATCHES TO TEH RBCORD-UMON.] DOMESTIC NEWS. End or the " Manuel Slough" Controversy. Washington, December 7th. — The judg ments of the Circuit Court of California in favor of the railroad company in the Mussel Slough cases have bean affirmed by the Su preme Court of the United States, thus end ing forever that controversy in favor of the Southern Pacific Railroad Company, Postal Telegraphy. Washington, December 7th.— The postal telegraph question is likely to come up in several forms at the present session of Con gress. The bill of Senator Edmunds has been supplemented by one of Senator Hill, the latter being an elaborate scheme for the absorption of the present lines of telegraph by the United States Government. On Mon day, Sumner of California will introduce a bill on the same subject into the House, he having fcr many years studied tbe problem of postal telegraphy. Sumner hopes to force his bill on the attention of the House. It has already received some notice from mem bers. Those from the South, notably Ran dolph and Tucker from Virginia, object to the measure on the ground that its tendency is toward paternal government, but all have agreed to give tbe bill their attention. Sumner's bill proceeds on ibe theory that a postal telegraph should be a part of the Post" ffi c Department, and provides for the appointment of a Fourth Assist ant Postmaster-General, who shall be an electrician, and who .-hull take charge of the new service. The details of service are left to tha Postmaster Gen eral. Bonds to the amount of $25,000,000, bearing 3 per cent., in denominations not exceeding $50, to run for thirty years but re deemable iv twenty, are to be issued to con struct the new lines of telegraph under the supervision of the Postmaster-General. The bill provides that work shall commence at certain points in the country simultaneously. I On the Pacific coast those points are Port land, Yreka, Sacramento, San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, thus making a com plete coast line. The whole system is to be opened fifty miles at a time, and any commu nity desiring to connect with the lines first built may do so, and their lines, if built as required by the Postmaster-General, may be accepted by him and paid f<r. Sumner's maximum rates on these lines is 10 cents for the first ten words, and 5 cents for each addi tional ten words. His maximum press rate, uniform all over the country, is '20 cents per 100 words. In the transmission of letters, the use of stamps, the riehts of correspond ence, secrecy, etc., the bill is similar to that of Senator Hill. The low bond is designed to place the loan in the bands of the people of the country, Chinese Restriction. Washington, December 7th. — The repre sentatives of the Pacific coast generally ex press the opinion that President Arthur, in his message, had not laid sufficient stress on the bad faith of the Chinese Government in carrying out restrictions. Many Demo cratic members of the lower house express the same opinion. Tbe way in which the fraud ulent Canton certificates have landed bogus traders, merchants and students in San Fran cisco is believed on all sides to have been a willful violation of the treaty and the re striction law, to which the President should have give more than the pausing notice he ac corded it. A bill willS-ie presented to the House at an early day, providing for the en forcement of the immigration regulations of the treaty. The Democrats of the Cali fornia delegation, it is believed, will take this bill up and champion it as a political measure of importance. Mexican Veterans. Washington, December 7tb.— The tenth annual reunion of the National Ascociation of the Veterans of the Mexican War began yesterday, with a large attendance. General Denver, the President of the Association, called the assembly to order and introduced Captain Merritt, who delivered an eloquent address of welcome, which was responded to by General Denver. General Kosecrans spoke hopefully of the prospects of se curing pensions to the veterans. Various committees were appointed, and the following officers were elected for the ensuing year: President, General Denver ; First Vice- President, General MausoD ; Secretary, A. M. Kennedy; Treasurer, S. V. Nile?. Reso lutions were adopted reciting that the survi vors of the Mexican war never received the reward due to citizen soldiers, and in the opinion of the Convention they should be placed upon the pension roll on an equality with the survivors of 1812 Copies of the resolutions were sent to the President, Sena tors and Representative*. Treasury Estimate*. Washington, December 7th.— Secre tary et the Treasury has transmitted to Con gress estimates for the appropriations for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1885. The amount estimated to be required for all the expenses of the Government is (283,125 305, which is (22,323 282 less than the aggregate of the appropriations for the present fiscal year, and (57,154,857 less than the sum called for in the estimates submitted last year. The appro . priations for the present fiscal year, including deficiencies and miscellaneous, amounted to 135,587, The estimates on which these appropriations were based called for (340, --280,102. * The Farmers' Congress. Louisville, December 7th. — The Farmers' Congress > esterday agreed oa a constitution and by-laws, stating the object of the organ ization to be to advance the agricultural in terests of the country ; to be composed of the .me number of members as the National Congrere, one member from each State Agri cultural College, all the head* of bureaus of agriculture of each State and the United States to be ex officio members. Governors are requested to appoint delegates each year by April Ist. The Committee on Resolutions reported a series, which were adopted. They demand a Commissioner of Agriculture in the Cabinet, ask for a Bureau of Statistics, urge farmer* and mechanics to take steps to be represented at the World's Exposition at New Orleans, urging farmers to raise a va riety of crops, favoring an annual Exposition in this city, and empowering the President of the Congress to ask the passage of a law by i the National" Congress incorporating the Farmers' Congress with usual powers. Much of the session was devoted to debate on the resolutions. Colonel Robert Beverley, of Virginia, was elected President for the ensu ing year, with one Vice President from each State : T. B. Nail, of Kentucky, Secretary ; J. I>. Guthrie, of Kentucky, Treasurer. Ad journed until to-day. t'eniß* of Message Reader*. New York, December 7th. — A Tim,, re porter yesterday asked 324 persons in this city|whether they had read the President's message. Among the parlies interviewed were merchants, bankers. Government and city officers, lawyers and traders generally. It was ascertained that i f 324 citizens, 105 had read it, 96 frankly slid they had not read it, 38 weakly promised themselves a study of the document by and by, 30 skimmed and 50 read the newspaper criticisms. This imper fect census probably represents a fair picture of the attitude cf average citizens towards the message. Catholicism In California. Chicago, December 7th. — Father Kale, of St. Mary's, Father Henneberry, of St. James', and others of the local Catholic j clergy who acted as an escort to Bishop Kinr dan on his trip to his new charge in San Francisco, reached home yesterday. "How did you like San Francisco?" asked a reporter of Rev. Father Roles. " Very much, indeed. I must say that the growth of Catholicism has been wonder ful there — much that it astonished me." " I suppose, then, that the diocese out there is a very wealthy one." " Ob, yes, indeed ; a very rich diocese. It takes in all of California, I should say ; but San Francisco is, of course, the main body, We visited Eos Angeles and other California towns, and were everywhere surprised at the progress being made by our people," " How are the schools there ':'' " Grand. In some of them I fairly blushed. Their school system is a wonderful one." " Did you stop anywhere on your way back !" " Ota ! yes ; we visited Salt Lake, and it would take me a week to tell yon all we saw there. Then we went down by way cf the Southern Pacific to Mexico, visiting Chihua hua and other points. The schools down there amount to nothing, and the people ap pear to think they can grow up in ignorance and be taught all that is necessary by their priests ; but the railroads are improving the country in every way." . The Pacific Coast Delegation la Congress. Washington, December 7th. — The Pacific Slope Representatives held a meeting this morning in the room of the Senate Committee on the Revision of laws to discuss matters af fecting the interests of the coast people. There were present Senators Miller, Slater and Dolpb, the entire California delegation in the House if Representatives, George, of Oregon, and Cassidy, of Nevada. Senator Miller was chosen Chairman of the meeting, and Representative Sumner Secretary. An informal interchange of views respecting the needs of the Pacific Coas', as regards appro priations for rivers and harbor?, public build ings and legislation on the Chinese question, followed. It was apparent that the members needed to formulate their opiriens more con cisely before any definite plan of operations could be agreed upon, and the meeting ad journed, subject to the call of the Chairman. Another conference will be held in a few days. Senate Committees. _ Washington, December 7th.— Repub lican Senatorial Committee, appointed to arrange the committees of the Senate, will give the Chairmanship of the Foreign Rela tions to Miller, of California, and the Post offices and Post Roads to Hill, of Colorado, Senator Bowen is spoken of for the Chair manship of the Mines and Mining. No change has been made in the Chairmanship of the Finance Committee. Tariff Legislation. ! I Washington, December 7th.—Representa tive 11:. of Onis is anxiously awaiting the formation of the House committees, in order to begin a crusade against the tariff. Hurd will undoubtedly be one of the members of the Ways and Means Committee, and he says a bold and aggressive warfare will be waged by the majority against high protective duties. It is said, remarked the correspond ent, "That the majority in the House will pursue a conservative policy, and that the existing tariff system will not materially be disturbed." "Wait until the Ways and Means Committee is announced," an swered Hard, " and then you can judge what sort of a tariff legislation is likely to engage the attention of Con gress for four or five months of the session. I do not think any general tariff bill will be brought forward, but we will ask for free salt, free lumber, free sugar, free barbed wire, free copper, etc ; and, if our bill is defeated, the country will know where the responsi bility belongs." " D i you propose to include all of them in one bill, or to present separate bills covering a single subject ?" "My preference is for single bills ; but I do not know how the matter will be arranged. I shall introduce a bill for free wool at the earliest opportunity. I do not think that any of my Democratic colleagues from Ohio will vote for such a measure, but I intend to push it. I repudiate that section of our State platform that condemned the action of last Congress for reducing the duty on wool. I was elected by a majority of 1,400, my constituents understanding that 1 favored free wool. Years ago I fa vored free wool. We had a i greenback craze, four years ago, that worked more harm to tbe party than anything that has happened of late years, and I now find men who were clamoring for soft money rais ing their voices for protection. Our Michi gan men were elected on a free lumber and salt issue, and I think it will be wise to join these two items in a single bill. There are many protectionists who will vote to make those articles free. Seven-tenths of the peo ple of Louisiana want free sugar. The in dustry in the South has been warning for years past, and I do not believe it is right to longer continue a tariff on those articles to the great injury of the people of the whole ountry." Speaker Carlisle. Views on the Tariff Question. Baltimore. December 7th — The Sun this morning publishes the following authorized statement of Carlisle's views on the tariff question : Carlb-li knows the present law is not a reform of the old law ; therefore he fa vors its revision, believing that at least the reduction of 20 per cent, recommended by the Tariff Commissioners should be made, and that the increased rates of duty, by which the promised objects of the bill of last season were perverted, should be reformed. He says it is the duty of this Congress to fulfill the broken promises of the last, and ] there is no c'anior against the needed action except from those who succeeded in reaping undue advantage from the last revision. The Calamity In the Straits of Sunda. Boston, December — The bark William H. Besse and the ship Anabuac arrived this morning, the former from Manila and the latter from Calcutta. The former had a voy age of 195 and the latter 139 days. Captain Baker, of the former, Bays his bark was di rectly in the vicinity of Anjiers at the time of the terrible disaster which killed thousands and changed the face of the land in and around Sunda Straits. He left Batavia Au gust 16r-h, and the following morning at day light those on deck noticed a heavy bank riling from the west and obscuring the sun. At this time the barometer dropped to '29.40. and again suddenly rose to 30.70. All hands were called and sail taken off as fast as possi ble. A heavy shower ef sand and ashes com- ' menced falling, completely covering tbe decks, masts and spars to a depth of several inches, By noon it had grown darker than the darkest night, and the wind commenced to blow a hurricane ; but, 1 strange to say, the sea remained perfectly smooth. Heavy rumblings, like dis tant thunder, were continually heard, and at intervals the sky was lighted up by lightning flashes, and a string smell of sulphur t Tint > ated the atmosphere and made it difficult to breathe. All bands were affected by this awful scene, and many of tbe sailors thought tie world was coming to an end. Throughout the gale tbe tide set strongly to the west i ward, and the bark drove through the water at the rate of fourteen knots per hour. At 3 p. M. the sky commenced to grow a little lighter, hut thr ashes continued to fall like snow. The following day the bark entered the Straits of Sunda, and the extent of the dam age done was plainly to bs seen. Whole islands had ei-nk, and those that remained had changed in form. The northwestern part ot Krakatia Island tad disappeared, and Verelaeia and Ling Island—here tofore covered with trees — were com pletely bare. They saw a very large number of dead bodies, and the water for miles was covered with trees and dead bodies. The sea for 800 miles was a field of lava. They experienced* hurricane from the north northeast, with a tremendous sea, which lasted three days. During this time the decks and cabin were flooded with water, and a portion of the bulwarks and everything moveable on deck was washed away. The most fearful thing of all was the sea of corpses. For nearly three days we came across body after body of persons who had lost their lives in the earthquake. One man . alone counted Bixty in plain sight. Thousands j must have perished. Violent Storm or Snow and Wild. Dexter (Col.), December 7th. — A snow and wind storm visited this section Wednes day night, which, in its disastrous effects, is without parallel in the history of Colorado.

Barbarous Treatment of Nihil!*! Prison ers. London, December 7th. — A Paris corre spondent forwards a second letter written in blood by a Nihilist in the fort at St. Peters burg. It describes the harrowing treatment of the prisoners. The prisoners rot awaj and exhale the odors of dead bodies before life is extinct. The number of those who go mad in consequence of their sufferings is daily in creasing. Madmen are strapped down and whipped with knouts by the keepers, and fierce yells resound throughout the night. Many prisoners have committed suicide. It is said one woman was outraged and then poisoned. Inquiries into the affair have been instituted. Rats are the worst enemies of the prisoners. A woman with a babe was obliged to be '. constantly on the watch, and fight night and day to prevent the rats from devouring her child. The use of combs and soap is forbid den. The prisoners, especially the women, whose hair is allowed to grow, are literally devoured by lice. Prisoners who refuse re ply to questions are tortured, and cases of the violation of women are frequent. The writer especially appeals to the civilized world in behalf of the women in prison, whose situation, he says, is far worse than the men's.

San Francisco, December 7ch. — In the Sharon divorce case to-day, on the question of the defendant's objection to the jurisdic tion of the Superior Court, on the ground that the case had been transfered to the United States Circuit Court, Judge Finn de cided that his Court retained jurisdiction, and the case must be placed on the calendar for trial. The case of William M.

San Francisco, December 7th.— A meet ing of the State Board of Silk Culture was held today, at which the annual reports were read. The only suggestion they contained was with reference to the offer of John Sell ers, of Brentford, to lease to the Society a tract of eight acres of land, containing 17, --000 mulberry trees, at $20 per acre. The matter was referred to a committee, with power to act. O.her reports show the Soci ety to be in a flourishing condition. Pupils are in daily attendance at the filature room, and the silk reeled by them is fit for exam ination by exp'rts. Tne committee, at the request of the Central Pacific, has furnished the road with three bunches of reeled silk, three boxes of sewing silk raised here, and a lot of cocoons, to he placed on exhibition in London and San Francisco, H.

He is married and has two children. Co! ton vs. Stanford. Santa Kosa, December 7th. — On the open ing of Court this morning, Judge Temple de cided the points raised in last night's argu ment. He ruled that defendant's counsel had the right to state their case in their own way, and that the proposed amendment to the answer should therefore be allowed. The admission of the Hopkins' inventory and ap praisement into evidence was likewise al lowed, and plaintiff's counsel thereupon read such portions of it as went to show the then values of the Central Pacific and Southern Pacific stccks and bonds. After the intro duction of several other papers, counsel com menced the reading of S. M. Wilson's deposi tion, which is a volume of 200 octave pages cf printed matter. Recess. [SECOND DISPATCH.) Santa Kosa, December 7th. — After recess tha reading of Mr. Wilson's deposition was resumed. It showed that in all the transac tions culminating with the compromise of August 27. 1879, he was the friend and ad viser of Mrs. Colton as against these defend ants ; that from the month of March, 1879, he was a painstaking and energetic worker in her behalf ; that the defendants themselves were desirous of clearing the memory of their form* r associate, and made him an offer of $10,000 as an inducement to further efforts in that behalf; that clerks, employes, records and every source of information was placed at his disposal, with permission to bring his experts to examine them, and that despite the most thorough research on bis part he was unable to explain the charges preferred against General Colton. The reading of the deposition was then suspended. Early in the week defendants' counsel pro posed to amend their answer so ss to bring in a transaction of General Colton'e, in which he undertook to purchase for himself and the defendants the Arroyo Saco raccho, now known as the lone Coal and Iron Company's property. This afternoon they proposed to file that amendment, from which it appears that Mr. Colton, acting as tbe agent of de fendants and Mark Hopkins, who was then living, did purchase that property, and that he reported the cost of the purchase at $336, --332, subj»ct to a mortgage of $84,000, or a total of $450,332, when in truth the property only cost $314,332.
