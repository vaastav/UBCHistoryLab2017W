A method which his *o approved itself by experluientul tests at points where such ( tests maybe fairly considered conclusive, should , lie extended to all subordinate positions under the Government. I believe that a strong and growing public sentiment demands Immediate measures for securing and enforcing ihe highest possible efficiency in the civil service, and its pro- i Section fbom reccgnized abuses, and that the ex terience refeired to has demonstrated the fcasi ility of such measures. The examinations in the custom houses and post-offices have been held uu- ! dermany einbarra*sments and without provision flbrcomjHUisation for the extra labor performed by 1 the officers who have conducted them, and whose | commendable interest in the public service has in duced this devotion of time and labor without pe- | cuniarv reward. A continuance of these labors < gratuitously ought not to he expected; and. with- j •at appropriation by Congress for compensation, j It is not practical to extend the system ofexami- . ■attocif genendlv throughout the civil service. It j laaiMn highly important that all such examinations Should be conducted upon a uniform system and a general supervision. Section 1751 of the It vised statutes authorizes the to presc ihe the regulations for admission to the civil scivlce af the United States, and far this purpose to em pl«>y auitable persons to conduct the requisite in quiries with reference to •• the flrnes* <»r each c.in- Hab' ' respect to age. health, character, knowl —id ability for the branch of set vice into «a seeks to enter." But the law U practi cally inoperative for want of the requisite anpr » I prtation. I therefore recommend an appropriation •fSSS.OOO per annum to meet the exjienses of a | commission to l>e appointed by the rreai<lent in , accordance with the terms of t is section, whose duty it shall be to devise a ju*t. uniform and eftl cient system of corn(>etitivc examination, and to : supervise the application of the same throughout | Ihe entire civil service of the Government. 1 am ' persuaded that the facilities which such a commie- i iion will afford for the testing of the fitness of those 1 whoapplf for office will not only be as welcome u | relief to membet* of Congress, as ;t will be to the Presidents and heads of departments; bat that it 1 will also greatly teud to remove the causes of em- J lmrasament which now inevitably and constautly attend the conflicting claims of patronage between | the legislative and executive departments. The I ■lost effectual check upon the pernicious competi- j lion of influence and official favoritism in the be- ; atowal of office will be the substitution of an open , ■ompetition of merit between the applicants in , which everyone can make his own record with , iha assurance that his success will depend upon tikis alone. { 1 alao recommend such legislation as, while leav feg ever V officer aa free as any other citizen to axpreaa his lsilltloai opinion anl to u<e hie means far Its advancement, shall also enable hlin to feel aa safe as any private citizen in the refusal of all demands upon his salary for political purposes. A law which should thus guarantee tru „ | jbt-rty and lattice to all engaged iu the public service, and lkewite certain stringent provisions against the ■aa of official authority to coerce the political ac tion af private citizens or of official subordinates, is greatly t"> bo desired. The most serious obsta cle, however, loan improvement or civil service •ad especially 'o rc'orm In the method of appoint ment and removal has been found to be the prac tice tinder what la known as the •• spoils system." hy which the appointing power has been so largely encroached upon by members of Congress. The tret step In the reform of the civil service must he a complete divorce b itween Congress and the Ex •cativeln the matter of appointments. The cor niptlng doctrine that •' to the viciors belong the •polls, la Inaeparnble from Congressional patron age at the established rule and practice of parties ia power. It seems to be understood by applicants fee office and by the people generally that Kepre sentatlvea and Senators are entitled to disburse the patronage of their respective Districts ami States. It is not necessary to recite at length the evils re tilting from this invasion of the executive fitno ttaaa. The true principles of Government on the Subject of appointments to office, as stated in tho aatfonal conventions of the leading partiea of the •onntry. have again and again hern approved by the American people and have not been called in ques tion In any quarter. These authentic expressions af pnblic opinion upon this all important subject, irwthe statement of principles that belong to the «iUu*lonal structure of the Government. Un ' -r the Constitution, the President and heads of ..." m ints are to tnake nominal ionts for office, li t .senate ia to advise and consent to appoint - - s. and the House of Representatives is to ac .so an I prosecute faithless officers. The best itt wrest of the pnblic service demands thai these dis tawtbus be respected; thai Senators and ltepre v mntivea whomay be judges and accusers, should •;i dictate appoirtinents to office. To this end fee co-operation ol the legislative dc artmcut •f the Government is requested, alike by the ue •emities cf the case, and that by public examina tion, members of Congress will be relieved front the demands made upon them with reference to appointments to office, until by legislative enact ment the pernicious practice Is c mdctuued and forbidden. It is therefore recommended that an act be passed detning the relations of members of Congress with respect to appointments to office by the President, and I also recommend that the pro visions of section 17f>7 and of the sections following •f the Revised Statutes, comprising the tenure of •fflce act of March 3d. ltslT. be repealed. Believing that to re Conn the system anil methods ; •f the civil sendee in our count; y to he one of the , highest and most imperative duties of statesman- : •hip, and that R can be permanently done only liy ; (he cooperation of the legislative an 1 executive de partments of the Oovernuieot. I again recommend (be whole subject to your considerate attention. COMMincE A Nit NAVtuATIOV. Tlie attention of Congress is Invited to the ne cessary appropriations for carrying into operation the schemes to enlarge the trade and commerce of the United States through the active agency of consoler officers and through the diss munition of information obtained from them. There lias been on relaxed interest iu these efforts as developed in oar commercial communities, and the value of in formation secured by this ineuns to the trade and manufactures of the country were recognized by Congress at its ta-t session, and provision was made for more frequent publication of consular and other reports by the Departmen of State. The first issue of this publication has now been tire pared, and subsequent issues may regularly be ex pected. The importance and interest attached tu reports of consul ir officers are witnessed by a gen eral demand for them by all classes of merchants and manufacturers engaged in our foreign trade. It is bc'ievcd that a system of such publications are deserviug of the upprirvu! of t'migress ai d the necessary appropriation for iis i .ui imiauce and cn largt ment will commend itself to your considera tion. The prosperous energies oi our domestic industries and their immense prediction of sub jects of foreign commerce invite and even require active development. It is especially important that our commercial re lations with the Atlantic and Pacific coasts ..f south America, with the West Indies and liulfof Mexico should be direct and not through a circuit of a Ktt ropeun system, and should tie carried in our bot toms. full appreciation of the <>p|iortu;iitie- which our front on the Pacific ocean gives to commcicc with Japan, China and the East Indies, with Austra lia a ,d the island grotipes which lay along these routes of navigation, should inspire equal efl'orts to appropriate! to our shipping ami to administer bv our own cipital a due proportion of this trade Whatever mod ifications of our regulations of tnd.-urol navigation may be iiceessarv < r it- till t-> meet and direct llu-sc impulses to tie- en largement of our oxehaiig- . at: I - our carrying trade, iam -uri the wisdom of 4'< inure** will r»*.«lv t» siipi lv. nm •f initial nit asiiiv. h<>\\• v< t. si « m** t • m<-*•< clearly useful and •• 11 i<*i«• nt tti.it I v ntur« li'l it \ • iir <.tin<M a«'• liti'-ii.

Tin' matter demands public administration, and thus pertaining to the (fovermncnt, ; ! resjH»etfully recommend to your prompt attention such just and eflteient measures as may conduce to tic* development of our foreign commercial exchanges and building tip our currying trade. In tills connection, I desire ills/? to .suggest a very great service which might he expected in enlarging and facilitating our cjommeree <»n the Pacific ocean were a trans-marine cable laid from San Francisco to the Sand wich islands, and thence to Japan at the : North and Australia at tin* South. The 1 great influence of such means of commun ication on these routes of navigation in I developing ami securing a du j sliare for our Pacific Coast in the commerce of the world needs no illustration or enforce ment. It may be that such an enterprise, useful and in the end profitable as it would prove to private investment, may need to he accelerated by nrudent legisla tion by Congress in its aid, and I sun nit the matter to vour careful consideration. All atiilltioual and not unimportant, altli 

IUII secuniiary reason for fostering alio enlarging tin) navy, may lie foil ml in the unquestionable Hitrviee to tile ex pansion of our eoiiiinerce, which wouhl be reniiereil by frequent circulation of naval ships in the seas and ports of all quarters of the globe. Ships of proper construction and equipment, to lie of tlie greatest ellieieney in case of a maritime war, might bo m tdo constant and active agents in lime of peae • in the advanei ment and protection ot our foreign trade and in the nurture and diseiplineof young seamen, who would natnrallv in some numbers mix with and improve the crews of our merchant ships. Our merchants at home ami abroad recognize the value to foreign commerce of an active (iovern inent. Our naval vessels and the intelli gence and patriotic zeal of our naval otlieprs in promoting every interest of their countrymen is a just subject for national pride. FOREIGN Rtif.ATIONS. Our relations with all foreign countries have been those of undisturbed peace, and have presented no occasion for concern as to their continued maintenance. My anticipation of an early reply from the Briiish government to a demand of indemnity to our fisherman for injuries suffered by that industry at Fortune Bay in January, 1878, which 1 expressed in mv last annual message, was disappointed. This answer was received only in the latter part of April in the present year, and when received exhibited a failure of accord lic tween the two governments as to the meas ure of inshore fishing privileges secured to our fishermen by the treaty of Washington, and of so serious a character that I made it the subject of a communication to Con gress, in which I recommended the adop tion ot measures which seemed to me proper to he taken by this government in the maintenance of the rights accorded our fishermen under the treaty and towards se curity of indemnity for the injury theSC in terests had suffered. A bill to carry out these recommendations was under consid eration by the house of representatives at the time of the adjournment of Congress in June last. Within a few weeks I have re. ceLved a communication from her majesty's government renewing consideration of the subject, botli of indemnity for injuries at Fortune Bay and of interpretation of the treaty, in which the previous correspond ence had shown the two governments to be at variance. Upon ltotli of these topics disposition toward friendly agreement is manifested by a recognition of our right to indemnity for the transaction at Fortune Bay, leaving the measure of such indem nity to a further conference; and, by an assent to the views of this government pre scribed in previous correspondence, that the regulation of conflicting interests of the shore fishery of the provincial sea coasts and the vessel fishery of our fisher men should he made the subject of confer ence and coucurrent arrangement between the two governments. I sincerely hope that a basis may be found for a speedy ad justment of the very serious divergence of views on the interpretation of the fishery clauses of the treaty of Washington, which, as the correspondence between the two governments stood at the close of the last session of Congress, seemed irreconcilable. In the important exhibition of arts and industries which was held last year at Sydney, New South Wales, as we'll as in that now in progress at Melbourne, the United States have la-en efficiently and honorably represented. Exhibitors' from this country at the former place received a large number of awards in some of the most considerable departments, and partici pation of the United States was recognized by a special mark of distinction. In the exhibition at Melbourne the share taken by our country is no less notable and an equal degree of success is confidently ex pected. The state of peace and tranquillity now enjuyetl by all the nations of the continent of Europe has its favorable intluence upon our diplomatic and commercial relations with them. We have concluded and rati fied a convention with the French republic for the settlement of claims of the citizens of either country against the other. Un der this convention a commission presided over by a distinguished publicist ap pointed in pursuance of the request of both nations by his majesty the Emperor of Brazil, lias been organized and lias lie. gun its session in this city. A Congress to consider means tor the protection < t in dustrial property has recently been in ses sion in Paris, to which 1 have appointed the ministers ot the United States in Franco and Belgium as delegates. The in ternational commission upon weights a id measures also continues its work in Pari-. I invite your attention to the necessity oi an appropriation to be made to enable' this government to comply with its obligation under the material convention.

The wrong was brought to the attention of the Spanish government in serious protest and remonstrance, and tin- matter is under going investigation bv the royal authori ties with a view to such explanation or rep aration as may he called for by the facts. The commission sitting in this city for ad judication of claims ot our citizens against the government of Spain, is, I hope, ap proaching the termination of its labors Claims against the ITiited Slates under the Florida treaty with Spain, were submitted to Congress for its action at the late ses sion, and 1 again invite your attention to thi-. I<hiir standing question willi a view of tinal disposition of the matter. At the invitation of the Spanish govern ment a conference has recently lieen held at tlie* city of Madrid to consider the sub ject of protection by foreign powers of na tive Moors in the empire of Morocca. The minister of the I'liited Siates in Spain was directed to lake part in the deliberations of this conference, the result of which is a convention signed on behalf of all the pow - ers represented. The instmmcnt will he laid before the Senate for its consideration. The government of the United States lias also lost no opportunity to urge upon that of the Kmperor of Morocco the necessity, in accordance with the humane an en lightened spirit of the age. or putting an end to the persecutions which have been so prevalent in that country of persons of a faith other than Moslem, and especially of Hebrew residents of Morocco. An attempt to negotiate a treaty of ex tradition with Denmark failed on account of the objection of the Danish government to the usual c lause, providing that each government should pay the expense of ar rest of prisoners whose extradition it asks. The provision made by Congress at its last session for the expenses of a commis sion which has been appointed and en tered upon negotiations with the imperial government of China, on subjects of great interest to the relations of two countries, enabled the commissioners to proceed at once upon their mission. The imperial government was prepared to give prompt and respectful attention to the matters brought under negotiation, and the con ferences proceeded with such rapidity and progress that on the 17th of November last, two treaties were signed at Pekin, one re lating to the introduction of Chinese into this country and one relating to com merce. Mr. Trescott, one of the commis sioners, is now on the way home, bringing the treaties, and it is expected that they will be received in season to be laid before tin: Senate early in January. Our minister in Japan has negotiated a convention for the reciprocal relief of ship-wrecked seamen. I take occasion to urge once more upon Congress tire pro priety of making provision for the erection of suitable fire-proof buildings at the Japa nese eapital for tiie use of the American legation, and a court ho use and jail con nected with it. The Japanese government, with great generosity and courtesy, has of fered for this purpose an eligible piece of land, in my annual message 1 called the attention of Congress to the subject of in demnity funds received some years ago from China and Japan. I renew the re commendation then made, that whatever portions of these funds are due to Ameri can citizens should be promptly paid ami the residue returned to the nations respec tively to which they justly and equitably belong. The extradition treaty with the king dom of the Netherlands, which has been for some time in the course of negotiation, lias during the past year been conceded and duly ratified. Relations of friendship and amity have been established between the government of the United States and that of lioumania. We have sent a diplomatic representative to Bucharest and have received at this capital a special envoy, who has been charged by his royal highness, Prince Charles, to announce the independent sov ereignty of Koumania. We hope for a speedy" development of commercial rela tions between the two countries. Iu my last annual message I expressed the hope that the prevalence of quiet on the border between this country and Mex ico would soon become so assured us to justify a modification of orders then in force to our military commanders in re gard to crossing the frontier without en couraging such disturbances as would en danger the peace of the two countries. Events moved in accordance with these ex pectations and the orders were accordingly withdrawn to the entire satisfaction of our own citizens and the Mexican government. Subsequently the peace of the border was again disturbed by a savage force under j the command of Chief Victoria, but by the I continued and harmonious net ion of the military forces of both countries his band has been broken up and subsequently de : stroyed. There i*> reason to believe that | obstacles which have so long prevented i rapid and convenient communication be ; tween the United States and Mexico by I railways are on the point of disappearing, I ami that several important enterprises of i 111 is character will soon be set on foot ! which cannot fail to contribute largely to tlie prosperity of this country, j New envoys from tiuatemala, Columbia, !

In the course of the war some questions have arisen nti'crting neutral rights. In till, the ministers of the United States have under their instructions acted with prompt ness and energy in tin- protection of Atner ican interests. The relations of the Tnited States with the empire of Braz.il continue to lie most cordial, and their commercial intercourse steadily increases to their mutual ndvan tajre. The internal disorders with which the Argentine republic lias for some time past been atllieteii, and which have more or less influenced its internal trade, are understood to have been brought to a close. This hap py results may he expected to redound to the benefit of the foreign coin meree of that republic as well as to the tie velopment of its vast interior resources. In the Samoa government, King Malic toa is under the support and recognition of consular representatives. The l'nite.l States, Great Britain and Germany seem to have given peace and tran.piility to the islands. While it does not seem desirable to adopt as a whole the scheme of tripertile local government which litis been proposed the common interests of three great treaty powers require harmony in their relations to the native forms of government, and this may he best secured by simplv diplomatic agreement between them. It would he well if the consular jurisdiction of our rep. reseutlitives at Opia were increased in ex tent and importance, so as to guard Ameri can interests in the surrounding and outly ing lands of < ioetmiea. The obelisk generously presented by the Khedive of Egypt to the city of New York has safely arrived in this country, and will be erected in that metropolis. A commis sion for tbe liquidation of tbe Egyptian debt has lately concluded its work, and this government, at the earnest solicitation of the Khedive, lias acceded to the provisions adopted by it, which will be laid before j congress tor its information. A commis sion for the revision of tin- judicial code for the reform of the tribunal of Egypt is now in session in Cairo. Mr. Forman, consul general, and J. M. Hatelu-lder, Esq., have been appointed as commissioners to par ticipate in this work. The organization of reform tribunals will probably be contin ued for another period of live years. In pursuance of an act passed at tin-last session of congress, invitations have been extended to foreign maritime states to join . in a sanitary conference in Washington, beginning on the. first of January. The ac ceptance of this invitation by many promi nent powers gives promise of success in this important measure, designed to estab lish a system of international regulations by which the spread of infectious or epi demic diseases may be more effectively checked or prevented. THE 

MIBBISSII-1-I AND OOU'MItI.V HIVEItS. The two great rivers of the North Amer ican continent, tin- Mississippi and the Co lumbia, have their navigable waters whol ly within the limits of the United States, and arc of vast importance to our internal and foreign commerce. The permanency of important work in the south pass of the Mississippi river seems now to lie assured. There has been no failure whatever in the maintenance of the maximum channel dur ing the six months ending August 'Jtli last. This experiment has opened a broad, deep highway to the ocean, and is an improve ment upon the permanent success of which congratulations may be exchanged among people abroad and at home, and especially among communities of the Mississippi val ley, whose commercial exchanges (hint in an unobstructed channel safely to and from the sea. Comprehensive improvement of the Mississippi and its tributaries is a mat ter of transcendent importance. These great water ways comprise a system of in land transportation spreading like network over a large portion of the United States, and are navigable to the extent of many thousands of miles. Producers and eon", sumers alike have common interest in such unequalled facilities for cheap transporta tion. Geographically, commercially and politically they arc the strongest tie be tween various sections of tbe country. These channels of communication and in terchange are the property of tin- nation. Its jurisdiction is paramount over their wa ters and the plainest principles of public interest require tlit-ir intelligent and care ful supervision with a view to their pro tection, improvement and the enhance ment of their usefulness. Tbe channel of the Columbia river for a distance of about one hundred miles from its mouth, is ob obstrueted bv a .succession of bars which I occasion serious delays in the navigation ; and heavy expense for lighterage and tow -1 age. A depth of at least twenty feet at low j tid" should he secured and maintained to - meet the requirements of tin-extensive and I growing inland and oeeau commerce it - subserves. The most urgent need, however j for this great water way, is a permanent ; improvement of die channel at the mouth 'of tin- river. From tbe Columbia river to San Francisco, a distance of six hundred miles, there is no harbor on the Pacific coast which can be approached in stormy weatlnr.

The report of the postmaster general ex hibits continued growth and a high state of etlleieticy of the postal service. The op i-ralions of no department of the govet—- liient, perhaps, represent with greater e\ aetness the increase in population and bus. iness of the country. In IMOO. postal re ceipts were tjts.tNNI.OIHI. In lsso, the re ceipts were |:i:1,:i10.47!t. All inhabitants of the country are directly and personally interested in having proper mail facilities and naturally watch the pnstullli-e very closely. This careful oversight on the part of the people lias proved a constant stiiiiu bis to improvement. During the past year there was a increase of glltl poslolliees, and the mail routes w ere extended 'J7.177 miles, making an additional annual tiin-porla tion of 10,S04,1!I1 miles. The revenues of the postal service for the ensuing year arc estimated at $->H,54."i,171, and expenditures at leaving a deficiency to ln appropriatcd out of the treasury ol s:i,tWO , tioi. The universal postal union has received tin- accession of almost all the countries and colonies of the world, maintaining an organized postal service, and it is confi dently expected that all other countries and colonies now outside of the union will soon unite herewith, thus realizing the grand idea and aim of the founders of the union of forming for the purpose of international mail communication a single postal terri tory embracing the world with complete uniformity of postal charges and condi tions of international exchange for all dc scriptions of correspondence. To enable the United States to do its full share in this great work additional legislation is asked by the postmaster general, to whose recom mendation especial attention is called. Tin suggestion ol the postmaster general that it would lie wise to encourage by appropriate legislation the establishment of American lines of steamers by our own citizens to carry mails between our own ports anil those of Mexico, Central Amcirea, South America, and of trans -l'acilic countries is commended to the serious consideration of congress.

NEEDED. The secretary of the interior links atten tion to the want of room in the public buildings of the capital now existing and in course of construction for the accommo dation of the clerical force employed on public records. Necessity has compelled the renting of private buildings in differ ent parts of the city for the location of pub lic otlices, for which a large amount of rent is annuall paid, while tin; separation of otlices belonging to the same department impedes the transaction of current business The secretary suggests that blocks adjoin ing Lafayette square on the east, north and west be purchased as a site for new editlces for the accommodation of government of fice's, leaving the square itself intact, and that if such buildings were constructed up on a harmonious plan of architecture, thev would add much beauty to the nation's capital, and would together with the treas tiry and new state, navy and war depart ment buildings form one of the most im posing groups of public edifices in the world.

TIIK COM MISSION Kit OF AUlti ('ii/rtHK. The commissioner of agriculture ex. presses a confident belief that his efforts in behalf of the production of our own sugar and teas have been encouragingly reward ed. The importance of the results attained have attracted marked attention at home and have received special consideration from foreign nations. The successful cul tivation of our own ten and manufacture of our own sugar would make a dill'ercnee of many million dollars annually in the wealth of the nation. The commissioner asks attention particu larly to the continued prevalence of infec tious and contagious cattle diseases known and dreaded in Kurope and Asia as the cat tie plague or plcuro pneumonia. A mild type of this disease in certain sections of our country is the occasion of great loss to our trade with (treat Britain, which turn islies a market for most of our live stock ami dressed nu-als. The value of meat cat tle exported from the I'niled Slates for the eight months ending Aug. 111, |ssn, was more than tjtlg.linO.ooi), and nearly double the value tor the same period in PS7U, an urn xamph d increase of export trade. Your early attention is solicited to this import ant matter. 

TIIK niSTItliT OF Col,l M 111 I again commend the general interests ol'th" District of ('olumbia to the favorable consideration ot congress. The a (fairs of the district as shown by the report of the commissioners.arc in a very satisfactory condition. In my annual message hereto fore, and in my special lues.age of Dec. to, IS7H, I have urged upon lie attention of congress the necessity ii claiming the marshes of the l'otomae adjacent to the capital, and again I am constrained by its importance to advert to them again. These llats embrace an area of several hundred acres. They are an impediment to tlm drainage of the city iitid seriously impair its health. It is believed that with this substantial improvement of it- riverfront the capital Would be in a all respects one of the most attractive cities in the world. Aside from its permanent population, this city is necessarily a place of residence of persons l'r nil ce. i v - ■ lion ol lie counter engaged in the public service.
