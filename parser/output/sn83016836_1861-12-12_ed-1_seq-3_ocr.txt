W had intended issuing the President's message in an extra so as to supply our city subscribers, and send it up country by Tuesday morning's mails, but as it was not telegraphed to S Paul did not get it until late Monday night, then, as there wrere no upward mails until Saturday the •extra would not pay. PORK.—Immenso quantities of prime fresh pork are brought to town from the country. I would bear eomparrison wi tli that raised anywhere. The price ranges from $2,75 to $3,50 per cwt. Some of our merchants are bushy engaged in paeking. "WOOD.—While this article, of the best quality, is a drug in the market, at 81,50 per cord and while we have some fifty subscribers on our books who have receiv- their paper regularly and as regularly promised to bring wood, "as soon as sled- ding is good," we have not, to the best of our knowledge, being able to obtain one €ord this season, for which we have not paid cash. This state of affairs cannot last long—that is, if we can help'it. W now say to these subscribers, once and for the last time —Sledding is first rate, wood is plenty, and if you do not pay in wood, or something else, within four weeks from this time, your names como off the books, and if you can get another paper for three years as cheap as you have this, you are at liberty to do so. W certainly shall not restrain you The only visopro we make to the above is, that if the weather ahould change so as to render the execu- tion impossible os very difficult, we shall •extend the time. But all old debts must be paid up this winter, at least up to Vol. 4. W do not intend this as a dun of course not: but if these dehnquints do not "pay up,"wc fear they will find, one day, that there is a material capable of producing a good deal hotter fire than wood. "Ven- geance is mine &c." W E A ER &C —I would be an effectu- al silencer on old croakers to see ourfrom "Winter" weather. Here it is, the 12th of December, and the Mississippi river not frozen hard enough to bear teams, and scarcely foot passengers Indeed above Upper town, the river is entirely open But one day yet has the mercury been as low as 20° below zero, and that only for an hour or two in the morning. Most of the time it has been coquetting among the twenties above. Minnesotians grumble at this kind ot treatment, and long for the "happy days gone by," when we could have steady, bracing weather. But appear ances indicate that we may have the de- sired change soon. UB SLEIGHING—Has been excellent. This and the glorious moonlight nights, now in vogue, tempt all who can beg, bor- row or steal a team, to turn out.
