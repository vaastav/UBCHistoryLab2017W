It Is to boliopcd this virtuous determination will not t vapors to beforo tliu 4th of March. The President iudorsoa tho rocoin nicndatlon of tho secretary of tho In torlor In regard to funding thodobtof tho 1'aclflo railroads. Having rocolvod such general approval there seems to bo no good reason why tho funding moas uro should not recolvo legislative atten tion at an early day. m Tun President says tho civil servlco law has fully answered tho oxpeitatlon of its frionds In securing competent and faithful public servants and In protect ing tho appointing officers of tho govern ment from tho pressure of porsonal Im portunity. Tho noxt administration and tho public generally will doubtless bo glad If ns much can bo truthfully said a year hence Ove man was olectou who ran upon tho St. John tlckot. lie ran for tho position of justlco of sessions in New York, and gets tho office becauso it turns out that his opponont, who xocelved all tho votes but 10, is Inellglblo.

Tho ovidenco boforo thd stato board showed conclusively that Lonian had received 300 majority nt tho olcctlon, which had aftorward bcon changed by forgery to 10 majority for Urand.

The ftlcaracua Cnnal. Tho Frcsidont's announcement, in his message that a treaty v 1th the Nlcaroguan government, which authorizes this gov ernment to build, maintain, and forovor control a canal, railroad, and telegraph Hues across that country, has already been concluded roust bo both surprising and gratifying to tho commercial world. It is a surpriso becauso tho negotia tions havo been conducted to success beforo nny ono know they woro being pressed, and gratifying becauso no moro important dlplomatlo enterprise could havo boou undertaken than that which lias now successfully prcparod tho way for a water connection between tho rich territory of tho 1'aclflo slopo and tho great parts of the Atlantic. From other points of view also tho matter is ono of great Import to tho nation. Ono hundred miles of tho projocted on terprleo may bo reported as almost com pleted, as It is furnlshod by tho San Juan river and Lake Nicaragua, which Is forty miles wide and suUlcleutly dcop for tho purpose Tho engineering difficulties to bo overcome in the romalning fifty-three mlka nro not great. When this treaty is ratified tho 1'anama question will cease to demand atttntion if indeed it shall remain a question. A New Street ltalltvoy Ilnll. Tho owners of llghtvohlclcs, tho street car companies, and tho atrangor within our gates will bo glad to bo informed that n tramway rail has been Invonted which not only admirably scrjres tho purposo for which it Is designed, but can bo laid in eucha way as to leu o tho street as smooth as though it was not there A rail of this kind is now In almost general uso In the priuclpat cities of Great Britain, and is fouud to work admirably. Its cost is not greater than that of tho vory objection iblo T rail now in use here; it can bo laid in almost any kind of asphalt, macadam, or ttonu-blork pavement without woodou tics or stringers, and when once laid be comes almost pcimaucnt. Thcro seems thereloro to bo no good roason why tho street-tar companies of tho capital, whose lntorest in picservmg and protecting tho beauty of our atreots is certainly as great as that of any other class of property owners, should not at least roplaeo tho rails now usod with this iieiv piUerii as rapidly as thoy uru compelled to renew their rails.

President Arthur's last stated messago to congress, like his previous moisagos, is a plain, sensible, business documont, In which tho condition and noeds of ovory branch of tho publlo sorvlco aro Bot forth in clear, compact terms. It gives to tho pcoplo a clearly outlined photograph of tho workings of tholr groat complox gov ernmental machine, and withal affords them ovidenco that their sorvants havo well discharged tholr duties during tho past year. Too l'rcsldcnt opens his messago with an allusion to tho ordorly, tompornto, and law. respecting conduct of tha pcoplo dur ing tho exciting days following tho lato cloction, and in that connection urges congross to provide moro prcclso and deflnlto regulations for counting tho doctoral vote. Ho is undoubtedly right whon ho Bays, "I am persuaded that, by tho people at largo, any of tho meas ures of rollof thus far proposod would bo preferred to contluued inaction." But unless congress can approach this subject with moro patriotism and less partisan ship than in tho past tho condition of, in action is likely to continuo. Our relations with foreign powers aro set forth at great length. Tho acquisition of the gnat Ch.ln.esa trading flcot by American citizens leads to tho suggestion that it would bo well to provtdo a uni form rulo for tho registration and docu mentation of ships built or purchased abroad by our citizens and employed ex clusively In traffic between forolgn ports. Tho restoration of tho agency and consu lato general at Cairo Is rccommondod upon good grounds. Negotiations will bo opened with Germany for n treaty of ox tradition, whoso operations will be uni form through all tho states of the empire Tho Important treaties negotiated with Spain and Nicaragua nro appropriately referred to and eongrcss Is notified that nothing Is lacking to mako our trtaty with Mexico cfiectlvo but tho tariff legis lation mado necessary by its torms. Tho President suirgcsts that our neutrality laws need ovorhiiullug and nmondmont so as to cover all patent acts of hostility committed In our territory and aimed against a friendly powor. liovlslou of our naturalization laws is urged bo as to do away with certain obso- loto provisions and euro numerous defocts pointed out. The suggestion of a central bureau "wherein should bo filed authen ticated transcripts of ovory record of naturalization in tho sovoral fodoral and stato courts, and to mako provision also for tho vacation or cancellation of such record In cases whero fraud had boen practiced upon tho courc by tho applicant himself, or whero ho had renounced or forfeited his acquired citizenship," is an Idea that should bo enacted into law. Tho records of such a bureau would often provo of inostimablo value to our natural ized cltizous. Mr. Arthur concurs with tho 6ccrotary of tho treasury In advising tho immodlato suspension of the colnagoofsllverdollars, and renews his former rccommondation for tho abolition of all intornal-ravcnuo taxes oxcept thoso upon distilled spirits. Touching tho important quostlon of na tional defonso, he Is emphatic In tho ex pression of his opinion that the fortifica tion Of our coasts should bo commenced nt once upon a comprehensive scale, and that the work of placing our navy upon a war footing should bo acceloratcd. His rccommondatlons touching thoso great objects of national concern will receive tho cordial appro al of tho country. In conclsu torms tho President recom mends that a sultablo pension bo con ferred upon Qon. Grant. Ho no doubt had In alow tho misfortunes that havo ocr taken our most illustrious citizen In his declining years as well as tho eminent Beivii.es to which ho roferrod, and it is reasonably certain that congross could not do a moro popular act than to promptly carry out tho rccommondation. 1'rom tho opening to tho concluding paragraph the message Is clear, straight forward, manly, statesmanlike . Tho President has apparently aimed to dojust what tho constitution proscribes "glvo to congress information of tho Btato of tho union, and rocommend to their consider ation such measures as he shall Judge no cossary and expedient." This ho has dono gracefully and very thoroughly. Tho document is full of information, There is no nttompt nt flno phrasing. There was no need of it. It is neither moro nor loss than it should bo, and will stand a modal among Btato papers of Its kind. An Ainerlcau Zollvereln. No part of President Arthur's admlr- ablo mossago will reccivo more attontlon or eauso moro discussion than his dodul tlon of what hooonsldors tho proper policy for this governmont to pursue with tho design of bringing about an Immodlato nud highly profitable oxtonslou of our forolgn traffic. Practically his proposition Is to put our solves and the other couutries of America upon nearly tho same basis of freo com mercial exchange that characterizes tho intercourse between our own states. Our reciprocity treaty with Mexico and tho treaty latoly negotiated with Spain in re gard to our commerco with Cuba and Porto Hlco already constituto stops In tho direction of this policy. With somo re strictions, it would establish internal free trade over tho faco of tho American con tinent and foster an enormous exchange north and south, from the benefits of which the great European manufacturing nations would be exeludod. President Arthur Is u protectionist, and the ropubllcnu party Is firmly wedded to the theory of protection to American labor and Industry. Yot there is no In consistency In his proposition for nn American zollveroln. The cssenioof tho protection theory embraces the creation uf a market for our products as well as dofoiua agalust competing manufacturing nations, and tho ProJldout's preposition looks to building up u grand mnrkot for our product) with friendly countries that do not compote with our industries nor, except in a vory slight degree, with any of thuproducUof our soil. It Isashrowd and skillful outlining of plan for draw lug tho American republics closer together through tho bonds of mutual benefits re ceUedaud conferred without Intrenching upon reserved domostlu rights such as each contracting country would be averse to sharing with tho others, such as tho bo no coasting trade, &.e. 'Iho President's definition embraces reciprocal commercial treaties, putting our consular servlco upon a salaried basis, to romovo tho burden of consular fees from commerco, the cuactuiont of meas ures to eroato and m ilutalu a steam tner ehaut marine currying our flag, nud, lastly, tho establishment of a uniform currency bails "for tho ceuntrios of Amorlca. Tho last proposition Is bold and novol. The President's brief presentation of its method of establishment, operation, and nd vantages nro as follows i This would rejulro n monetary union of America, whereby the, output of tho bullion producing countries and tha circulation of those vv hlch ) lcld neither gold nor sllv or could bo adjusted in conformity with tho population, wealth, and tnnimcrclsl need) of each. As manyol tho countries furnish no bullion to the common Mock, tho surplus production of our mines and mints might thus be utilised and a steptaken toward tho general romoncll ration of silver. Thoro wonld bo vast difficulties in tho way of bringing such n union about, but It Is not Impusilblo of accomplishment. Obviously It would bo of great ndvautajo to tho United Statos if our colnago de nominations should become the common circulating modlumof tho republics south of us, but tho attachment of custom, dis like to giving up a colnago of denomina tions and values porfoctly f iinlllar for one whoso denominations and values wonld havo to bu laarnod, and national prldo, will all staud as formldablo ob stacles to tho accompllshmont of a mone tary union. 

AMUSKMKNTS. AUui'nu'H orcn itoesc John T. ltaymo.id was elcclod "For Con gress" at Albaugh's Opera house last ovontmi by an overwhelming majority, If tho applause which grooted hlsappcaraiico on the stage can bo taton as an evidence of tho fact. Tho play has been remodeled and greatly Im proved since Its presentation tat season. Tueso improvements havo afforded Mr, Itaymond greater opportunities for tho display of his exceedingly droll humor, ot which ho takes tho greatest adi antage. Thcro wero over forty members of congress present at tho performance, who gao hequent evi dence of their appreciation of certain politi cal "hits" brought out during the play. The pcrformanco as a whole was a ery good one, and deserved a much larger audience than was present. Although Mr. Itaymond wastho center of attraction, Mr. W.

"Standing Hoom Only" Mas posted in tho lobby of tho National theater last ci enlng at the performance of thoAmcrlcau sensational mclo-draum "Shadows of n Great City." It is undoubtedly tho finest melo-drama which has boon presented In this city this season. It Is confessedly sensational, and, though Im probable, the story Is nevertheless possible, representing a ) oun; gambler's determination, by robbery and murder, to deprl o a cousin and her child of n princely inheritance There aro strong touches both of pathos and humor In the play, but tho most striking feature Is the remarkable attention which has been paid to scenic effects and trausformatlons, which arc, Indeed, magultlccnt. Iho performance was a pronounced success. Whero all did so well It would seemingly bo unjust to discrimi nate, but tho playlug of Tom Cooper by It. 1'..

FORK'S OFEItA IIOISE. Charles II. Hojl's latest laughablo lilt "A Rag ltab" was played at Ford's Opera houso last cicnlug to a full house. Of plot thcro Is nothing worth mentioning, but tho many ludicrous and ridiculous situations kept tho nudienco in a roar of laughter from the com mencement to tho ending of the play. Any ono dctlrln? a good, hearty laugh for tbrco hours should go and eeo tho "Kag llaby." THE TAULRNACLE COSCFRT. Tho Tabornaclo church was well filled last night with an nudienco comprising perhaps a majority of local singers on tho occasion of tho first or a scries ot concerts by tho music committee of tho church. The interest cen tered in the first appearance in this city of Miss Homer, a soprano from Kew York. WMx a aolco of considerable magnitude, which has been tralnod In n good school, she made a fatorablo Impression, and each effort was rowardod by liberal ap plause Eho showed to the best advantago In ballad, whero there was no call for ocal pyrotechnics, though for so extensho an organ her volco Is qulto flexible Slio is Im passioned in manner, evidoutly feeling the sentiment of tho musla she is interpreting, aud in this respect tho earnestness und fidelity of her work Is shown. Mrs. l'owell sung a florid polka capprlcclosooxqulsltely, giving evidence of great improvement both in volco nud method stneo last season. For an encore she ga o her ow n dainty w altz song, "Sweetheart." Mine, lengar, whose skill as a violinist Is fully recognized, was allotted three num. bcrs, in all of which sho exhibited tho train ing and Intelligence of tho true artist. Mr. Will iam WaldecLer, who already occupies a high position as a nolo pianist, played aValse llrll Haute by Moszkon ski, w hlch brought out fully tho puro, resonant, and powerful tuno of tho Weber grand, and exhibited Ills ow n admirable technique and skill. Mr. F, Knoop gave ono solo acceptably, and sustained himself credit ably In tho duet from "Paul and Virginia" with Miss Homer, with which tho programme closed. Tho next concert will take place on Jan, 5. CIIVIICII OF OCK PATIIFR. To-morrow night tho first of a series of con certs by tho choir of tho Church of Our Father will take place In tho church, corner of Thir teenth aud It streets.
