Mr. Sumner introduced bills of the fol? lowing titles: A bill to carry out the prin? ciples of a republican form of government in thc District of Columbia; a bill prescrib? ing an oath to maintain a republican form of government in the rebellious States: a bill in part execution of thc guarantee of a republican form of government in the Con? stitution of tho United States; a bill on thc subject of appropriate resolutions to en? force the amendment of the Constitution prohibiting slavery; a bill to preserve tho right of trial by jury by securing impartial jurors in tho courts of thc United States; a bill to enforce the guarantee of a repub? lican form of government in certain States whose governments havo been usurped and overthrown. Mr. Sumner also intro? duced the joint resolution declaratory of the amendment abolishing slavery; a series of resolutions declaratory of thc duty of Congress, especially in respect to tho loyal citizens of rebel States; ana a series of re? solutions declaratory of the duty of Con? gress with respect to guarantees of the national security and national fait h in tho rebel States. Mr. Wade, of Ohio, introduced a bill to regulate the franchise in the District of Columbia. Mr. Harris, of New York, introduced a bill to regulate thc Judiciary of the United Stn tes. Mr. Wilson, of Massachusetts, introduced a bill to maintain the freedom of inhabi? tants of States declared in rebellion. nousE or REPRESENTATIVES. The House of Representatives was or? ganized to-day by the re-election of Hon. ?Schuyler Colfax. No Southern members were called. Mr. Maynard, of Tennessee, protested, but tho Clerk refused to liston to him. The President announces that he is not ouly in favor of the admission of the Tennessee delegates, but of all members elected who can take th? oath. Strong efforts will be made to make Tennessee an exception, but it will fail. The galleries of the House of Represen? tatives aro densoly crowded, and much food humor is prevalent among the mend? ers. One hundred and seventy members an? swered to their names. Mr. Brooks, of New York, made a speoch, characterizing the omission of thc mem? bers from Tennessee from the roll as un ?irecedeated. If Mr. Maynard was not a oyal man, from a Union and loyal State, the President himself waa not loyal, but an alien and a stranger. He charged that the adoption of the resolution by the Re? publican caucus was designed as anta? gonistic to the President's forthcoming meseage. The House took no action on the subject, but under the operations of the previous question, proceeded to the election of Speaker-Mr. Colfax, of Indiana, and Mr. Brooks, of New York, being placed in nomi? nation. THE 

SOUTHERN MESTBEBS. As the Clerk was calling the roll of the members from New York, Mr. Maynard, of Tennessee, rose to speak, but was prevent? ed from proceeding by the Clerk, who stated that no remarks at that time were in order. At thc conclusion of the call of thc roll, Mr. Morrill, of Vermont, moved that the House proceed to the election of Speaker. Mr. Maynard again attempted to bo heard, but was silenced by cries of "order." Mr. Brooks, of New York, protested against the refusal to hear Mr. Maynard, claiming that if Tennessee was not a State of the Union, and if Mr. Maynard was to bo regarded as an alien, the President of the United States-a citizen of Tennessee was also an alien and a usurper. He de? manded that the members from Virginia and Tennessee should be admitted, and denounced the refusal of thc House to ad? mit them as despotism. Mr. Brooks was frequently called to order during his remarks hy ?lr. Stevens, of Pennsylvania, and others, and finally asked Mr. Stevens when ho proposed to consider the question. Mr. 8. replied that he proposed to consider it at the proper time. The response elicited considerable applause from the members and spectators. The Clerk said he could not recognize ) any one as a member whoso name was not on thc roll. Mr. McPherson was elected Clerk; Mr. Ordway, Sergeant-at-Arms; Mir. Goodenow, Door-keeper; and Joseph Grace, Post? master. Mr. Stevens offered a hill for the ap? pointment of fifteen members to report whether any of the late Confederate States are entitled to representation. The bill was passed by a vote of 123 yeas to ;i(i nays. Mr. Brooks then moved as an amend? ment to the motion for an election of Speaker, that Mr. Maynard bo allowed to make kio statement. This wu.? loudly ob? jected to. The election of Speaker then took placo, with the result already an? nounced. 

SENATOR WILSON'S 11II.I.. Senator Wilson, of Massachusetts, will introduce the following bill, and press it to an early vide in the Senate. He considers I that the condition of affairs in the South I is such as imperatively demand prompt action in the premises: "An Act to Maintain thc fr" '.^iitqflhe Inhabitant* in mc ??tates declared in In? surrection and Rebellion by Proclamation of the President af the 1st if July, "He it enacted, &c, That all laws, sta? tutes, acts, ordinances, rule? and regula? tions of any description whatsoever here? tofore in force or held valid in any of the States which were declared to be in insur? rection and rebellion bv thc proclamation of the President of the 1st of July, ist;2, whereby or wherein any inequality of civil rights and immunities among tho inhabit? ants of said States is recognized, autho? rized, established or maintained by reason of or in consequence of any dist inctions or differences of color, race or descent, or by reason of or in consequence of a previous condition or status of slavery or involun? tary servitude of such inhabitants, be and thev are hereby declared null and void. And it shah bo unlawful to institute, make, ordain or establish in any of tho ?States declared as aforesaid to be in insurrection and rebellion any such law, statute, act, ordinance, rule or regulation, or to enforce or to attempt to enforce thc same. "SEC. 2. And be it further enacted, That any person who ?hall violate either of the provisions of this Act, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall bo puHishcd by a line not less than $500, nor exceeding $10,000, and by imprisonment not less than six months, ?nd not exceed? ing five years, and it shall be tho duty of the President to enforce the provisions of this Act." President's Menage. 

WASHINGTON, Decembers.-Thc message of President Johnson was read to Congress this day. It says that resistance to thc Government having exhausted itself, the first question to be considered is, whether the territory within tho limits of States which attempted to secede should be held as conquered territory, uuder military authority emanating from the President. Ho considers that military Governments established for an indefinite period would have eflered no security for an early sup Srossion of discontent, would have pro ucod a vanquished people full of enven? omed hatred, rather than restore their affection, which is the true theory. All pretended acts of secession were from the beginning null and void. States cannot commit treason, nor secede through their individual citizens who may have commit? ted treason. The States attempting to secede, placed themselves in a condition whore their functions were suspended, but not destroyed; but if any State neglects or refuses to perform ita offices, there is tho more need that the General Govern? ment shouid maintain its authority, and, as soon as practicable, resumo its func? tions. On this principle he acted, gradu? ally and equally; by almost imperceptible steps, he sought to restore' the rightful energy of the General Government and the States. To that end Provisional Go? vernors were appointed. All parties in the late terrible conflict must work to? gether in harmony. It is not too much to ask that a one-side plan of restoring tho States shall proceed, in conformity with a willingness to cast the disorders of tho past into oblivion, and that on the other side, tho evidence of sincerity, in the future maintenance of the Union, shall be put beyond doubt by thc ratification of tho proposed auti-slavery amendment of the Constitution. This amendment boing adopted, it would remain for tho States to resume their i laces in both branches of Congress, and thereby complete the work of restoration. The President says that the General Government has no authority to make tho freedmen electors; that power remains with the States; they can decide whether it is to bo adopted at once, or in? troduced gradually, with tho condition, however, that thc Government faith re? quires tho security of tho freedmen in their liberty, property, right to labor and to claim jurisdiction of their labor. It will bo his constant aim to promoto peaco ?with all foreign nations, and thinks they are animated by the same disposition. The accordance of belligerent rights to the insurgent States was unjustifiable; but Great britain was au exception. She built ships and furnished men and material of war to tho insurgents. A justification of it cannot be sustained before the tribunal of the world; at tho samo time, ho docs not advise any present attempt at redress by acts of legislation; for the future, the friendship between the two countries must rest on a basis of mutual justice. We have wisely forcbome, because of tho alleged propagandise of republicanism; but it would be a cause of groat calamity to our? selves and the cause of good government, should any foreign power challenge tho American people to its defence against foreign interference. He relics on the wis? dom and justico of those powers to respect our system of non-interference, which has so long been sanctioned by time. Prom Washington. Secretary Stanton has received the fol? lowing despatch: "

Semi-official news from the city of Mexi? co, under date of November 17, has been received in this city, at thc Mexican Lega? tion. Langlais, the Minister of the Trea? sury, whom Napoleon sent to Maximilian, in order to arrange thc finances of the Em? pire, has declared that it is impossible to succeed in that enterprise, as thc budget amounts to 40,000,000, and the receipts do not quite reach 15,000,000. There is no confirmation of the report of tho defoat of the Liberal forces under Ugaldo aud Fi? gueroa. The French are concentrating their forces in San Luis Potosi, the city ofMexico, and on tho Kio Grar.do. Tho abandon? ment of tho States of Sonora, Sinaloa, Chi? huahua, Nuevo Loon and Oohuila is offi? cially confirmed in late advices from Mexico. It is represented that the Liberals arc daily gaining ground, an.i thc number is always increasing. Gen. Diaz defeated an Imperial force in tho State of Puebla, and afteward went to see Gen. Alvarez to com? bine a decisive movement against the French.
