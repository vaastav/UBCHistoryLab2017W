It occu pies a little corner of the local page. These gentlemen are liberal dealers and they keep an endless assortment of goods in their iine. Although uuch is mentioned iu their advsrtiseiaent, not one-half is told. The balance can be seen at their Corner Drug Store. The heavy wind of Monday after coon did some damage along the rail road.

We would like to de vote a portion of our paper to agricul ture. This we can do easily enough '.by cutting from other papers long, theoretical articles on the subject; but it would amount to nothing. What we want is ehort practical articles trom onr own farmers. This would be of utility, enabling oar farming community to interchange ideas on farming andiearn from each other the best and most practical manner of raising all kinds of crops, ; stockj etc. - Who will try their hand at this.-: Tie net profit of the Alumnal sup per, last Friday night amounted to $58 00, which was doing very well1 . we think.

The committee inform ns that they had fully Intended hold ing a fair and had made arrangements therefore, but that not to interfere with the fairs of the Firemen they had de eided to withdraw. We think this the best way to arrange the matter. This Church can hold a fair in the future when there is no opposition the field and receive the patronage all the people. ' Stack Fair. As will be seen by ref erence to the report of the Agricultu ral Society Meeting, the Board Managers of the Society have decided to hold a Stock Fair in the spring. In premiums we learn that about $5,000 wCl bo given, wniie arrange . taenta will be made to have a liberally ranged premium list, good arrange ments and a fair that we can be proud of. Other societies in the State have held such fairs, and have not only found them profitable to themselves, but also of great use in encouraging farmers in improving their stock. ' T7e hope all will look upon this Stock Fair In it- true light, and lend a help &3 tzi to m&klcg it a aceeess.

He fell in with a lot of fellows, who got him into a saloon and tried to get him to throwing dice, etc. This be refused to do. but drank with them several times. At one time he complained of being sick, and one of the parties prescribed for him, and drugged him, as he afterward as certained. He got on the morning train, eoire south, at Clyde, and had been seated but a moment when fellow claiming to be a detective came up to him and told him he must con sider himself under arrest for passing counterfeit money, and demanded all the money he had. Jones said he had no counterfeit money, but was order ed to give it up, and told that they were obliged to report at Tiffin to chief detective, and that they would goto a bank and ascertain if the money was good. When they reach ed this city, they went to the First National Bask and the money, $83, was pronounced good, The sham de tective took poor Jonee out and told him to wait a moment while he went to the office of the chief detective.and the matter would be fixed up all right Jones waited, but the detective did not return nor the money either. Jones got out a warrant, but the fel low could not be found. Jones is thus badly sold. The drug he bad taken made him so dazed that he could not give a good description of the man, but he is supposed to be one of a Fremont band of robbers who work east and west from that place. To Melmore. On Sunday last number of the Masonic Fraternity this city went to Melmore to attend the funeral of Mr. II. M. Becker. On arriving at that place they went the lodge room of the Masons, and with ita members adjourned the Church. Rev. Mr. Collier of this city delivered an able discourse from the words "In the sweat cf thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken; for dust thou art, and dust shalt thou return." The sermon was llrtened to with intense interest by an audience that filled the church to its utmost capacity. This was one of the largest funerals ever held that place and evidenced the estima tion in which the deceased was held. The visiting masons, after partak ing of a good dinner at the American House started for home.

As Ven'ce and Liberty townships had no members of the Society, no managers were selected for them. Adjourned. The Society then adjourned. The attendance at the meeting was not as large as last year but considerable spirit was manifested. The work done will give satisfaction, . Immediately after the adjournment of the Society the Board of Managers of the Society met with Samuel Her rin, Vice President in the chair. The first business was the selection of a Secretary.

Our citizens will now have an opportunity of ob taining one of the most valuable looks that has been introduced in this place. It is Dr. Kitto's Illustrated History of the Bible, The ageut, Mr. C. M. Gal lup, Jr., called on us, and we have given our name- for a copy, and think that few intelligent readers will be able to resist the temptation to pur chase so good a book. It is made ex ceedingly attractive by about 300 illustrations, many of them full-page engravings by Gustave Dore, the most eminent of living artists. The author s a most celebrated biblical scholar, who spent three years in Palestine gathering material for this great work. It is a royal octavo volume 750 pages, gotten up in the first style, and made exceedingly attractive well as valuable. It is confidently commended as a book for the family circle, and especially for those engaged in the work of christian instruction. It is meeting with wonderful success wherever introduced. Over 200,000 copies have been sold already and the' sale is constantly increasing. An Interesting Crowd. At about five P. M. Sunday last, "might have been seen" some dozen persons slowly and wearily coming in, in squads three or four from Melmore. How came "that this was thus" is follows: These gentlemen went to Melmore the band wagon. On their return, when about one-fourth of a mile from Melmore, the forward axletree of the wagon broke and the gentlemen found that they were in for a walk. There upon Messrs, G. K. Brown, B. Atkins, J. H. Frost, N. M. Barnes, P. Schieb, E. White. J. P. Parks, Chas. Sours, 4c., shouldered blankets, coats and shawls and like so many ' Weston "lit out" for Tiffin. A more tired com pany never reached home than this, and they voted it at least forty miles to Melmore. We can imagine their feelings. JfortB Western Ohio Teachers' Asso ciation.

( I j As the question has been often ask- - .1 Ai.t. Af imnMrnDntl rift you propone having at your Fire De- partment Fair," allow me, througn the columns of the Tribcne, to ex plain jut what our arrangements are, In the first place we have decided to hold a fair, under the auspices of the Tiffin Fire Department, the proceeds of which are to be placed in the treas- ury of the different companies consti tuting said Department and thereby avoiding, to a great extent, the drain upon the City Treasury for keepii.g up the incidental expenses of the dif ferent compauies of the city. No tax payer can fail to see the advantage in this to himself and the city at large. We have made arrangements with our business men here to furniah us with all the goods we may want.from the smallest toy to a house and lot. Persons in need of holiday present will do well to give us a call. On Fri day and Saturday before Christmas we expect to be open to dispose of our goods, some by lottery, some by auc tion, and some by retail, giving all an opportunity to get their presents. The indispensable pop corn and candy man will be on hand, during the fair, with an endless supply. The halls will be gaily decorated for the occa sion, and everything will be done to make it pleasant and agreeable for those who may favor us with their presence. We say to all, come and ft i T- 1 see as. lioos- silver uornei naiiu ua been secured for the occasion. The committee on amusements propose to make it lively on the stage. Don't forget the place at City Hall, com mencing December 23, 1870. Ponltry. S. 8. Smoyer hands us the following, from the "ew ork Pro duce Market," relative to poultry and the prospects: The fears expressed in our last In relation to dressed poultry have been far more than realized. The stocs: that arrived for Thanksgiving was not all sold; a heavy stock was car ried over, and a very heavy delaved stock came in on top of it The weather turned warm, too, and has so continued. The result has been the worst 'Sticker" we have had for sev eral years. For two or three days past receivers have been turning out stock at any price the buyers would offer. It is almost impossible to rep resent the market in our quotations. For stock that has been carried a few davs or arrives soft the price is mere ly nominal. The sanitary police have taken many lots as unfit for food. Fresh, bright and handsome chickens have some demand for our best retail trade: this is about the only kind the seller attempt to hold with any firm ness. AH appearances indicate that the stock of poultry in the country is very heavy and that low prices must rule this season. Live turkeys and chickens are very flat and heavy. Live ducks and geese have a light in
