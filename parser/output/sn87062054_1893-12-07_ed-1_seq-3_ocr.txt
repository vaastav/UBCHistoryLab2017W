Foreign Affairs. My predecessor having accepted the office if arbitrator of the long standing bound jrv disputes, tendorct to the president "t the Argontlne republic and Drazll, It has bei-nray agreeable duty to receive tbo special eavo-rs commissioned br those states to lay be fore mo evidence and arguments in behalf ot thHr respective governments. The outbreak of domestic hostilities In the republic, ot Drazll found th United States alert to watch (be Interest of our citizens In that country with which we carry on important commerce Sev eral vessels of our new navr are now, and for seme time have been stationed at HIo de Janeiro. Tho struggle being between the es tablished government, which controls the machinery of administration, and with Thlch we maintain friendly rotations and certain officers of tho navy employing the vessels ot their command In an attack upon the national capital and chief seaport, and lacking, as It docs.' the elements of divided administration, I have failed to see that the insurgents can reasonably claim recognition as beUIgerants. This far tho position of ourov eminent has been, that of an attentlvo but nn Impartial observer of tho unfortunate conflict Id passlng.our fixed policy of Impartial neutral ity In such a condition of amirs us now exists, I deem It necessar to disallow In a, manner not to bo misunderstood, tho unau thurlzed action ot our lato naval commander In thi.se waters In saluting the revolutionist Bra zilian admiral, being Indisposed to countenance, an act calculated to glvo gratuitous sanction to tho local lnsurroctlous The convention between our government an.l Chill, having for Its object' tho settlement and adju tmsnt of tho de mands of the two count- les against each o'her has been made cflectlvo by tho organiza tion of tho claims commission provided for. The two governments falling to agree upon tho third member of thi commission the good offices otthe president ot the Swiss repub.lc were Invoked, as provided In tho treat?, and the selection of"jbo Sws repre Iscntatlve to this- conntry wHs gratifying alUo to the United States and Chill and tho vexa tious question ot so-called legation asrlum for offenders against tho stato and Its laws was presented anew In Chill by the unauthorized action of tho late United States minister in receiving Into his offlcUl resldcnco two persons who bad Just failed In an attempt at revolution and against whom criminal charges were pend ng, growing out of a former ' abortive disturbance, nnd tho doclrlno of asrlum as applied to this case Is not sanctioned br tho best .precedents, and, when allowed, tends to encourage sedition and strife Under no circumstances can tho representative of this g 'Yerninent bo per mitted wide.' tha Ul-dctlneJ fiction of oxira-territorial Jurlsilctlon to attempt the administra tion of criminal Just co in tho countries to which they aro accredited A temperate de mand having been made by tho Chilian govern ment for the correction of this conduct In the Instance mentioned, tho minister was Instruct ed no longer to harbor the offenders The legislation of last year known us the deary law, requiring the registration of all Chlneso laborers' entitled to resldcnco in tho United States and tho deportation of all not comply luz with the provisions of tho act within the time prescribed, met with much opps,ttion from Chinamen In this country. Aotlnc upon the advice of eminent couusel that tho 1 was unconstitutional, tho great, mass of tha Chlneso laborers, pending judicial Inquiry as to Its va lidity, In good faith declined to apply for the certificates required by Us provisions. A test case upon proceeding by habeas corpus was brought beforo tha supremo court and on May 15, not, a decision was mado by that tribunal sustaining tha law. It Is believed that under the recent amend ment of tho act extending the time ot registra tion, the Chinese laborers thereto entitled, who desire to reside in this country will now avail themelTe3 of the renewed privilege thus at forced ot establishing by lawful procedure their right to remain and that thereby tho ne cessity ot enforced deportation may bo to a great degroe avoided It Is devolved upon the United States min ister at I'ekln. as dean of the dlplomatl.i body and in tho absence of a representative ot oweuen ana Norway to press upon the unineso wverjiment reparation for tho recent murder of Swedish mlsslonalrcs at Tong, but this ques tion Is of vital lntorest to all countries whose cliizsns engage in missionary work In tho In terior Our relations with tbo French republic con tinue to be Intimate and cordial I sincerely hope that the extraction treaty with that country, as amended by tho senate, will soon bo opcratl o. While occasional questions affecting our naturalized citizens returning tor the land of their birth havo arisen in' our Inter course with Germany our relations with that co ntrycontlnuo satisfactory. Tbo questions affecting our- relntlons with Great Britain have been treated In u spirit of friendliness. Neiotlatlohs aro in progress be tween the two governments with u view to such concurrent action oh will raako tho award and regulations agreed jpon by tho Ilenrtng sea trlbural of arbitration practically effective, and it is not doubted that Great Ilritaln will co-operate freely with this country for tho nc roropllshmont ot that purpose. Tbo dispute growing out of the discrimination tolls Imposed In tho Welland canal Upon cargoes of cereals bound to nnd from the lako porta of tho United States,' was adjusted b ino substitution of a moro'equltablo sched ule ot charges and my predecessor thereupon suspendo his proclamation Imposing olscrimi natlng tolls upon Ilrillsh transit th ough our canals.

This treaty I with drew for examination and dispatched Hon. James A. Ulount, of Georgia, to Honolulu as a special Commission to tnako nn Imn.lrtlivl tn. vesligatlon of tho circumstances attending tbo change of government nnd of all tho conditions bearing upon thi subject ot tho'troaty. Aftor a thorough and exhuustlvo examination Mr. Illount submitted to mo his report showing beyond all question that tho constitutional government of Hawaii hid been subverted with tho nctlvo old of our representatives to that g vernmentnnd through tho intimidation causod by tho pres ence of an armed naval force of tho United Seates which was landed for that purposo.at tho instance of our minister. Upon the facts developed it seemed to me the only honorable course for our government to pursue was to undo the wrong, that -had boon done by thoso representing us nnd to restore ns far as prac ticable the status existing at tho time of our forolblo intervention. With a view et accom plishing this result within tho constitutional limits of executivo power, and recognlztng all our obligations and responsibilities grow ing put of any chango of conditions, brought about our unjustifiable Interference our prosont minister at Honolulu his'rocclvod appropriate instructions to that end. Thus nr no Information ot tho accomplishment of any definite result has-been received from him Additional advices uro soon expected. When received they will promptlybe sent to congress togothcr with all other Information at hand, accompanied br a special executive message fully dolatllng all the facts nocossary to coin plote undertandlng otthe ease, and presenting a history ot all material, events leading up to the present situation.

It is estimated that on tho first day of July 1 91. tho metallic stock of money in the United States, consisting of coin and bullion amounted to ll,f 18,SO,IC0 of which $597,097,035 was gold and 4015,601,481 was silver. Ono hundred nnd nineteen national banks were organized during tho year ending Ootober 31, 1893, with a capital of ( 11, .'30,000, fort-stx went Into voluntary liquidation and 1W sus pended. Sixty-five of tho suspended banks were Insolvent, eighty-six resumed business, and soven remain In the hands of bank ex nmlners with prospects of speedy resumption. Of the now banks organized 41 worn located In tho eastern statos 41 west of the Mississippi river nnd 31 in tho central and southern states. Tho total number of banks in existence on tho 31st day ot October. 1S93, was 3,793, having an aggregate capital ot J693.55M3JI Th3 net in. crease In tho circulation of these banks during tho year was !3At89,87i The recent repeal of the provision of law requiring tho purchaso of silver bullion by tho covcrnment as a, feature of our monetary schemo has made an entire chango In tho complexion ot our currency af fairs. I do bot doubt that tho ul Imate result of this action will bo most salutary and far reaching. In the naturo of things, however, It Is Impos slble to kuow nt this tlmo precisely what condi tions will be brought about oy mo cnange, or what, If any, supplementary legislation may in the light of such conditions, appear to bo es sential or cxpedl nt Of course, after tho re cent financial perturbation tlras is necessary for tbo ro-establlshmcnt of business confidence. When, however, through this restored conn d'neo, tbo money which bns boon frightened Into hoarding laces is roturned to trade and enterprise, a survo ot tho situation will probably dlscloso a site path leading to a permanently wuiw i"w ......, sufficient to meot every requirement ot our In creasing population and business. In tho pur suit of this object we should resolutely turn away from alluring and temporary ex pedients, determined to bo contented with nothlrra less than n lasting nnd com prehcnslve financial plan In these clr cuinstances I am convinced that a reasonable delay In dealing with tho su ject, instead of being Injurious, will increase tho probability of wise action. I deslro to earnestly suggest .tho wisdom n nmcndlng tho existing statutes lu r gard lo the issunnco ot government bonds. Tbo authority nor vested in the secretary of the trea-ury to Issuo bonds is not as clear as it should bo and tho bonds authorized are disad vantageous to tbo gov rnm n both ns to tho tlmo ot maturl and rate ot Interest The superintendent ot immigration through .,.- ..tr of lho treasury reports that dur ing the I st fiscal yeor thero arrived nt our tSuilMM Immigrants.

Tho report of tho attorney-general" contains the usual summary of the affairs and" proceed ings of tho department of Justice for tho past yoar. togothcr with certain recommendations ns tf noeded legislation on various subjects. I cannot too heartily indorse tho proposition that tho.feesvstem as applicable to tho com pensation of Unlted.Statos attnrnor, marshals, clerks of federal courts and United Statos com missioners should be' abolished with as little deluy as posslbla If is clearly tn the Interest ot tho community that the,' business of tho courts both civil and criminal shall bo as small and as Inexpensively conducted us the onds of justice will allow. Tho system Is, thoroforo, thoroughly vicious whleh makes tho compensation of court offi cials depend upon the volumo of such business and thus create a conflict between a proper ex ecution of Ihe law abd private gain, w.hlch can not fail to be dangorous to the rights and free dom ot tho, citizen an I an lrreslsttblo tempta tion to tho unjustlfiod expenditure- of.publlo funds. If in 'addition to this reform another was lhauguratcd whioh would ijlvq' to United States commissioners lho final disposition ot petty offenses within tho grade-of m sdemean ors, especially those coming undor the lntornat revenuo laws, a groat advanco would bo made toward a more decent administration ot tho crlmln I law. In my first message to congress dated Decern bcr8,188.l I strongly recommended theso changes and referred somewhat at length to thg evils of the prosent system. Slnco that tlmo tho crim inal business of tho federal courts nnd tho ex panse nttendlng it havo enormously increased. The number of criminal prosecutions pending in tbo circuit nnd district courts of the United States on tho 1st day ot July, 13), was 3,8)8, of which 1,881 were for violations of tho Internal revenuo laws, whllo tho numbor of such proso outtons pending on tho 1st day ot July, 1893, was (i, 5 X) In which 4.2J0 were for violations of tho Internal revenuo laws. Tho expense of the United States courts cxoluslve ot judges salar ies for tho year ending July I, 189), was $2,874, 733.11 and tor the year ending July, 1893, $t,5i8. 07187. It Is, therefore, apparent that tho reasons given in 1885 for a change l'n'tho manner of enforcing the federal criminal laws have gained cogeney and strength by .lapse ot time. I also heartily join the. attorney-gen ral In recommending legislation fixing decrcos ot murder within federal jurisdiction, as has-been done in many ot th stttes, authorizing writ ot error on behalf of tho government In cases where final judgment Is r nde ed against' tho sufficiency of an Indictment or aga nst tbo government on any other question arising be to e actual trial: limiting the right of r'evlow Id case ot feionr p nlshable only ,hx flno and, im prisonment to the circuit court of appeals, and making speedy p o lslon for the construction of such prison- and reformatories as mty be necessary for tho confinement of United State 3 convicts. I'ost. Office Department. The report of tho postmaster-general con tains a detailed stnement of tho operatlons.ot the post office department during the last fis cal year and much information touching this Important branch ot tbo public service. The business of tho malls Indlo its' with absolute certainty the condition bf" the business of the oouniry, and depressions in financial affairs in evitably and quickly reduces tho .postal rove nues. Therefore' a larger discrepancy than usual between the post office receipts and ex penditures Is the expected nnd unavoidable re sult of ths dopresslng stringency which has prevailed throughout the country during much of the tlmo covered by tho postmaster-general's roport At a date when hotter times were anticipated it was estimated by hls'prcdeccssor that tho deficiency on tbeSOthdar ot June, 1893, would bo but a little over ?l,6x,0J0. It amounted, however, to more than $,00i,OJO. At tho samo time and under the influence of like anticipa tion estimates wero mado for tho current fiscal year ending Juno HO, 18)1, which exhibited u surplus of revenue over expenditures of $72, 245.71, but now In vlow of the actual recolpts and expenditures during that part ot tho cur rent fiscal year already expired tho present postmaster-general est maie4 that at Us close Instead ot a surplus there will bo a deficiency of nearly $1,000,099. Tho post office receipts for the last fiscal year amounted to i75.8J0.933. 10 and Its' expenditures to 181,074,104 a Thfs 'btfst offlce deficiency would disappear or be lmmensely.dccroised It less matter were carried f reo through the malls, an item of which Is upward ot threo hundred tons of seeds and grain from tho agricultural department Tho total number of post offices In the United States on tho SJthday of June, 1893, was 03,491, an Increase of 1,'.'8I over tho preceding year, and of theso 3.C0) were presidential, an lncrcaso in tbat class of 2)1 over tho preceding forty-two free delivery offices wero added during tho year to thoso already 'existing, making a total of OX), and ten cities and towns provided with frco delivery on June 3), 1893, ninety-three other cities and towns' are' now entitled to this service under tho law, but it has not been accorded them on nccount of in sufficient funds to meet tho oxpense of its es tablishment I. am decidedly of tho opinion that tho provisions tf tho present law permits ns general introduction of this, feature of mall service as Is nocessary and Justifiable, and that it ought not to bo extended to smaller com munities than art now doslgnated. Tbecxpcnsoot frco delivery for tho fiscal year ending June a), 1891, will be tnoro than JII,'OO,ou0and under the administration now existing thero must be a. constant increase In tho Item ot expenditures. There wero 0,4 A ad ditions to ths domestic money order otfljies during tho last'llscal year, being, the largosTin crcaso In any year slnco tho Inauguration of tho system. The total number of theso offices at tho close of tho year was 18,131. Thero wero 13,309,735 money orders -Jsuedr from Jheso of fices, being an increase over !the''preceding yoar ot I,2IO,S9i. and tho valus ot lhese"brders amounted to$127t:7(!,i33.YnnitnorOsp.ot 7, 509,033.53.

The number of international mo ey ordors Issued during the year was 1,053, 9J, nn increaso over tho procdlng. year of T2, 523. nnd tho vntuo was $10.341.837.80,. nn'Ihcre'ase of $l,2il,5043l. Tho number of orders paid was UX),917, nn increaso over tho preceedlng year of 13,503, nnd their value was tv.8j;375, an Increase- f $91,1)91.83 From the forog in? state ments ltapprars that tbo total issuo of money ord rs and postal n itos far tho year amounted to$150,2l.3li2l. The number of letters nnd "packages mailed during tho year for special delivery was 3,375, 093, an increase over the preceding year of. nearly S3 per cent Tho special delivery stamp used upon these letters and paclcagos amounted to J3S7.559 30 and the mcssenger.s'.fecs paid for their delivery amounted o 230,5971, leaving a profit to tho government of 9 970 59. The rail way mall service not only adds to tho prompt ness of mall delivery nt all oBIjos, but it Is tho especial Instrumentality which puts tho smaller and way places In tho service on nn equality in that regard with tho larger and terminal office's. This branch of tho postal sorvlcohis, there fore, rccolved much attention from the po.it-mastor-gonoral, and though it Is' gratifying to know that it is in a condition of high efficiency and great usefulness, i am lea to agree wnn tho postmaster-general that there is room for Us further Improvement Thero are now-connected with the post office establishment 23.3JI employes who are in' tbo classified pervlec, and lho hood ot this groat depart r.cnt gives vcoh cluslvo ovldonce of thovallio ot oivll scrvloo reform when, nftcr an oxperlenco that renders his judgment absolutely reliable, he expresses tho opinion that without tho bench t ot this system It would bo Impossible to conduct. tho vast business Intrusted .to him. Tlin Interior Department. Tho sccrotary of tho Interior has tho super vision ot so many important subjects that his reports are of special value and interest On tho30ih.diy of June, 1833, thero wero on the pension rolls 95tl,OI2 names, an lncroasoof'8.- "Jliovor tbo number on therolls June 30, 1891 OI theso were were soventcenLWiaows and daughters of revolutionary soldiers, tho sur vivors of tbo war of 1812, J',4;5. widow ot soldiers of that over, 21,518 survivor's and widows of tho Mexican war, 3,833 survivors and widows of In dian wars, 281 army nurses and 473;95 surviv ors and widows and children of- deceased sol diers nhd f.illo s of, the war of tho rebellion. Tho latter number represents those pensioned on account of.

ISii Tho number added to the rolls during the years was 1J3.03I and tho number dropped was 33.09J. Tho first payments on pensions allowed uuring mo year amounted to i3j,7J0,asu.vts. This Includes arrears, on tho accumulation be tween tho tlmo from which tho allowance of prosent dates and the time of actually granting the certificates, although tho law of 1E90 per mits pensions1 for disability not rolatod to mili tary service; yet as a rcaulsite to Us benefits a disability must exist Incapacitating applicants irom tne performance of manual labor to such a degroe as to render thorn 'unablo to earn a support" 'Execution of this law In its early stages does notseem to havo been In accord with its true lntcn'Ion, but toward tho closo of the last ad ministration 'an authoritative .construction was given, to tho statuto and since that tlmo this construction has been followed. "T Is had tho effect ot limiting the operation of the law to lu Intended purposes. The discovery having boon mado that many names had been put upon tho pension roll by means ot wholesale and glzantlo frauds, tho commissioner suspended payments upon h"numoor ot pensions which seemed to bo fraudulent or unauthorized pending a comploto examination, giving notlco to lho pensioners, lmjcder that thoy might havo an opportunity to establish, If possible, tho. justice ot their claims notwithstanding opparcnt Invalidity. This, I understand, is the praotlco which has for a long t mo prevailed in tho pension bureau, but after entering upon these rocent investiga tions the commissioner modlfiod this rule so as ndV to nllow, uritll nfter a comploto examina tion, Interference with tho payment of a ponslou not aitogjther void, but which merely had been fixed at a rate higher than that au thorized b law. I am unablo to understand why frauds in tbo pension office should not bo exposed and corrected with thoroughness and vigor, i very namo, fraudulently put upon these rolls' Is a wicked Imposition upon the kindly sentiment In, which pen sions have their origin. Evcrv fraudu lent pensioner has become a bad citizen, affidavits to support of a" pension have made perjury moro tommrn, and false and undeserv ing pensions rob tho people not only ot their money but of the patrlotto "sentiment which the survivors of a war. fought for- tie p oserva tlo'a of the union ought to Inspire Thousands Of neighborhoods have their well known fraudu lent pensioners, nnd recent developments by tho bureau establish appalling conspiracies to 'establish ji'ensfon frauds. Ur no means the least wrong done Is to brave and deserving' pensioners, wh i ought not to bo condemned to such associations. Thoso who attempt, in the lino of duty, to rectify these misdoings should not bo a'ceused of enmity or Indifference .to the claims of honest veterans. The sum expended on account of pactions, for the year-ending Juno , If 9 1, was $150,710,467.14. Tho commission estimates that

Though tho speculator who stands with extortlonato purpose between the land office and those who, with their families, arojnvltcdby the government to settle on tho public lands, Is a despicable character who ought not to be tolerated, yet It Is dlffl.ult to thwart his schema Tho recent opening to settlemcn ot tho lands In the Chorokce outlot, embracing an area of 0,500,0.0 ucros. notwithstanding theutmostcare In framing tho regulations governing tho selec tion of locations and notwithstanding the pres ence1 Ot United States troops, furnished an ex hibition, though, perhaps in a modified degree, ot tho mad scramble, tho violence and the fraudnlont occupation which have accompanied ty-cVldus'' openings ot publto lauds. I concur with the socrctary In the belief that tho30 out ragVOtis Incidents cannot be entirely prevented without a change in the laws on the subject, and t hope tho recommend itl'onslH that direc tion will be' favorably considered. -ii , - --'"Department of Agriculture. Tho report of the secretary of-agrlculturo will be found exceedingly interesting, especial ly tof that large "part of of our citizens Inti mately concerned In agricultural occupations. On lHo9ihday'of,Marcli,189i.there.wereuponlts pay rolls 2;43) cm'ploros. This number has been reduced to 1,850 persons In vjow of a depleted publlo treasury and the Imperative demand of tho peoplo for tho economy in tho adminis tration o'f ahclr government the- secretary has entered upon thr task of rationally reducing ex penditures b? eliminating from tho pay rolls oU'rpcrsonsS not needed for an efficient con duct of the affairs ot tho department During tho first quarter of tho present year th-j ex penses of the department aggregated t3487d7fl against io;,i)is.J.for ino corresponding periou of tho fiscal year ended Juno ,33, i $93. Tho sec retary makes apparent his Intention of continu ing (his rate of reduction by -submitting esti mates for the ricxt fiscal year less by t99l,380 than those for the present year. Among tho heads ot divisions in this depart ment the changes havo been exceedingly fow. Three vacancies occurring from death and resignations' have been filled br'tho promotion of assistants in the samo divisions. These pro motions of experienced and faithful assistants have, not only been In tbe interest of efficient work, but havo suggested to those In tho do' parment who look for retention nnd promotion thit merit and devotion to duty nro their best reliance. Tho amount appropriated for tbe bu reau of. .animal Industry for tho current fiscal year ,1s $s50,ooo. tho estimate for tho ensuing year is $70 ',0)0, Tho regulations of 1893 concerning Texas fever have been enforced during tho. last year, and the largo stock yards of tho country have been kept frco from Infection.. Occasional I -cat Outorcaks havo been largely such as could havo b, en effectually guarded against by the owners of the affected cattle. While contagious p'.euro-pneumonia In cattle hos been eradicated animal tuberculosis, a dis ease widespread, and more dangerous to human llfo than" pleuro-pneumonia. Is still prevalent Investigations have been mado during tbo past yearns to to means of -.Its communication ard tho mothod ot Us correct diagnosis. Much pri press has been mado in this dlrootlon by the studies of the division ot animal pathol ogy, but work ought to bo extended In co operation with' local, authorities, until tho dan ger to .humap life arl4ne from this causo Is re dii'cef. to a minimum. ' ' The number of animals arriving from Canada during the year nnd Inspected by bureau officer was 103,09.', and, the number from trans-Atlantic countries was 1,5:97. No contagious diseases wero found among tho imported animals Tho to'tal number of inspections ot cattle for ex port during the. past fiscal yosr was 011,54.'. Tho, exports show a falling oft of about 2i per cent from tho .preceding year, the decrease occurring entirely In the last half otthe year. This suggests that the falling off may have been largely duo to an Increaso la the prl(of Amor lean export cattle. During tbe year ended June 8J, 1893, exports of inspected pork aggre gated 23,677,410 pounds ns against 3, 152,871 pounds for tho preceding yean The falling off In this export i not confined, howovor. to In-, spectcd. pork, tbo total quantity exported lor 1892 being 031.49)016 pounds, while In 1891 It was only .i27,3j8, i 91 pbunds. I Join tho- secretary in recommending' that hercaftor each applicant for tbo position ot in spector or assistant Inspeotor in the bureau of animal Industry be required as a condition pre cedent -to his appointment to exhibit to tbe United Statps civil service commliHSoner bis diploma from an established regular and repu table veterinary college, and that this be sup plemented by such' an. examination in veterin ary sclencu as the commission may prescribe. The exports of agricultural products from tho United States for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1892, attained tho enormous figure of l8JO,000,ax) in round numbers, .being 78.7 per cent of our total exports. In. tho last fiscal yoar twis aggregate wos greatly reduced, but, ncv rt el ssr reached $i)15j'03,OO0,.belng75.l per cent of all American commodities exported A review of our agri cultural exports lth special refero ce lo their res .tuition will show that In almost every lino tho United. Kingdom ot Great Drltatn and Ire land absorbs by far the largest proportion. Of . cattle the total exports agregated tn value for tho fiscal year ended Juno S0P 1891, $M.')03,0)t', of which Great Url'taln took considerably over S'iVOi.wJ. .Of beef products of all kinds our total exports wero $3,090,000, ot which Great Ilritaln took $!l,0VO00. Ot pork products tho total exports wero $3),-0JO,-00,of which Great Britain took $3,00 ',000. In breadstuff', cotton and minor products, Uke proportions sent to the samo destination are shown. The work ot the statistical division ot the dopartment of agriculture deals with all that relates to the economics ot farming. The main purpose ot Us monthly reports are to keep tho farmers Informed us fully as possible of all matters having' any lnfiuenco upon the world's markets In which , their products found sale. Its publications relate especially to the commercial side of farming. It is therefore of profound Importance and vital concern to the" farmers ot tho United States who represent nearly ono-ha f ot our population, and also of direct interest to the whole oountry, that tho work of this division he efficiently performed and that the informa tion It has gathered be promptly diffused. It Is a matter for congratulation to know that ths secretary will not spiro any effor to make this part of bis work thoroughly useful In tbo year 1839 the congress appropriated $1,000 to be taken from tho patent offlce funds for tho purpose ot collecting and dis tributing rare and Improved varlet es ot seeds and for prosecuting agri cultural lnvest'gatlons and procuring agri cultural stattslics.and from thissmall beginning the seed division of the department of agricult ure has grown to Us present unwieldy and un justifiably extravagant proportions. During the last fiscal year the cost of seeds purchased was $'.0,513 01 Tbe remainder ot an appropriation of $135,000 was expended in put ting them up and distributing them. It sure y mv?r could have enteied tt.e minds ot thes) who first sanctioned appropria tions of publlo money for tbe pur chaso of new nnd Improved varieties ot seeds for distribution that from this would grow largo appropriations for the purchase and distribution by members of congress of or dinary seeds, bulbs and cuttings wbi h are com mon In all the states and territories and every where easily obtainable at low prices In each state andterrttory an agricultural experiment station has been established. These stations, .by their very charaoter and name, are the proper agencies to experiment with nnd test new varieties of seeds-, and yet this Indiscrim inate n'nd wasteful distribution by legislation and legislators continues, answcrlnr no purposo unloss It be to remind constituents that their representatives aro willing to remember them with gratuitous seeds at publlo cost . Under the unction ot existing legislation there was sent out from the agricultural de partment during the last fiscal year enough of cabbagosced to plant 19,20) acres ot land, a sufficient quantity of beans to plant 4.000 acres, beet seed enough to plant 2,506 acres, sweet corn enough to plant 7,833 acres, sufficient cucumber seed to cover 2,02-5 acres with vines and enough muskmelon and watemelon seeds to plant 2.C75 acres The total quantity of flower and vegetable seeds thus distributed was contained In more than nine million packages and they wero sufficient If planted to cover S9 i-91 acres ot land. In view of these facts this enormous expendi ture without legitimate returns of benefit ought to be abolished. Anticipating a com munication so manifestly In tho interest ot good legislate n moro than 100,030 has been stricken from the estimate made to cover this object for tho year ending June 30, 1893, and tbe secretary recommends tbat tbe remaining 133,00 ) "of estimate be confined strictly to tho purchase of new nnd Improved varieties of seed and that these be distributed through ex periment stations. Thus ths seed will bo tested and after the test has been completed by the experiment station tho propagation of the useful vnrlcttcs and the rejection ot the valueless may safely bo left to the common senso of tho people SAar Department. Tho secretary of war reports that tho strength of tho army on the 39th day ot Sep tember last was 25,778 enlisted men and 2. 114 officers. Tho total expenditures of the depart ment tor the year ending Juno 31. 1893. amount ing to$51,9H,07&89. Of this sum $1,992, 581.91 was for salaries and contingent expenses $13,377, 8iS.3i for tho support of the military establish ment, 45,077,03X13 for miscellaneous objects and (29.518.031.41 for public work. This latter sumlncluds 315,290,870.49 for river, and harbor Improvements and $3,210,11.20 for fortifica tions and -other works of defense. Tho total enrollment ot tho mllltla of tho sev eral states was, on tho elst ot October of the current year, 113,597 officers and enlisted men. The officers of tho arm detailed for tbe In spection and Instruction of this reserve of our military forco report that increased interest and marked progress are apparent in tho dis cipline nnd efficiency of the organization Neither Indian outbr-aks or domestic vio lence havo called tho army Into servlco during tho year, nnd the only active military duty re quired of It has been in tho department of Texas, where violations of tho neutrality' laws ot tho United States and Mexico wero promptly and efficiently dealt with by tbe troops, elicit ing the warm approval of the civil und mill tar authorities of both countries. Tbo operation of wtse laws and tho lnfiuenco of civilization constantly tending to relieve the country from tbo dangers of Indian hostilities, together with tho increasing ability of tha states through the efficiency ot tho nation il guard organization to protoct their citizens from domestto violence, load to the suggestion that tho time is fast npproachlng whon there should bo a reorganization of our, army on tho lines of tho present necessities of tho country. This chango contemplates neither Increase in number nor added expense, but a redistribution of the forco and an encouragement of measures tending to greater efficiency among tho men and improvement of tho service The work ot tho projected Chtckamauga and Chattanooga national military park has been proscouted with zeal and Judgment The reports of tho military academy at West Point and tbo special schools for special in struction of officers show marked advanco In the education of tho army and a commendable ambition among its officers to excel in tho military profession and to fit themselves for the highest servlco to the country. The Navy. Tho report of the secretary of tho navy eon. tains a history ot tho operations of his depart ment during the past year and exhibits a most gratifying 'conaltlon of tho personnel of our navr. Ho presents a satlsfaclory' account to congress which has been made In tho construc tion ot vessels and makes n number of recom mendations which Is oipeclally Invited. During tho past six months tho demands for arming' Vessels havo been many and urgent There hive been revolutions calllngfor vessels to pi-ttect American Interests in Nicaragua, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Honduras, Argentine nnd Brazil, whllo tho condition of offalrs In Honolulu has required the constant presence of one or moro ships. With all theso calls upon' our navy It became necessary in order to make up a sufficient fleet, to- patrol' the .Cehrlpg sea under the 'modus vivendl agreed 'upon with Groat Drltaia to detail to that service, one ves sel from the Ash commission and threo from tha revenue marine. Progress la the constriction of now yesscls has not been as rapid as was anticipated. Thero have been delays In tbe completion o unarm ored vessels, but for tbe most part thoyhavo been such ns was constantly occurring even la countries. having the largest experience tn naval ship building. Tho most serious delays, how ever, have been In the work upon armored ships. The trouble has been tho fail lire ot con tractors to deliver a rmor n agreed. Tho diffi culties seem now- however, to -have sJ)oen all overcome and .armor Is being delivered with satisfactory promptness Tho method ot employing mechanical labor at navy yards through boards ot labor, and making efficiency tho sole test by which labor ers are employed and continued, Is producing the best results, and tho, secretary Is eirnesily devoting himself to Us development Attention Is Invited to the statements ot hits report in re gard to workings of tbe system The Civil Srrvice. Tho continued Intclllgentexocutlon of tho civil service law and lha Increasing approval by tho people of its operation are moil qualifying. Tbe recent extension of Its limitations and regula tions to the employes at free doUverir post ofll.-cs which has been honestly and promptly accomp.lshed by the coramlssloi, with tbe hearty co-qperatlonof tho postmaster-general. Is an Immensely Important advance in tbe use fulness of the srstcm. 1 am. It possible, more than ever convinced of tho Incalculable benefits conferred by tho civil service law, not only In Us efftbt upon tho public service, but also what ts even more important In its effect In elevating the tone of political life generally. Tho law embodying civil Hervice reform ' found Its way to our statute, book more from fear of tho popular Sentiment existing In lu fa vor than from any love for tho reform itself on the part ot legislators, and It has. lived and grown and flourished in Spite of tbe covert as well as open hostility ot spoilsmen und notwithstanding tbo querulous Impracticability of m ny self-constituted guardians. B neith all tbo va arles an sublimated theories which reattraoted to, It there underlies this reform a sturdy, com mon senso principle not only suited cto this mundane sphere, but whose application our' people are more and more recognizing to bo ab solutely essential to.the most successful opera tions ot their government, It not to its per petuity. ' It seems tome to be entirely Inconsistent with the character ot this reform, as well at lth lta best enforcement, to oblige the com mission to rely for' clerical assistance upon Clerks detailed from othe- departments. - There Ought not to be such a condition In any department that clerks hired to do work thero can be spared to habitually work at another place, and It does not accord with a sensible vlow of civil scrvlo reform that persons" should be employed on tbe theory that their labor Is necessary In one department when In point ot fact their services aro devoted to entirely dif ferent work In another department I earn estly urge that the clerks neces's.ry to carry on the work ot tbe commission be regularly put upon its roster, and that tho system of oblig ing tho commissioners to relr upon the services bf clerks belonging to other departments be discontinued. Tbls ought not to Increase the expense to tho government, while il would certainly be more consistent and adds greatly to ths efficiency of the commission Economy in a publlo expend iture is a duty that cannot Innocently be ne glected by thoso Intrusted with the control ot money drawn from tho people for publlo uses. It must be confessed that our apparently end less resources the familiarity ot our peoplo with immense accumulations ot wealth, the growing sentiment nmong them that the ex penditure of publlo money should tn some man ner bo to their immediate and personal advan tage, the Indirect and almost stealthy manner In which a larger part of our taxes are exacted, and a degenerated senso ot official accountabil ity have led to growing extravagance in gov ernmo ital appropriations Tariff lteform. Aftor a hard struggle, tariff reform ,1s di-:. . .rectly before us. Nothing so important claims' our attention and nothing so dearly presents Itself as both an opportunity and a duty an opportunity to deserve the gratitude ot our fel low ittzrns and a duty impos d upon us by our oft repeated pro'osslons nnd bv the cmphntla mandate of tho people After full discussion our countrymen have spoken in favor of this reform, ano they have confided the work ot its accom plishment to the hands of thoso who are sol emnly pledged tolt It thero Is anythlngln the theory of a representation in publlo places ot the people and their desires, it publlo officers are really servants of the peoplo and If political promises and professions have anv binding force our failure to give the relief so lo g awaited will bo ' sheer recreancy. Nothing should intervene to distract our attention or disturb our effort un til this reform is accomplished br wise vand careful legislation. While o should staun bly adhere to the principle that only tho necessity of rovenue Justifies- the Imposition ot tariff duties and other federal taxation and that they should be llmlto I by strict economy, we cannot close our eyes to the fact that condi tions have grown up among us which in jus tt o nnd fairness call. for discriminating care in the distribution of such duties and taxation as tbe emergencies of our government actually demand. Manltcstly.it wo are to aid the people directly through tariff reform, ono ot its most obvious features should be a reduction In presont tariff charges upon the' necessaries of Ufa. Tho ben efits of such a reduction would bo palpable and substantially seen and felt by thousands who would be better ted nnd better clothed and bet ter sheltered. These gifts should bo the willing benefactions of a government whose highest funotlon is the promotion of tho welfare of the people Not less closely related to our people's prosperity and well being Is the removal ot re strictions npon tho importation of the raw ma terials necossary to our manufactures. Tha world should be open to our national Ingenuity . and enterprise. Tor their goods soon fill tho narro ' market to which they are eonflnod. Then folio s a suspension of work In mills and factories, a discharge ot employes und distress In tbe homes of our worklngmen Even if the often disproved assertion could be made good that a, lower rate ot ages would result from free raw materials and low tariff duties, the intelligence' ot our worklngmen leads them quickly to dis cover tb.it tbelrsteady imploymcnt permitted by free raw miterlals Is tbe Important factor In their re atton to tariff legislation, a measure has beon prepared by tho approprt- l,atocoDgres3lonal committeo embodying tariff reform on tho lines bereln suggested, which will be promptly submitted for legislative action. It is tbo result of much patriotic and unselfish work and I believe It deals with Us. subject consistently and ns thoroughly as ex-" biting conditions permit I nm satisfied that the reduced tariff duties provided for In the ' proposed legislation, added to existing Internal revenue taxation will in tho near future, though perhaps not Immediately, produce sut-'-flcicnt revenue to meet tho neodsot the gov ernment The committee, alter full consideration and ' to provide against a temporary deficiency, which mav exist before the business of the country adjusts Itself to tho now tariff sched ules, have wisely embraced in their plan a few additional Internal revenuo taxes, including a small tax upon incomes derived f rom1 Certain ' corporate investments. These new assess. ments are not only aDsotuteiy just ana easily borne, but they'have tbo further merit of being such as can be remitted without unfavorable business disturbance whenever tho necessity ot their imposition no longer existfi In my great desire tor tho success of this measure I cannot restrain the suggestion that its success can only be nltalned by means ot unselfish counsel of tbe part or tha friends ot tariff reform nnd as a result of ihelr willingness to subordinate personal desires and ambitions to tho general good ot the-local Interests affect ed by the proposed reform are so numerous and so varied that if all nro insisted upou the legls- lation embodying the reform must inevitably fail In conclusion my intense feeling of responsi.' billty impels me to Invoke for the manifold in- . terestsotn generous nnd confiding people the, most scrupulous care and to pledge my willing support to every legislative effort for the ad- . vanijtmont'ot tho greatness and prosperity ot our beloved country.
