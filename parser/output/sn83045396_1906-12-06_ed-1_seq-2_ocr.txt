WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 5. i Something very liko consternation ' seized upon tlie Mormon contingent in J Washington whon the message of tho t President was read in both houses com- " mending a. National polygamy law. ' In roconimending a National marriage ! j and divorce law, the President said the ' j chango would be good from every K standpoint, and continued: U "In particular it would bo good bo- J causo it would confor on the Cougress 1 the power at onco to dcnl radically and ; efficiently with polyganvy, and this should bo dono whether or not marringo j and divorce aro dealt with. It is neither safe nor proper to lenvo tho question of polygamy to bo dealt with by the Beveral States. Power to deal with' it should bo couforred on tho J National Government." r( Smoot Disappointed. t i Senators Sutherland and Smoot dc- j clined to discuss the matter, but it was very plain that the- were very much ' disappointed with the message. Iioprc i' Kentativo Howell was unable to under stand just what the President was driv ing at. Thore can be no question but that the message was a. great disap- ' pointment to tho "Utah delegation in Congress. It amounted almost to a j bombshell among them. Sonator Dubois was vory much pleased " with the President's recommendation. Ho said last night: "I am glad that the President xccog nizos the fact that there is polygamy il among the Mormons. His open defense of them and support of them has brought joy to every polygamist house lit hold in Idaho, Utah and Wyoming, and everywhere that polygamous Mormons live. I wish he would also join those j of'us who desiro to mako a separation J of church and state in polygamous ? countries and to break down tho politi cal power of the polygamous Mormon Jt hierarchy, and that he would start in j 1)3' aiding us to deprive Apostle Smoot, ij the representative of this polygamous hierarchy, of a seat in the Senate in . , stead of trying to keep him in his n i ' Cannot Prove Polygamy. Kuj ? -'If any National law is to bo passed RU to reach the Mormons, it must bo for ITfiJ unlawful cohabitation, and tho penalty I iff for that must be made equal to a penal- ; j ty which would bo commensurate with jK vrt' iho offenso of polygamy, n fj "You cannot provo polygamy on the Mr ijC Mormons in any court to the satisfac- Yt1 II ! tion of any court or any jury, for the I . reason that in order to provo polygam- 1 you must prove the second marriage. I 1 Tho plural marriages among the Mor- f , mons are celebrated in their temples, or i ! at the present timo in foreign coun- 1 1 tries, like Mexico or British Columbia, ii ; i and tho plural marriage ceremonies are V j performed by the higher officials in tho j Nlormon church, and no record of any I. kind or description is kept of them. In 8'' Territorial days, under the Edmunds ! jlf act. when thousands of convictions were IU had in Utah, Idaho, and other places in jV the West, they were all for unlawful (fl cohabitation. None of them were for j'tfc'i polygamy, because, as I have said, you MhI sannot prove tho second marriage, which )m), is necessary for pol3gamy or bigamy. ', I jifff Crap3ey Formally Deposed. yr

The nego tiations havo been conducted .chiefly at Washington, with the co-operation of the American embassy hqw, and ap pear to .bo part, of a general plan to close up a number of outstanding questions in which Cnnadian intorests are involved. The recent trend of the negotiations have been toward having Canada relinquish such rights as she possesses in Bohring sea in considera tion of adequate compensation or con cessions in other pending questions. However, these exchanges have not mndo any notable advance, as Canada regards nor rights in Behring sea in the light of a national asset, and while disposed to make a reasonable ad justment, she docs not .v-ear to be ready to give up her interests on tho basis of the concessions thus far tenta tively proposed. Tho negotiations, therefore, lack recent definito develop ment, although tho Government offi cials hero hope that the appointment of a now Embassador to tho United States may lead to clearing up this and other pending questions.

CRUSHED TO DEATH Michael Hagan Instantly .Killed by Falling Under Short Lino Train. Michael Hagan, a structural iron worker employed at the new Garfield smelters, met death while attempting to alight from an incoming work train at G o'clock Tuesday evening. His horribly mutilated remains are now at tho Evans undertaking parlors on State street, awaiting tho action of the au thorities as to their final disposition. Hagan, who has been employed at the Garfield smelters t for a number of months, had been in tho habit of leav ing the incoming Short Line work train several blocks before it reached its reg ular stopping placo" at tho South Tom ple and Third -West depot. Ho lived at o25 West North Tempi 6 stroet, and ho gained fully two blocks by jumping lrom the train and walking to his home.

HE THE MUSSED lEITEMGIIEfl Famous Epistle to Mormons 1 .Was Composed in Salt Lake Public Building. COMMITTEE OF SM00TITES AUTHOR OF DOCUMENT A. Milton Musser Was Finally Induced to Father the Instrument. A. Milton Musser 's fnmous epistle to the Mormons, advising them to vote tho Ropnblican ticket irrespectivo of their political affiliations, was composed in tho Federal building by a commit tee of Snioot-appointcd federal officials, including. District Attorney nvrum E. Booth, United States Mn'rshal Wil liam Spry, and Rovenno Collector E H. CalliBter. The lotter had great ofl'oct in tho rcctn Utah campaign, bocnuso tho Saints believed and rightly so that it had tho sanction of Joseph F. Smith, tho polygamous prophet, soor, and rovolator of tho church. Tho news that tho Booth-Spry-Callis-ler aggregation collaborated in the au thorship of tho lotter leaked out 3'cs terday and is authentic. Tt was com posed with tho sanction and knowledge of President Smith, and, after it was written, considerable time wns spent in discussing who should father and sign it, so as to pivo it tho creates weight with tho Saints and Jead them to bp liovo that it was the voice of their prophet speaking to them. Tt was con ceded that for President Smith to sign it himself would bo fatal, in that such nn act would absolutely oxposo the hand of tho Mormon churoh in Utah pal i tics. Finally, A. Milton Mussor, four-ply polygamist, advocate of stirpiculluro and unblushing defender of plural mar riage, was chosen as tho man who should attach his signaturo to tho let ter. Ho was selected becauso all the Saints in Utah, or nearly all. know that ho is employed in the church of fices, where he works directly under tho cyo of President Smith, and becauso the Saints would understand in an in stant that he would not dare to ap- Sciul his name to any document which id not meet witli tho approval of the president of the church. After Mussor had signed tho docu ment, which was first given publicity in the columns of the local Smoot organ, it was pritcd in pamphlet form and circulated throughout Utah by tho thousands of copies. Every Saint who received a copy of it understood that ho was receiving direct orders from tho head of tho church tho Almighty's vicegerent on earth as to how ho should cast his ballot on election day. The committee which drafted tho lot ter was made up of federal officials nppointees of President Roosevelt. Ono or them pretends to be a Gontilc, while tho other two aro Mormon elders.

Iliph officials of the Denver & Eio Grando railroad, tho" Colorado Fuel and Iron company and tho American Smelt ing nnd Eefininp company havd boon summoned to give testimony. J. A. Reider, auditor of the Colorado Fuel and Iron company, was ques tioned about the connection between the Colorado Fuel and Iron company and tho Colorado & "Wyoming railroad, lie said tho railroad was not owned by the Colorado Fuel and Iron com pany, but the officers of tho railroad company aro also officers of tho Colo rado Fuel and Iron comnanv. Attorue' J. T.

Coal and Oar Shortage. Tho witness said thero had been a shortage of cars for some time, and said noarly all the mines had been closed at different periods owing to this shortage of cars. He said there had been a general urgent demand for coal this winter, and that on many orders the company was two months or more behind. Asked about the alleged discrimina tion of railroads in regard to the cars, the witness said ho knew, of no dis crimination either in favor or against tho companj. Mr. ' Wellborn said that the railroads made no discriminatory rates in favor of tho company in its intorstate busi ness, and the "only State discrimina-torj- rates made were those which wero brought out in tho examination at Puobio yesterday. In answer to "a question by counsel, he said that the Colorado Fuel and Iron company did nothing for tho Denver fc Rio Grando railroad in re turn for tho low rate. Ho said that it was uocossary for the Colorado Fuel and Iron company to have the low rato in ordor to do business in Pueblo at a profit. Ho did not know thnt the fact that-other manufacturers could not get the same low rate was the cause that Pueblo had not become a great manufacturing city. HOT
