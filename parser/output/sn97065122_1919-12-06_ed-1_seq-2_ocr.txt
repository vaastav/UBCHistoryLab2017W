The President in his message to Congress confines himself to purely domestic questions. There is no ref erence to Mexico, and only incidental allusions to the treaty of peace. These questions, it is understood, are deferred for special discussion. With most that Mr. Wilson says the people will be in accord and Congress will have no quarrel. His strong recommendation of the establishment of a budget system has been antici pated to an extent in the almost unanimous adoption by the House of the Good bill, an dthere seems to be little doubt that the Senate will take similar action to put inta final effect a reform urged by Mr. Taft years ago. The problem of taxation which the President pre sents, but makes no attempt to solve, is one that is being given profound consideration by the leaders in Con fess, and they have already given much thought to the question raised by liir.i "whether the higher rates of in come and profits taxes can in peace times he effectively productive of revenue, and whether they may not on the contrary be destructive of business activity and produc tive of waste and inefficiency." That they have an ad verse influence upon . business and, besides, contribute largely to the high cost of living, is not to be doubted, but how to adjust them is a problem that is, as Mr. Wil son says, not an easy one. We believe that most repub licans feel that a general protective tariff is not now expedient, owing to the changed conditions which the President reviews, but the protective principle will be applied in specific cases where it seems wise. The dye industry is one of these, and the President's recommenda tion as to this is an admission that the time-honored re publican tariff policy is right in principle. Generally speaking, however, it ia essential that in the present con ditions imports must be encouraged if our exports are to be maintained, and if the cost of living is to be re duced to a reasonable standard. The recognition and relief of soldiers is not a de batable question, except as to the best means; nor can the President raise any argument over the principle ex pressed in his recommendations as to legislation in the nterest of the farmers. All these questions are, how ever, but introductory to his discussion of industrial con ditions, which is, indeed, the paramount domestic issue. The causes of unrest, he says, "arise from or are con nectedt wjth the failure on the part of our government to arrive speedily at a just and permanent peace, permitting eturn to normal conditions: from the transfusion of radical theories from seething Europe pending such de lay; from heartless profiteering resulting in the increase if the cost of living, and lastly from the machinations of passionate and malevolent agitators," This being in ine with our own utterances, we must agree, but we are unable to release the administration from some measure of responsibility growing out of its acts, or failure to ict, from the Adamason law onward. However, when the President says that Congress "should arm the Fed eral Government with power to deal in its criminal courts with those persons who by violent methods would abro gate our time-tested institutions"; when he says, after isserting the right of individuals to strike, that "there is a predominant right, and that is the right of the gov ernment to protect all of its people and to assert its power and majesty against the challenge of any class"; when he says that "labor not only is entitled to an ade quate wage but capital should receive a reasonable return upon its investment, and is entitled to protection at the hands of the government in every emergency"; when he says "it makes little difference what minority it is, whether apital or labor, or any class, no sort of privilege will ever be permitted to dominate this country," then we say that he speaks not as a special advocate but in the tone and the manner that should characterize a Presi- . . lent ot me united .states. The people of this country would see no injustice done !o labor. On the contrary, as we have frequently said, there was never a time when the wish to advance the conditions of labor was so strong and so sincere, or so general in practical application. We have just heard that the principles of profit-sharing and representation of em ployers in industry have been adopted and is at once to !ie applied by ten of the largest industrial corporations n the United States, employing several million men ind .vomen; and employers all over the country, in incr j.wing. numbers, are endeavoring to bring about practical co operation for mutual interest and advancement. Never, .ve repeat, has there been a time when the individual ten ancies among employers have ben ;o strongly toward improvement of working eondithrs ind f't the genera', .vol fa re of all wate-workers. Yet, on the other hand, there is growing up a very tKp reser.toent against labor movements that are regardless of any interest but their own, that by their magnitude and control of essential produrts ca nand do inflict great loss and suffering upon ihe public, or that take advantage of their organized power to attack the fundamentals of American institu tions. The right of the public in the United States of America is, indeed, predominant, and the government that does not protect the public in the maintenance of its! predominant right fails in its paramount duty. Mi. Wil-j son's words sound well, and the people expect that ac tion shall be in accord with their spirit St. Louis Globe Democrat. 

OTTWAY 1 Rev. W. H. Marrison delivered a very interesting and appropriate ser mon to the school Thanksgiving day. All were present for the sermon. Several of the parents and patrons were out for .he sermon. We hope to always be able to cehbrate Thanks giving in such an appropriate way. We boys and girls feel grateful to Brother Harrison for thfe interest which he has shown us. We have a few folks, we are sorry to say, who can't appreciate Thanksg'ving day only as a day upon which to hunt rab bits. Brother Harrison and his wife were entertained at noon by Mrs. D. M. Harmon and daughter, Miss Mol- lie. Our Cheap Column XT ! 4 V J Versigrams By Niel Graham ! ! THE

I argued that the common heard should have a better show, that lines of caste were so absurd that titles all should go. But when my rich old uncle died and left his coin to me.

Everyday History! By Niel Graham THE 

GRAVE OF EMPIRES History offers no more peculiar spectacle than the tragic end of every civilization that has sprung up in Af rica. Not one of the mighty coun tries that once flourished there have remained to this day. Egypt, a great and civilized empire five thousand years ago, died. Carthage, that once challenged the Roman Empire, has disappeared, as did the Empire of the Fatimites; Abysnia, nominally a white and Christian empire, is almost dead, and the Kingdom of the Vandals, and the civilization of the Moors alike fell. No great negro empire has ever made its appearance. Liberia, plant ed in the hope that the Negro would develop a new and unique civilization of his own, and given every sort of encouragement that a new colony could wish in the way of material equipment, has degenerated into a worthless and almost forgotten state. Africa today is a continent of ruins that tell of former civilizations that have supplanted by the newer peoples of Europe.
