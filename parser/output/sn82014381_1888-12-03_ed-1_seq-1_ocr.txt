ISPKCIAL DISPATCHES TO TBB RECORD-UNION. | A LONG DOCVMKXr. The President* Message Said to be of JUuusual Length. Washington, December 3d. —President Cleveland's annual message will be sent to both houses of Congress to-morrow im mediately upon the receipt of the- usual notification that they are ready to receive any communication he has to make. No delay is anticipated in the organization. It is more than probable that the reading of the message will consume the first legis lative day, as it is understood lo be of un usual length. The report of the Secretary of the Treasury will not be sent to Con" gress until Tuesday. THE 

FIRST WEEK OF CONGRESS. The programme for the week in the Sen ate* will depend upon the result of the meeting of the Committee on Finance, called for Tuesday morning. If it is then decided to take up the committee's revenue measure and the Senate's substitute for the military bill, pending at the close of the last session, its consideration will preclude the possibility of another bill coming to the front until it is disposed of. It is the ex pressed desire of Senators Morrill, Allison and Sherman to push the measure to a vote, so it seems probable the bill will be taken up. If, by any possibility, the revenue bill should not come up, the probabilities, of course, of legislation are rather vague. The bills most likely to receive prompt atten tion, with the least opposition, are those for the admission of North Dakota, Montana, and Washington Territories into the Union. The special order for Tuesday, at 2 o'clock, is the Union Pacific funding bill, popularly so-callfd. Tuesday and Wednesday in the House will probably be devoted to the consider ation of bills on tbe calendar in what is called the "consideration morning hour,' the privilege of calling up bills resting with the Committee on Indian Affairs, and the pending measure being that for the settlement of claims of the Old Settler band of Indians. Thursday is tbe day fixed by Democratic caucus resolution fur the consideration of the direct tax bill, but it is still a matter of surmise whether or not the caucus pro gramme wiil be adhered to. CAISINFT GOSSIP. Tue Pacific Coast Certain to Be Repre sented—New York's Squabble. Washington, December 2d.—The impres sion is constantly gaining ground that Gen eral Harrison will give the Pacific coast a representative in hia Cabinet. This belief is strengthened not by anything General Harrisou has said, but rather from what he has not said. The President-elect has prob ably expressed himself with greater free dom to Senators Allison and Spooner than to any of the distinguished visitors who have called upon him at Indianapolis since his election. To neither of these gentle men has he said anything about the per sonnel of his Cabinet, but both arc of the opinion that General Harrison will' recog nk" the Pacific {•lope in a manner lo grat ify the Republicans of that section. Gen eral Harrison is nor unmindful of the splendid battle fought by the Reoublicans in California, Oregon and Nevada, acd of claims which the coast has to be repre sented in the next Administration. The fight over N^w York's representa tion in the Cabinet is waxing so warm here that not a few Republican politicians are willing to predict that the Empire State will have either two members of the Cabinet or none at all. Mr. Cleveland has kept two Nev.- Yorkers in his Cabinet— Mi. FaircbiM and Mr. Whitney—but it is hardly to be presumed that with the Vice President elect from New York, General Hairis-jn would give two Cabinet places to residents of that State. Ei-Senator I'latt, backed by Vice-Presi dent-elect Morton and influential members of the Republican party in New York City, asks to be made Secretary of the Treasury. He requires General Harrison to turn down ex-Senator Warner Miller, who, as the-Republican candidate for Governor of New York in the last election, sacrificed his personal wishes for the benefit of the Republican Electoral ticket. If Harrison appoints I'latt to a Cabinet office he will be denounced by Miller's great personal fol lowing iv the country districts in New York. If he selects Miller in preference to Platt, the letter's following in New York City wilt be up in anus against the Admin ministration. Senator Plumb, of Kansas, said to-day that he heard in New York yesterday that a strong opposition to I'latt, headed by Cor nelius Bliss, was organizing in the Union League Club. California's chances for a Cabinet posi tion after March 4th may depend very largely upon the settlement of this war in New York, as, if two members of the Cab inet are selce'ed from the Empire State, there will be one less position to be given the West. THE 

COMING CONGRESS. The Session to Begin To-Day—The Tarlll and Other Measures. Washington, December 2d.—The second session of the Fiftieth Congress will be called to order at noon to-morrow. There will be a quorum present in both the Sen ate and House, but no business will be transacted, except to appoint a committee to notify the President of the assembling of Congress and to listen to the reading of his annual message. Senator Allison informed your corre spondent to-night that on Tuesday he would call up the tariff bill in the Senate and resume its consideration until agreed to. He hopes to pass the bill before the holiday recess. Then an effort will be made to induce the House to agree upon a compromise that will satisfy both parties and pat the whole subject at rest. The prospects for such a compromise are not regarded as promising. The House Appropriations Committee will report its bills as raoidly as possible. The direct tax bill, the Oklahoma bill and bills to admit certain Territories as States will be brought forwsrJ for spetdy action. IHE 

PRESIDENT-BXECT. A Quiet Sunday lor General Barrlson—A ViHit from Longstreet. Indianapolis, December 2i.—The Pres ident-elect and Mrs. Harrisou attended divine services this morning at the First Presbyterian Church, and listened to a ser mon by Rev. L. M. Haines. The only out of-town caller today was J. T. Loomis, of Washington, who wa3 Press Agent for the National Repnblican Committee during the campaign. To-night General Harrison presided at the fifty-third anniversary of the Indianapolis Benevolent Society. 

GENERAL LONGSTREET ARRIVES. Indianapolis. December 2d. —A late train from the south to-night brought the dis tinguished ex-Confederate General James Longstreet, of Georgia, accompanied by his friends—Hon. E. A. Angeir and Alton* An geir, of Atlanta. They are Rueats of E. C. Attins, and will remain two or three days. It is understood that General Longstreet will hold an audience with the President elect to-morrow. His visit is declared to be purely a social one. What Clarksoo Doesn't Know. Chicago, December 2d.—J. S. Clarkson, of lowa, is here en route to Washington to attend a meeting of the Republican National Committee. He does not believe there will be an extra session of Congress but thinks there will be four or five new State* in the Union before long. He offered no opinion as to the probable personnel of Harmon's Cabinet. The Pacific Coant Delegation*. Washington, December 2d.—Represent atives Felton. Morrow and Vandever ar :ived hereto-day. Mr. McKenna will ar rive to-morrow. Senators Stewart, Do!pV and Miichell are in the city. Biggs and Thompson arrived on Friday. Senators Stanford and Jonesareexpected next week. 

JAWBONE TOURNAMENT. All tbe Big Pugilists Entered-Hard to <iv. v, the \\ iinii-r. New York, December 2d.—Sullivan blus tered last evening about Mitchell. He said he would make Mitchell the same offer Mitchell made Dempsey. "■ I don't want any gate receipts," said Sullivan ; " put us in a room and if I don't do him up why the boodle's his. But Mitchell won't fight; he don't waut to." He further said : vI am here to arrange 1 a match with either Mitchell or Kilrain, | anrt it will not be my fauU it 1 do r.ot do this. I will meeteitherof them forslo,ooo, or as much more as they care to raise, in six months. I will not fight for less than $10,000, but I will fight for that amount or more." KILBAIN DOESN'T OBJECT. Chicago, December 2.1.—" Parson Da- ', vies," Jake Kilrain's maneger. said in effect j to-night tha: Kilrain will fight John L, Sullivan with bare knuckles to a finish, ' under prize ring rules, for $5,000 a side, | within ten weeks. " Richard K. Fox. Kil rain's backer," said Davies, " stands ready at any time to make the necessary depesit, and Kilrain is equally anxious to'hear that Sullivan will agree." HUtli AMI MITCHELL. New York, December 2d.—Tbe World j says : Davies is tryin • to arrange a match between Milchfll 'and Dempsey, to take place is the Chicago Exposition "liuildine, and says in explanation why Mitchell re fused the otfer of the California Athletic Club, that if the California battle resulted in a draw Mitchell would receive only $3,500. of which Kilrain would get half. I On the other hand Mitchell figures the I Chicago receipts at $15,000 and he would get half. .V'CAFFKEV AND KILLER. St. Paul, December 81—Dominiok Mc- Caffrey recently stated that Killen was a cur. and did not want to fight This ex cited the Northwestern champion's ire. and last night he posted a forfeit of $500 for a fight to a finish with McCaffrey for from $1,000 to $5,000 a side, the winner to take the stakes and ail the gate receipts. The mill is to be fought under the Manjuis ' of liueensberry rules, with two-ounce gloves, and to occur at any tiuie McCaffrey may name. AMONG THE BANTAM 3.

A MUSICAL STAR. Komantic Story of a KUing Young C.li- ; lornla Singer Abroad. I.osiwx, December 2d. —The success of; Miss Josephine Simon, of Oakland, Cal., • as a concert-singer, is lometbinß remarka- ; able. She is looked upon by musical peo-1 pie, critics, and those high in society and ' authority as a sjrt of infant prodigy. * The ! managers advertise her as the fifteen-year- : old prima donna from San Francisco. " She I told an interyipwer that she wns born in i Brooklyn, NY V., in 1873. She is a I with a very short, waist, and a fresh, pleas- j ing face. Her wonderful mezzo s-'piano' voice made the great Albert Hall ring, atid ! her Scotch melodies were SO pleasing that ; the audience almost buried her in flowers, i Already romantic stones arc being told ! about her. It is smd that her fniher whs a poor butcher in Oakland, who badkrnpted himself in his < (Torts to give his daughter I « music*] education. He was forced to i leave the town between two days to escape his creditors, and v.ande/ed disconsolate. Th»n the talented giri ramp to bis rescue. She had already begun winning fame and moner with her voice, aud she not only helped her father to cross the oc tan to her, but sent a message to his creditors to the effect that she would pay every cent of his debts IN THE EVENT OF WAR. TheCzir'a IMan for Preparing Warsaw for Any Emergency* Londok, December 2d.—The Daily Tele [irajiU's correspondent at Sr. Petersburg says: " The War Oltice is actively organized in a homeogenous plan for defense in the event of war. The Government has sanctioned the iilan proposed by General Gourko to supply Warsaw with BDOOgh provisions for 50,000 people. The remaining 35,000, con sisting of Poles mid Jews, will b3 expelled from the city and left to their own devices, in the event of war. With this decision vanishes the Poles' last hope of reconcilia tion." The Cost of Smoke in London. Professor (handler Roberts estimates ! the weight of the smoke cloud which daily I hangs over London at about fifty tons of j solid carbon, and 250 tons of carbon in the form of hydrocarbon and carbonic-oxide gases. Calculated from the average result of tests made by the Smoke Vbatement Committee, the value of coal wasted in smoke from domestic grates amounts, Dpon the annual consumption of five mUhom of ■ people, to £2,207.")00. The cost of carta« on this wasted coal is calculated to be j £203,750, while the unnecessary passage of about 1,000,000 horses through the streets in drawing it add seriously to the cost of street cleaning and repairing. Then there is the cost of taking away the extra ashes, £43,000 per year. Summing it all Dp, the direct and indirect cost of the wasted co.il may be set down at £2,600,000, plus the additional loss from the damage done to property, caused by the smoky atmosphere, estimated by Mr. C'liadwick at £2,000,000, the whole aggregating £4,600,000, or $23. --000,000. Culture Leads to Simple Dress. A marked feature of our times is the in- { creased simplicity in dress. In spite of an occasional monstrous whim that gets em bodied in style, both the habits of ladies ' and gentlemen are more quiet and iess pre- j tentious than fifty years ago. .Men's bwi- ' ness suits are on a pattern brought down ! to absolute economy in expense and fitness j for work. Xor are dress suits character- . ized by any of the superfluities of the last century. Clergymen have given up not only the wigs and bands and cocked hats of a hundred .years ago, but the tall hats, the invariable black and the white tie of ! fifty years ago. The Judges no longer ! wear scarlet, faced with velvet. Wigs, i stocks, {Kjwders and pomatums are less and i less important. A gentleman of 1800, j when he went abroad, must appear in ; satin embroidered vest, a wig and satin ' small clothes, with white silk stockings, j Culture does not lead in the direction of elaborate adornment of the person.— Globe- I' crat. To Wed an English Major. Nice, December 2d.— A villa has been taken here lor ihe season by Mr. and Mrs. Huston of San Francisco. Great prepara tions are being made for the marriage ot their daughter to Maj )r Blunt of the Eng lish army. The Major owns a villa at lily, and has a handsome income. At the Rate It Is Going.

A Tennessee Farmer Assessed for His Deviltry—Dynamiter Hro nek Convicted—Etc. [special dispatches to the record-union.] TWELVE YEIRS. Bronek, tbe Chicago Anarchist, Must Go to the Penitentiary. CniCAOO. December 2a.—At the conclu sion of the arguments in the HroDek dyna mite case last evening Ju.!>re Collins at once charged the jury. The Judge's charge was quite lengthy, and its reading occupied fully a half hour. At ten minutes past 9 o'clock the jury retired. At twelve min utes to 10 o'clock the announcement was made that the jury had agreed. The verdict was handed to the Clerk of the Court, who opened the paper and read : " We, the jury, find the defendant guilty as charged in the indictment, and fix his punishment at twelve years in the peniten tiary." A" friend leaned over Hronek durinjr the delivery of the verdict. He looked up with a pleasant smile and said. "Ich verstene." His face bftrayed no evidence of disappointment or fear. WILL HAVE A WHOLESOME EFFECT. Chicago, December 2 i —The verdict of the jury iv the dynamite case, at a late hour last night, sentencing Hronek to twelve years in the State Prison, seems to fully escablisb the constitutionality of the Act of Jaly, 1887, providing a penalty from any improper u»e of dynamite in experi menting with or teaching others how it could be used. The defense in this case sought to prove that the dynamite came into Hronek'o hands before the passage of the Act. The general impression prevails that the de cision of the jury in this case will have a wholesonin restraint on dynamite plotters, and that the backbone of anarchy in this city is about broken. A GALLANT DEMOCRAT. Mojur O'Brien, of Boston, Makes a Ver mont Girl Happj. Bostok, December 2d.—Mayor O'Brien porcbaaed a large turkey on Wednesday. When his cook was preparing it for the Thanksgiving dinner a wad of paper was iHscoveieil inside, inclosing a note from Kat ■ Gillette, a young school-teacher of East Randolph, Vt., complaining that she had no watch, and hoped that some good Repnblican into whose hands the turkey might fa!l would send her one. Gallant Mayor O'Brien purchased a val uable gold watch acd sent it to her, saying he could forgive her dislike of Democra.s becausi of the onesided State in which she lived, and hoping that she would accept the watch from a life-long Democrat and the Mayor of Boston. , ANTI-CHRISTIAN. Reasons Given for BstabUyliing Anarchist Sunday Schools. Chicago, December 2d.—Three hundred persons held a meeting st the Aurora Turner Hall this afternoon for the purpose of effecting a permanent organization to support the so-called "Anarchist Sunday schools." The object was accomplished. Stveniy of the people present signed the roll of membership on the spot. The feature of t!i« meeting to-day was the gen eral denial tliat the schools are anarchistic or socialistic. The plea was made that they are simply anti-religious. One of the leading radicals voiced the ! sentiment of the meeting when he said : " This is an attempt to remove our children | from the demoralizing influence of the ! Christian Sundayschoois, and its baneful 1 effect 00 iheir minds, making them stupid [and top lazy to think, instead of develop i ing their Intellect." THE 

HALL SCANDAL. A Wife Who Does Not Fear a Drnnken Husband's Threats. Chicago, December 2d.—Mrs. Pauline Hall was seen by a reporter yesttrdav as she was starting for a bicycle ride from "the I residence of her sister-in-law on Michigan | Avenue. When asked what she thought I of her husband coming over from London to "stir up" things, she said: " I rsally do not care whether he conies or not. My case is strong, and lam not afraid of any uncomfortable relations he proposes to make. He was a habitu.il | drunkard, and until I applied for a divorce I was unable to buy any luxury for myself or family, owing to bis constant demand on my purse." GOT IT BAD.
