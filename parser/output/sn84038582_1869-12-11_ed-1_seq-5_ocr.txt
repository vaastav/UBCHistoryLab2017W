OTTAWA FREE, TRADER: SATURDAY, .DECEMBER 11. 1869, FROM WA8HNQT02Y. COXfcftBM Met ftt 12 o'clock on Monday, a quorum btv ingjrt$ent in Lot V houses. The day . was stormy and disagreeable, and the attendance of visitors unusually email. None of the hotels of the city are full, and tliu lobbies are nearly empty. The ''third house," however, are on hand, and there is said to be no end of the jobs they are ready to press upon congress. After organizinij and sending the usual com niittecs to the President, both houses were kept waiting iunriy two liourd beforo the Presi dent's i:ie.i:Lr arrived, which was read very quietly, its reading creating no surprise, as speculation and gossip had anticipated its leading points. The proposed further perse cution of Georgia elicited a ripple ol radical applause, while tho adverse views on Cuban recognition were received with disgust by the "Cuban lobby." After the reading, the mess age was referred to the committee of the whole in the house, and laid upon the table and or dered to be printed in the senate. 

BILLS. Among the bills thus far introduced the fol lowing are the most notable : In the Benate; by Mr. Drake, a bill to pro hibit the Supreme Court hereafter from declar ing unconstitutional any act or joint resolution of congress. In fact, the bill proposes to make congress the supreme power in all cases, and If that body should abolish the office of Presi dent and set up a king, there would be no remedy but in revolution. This infamous proposition was appropriately iollowed by another from Mr. Sumner, depriving the court of the right to grant writs of haoeat corpus. By Mr. Morton : A bill for the reconstruc tion of Georgia, on the plan shadowed forth in the President's message. By Mr. Trumbull : A bill prohibiting mem bers of congress from signing recommenda tions of candidates for appointment to office. By Mr. "Warner : A bill to relieve certain persons therein named of political disabilities. An informal debate on this bill in the senate on Wednesday seemed to leave no doubt that congress intends to pn3 a bill relieving politi cal disibilitics generally ia the south, and abolishing all test oaths. In the house, about the first bill introduced was one by Mr. IJutlrr, to repeal the tenure-of- office law. This was Butler's ret at the last ssion, and he seems determined to "put it through." On the same day a bill prepared by the cen sus committee was introduced, and as the passage of this bill before the new year Is al most an absolute necessity to enable the next census to be taken during the year 1870, the houitc has spent the greater part of each day einec in its consideration in committee f the whole, A bill to extend the Hoe Tress patent was killed in the house- on Tuesday by being promptly tabled. This may possibly, howev er, be intended only as an invitation to the Hoe Tress company, which is Immensely rich, to "shell cut." Tm: 

FINANCES. It is somewhat singular, that notwithstnnd ing all the talk about the finances, specie pay ment, and the like, not a single finance bill, properly so called, lias yet been introduced. There appears to be a general hesitaucy on the part of congressmen to approach the subject, although in regard to a precipitate resumption of specie payment, there is among members al most a universal opposition. This tune, how ever, may be materially changed when the bondholders' lobby gets to work. CAPITAL KKMOVAL. The St. Louis capital removers are on hand with quite a formidable lobby force, while the people of the District are in consternation, particularly in visw of the fact, that the Presi dent in his message wholly omitted any al lusion to their affairs. It is the first message in 25 years that failed kindly to commend the District to congress for liberal appropriations. The citizens of the District count the President among the removers. 

GKOKOIA. The friends of Georgia are indignant at the proposed renewal of the political oppression of that state. Tho Chif Justice who decided that the negroes were illegally excluded from the Georgia legislature, for which offence Georgia is now te be punished, was no oth er than ex-governor Joe Brown, the very man, who during the canvass when that legislature was elected, made stump spent lies to prove that under the constitution of Georgia then to be voted upon, negroes were not eligible. Young Brennaman, tried at Morris during the present week for the murder of kis father several months ago, was found guilty, aad sentenced by the jury te the penitentiary for life. The de fence net up for him wan insanity, but the jury couldn't nee it iu t.at light. The town ef De Kalb, De Kalb oeunty, ou the 4th inst, votod by a large majerity in favor of a subecriptien of $75,000 te the stock of the Belvi dero and Ottawa Railroad. Besides the fact tliat ice is lighter than wa ter, there is, says an exchange, another curious thing about it which many persons do not know perhaps namely, its purity. A lump of ice molted will becomo pure distilled water. Water in freezing turns out of it air that is net water, salt, air, coloring matters and all impurities. Frozen pea-water makes fresh water ice. If you freeze a basia of indigo Hater, it will make ice as clear and as white as that made of pure raia water. When tfca celd ia very sudden, theae fereiga matters hate o time to Utape, th by rising of stoking, aad ace thus aafcaglti mt&ta ice, but do cot taak y pZ Cf it ' rORIOHJIBW8, The steamer, .Mopwcht witU the remains of George Peabody, willjwil for America on Son day, the 12th. Her cabins are draped with black cloth and white silk. . 'J For the first time in the world's history the President's message and the report of the chief finance minister of America were transmitted to Europe by telegraph and published in Lon don and Paris within twenty-four hours after their delivery to congress. The English prets is rather sparing in its comments en the mess age. L'pon the wholo, its tone upon the Ala bama question is regarded as friendly. The Nr infers from It that America wants indem nity lor her feelings Tatiinr than for her pocket. This it thinks may be pven.' Diplomacy may oil the friction and remove a sentimental grievance without compromising British in terests or pride. Mr- Boutwell's plan for an early resumption of specie payments is generally applauded. ' - Spain, Rumors of Carlist conspiracies are again rife. The Carlist Chief, Palo, has been con victed of treason and sentenced to death. In the Cortes on the Oth, Gen. Prim stated that since the commencement ol the Caban rebellien H vessels of war, two iron clads,and nearly 40,000 troops had been sent to Cuba. Half. The Ecumenical council was opened at Rome on Wednesday by the Pope. An enor mous crowd tilled the Vatican aad lined the streets threugh which the members of the council passed. Tho pope, followed by 700 bishops, proceeded to the hall of the council amid the ringing of bells and thundering of cannon. The holy father was in line health. The London 1'imet reports from Rome that "thiigs augur ill for the council Gallicaniam is rampant. The Austrian and German bish ops demur to the dogma of infallibility, and discord is apprehended among the Italians. Antonelli shakes his head at a procession in which he never felt any sympathy." tOn the same day this august council met at Rome, the congress of Deists met at Naples. Austria. Austria meets an unexpected obstacle in the way of suppressing her Dalmatian insurrection. She is unable, except at the immense cost and laber of crossing the Alps, to send troops te that country without passing through Turkish territory. To this the Prince ot Montenegro stoutly demurs, and the Prussian government sustains him. iiTnlir, November Kth, by Her. Geo. B. Kort, af-. A. M. t M M RUM A N, of Harrisburg, Pa., to Ml
