POST-INTELLIGENCER. MXATTLE, Til VRS OA 1, It EC. 10. THK PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. The president's message, which is pub lished in full this morning, begins with a *®view of the work of the state depart ment, which the events of the year have tendered exceptionally interesting. Re ciprocal trade arrangements have been entered into with Brazil, Spain and San Domingo. The terms of the arbitration of the Bering sea controversy have i>cen agreed upon between Great Britain and the United States, and it only remains to ■ agree upon the arbitrators to complete the convention. Germany, Denmark, Italy, Austria and France have opened their markets to American pork products be fore our legislative threat to exclude from Mir markets the products of any country perpetrating unjust discrimination against the products of the United States. The president truthfully describes the lynching of the Mafia at New Orleans as a discreditable, as well as deplorable inci ient, an offense agr.inst law and human ity, and points out that through the iaii nre of congress to make offenses against?' the treaty rights ot foreigners, domicj&>d in the United States, cognizable ig, the federal court, the United Statea courts have no power in cases to intervene •Ither tor the protection of /the foreign Citizen or for the punishment c f his s i a y. •rs. The president thinks that the federal government is anaweratf le for the ads of the officers of the charged with po lice and judicial j n cases where it would be if the United States had exercised power to define and npih crimes against treaty rights. W In the ma£f cer Q f Chile our government •Imply by the policy which it in listed ujm,n on the part of Europe during war. The Itata was seized for jf Violation of our neutrality laws, broke her arrest and put to sea; but her surrender f was promptly ordered by the junta of the eongressional party. No official complaint •f the conduct of our minister to Chile or our naval officers or of the policy of our government has been made. For the out rage committed upon the sailors of the Baltimore our government has notified Chile that it would expect full and prompt reparation. The reply of the Chilean sec retary of foreign affairs was offensive in its tone, and the government is now awaiting on adequate and satisfactory response to its demand for satisfaction. The president announces that under the direction of the inter-continental railway commission nearly 1,000 miles of the pro posed railway has been surveyed, includ ing the most difficult part, that through Ecuador and Southern Colombia. The president strongly recommends the equip ment of Pearl harbor in the Hawaiian Islands as a United States naval station. Our government has officially remon r strated with the czar of Russia against the harsh measures now being enforced against his Hebrew subjects, measures which Within a few years will expel 1,000,000 of persons from Russia and increase an emi gration to the United States that will stri ps ouslv affect our labor market. , N -. The construction of the Nicaragua feanal is a matter of supreme commercial Interest to the Pacific coast, and the presi dent declares it a matter of the highest concern to the United States that this canal should be speedily built. The gain of freight to the people and to the govern ment of the United States in the use of f naval vessels by tin* short water commu nication between the Atlantic and l'acitic would soon pay for its cost. President Harrison commands the assent of every Intelligent man on this Coast when he de clares his entire agreement with United States Senator Morgan's opinion that "the Ni caragn* canal is the most important subject now connected with the commer cial growth and progress of the United States." This view of the Democratic sen ator from Alabama was identical with that of Senator John Sherman, and with the leading minds of both the gTeat parties of the country in exact accord upon this subject there would seem to be no good reason why congress should not push this grea* work rapidly to com |;v, pletion by a government loan, like that granted the Union Pacific railroad. The |t| president favors the guaranty of the bonds of the canal company by the United States, which would give them a ready ■ale at par as a 3 per cent, bond, thu* s.iv- Ing the marketing of the bonds at a heavy discount which would retard the rapid con struction of this great national commercial T . waterway. . The president deems the Nicaragua canal of such transcendent in terest that the government would t>e fied in securing it by direct appropriations from Its treasury. The guaranty of the bonds of the canal company to an amount necessary to its completion could be given without any serious risk of ultimate loss. The president makes a humane appeal to congress to provide legislation that shall > protection of our federal courts to American labor upon the West Indian Island of Navassa belonging to the United States. At present the discipline main tained upon this island is as barbarous and despotic as that of a convi, t camp. The president urges that the protect m of our federal jurisdiction be at once thrown about American labor yn the island which is now governed only by the arbitrary vxul m of the Navassa Phosphate Company. mm- International copyrigl '- has been s. cured IK with Belgium, France, (ireat Britain and HI Switzerland, while wit* Germany a special m convention hS3 KM** 8 al that country within the reciprocal benefits of our legislation. Concerning the tariff, the president says that the evil prophecies of its opponents have not been fulfilled, while in a large measure the §ct has realized the hopeful predictions of its friends. Our total foreign commerce, imports and exports, from October 1, I**o, to .September 1, 1891, exceeds the largest in any previous year, that of 1890 by over $100,000,000. Our im ports of merchandise for the. year are 111.000,000 over the imports of I*9o. The value of free imports for the year exceeds that of lA9O by $118,092,3*7; and there is a decrease of |l'V>'>l t 3oß in the value of dutiable imports. The percentage of merchandise admitted free of duty during the year is larger than during any prior fiscal year in our history. Our exports lor the year ending September 30. I*9l. show an increase over the exports of the previous year of nearly $<53.0 

H.OOO, which is three times the average annual increase of exports during any year of our history. The president believes that the new tariff has created several great indus tries which will within a few years give employment to several hundred thousand American working men and women. The Uriff, despite the reduction of revenue by placing sugar on the free list and the re duction in the volume of dutiable imports leaves the treasury with an ample surplus, actual and estimated, up to June 30, 1593. The president would not disturb the exist ing silver act of July, 1890. Under it the government is now buying and putting out of the market what is the equivalent of the entire product of our silver mines. Under the present silver act every dollar of the treasury notes is sued rests on a lull dollar's worth ot" silver bullion deposited in the treas lry, and Vhe treasury department is aule to the parity in the use of coin.. r.ars and their paper representatives coin age would be disastrous, fq*» as the presi dent says, "While the/' money lender would protect himself * r , y stipulating tor payment in gold tb.e laborer has never been able to do The president is a bi-metallist, w \y' j 3 ready for a full coin use of silver jJift. as soon as the co-operation ol othgv nations can be secured, and -,r ra tj o fixed that will give cir culation equally to gold and silver. VT bile there is no present prospect of an international conference and agreement there is a growing sentiment in Europe in favor of a larger issue of silver. The amount of money in circulation March 1, 1889, was $1,404,1305,890, while on the Ist of December, 1891, it had increased to $1,577,- 202,070. One-half of the per cent, bonds have been extended at 2 per cent, and the rest were paid on presentation. The revenues of the postoffice depart ment show nn increase of $50,000,600, while an estimate for the year 1891 shows a surplus of receipts over expenditures. The president urges the completion of a first-class modern navy adequate to the protection of our citizens and our com merce in all seas, and to the full defense of both our Atlantic and Pacific coasts. On the subject of irrigable lands the president points out that without prompt legislation by congress and state legisla tures private corporations will have unre stricted control of one of the elements of life, and the patentees of the arid lands will be tenants at will of the water com panies. The president holds that the United States should part with its owner ship of the water sources and the sites for reservoirs, whether to the states and terri tories or to individuals or corporations, only upon condition that will insure to the settlers their proper water supply upon equal and reasonable terms. The president renews his appeal for pro tection to railroad employes by the enact ment of a law requiring of every railway engaged in interstate commerce the equip ment each year of a given number of its freight cars with automatic couplers and airbrakes and couplers to be used. The closing portion of the message is devoted to the presentation of an exceed ingly able and statesmanlike argument, urging the elimination by constitutional amendment of government l>y "gerry mander" from national politics. The ac tion of the Democratic legislature of Michigan is made the text of the president's argument in favor of a "constitutional amendment which will secure uniformity and prevent that disgraceful partisan jug glery to which such a liberty of choice, if it exists, oilers \ temptation." The president urges that we take, by consent, one step in the direction of re form by eliminating the gerrymander, which has been denounced by all parties as an induence in the election of elec:ors of president and nietnliersof congress." The president concludes this timely and exceedingly ai le protect :> viinst our alarm ing drit't toward coveruinent by "gerry mander" as follows: Ail the state* hr, >€®n acting frei-'.T and separately at.i have determined that the choice of electors by a general ticket in the wise*t atid ■licit ir.ettifl, »i;id it w J »■ m that there could beno objection u> a constitute >:ial amend ment msk n; tha'. mc:!i'M ivrmnaent.

The power of centres* .» a-;ii>le to deal with ih;s threatening and intolerable abuv. The message is long, but could nit well have been shorter, and in arrangement and composition is a memorably able state paper. Without a trace of partisanship it Is nevertheless a powerful plea in justifi cation of t iie policy and administration of the Republican party. 

I'KNSION!*. The report of the Secretary of the In terior shows that under the act of June, 1890, granting pensions to soldiers and sailors incapacitated for the performance of manual labor, and providing for pen sions to widows, wives, children or de pendent parents, thousands of disabled veterans have been relieved, stricken since the days of service, or who. through lapse of time, can no longer prove their disability to have been incurred in the line of duty. Its benefits have a : io been ex tended to many thousands more of widows, orphans and dependent parents of such veterans. The pension roll June 3U, 1891, was 076.100 strong, and probably today is not far from 700,(XK), or 150,000 more than was carried on the rolls at the close of the last fiscal year. This dependent pension act probably marks the limit of pension legislation for the future. The lead ing men of the O. A. R., like General Alger and Judge Vearey, discourage in their public addresses any attempt to persuade congress to grant a service pen sion without discrimination to every man whose name, lor a long o; short term, was borne upon the roils of the Union army whether he today is sick or weil, self-sup porting or indigent. A general service pension bill of this indiscriminating char acter would be equivalent to asking con gress to enact extortion and extravagance. Everybody knows that out of the 2,250,- 000 to 2,500,000 men whose names, from first to last were borne on the roll of the Union army there were at least a million of men who were obtained when volunteer ing ceased, the draft became necessary, and the evil days of substitutes, great bounties, bounty jumpers, desertion and re-enlistments were upon us. Of this million of mercenaries thousands did gallant service, but there were also thousands who were skulks on the battlefield, hospital shirks, deserters, fellows who came into the Union army for nothing but bounties, pay and rations; the vilest scoundrels and scrapings of great cities. These creatures suffered no hardship or peril they couid escape; they came into the army too late for the fight ing of 1863 at Gettysburg at the East (yr Chattanooga at the West, and the are that having escaped the three yvars of service from May, 1861, to May, 180t. their ranks are fuller today than'the ranks of the million of men that the government obtained by volunteering before the draft and big bounties became necessary to get m< n. Under a. service pension every man of these sccundrels and deadbeats would become u life charge upon the govern ment. The government today is obliged to (fare for them when they are incapable of ,self-support by manual labor, but the prospect of a service pension to men who ntfver rendered any service they could I'vade or desert is intolerable. A service pension to surviving veterans entirely capable of self-support would be an unjust burden upon the hard-working labor of the country. The nation has done more than stern justice already; it lifts been generous, and it is time to call a halt on pensions. Nearly a generation has passed away since the war. The pen sions charge per capita in 1871 was 87 cents; in 1889, $1.74. In 1871 the pensions came to $34,443,894; in 1891 the pensions amounted to $ 106,493,000; and the total pensions for the year ending July 1, 1892, are estimated by Commissioner Raum at $116,000,000, or $9,000,000 less than the con gressional estimate and appropriation. The pension bill for 18U3, it is estimated, will not reach $150,000,000, and from that time forward the commissioner estimates there will be a reduction In the ex penditure for pensions, but this pre diction of Commissioner Raum can not possibly be verified if we repeat the legislation, whose bad precedent was established when a Democratic con gress enacted the Mexican war service bill, thousands of whose beneficiaries never saw Mexico and thousands of others are possessed of a competence. A service pension would be a most in tolerable act of unjust legislation; its enactment will be impossible, we believe, and ought to command the inflexible oppo sition of every thoughtful, patriotic veteran in the land. These are the views of the wisest and most sagacious chiefs of the G. A. R. as we find them publicly and privately expressed. 

SUGAR FACTS. The following figures will answer the in quiries of a correspondent concerning sugar: The United States produces of cane sugar from 125,000 to 140,000 hogs heads. The product of Louisiana for 1884-85 was 94,500 tons. Our annual maple sugar product is about 15,000 tons. Louisiana consumes about 70 per cent, of her sugar crop. As long ago as 1874-75 we imported over 630,000 tons of sugar, and our sugar imports for IS9O were 2,934,011,- 500 pounds, valued at over $96,000,000. The cane sugar production of the United States is confined to Louisiana, which is too far north to make it a first-class sugar producing country, as may be seen by the fact that the island of Cuba, without half trying to develop its sugar-growing capac ity, produced in 1884-85 over 627,000 tons of cane sugar; the other West Indian islands produced 300,000 tons; Bra zil, 269,000 tons; Java, 310,000 tons; Manilla. 203.000 tons; the little island of Mauritius, in the Indian ocean, produced in ISB4-85 over 203,000 tons as against Louisiana's 94,5f)0 tons, and De merara, in Guiana, South America, pro duced 100,000 tons. Germany produced of beet sugar in 18 v 4-S5 over 1,155,000 tons; Austria-Hun gary. 558,000 tons; France, 308,000 tons, and Russian Poland 387.000 tons. The United States cannot at its best pro duce over 100,000 tons of cane sugar an nually, while its annual consumption of •ugar will exceed 1,000,000 tons. The to tal annual consumption of sugar by the United States fifteen years ago was over 800,000 tons, and the figures of our sugar it p rts for l-:«0 which we have given in pounds show that our annual suc;ar con sumption largely exceeds 1,000,000 tons. Our Louisiana sugar makers as a rule use all the latest improved scientific methods of sugar culture and sugar making, while Cuba does not, and yet Cuba with little effort produces six times the annual pro duct of Louisiana and markets it ail in the United States. Our Louisiana cane sugar erowers, our boot sus;ar and maple sugar makers, since sugar was placed on the free list, have been paid a bounty, which for the year has amounted to between nine and ton millions of dollars. The people have, after paving this bounty of ten millions to our domestic sugar growers, made a net saving of nearly J."*),000,000 by placing sugar on the free list. We cannot raise our own sug.tr, for the climate is against it. Louisiana raised 25,000 tons as ear.y as 1*1?, and with ail her growth of population, improved machinery and processes of sugar making she has never raised more than 100,000 tons. We are too far north for cane sugar making; what we may yet do with the beet su:rar industry can only be deter mined by thorough trial extending over a number of years, but at present sugar is not a competing industry and is there fore properly placed on the free list in our tariff, which, however, allows our domestic sugar growers a bounty.
