A HUGE FIBE. Strobrldge't Largs Lithograpblo Works atr Cincinnati Consumed by Fiames la Lest Than Forty Minutes. A Fireman Falls Thirty-five Feet From a Ladder. Joseph Jacobs Burned to Death Tenement House. In a Several Firms Damaged In Dolnth by J Fire and Water. Cincinnati, Dec. 1. At one-thirty fc"i uiornme a general alarm sounded and called the entire fire department to the btrcbridge Lithographing conv pany's great building, on the northeast corner of Elm and Canal streets. The flames devoured the entire building, and in less than forty minutes the walls fell in. The loss is total and will Jrobably be not less than $250,000, but Sy some it is estimated as high as uauamuiion. htrobridge & Co. have t an insurance of $150,000, in forty differ ent companies. The fire started j in the second story, but no one knows how. There is a bare suspicion (, of incendiarism. The Strobridge com ,'pany have an office In New York and ' one In . London, England, but their work is done here. The building was Irne structure, five stories in height and hunting over a hundred feet on the north of Canal street. It was filled with costly machinery including fifteen lithographic presses. ' Its stock of paper and of finished and I partly finished work was very large, estimated to be $100,000. Most of the , winter work for theatrical companies r was finished, but a large portion was still in the building and a number of theatrical companies will be without material to properly bill their plays. Among those suffering in this way are Charles A. Iloyts three com panies: "The Tin Soldier," "Rag Baby," and "Hole in the Ground?' Mlcheal Stroeoff, Kiralfgo Aladdin; Montgomery Fhister's "Soap Bubble," and Forepaugh'a and - Barnum's circuses. The work for the latter, however, had not advanced very far. The scene during the fire was starling. The height of the building, combustibility of its con tents and substantial style of its struc ture served to make the fire fierce but comparatively slow. It burned floor after floor and the falling of heavy lith ographic stones gave sounds like the discharges a battery. Later the falling of the walls sent sheets of flame and showers of sparks high into the air. During this part of the catastrophe Fireman John Shuler, who was on a ladder thirty-five feet from the ground, missed his footing and fell to the pavement. He was taken to the hospital, with injuries which may prove fatal. The business is probably the largest of its kind in the world. One hundred and twenty five men were employed. Mr. Hines Strobridge, president of the company, says he thought the building fire-proof and is astonished that it should go as it did. Within the building as tenants, were James Bar clay, job printer, and a Halstead stock ing company. Their toes will be about $10,000 each. The best estimate that can be made of the total loss is about $300,000, on which the insurance is $150,000. But the loss on business during the time of enf orrced idleness cannot be accurate ly estimated. The building may be regarded as a total loss. The portions of the walls left standing are worthless. The fire is still burning slowly, at 10 a. m., and the engines are throwing water on it. 

THREATENED BY A MOB. Frederick, Md., Nov. SO. Since threatening revenge. Several of them have been locked up for their talk and efforts to raise a mob to do violence to Sheriff Luther and others. Several well-known citizens, who were believed to have had something to do with the lynching, received anonymous notes warning them that their lives were In danger, and that the brothers of Bigus would be revenged. Nightly the ex citeaent was increased until last night there were several hundred strange ne groes from the surrounding country in the city, and they were in an ugly mood. There are four or five hundred ne groes residents of Frederick, who, with the negroes from the outside, make a formidable mob. At midnight the an gry negroes were marching the streets carrying heavy sticks, and the more drunk among them cursing like de mons. Some of them were declaring that they would burn tne jail and iree the prisoners. The town authorities are powerless, and the mayor has or dered out the Fredericks Kinemen, a militia organization. These, about 100 in number, armed with Winchester rifles, are guarding the jail and the sheriff's residence. The dooways of the jail have been barricaded. The negroes seem to direct their vengeance against the sheriff, who they declare. did not properly try to protect Bigus rrom tne lyncning party. AN

The mystery surrounding the murder oi isaviu xvanaaii iasc nignt deepens. The entire lack of a known motive forms the subject of the deepest per plexity. The victim was showing the occuDHnt of a room a lot of ttrtm h bought, when suddenly a stunning ex plosion occurred and a section of lamp shade fell. The family at first thought that the lamp had exploded. The vic tim after the explosion still sat in his chair. Ills cane clasped in his hands,' resting between his knees, but his bead was bent forward on his breast, and when they reached his side he was dead. The boy says he left the house fifteen minutes before the murder os tensibly to go to Montague Citv to viBit some of the boys. He states with precision the very second he reached here, and tea hour he left, most too exact for belief, and this suspicion is shared by the state detectives, who have the case in hand. Shortly after noon the son was arrested, charged With murder. An attempt was made to poison tne old gentleman some time ago, Dut railed. There was $40,000 in surance on Uandall's life, and there are whispers that a probability of his willing this to his sister may have prompted tne son to do the deed. . triple wreck. dutisi aioui.. ssqv. au.wrnera m ft triple train collision this morning b thelynlngor Jn Brs'colorelast ffi ft I Weldon. a white teamster.

The annual report of the commissioner of agricul ture was laid before the president to day. The commissioner recommends substantially the abolition of the seed division of the department, and the transfer of its. duties to the state and territorial and experimental stations. The commissioner indicates a disap proval of the proposition that the de partment should be made an executive department, with a member of the cabinet at its head. He gives a history of the work of the bureau of animal industry, "which was read before the recent cattle growers convention in Kansas City, and expresses regret at the unavoidable loss inflicted on the farmers of Illinois by the cattle quarantine. The commissioner says it is vet too eanv to mage a special statement of the results in detail of the present year's experiments in the de velopment of sorghum sugar manu facture. "But," he adds, "enough is known already, I think, to enable this country to anticipate at an early date the production of a sugar supply from a plant as easy oi cultivation as corn, but little circumscribed by climatic influences, and one whose products have a value equal to the cost of raising." In his chapter upon the Department's experiments in silk reel ing, the commissioner says the experi ments have not yet reached the point of paying their own expenses. but that was hardly to be hoped for with a plant so limited. Another year's experience it is expected, will show what could be done under satisfactory conditions. The commissioner describes at some length i """J1"""""' """f" i cal microscopical, forestry and other I ,:..;; .. v: the work or tne entomological, statist! divisions, and sets forth the usefulness of their accomplishments. He further recommends that the public printer be authorized to furnish to the agricultural press of the country at the mere cost of the labor and material, electrotypes of such Illustrations of the department as the editors may desire, holding that many oi tnese merit a much wider circulation than they can get in the reports of the department. The commissioner says the building of reservoirs among the KocKy .Mountains tor the storage of an immense volume of water wasted should command the early attention of congress. What Am I To Do?

BANES AM) BURSTS. Twenty-fifth Annual Report of tht Comptroller of the Currency, Showinff the Total Number of Na tional Banks Organized. Per Cent cf Voluntary Liquidations and Failures. Increase and Decrease of Capital for the Year. Wakhtnoton. Dec. 2. The twenty- fifth annual report of the comptroller of the currency iis now in print and will be presented to congress on the first day of the session. The report shows that the ' total number of National banks organized up to the 21st of Ucto- Der is o,ouo, oi which oz uavo guuo in to voluntary liquidation, 119 have failed, leaving in operation at that date 3,061. The total number of new banks formed during the last year is zaa. The total number closed during the year is thirty-three, of which twenty five went into voluntary liquidation and eizht failed. The new banks com prise five in the New England, thirty- three in the Middle states, fifty in the Southern states, one hundred and seven in the Central states, and thirty in the Western states and territories. Of the failed banks one was in New England, two in the Middle states, four in the Southern states, and one in the Central states. The net increase of capital for the year is $3,572,325. On the other hand, there is a net decrease of $50,495.510 in the circulation, repre sented bv bonds. The decrease result ing from the surrender of circulation by banks- still in operation is $57,770,475, and the decrease caused by banks going into voluntary liquidation and failing is $1,274,380, making a gross decrease of $59,044,855, which is offset by a total increase of $8,549,265, which consists of an increase by the formation of new banks of $4,592,090; an increase of cir culation by previously existing banks to the amount of $3,957,175. The affairs of hve failed banks nave been closed during the year, including among them one ot those wnicn laiiea during the year. In four cases out of the five the creditors have received pay ment of the principal and interest in full and there has been a balance of as sets transferred to an agent of the stockholders. In the other case, that of a bank which failed in 1879, the total dividends amount to 61 per cent. The total amount of money paid in divi dends during the past year is $2,106, 203.41: the whole amount paid to cred itors of insolvent banks since the sys tem has been in operation is $29,434,986 upon proved claims amounting to $46, 938.388; the total assessments on stock holders $9,945,250, ot which tne gross collections have been $4,732,569. Very full statistics have been col lected about the state banks, saving banks, loan and trust companies and private banks and bankers through out the country. The suggestions made by the comptroller as to amend ments to the laws are in the form of a code revising and consolidating old existing laws vith a number of chanees, each of which is fully ex plained and the reasons for it are set forth at considerable length. The most important of the changes recom mended is that the minimum amount of bonds to be deposited as security of circulation shall be 10 per cent of the capital of bank3 of not over $250,000 and fJo.wo tor banKs oi wnicn tne capital exceeds $250,000; also that the semi-annual duty on circulation oe hereafter charged only on the amount issued upon bonds deposited in excess of the minimum amount as above. He also recommends that the Na tional bank notes be counted as a part of the lawful reserve of the banks. The restriction upon banks as to mak ing loans in excess of ten per cent of the capital to any one party is modified in respect to loans upon collateral se curity, and the total limit is raised to twenty per cent of the capital and sur plus. The proposed code has been transmitted to every senator and rep resentative, with a modification of the existing laws upon the subject, ar ranged in sections parallel with those of the proposed code, accompanied by a letter explaining each ot tne more im portant changes and giving the reason tnereror. CARLISLE'S VIEW ON THE SUBJECT. Washington. Nov. 30. The Post to-morrow morning will print a series of interviews with nearly a hundred members of congress, upon the ques tions which are to be presented to that body for its action during the coming session, and particularly those relating to the tariff reduction of the surplus revenue, and a postal telegraph. The Post will summarize tne interview as follows.: Speaker Carlisle states the democrat ic position with great clearness. His views are especially important in view of the great responsibility which will be placed upon his shoulders with the organization of the house. He be lieves in an immediate reduction oi tne surplus revenues now pouring into the treasury. He believes in reducing the taxes which produce these revenues at least $70,000,000 annually. His demo cratic followers who voted with Mr. Morrison in the last congress, general ly take the same position. Democrat ic reDresentatives for Minnesota and Michigan have the highest confidence that their two states can be made democratic upon the revenue reform issue. Many ways of reducing the surplus are suggested. The democratic sentiment is larcreiv in iavor oi increas ing the free list; adding to it salt, lum ber and the necessaries oz me. Representative Bvnum. of Indiana. thinks that the republicans of the west and northwest are beginning toieei that they cannot longer oppose tariff reduction with political safety. Representative Turner, of .Kansas. comes forward with a new proposition to subsidize exported grains. Views on the postal telegraph are both divers and interesting, uniiKe tne tarnr it is not a party question. The represent atives who favor it are numerous. Representative Wade, of Michigan, is in favor of a government telegraph and wants the government to appro priate $10,000,000 for the purpose. On the other hand the arguments against the government ownership as given by Mr. llutton, or Missouri, Mr. wise, of Virginia. Mr. Merriam, of New York, and a number of others, are that the eovernment ought not to increase its civil list by 50,000 operators; that the government ought not to go into pri vate business, and that the scheme is unwise and undemocratic. All of the congressmen, however, with one or two ;;nns otpb that a strnnff nrpsaiir I exceptions agrw tnat a strong pressure I will made to hriniy the mattpr will be made to bring the matter be fore tbe present congress, and they seem willing to devote some time to a thorough discussion of it. Not a single doubt is expressed by either democrats or republicans as to the nomination of Presideut Cleveland, and tbe democrats are certain of his election. The unanimous sentiment is that the democratic candidate for vice president must come from the west. The Indiana congressmen favor Gov ernor Gray. hit. ilas has some friends in Texas. The Illinois delegation is divided between Black and Stevenson. The republican congressmen usually favor Mr. uiaine, aitnougn the Ohio repre sentatives mention Mr. Sherman as a very likely choice of the party. Repre sentative cannon, oi Illinois, who was chairman of the judiciary committee when the republicans controlled the house, thinks Mr. Blaine could carry his state better than anybody else but he says that unless the republican candidate can carry New York the party will be defeated. call for a democratic caucus. Washington, Nov. SO. A call for a caucus of democratic members of the house of representatives to meet next Saturday evening for the purpose of nominating officers of the house to be elected next Monday, baa been pre pared and will be authoritatively pub- lisnea to-morrow.

Hey. Dr. Giesy, of the Episcopal officiated. ENTER-STATE COMMERCE COMMISSION. Washington, Dec 2. The first an nual report of the inter-state commerce commission has been laid before the secretary of the interior. It is a printed document (exclusive of tabular appen dices which are not yet ready,) of forty- wree pages ana Dears tne signatures oi an tne commissioners. After dwell ing briefly upon the magnitude of the interest which the act undertakes to regulate, the commission devotes a dozen pages to a historic sketch of the country's transportations facilities from the pack horse and dug out of the early days to the mammoth institutions of the present. tracing back to their origin all those grievances and abuses which finally led to tne passage oi tne inter-state act. Under heading "The Carriers Subject to its (the act) Jurisdiction" the commission expresses the opin ion that the express busi ness done by the. railroad com panies themselves is within the act. Whether the express companies which are independent of the railroads are within the contemplation of the act is more doubtful. In regard to the sleeping car companies, live stock car companies and oil companies which transport in tank cars the commission say that they are as much subject to the temptation to discriminate as the railroads are and the fact is laid before congress for such action as It may choose to take in the premises. The long and short haul clause is exhaustively discussed, together with the reasons of the com missioners jf or temporarily suspending the provision in certain sections and they say in part: "The considerations which were influential in determining when these temporary orders should be granted were not more the relief of the carriers from danger or less than the prevention of threatened dis turbance of business interests in certain localities, which by its reflex action seemed liable to embarrass seriously the entire coun try." Reviewing the railway opera tions during the period which has elapsed since the act took effect, the commissioner feels warranted in saying that while less has been done in the di rection of bringing the freight tariffs into conformity with the general rule prescribed by the fourth section than some persons perhaps ex pected, there has neverthless been a gratifying advance in that di rection and there is every reason to be lieve that this will continue. The com mission, after quoting that part of the twelfth section, which empowers it to enquire into the business of all "com mon carriers," says: "This is a very important provision, and the commis sion will, no doubt, have frequent oc casion to take action under it. It will not hesitate to do so in any case in which a mischief of public import ance is thought to exist and which is not likely to be broueht to its attention on complaint of a private prosecutor. There is every reason to believe, how ever, that some of the most senouB evils, which were notorious in the railway service before the passage of the act, and were in the legislative mind as reasons for its en actment, have now almost ceased to exist. One of these was the giving of special and secret rebates. Complaints of unjust discrimination and the giv ing of undue and unreasonable preferences by the open rates are still frequent, and it is not to be denied that in the existing tariffs there are many rates which, as com pared with others made by the same carriers, seem to be unfair and op pressive, but even as regards this species bf injustice the good effects of the law are manifest. Being now com pelled to justify their rates when called on, the commission finds that it makes the managers more cautious about do ing justice." On the subject of com plaints, the report says that in a ma- Jority of cases either the complainant las been found to be mistaken in his facts, or if wronged it has been through carelessness or mistake of an agent, which was readily corrected, or if the facts presented a case of dif ference of opinion the parties, when brought in communication succeeded in finding Borne basis for settlement without further investigation. This, method of disposing of com plaints is believed by the commission to be more useful than any other. The commission urges the desirability of a uniform freight classification through out the country, but doubts the ability to reach the matter by legislation. The commission says: "Tne pooling of freights and railroad earnings so far as the commission has knowledge or information on the subject, came to an end when the act took effect, but pooling was only one of the sev eral purposes had in view in forming railroad associations, the leading asso ciations have been dissolved, but have continued their existence for other ob jects. IN THE PRINTERS' HANDS. Washington, Dec. 2. Secretary Fairchild completed the preparations for the annual report to congress.

It will be made public immediately after its pre sentation to congress Wednesday after noon. The President's message will be sent to congress Monday. 

HARPER'S CROOKEDNESS. Development in tbe Celebrated dellty Bank Case. HABFEB(S TRIAL. Fl- Cincinnati, Nov. 30. The trial of . I. Harper was resumed to-day in the United States court a longtime after the appointed hour, owing to the absence of a Juror, who obtained leave last night to go home and arrange his business. The first witness was J. W. Hoyt. a broker of this city, whose testi mony gave in detail numerous transac tions in the buying of wheat in Chicago by him.. When asked for whom he was acting, he answered that B. . Hopkins, the assistant cashier of tbe Fidelity bank, made the purchases, but the settlements were always made by is. Lt. Harper. These transactions be- gan in January. They were ordinary speculators' purchases, where no wheat is ever seen, out settlements are made accordidg to how the market runs. Robert M. Orr, assistant cashier of the American Exchange Bank of Chi cago, was called to identify the draft referred to by Mr. lioyt. Mr. tckert. of Wiltshire, tckert & Co., of Cincin nati, followed. He testified to the deal with Kershaw & Co.; and other Chicago firms from January last till June, and said they .sent about 1,000,- ooo to Chicago to -tversnaw & jo. When asked where he got the money he could not tell exactly. He supposed it came from parties interested in the wneal aeal- lie Was men Shown some I siened bv himself and Wilt- ! cucuuj nigueu uy uuuaeu mm iffc- He was then shown some shire, and was asked again where the monev came from. He said: "All I had to do when calls were made on us was to go to the Fidelity bank and give our check for the amount. Where the money came from I dont know. When these checks were drawn we did not have that amount in the bank. W. Wiltshire, partner of Eckert was next called. He indentified checks ag- rating $1,300,000 drawn by J. W. rViltshire and indorsed by Wiltshire. Eckert & Co. tie srid that either him self or Mr, Eckert had endorsed the checks. He said there was an under standing between him and Mr. Harper that these checks should be protected. He made it clear that he acted in all this wheat deal as the agent or broker of x.. Lt. narper. wtlshtrk on the stand. Cincinnati. O., Deal. The Harper trial was resumed this morning with J w. wiisnire, a goon looauig broxer. on the stand. His testimony, in chief, had been oi the most direct nature. showing that he had purchased for Harper in tne cmcago market about 20,000,000 bushels of wheat of which they were noiding i4,ouo,ooo when the crash came last June. The loss repre sented by the breaking of their corner was from $3,000,000 to $1,000,000. He said ce never could ten exactly what (he total loss was for the reason that his Chicago brokers bad never render dered any account showing what had been realized on closing out their deal. In every way he made it clear that Harper was his principal, that his checks on the Fidelity Bank were not against any balance there to his credit', but that he was given to understand. that they were to be protected by Harper. When it came to the cross examination Wilshire promised to be loaded for more than one kind of game, iiis statements to-oav will sause some squirming in other quarters. Nearly the first question asked by Major uiwiwuu lot tne aeiense Drought out the fact that Wilshire had deposited checks aggregating 300,000 on First auonai lianx of this city and 895,000 on the Merchants Bank with the Fidel ity Bank, where they were treated as cash. He had not that amount of money in those banks at the time the checks were drawn, but he did it because he was in structed to do so by Harper, whom he supposed to be abundantly able to uu.o caiB oi tne eneexs. Said Blackburn, looking the witness squarely in the eve: - "Tell me now, here are checks on the x ii bl national to tne amount OI K250.- iwin . . ' ww, urawn oy you may z. itssi. How much money had you in that bank at that time?'' Wilshire, reddening a little and look ing at the floor, said: i can t tell." "Well, was it $10,000?" "Don't remember." "Don't you know it was not as much as $10,000?" "Perhaps it was not." " iet you drew for SOOO?" "Looks that way." said the witness. looking with a smile at the documents in Major Blackburn's hands. ".Now," said Blackburn, "do you call that legitimate business?" "1 don t call it illegitimate.' "What, puttinir -out bocrus checks with no money behind them?" i did not know what Mr. Harper had done to protect them, and I looked to him for protection," was the explan ation, which was more satisfactory to the witness than to the others who heard it. At this point the court took a recess till the afternoon. Mr. Harper is still attended by his wife and her sister, and gives close at tention to all that transpires. He has watched with eager interest the face of this witness, bis broker, who has, in plain words, laid bare the entire trans action. EXAMINER POWELL'S STORY. Cincinnati, Dec. 2. The Harper trial opened with the usual crowd of spectators, and the same groups of at torneys and reporters about the tables. Mr. Schofield, of the First National Bank of New York, explained the ac counts of his bank with the Fidelity, stating among other things that the Fidelity general account showed a credit of $500,000, while their special account showed a dehcit of 9o00,ooo. But he answered to the court that it was the agreement that the special ac count was not to be drawn upon. Mr. Harper showed more than usual feeling during this witnesses' testi mony, and shook his head vehemently as he made a suggestion to his coun sel. Bank Examiner Powell, who was the government's agent in closing the doors of the Fidelity last June, told his story, how he was begged by Harper to pass exaiiiiuabiuu, tuiu was mcu oa&eu to telegraph to the comptroller of the currency for authority to not make ex amination, but he still refused. He then found tell-tale memorandum checks as cash representing $600,000. ttriggs bwiit, president, said ne never knew of them till then. Harper, when asked for an explana tion, shrugged his shoulders and walk ed away in silence. Mr. Yowell, discount clerk, showed that discounts to the amount of $142,- 000 were made between January and June, but most of them remained un collected. The defense then drew from the wit ness, in spite of the efforts of the gov ernment counsel to prevent it, a state ment that W. H. Chatfield, one of the directors of the bank, was the one in whose name discounts appeared as late as June 13th. The witness made comical efforts to withdraw his hasty answer by clapping his hand to his mouth, but the story was beyond re call. W. A. Lucins, general bookkeeper, testified to a letter of advice from a party who had no funds in the bank. Harper took that letter and draft, and it next appeared in Harper '8- account, with his endorsement. The cross examination of Mr. Lucius was continued without producing any thing interesting. Mr. Quinlan, of the Chemical Bank of New York, was recalled to testify about whether the draft upon his banx ior ku,uuu, mentioned in his testimony yesterday, had gone to Harper's individual ac count or not. He said he had received telegram that would enable him to answer, but the evidence in that form was ruled inadmissable. Paul D. Ashbrook, a smooth faced boyish witness, stated that he was the individual book keeper of the Fidelity National bank, and had charge of the accounts from A to J, which of course included Mr. Harper's. It was concerning this that he was called to testify. He said iiarper s account was frequently over drawn. At one time in May it was overdrawn $16,000. He indicated overdrafts at the time they were made in Harper's account but after they were made in the account of Harper & Co. Witness read the fluctuations of Harper's and other accounts in which he was interested rrom January to June. Nearly all were overdrawn. At one time after the failure witness had marked the overdrafts Dr." in red ink. Usually overdrafts ran for a short time, but Mr. Harper had told him these were to run for some time. Witness was not sure that Harper had instructed him to omit the Dr." m these overdrafts. C. J. Kershaw, the Chicago broker. was recalled and identified a number of letters of advice signed by Hopkins, assistant cashier of the fidelity Bank; also a number of telegrams signed Fidelity Bank relating to transfers of money by the Fidelity to the American .Exchange .National sank of Chicago. When the district attorney called Briggs Swift there was a murmur of expectation, for this is the name of the venerable president of the late r ideiity Bank. A tall, straight man with white hair and beard, both scanty. walked with almost youthful step to the witness stand. This was Briggs Swift, a man who had lived more than his three score and ten years, and who has spent all of his business life in Cin cinnati with never so much as a stain upon his business integrity until the merciless hand of the government placed an indictment upon its rccorus agaiuat mm uiuug wnu Harper and other officers of tbe bank. There are few business men in Cincin nati who could conceive of Briggs Swift doing a dishonorable act, and there was much curiosity as to bow he would talk when called as a witness Almost the first question produced laughter. He was asked if he knew his bank was engaged in a wheat deal. I did not" was his blunt answer. ne then went on to say that he asked Harper in January last, if he was in tbe wheat deal, and Harper said he had not a dollar in it. "Later I Bent him a letter asking the same question, and he re plied by letter saying he had no inter est whatever in tne matter, and it any man said ne naa ne was a liar. After wards I often spoke to him about how he always contracted the rumors that he was in the deal. When the public began to suspect that Fidelity Bank, and I wan ted to restore commence, l went to the bank with Mr. Richard Smith, of the Gazette, who has known me for years, and together catechised Har per on tne subject. we put him on the stand and he denied it. Then Mr. smith, upon my assurance and upon Harper s express statement, wrote an editorial denying that the Fidelity Bank was mixed up in tbe affair. This was but a few days before the iaiiure.

Pelletan made an address to a num ber of deputies who congregated out side the chamber, advocating the elec tion of M. Sadi-Carnot, thereby uniting the republican votes. Several deputies rejoiced that it would be the first time the majority had lowered to the will of the minority, and added that the atti tude of M. Brisson and Sadi-Carnot was unworthy of republicans.

President Leroyer replied, "I take my stand on the constitution." M. Michelin wished to propose to revise the con stitution." The president again de clined to allow M. Michelins proposal to be made and the latter entered a protest. The matter was then dropped. The balloting ior election oi president began at 2:15 p. m.

Dun & Co., in their weekly review of trade say: Speculative booming and commer cial embarrassments, anxiety abroad and uncertainties connected with the meeting of congress have made" up during the week nearly all the specu lative market. There is a furious ex citement on corners about, and arti ficial advances are forced by powerful L cliques, aiaeu uy an aDunoance ot money, but prices check legitimate business. Industries are hesitating and monetary stringency at many points results in slow collections and some important failures. At Denver collections are fair and money in increased and sharp demand. At Kansas City collections are dull and money close. ax bi. I'aui collections are tairiy satisfactory. At Omaha collections are fair with money easier. At Milwaukee the demand is urgent. the market stringent and collections somewhat backward. At Chicago speculative demands are increasing, and meanwhile calls from the country do not abate. At Detroit business -is somewhat quiet, and the grain trade requiring less than usual, but though money is easier the rates are 7 to o per cent. At Cincinnati the banks nave not money for outsiders, and the market is close 6 to 7 per cent. At Cleveland deposits improve but money is still close. At Philadelphia collections are some what slow. Heavy blocks of paper await sales and considerable New York paper is being offered. At lioston western paper is onereu at 7 per cent., some of it endorsed by banks while the home demand is large. The drv eoods trade is moderate, as usual for the season, without improve ment in woolens. Considerable sales of cassimere at prices only a little be low last year are reported, and in over coatings prices are considered low, but recent advances in cottons are sustain ed in sales. The boot and shoe trade is in good shape, but leather is dull and hides de pressed. jn groceries mere is a large vomme of business, but speculation in coffee has driven out buyers so that quota tions are entirely nominal, and the sugar trust has advanced the price of refined. Iron still hesitates though best erades are scarce and prices at Pitts burg 10 lower for all grades except charcoal. In bar iron there is a per ceptible shrinkage of demand. Nails are dull and lower, and steei ran uuy- ers hold off. The halting in the market for securities continues, partly because of foreign sales partly the result of rate disputes, and partly because late returns show nearly as large an in crease in expenses as in earnings. The wheat market has risen 'i cents, and corn as much with great excite ment. Oil and cotton have been stronger, and the boom in pork products which lifted prices has met a reaction. in an directions speculation is marked bv that excited activity which renders lemtunate dealers cautious.

John Most, the anarchist, prepared a long address to the public in regard to his late trial and conviction, and says as soon as the Chicago anarchists were executed the "capitalistic press" turn on him for their victim. He asserts he has been very careful about talking or writing since his last imprisonment; that false statements regarding his speeches and bogus interviews were published; that Pinkirton's men shadowed him and tried to provoke him to violence. He intimates that his arrest was the result of the visit of Inspector Bonfield, of Chicago, to this city, that it was a police conspiracy, backed by perjury and unfair methods by tha district attorney which caused his conviction. Political BtekeriDK. New York, Dec. 3. A "Washington special says: "Edmunds called on me last week," remarked Secretary Lamar yesterday. 'I suppose he will object to my confirmation if I am nominated for the vacancy on the superior court bench. When Edmunds calls on any body under similar circumstances you may depend upon it that he means to object to his nomination in the senate. I know him of old." A letter received in "Washington last night from Don M. Dickinson says. I among other things: "l nave disposed of my household goods and shall be in ' Washington next week." This seems to remove all doubt as to Dickinson's entering the cabinet. Lincoln's Imprisoned Council.? Washington, Dec. 3. On the 31st day of October last Judge Brewer of the United States circuit court for the district of Nebraska issued a restraining order to prevent the mayor and city council of Lincoln from declaring va cant and refilling by new appointment the othce of ponce judge of that city. The mayor and city counil in disregard of the restraining order removed Par sons and appointed a successor. Judge Brewer thereupon fined them $600 for contempt and caused them to be ar rested and thrown into prison to be there held until they should pay the fine. They petitioned the L nited States court for a writ of habeas corpus and that court to-day granted a rule to show cause why such writ should not issue returnable on the 12th inst. Bsvanue Balder.
