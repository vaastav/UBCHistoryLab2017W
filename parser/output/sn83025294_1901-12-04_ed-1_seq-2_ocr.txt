PRAISES MESSAGE RAILROAD CHIEF OK RECLAMA TION OF WESTERN LANS. PRESIDENT ROOSEVELTS PLAN C. C. Brown of —ake Shore & Michigan Southern Discusses Irrigation of Arid Territory—Tells of Bene fits to Fe Ootained. (By Associated Press.) ' Chicago, Dec. 4.—W. C. Brown, presi dent and general manager of the Lake Shore & Michigan Southern railway, with headquarters at Cleveland, when asked for an expression of opinion on the pres ident's message in regard to the develop ment of the West, said: "I cannot express too strongly my ap preciation of the recommendation of the president, looking to the reclamation of the now arid regions in our Western States and territories by the construction of great reservoirs for the storage of Water. •'The fact that the president favors the Undertaking of this work by the general government is logically the result of his familiarity with conditions in the West and his practical knowledge of the sub ject under consideration. The work of the reclamation of arid lands, under taken in the comprehensive and thorough manner which its importance not only Justifies, but demands, will require a larger expenditure of money than the sparsely settled states of the West can command. Government Money Needed. Money for this purpose expended by the state must be raised by taxation. This is an obvious impossibility, and therefore the only alternative left to the state or territory, unaided by the gen eral government, would be to farm out to great syndicates composed of Eastern capitalists the right to construct the reservoirs, to own their own water and control the land reclaimed. Under this plan the settler seeking a home upon government land must pay tribute to the syndicate thus formed in such amount as the syndicate might elect. •'Each year a new generation of young men is being graduated from farms and villages and cities of the East and Middle West. Men who must find some location for a home and some vocation by which they may become self-supporting. Available Land at Premium. "For years the fertile prairies of Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Minnesota and the Dakotas have attracted thou sands of these homeseekers and home makers. These states are rapidly filling up. Soon they will overflow from the annual exodus of young men who look for attractive, opportunities for securing farms and homes in this territory. When this time comes some territory must be found for this rising westward tide of Civilization. "The one overshadowing cloud, more portentlous than any other today, is the rapidly growing political representation and influence of the great centers of pop ulation as against the country. The hope of the country Is in the 40. 80 and 160 acre farms—thousands of them—owned and tilled by happy, prosperous Amer ican citizens, and in no way can this con dition be brought about so speedily as by the government undertaking at once the work of reclaiming and making fruit ful and fertile the millions of acres of Jand now its property, but absolutely •worthless without water. Advantages of Irrigation. "It is well within the omits of extreme conservatism to say that 40 acres of ir rigated land will produce on an average more than the best 80 acres in the fertile Valleys of the Mississippi and Missouri. Personally I believe that acre for acre, the irrigated land may be depended upon to produce three times as much. "Taking the former estimate, however. Bs a basis and attempt to compute the addition to the material wealth of this country which would result from the ex penditure in this great work of one-half the money which is appropriated annu ally in the river and harbor bill, much of which, to put it mildly, is spent with put hope or expectation of return, and the result will beggar comprehension. Benefits to Be Derived. "But above and beyond the material' ifeatures, consider the moral effect upon the character of the nation of filling the foothills and the valleys of the trans Missouri states with the multitude of Jiardy pioneers and homebuilders that {w ill he attracted by the field thus opened to them. '.'No recommendation or suggestion has ipver been made by a president more im portant than this or more worthy of care

Vienna, Dec. 4.—An article in the Rus sian paper. Svet, on the recent Polish agitation, says the Austrian Poles, who play rather a prominent part in the realm of the Hapsburg, are indignant at the outrages committed iby the Germans in Posen. The harshness of these Ger man proceedings, says the Svet, excuse the Poles to remember that they are a Slav people and that the laws of nature call them to join the other branches of the race in the struggle against a com mon enemy. ENGLAND TO AID HENELIK. Adroit Scheme to Work Detriment to the Abyssinlans. (By Associated Press.) Paris, Dec. 4.—A letter from Jibuti, East Africa, in the Journal Des Débats credits Great Britain with adroitness in her dealings with Emperor Menelik.

London, Dec. 4.—Close upon 60 claims of services, to be performed in the cor onation of King Edward, have been sub mitted for consideration to the court of claims, which meets inthe priv;i council chamber at Whitehall today.

Besides this special claim the duke, it the right of the earldom of Arundel, claims the office of Butler at the ban quet.

The consolidation of the Chicago Rec ord and the Chicago Times-Herald was one of the most important events in the history of modern metropolitan journal ism. People familiar with the newspa pers published in the great capitals of the world say that the best daily papers are made in Chicago, and it is well known that the Chicago Record and the Chicago Times-Heralii ranked at the very front among Chicago's best dailies. Each covered the world's news thorough ly every day, and each possessed also distinctive special features giving It that individuality so attractive to its readers. Now that the two have been combined, all the resources and world-wide facil ities of both papers are united in the Cnicago Record-Herald. It is in truth "a great combination"—a combination without a parallel in American journal ism. The fortunate readers of the Chi cago Record and the Chicago Times-Her ald now receive every day a newspaper whose news facilities are unequaled by any other American newspaper.

BIG 

COMBINE IS OFF IDEA OF STEEL PLATE TRUST ENDED FOR PRESENT. THE PROJECT NOT FEASIBLE Close Corporation Could Not Exi^ Among Firms Slated for Member N >» •. ship With So Many of Promit^ ence Outside the Combination. (By Associated Press.) New York. Dec. 4.—It is authoritatively stated that negotiations looking to the formation of a big steel plate combina tion have been declared off. It is also stated that there is little llkelihoo.i| at present of the project being revived. (t The proposed combine was to have a capital of 825.000,000 to $50,u00,000. and it was generally supposed at the time the negotiations were in progress that the combination was being organized in the interest of the United States Steel cor poration. This view of the case was strengthened by the fact that an an nouncement was made that President Schwall of that concern was giving his counsel and assistance to the formation of tlie trust. Plants Booked to Enter. The plants that were booked to enter the trust were the Tidewater Steel com pany. the Lukens Iron & Steel company, the Worth Brothers and the Central Iron & Steel company. When the combination was proposed it was said the project was primarily taken up. so as to prevent a disruption of the pool through price-cutting, which it was argued would result in a trade war which would soon affect the whole steel indus try. In any event, the fact should not be lost sight of that even if the plans of those interested in the steel plate com bine had been carried to a successful issue it follows that the consolidated company could not 'have been a close corporation. Many Important Outsiders. There are several important concerns outside of those mapped for membership and also outside of the United States Steel corporation. These include ,-tlje Phoenix Iron company. Otis Steel com pany limited, Glasgow Iron company, Carbon Steel company and one or two plants of the Crucible Steel company, besides the Jones & Laughlins, limited. Among the other important concerns which are members of the pool, ,.bu> which are conducted on independent lines, are the Birmingham Rolling Mill company, the Colorado Fuel & Iron com pany. Passaic Rolling Mills company, Re public Iron & Steel company, Cambria Steel company and the Tennessee Coal & Iron company. Made Dean of Yale Law School. (By Associated Press.) New Haven,-Conn..
