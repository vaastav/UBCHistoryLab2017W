DREW-... ...................... Associats Ksrroa Secretary Cameron's Report. Considerable fault has been fonnd with the President's message, because it did not more fully discuss those questions iu which the people are most interested. Our for eign relations, including the complications likely to grow out of the seizure of Mason and Slidell, the President dispsea of in one brief, unsatisfactory paragraph ; while the great rebellion, whose suppression is taxing the nation's powers to the utmost. is passed by with some very obscure we might Bay "obfusticated" remarks. What ever fault may be found with the President's message in this particular, the same cannot be charged against the Report of the Secretary of War. Mr. Cameron plunges in mediae rat, with a directness and positireaesa that leaves no one in doubt as to bis earnestness. or meaning. He first gives us a tabular statement of the strength of onr army. There were rais. ed for the three month's service 77,876 men There have been enlisted, for the term of three year's, 640,637 men. This estimate we presume, counts all the regiments which have been authorized by the Governors of the various States as full, which is not strictly correct, though there is but little doubt they will be ready to take the field in a few weeks at farthest. The estimated strength of the regular army is 20,334. The grand total, regulars and volunteers, foots up 660,971 men, rallied in six months to de fend the honor aad integrity of the Union This gigantic army is divided as follows Infantry, 568,383; cavalry, 69,398 ; artil lery, 27,688 ; rifles and sharpshooters, 8,395 engineers. 107. The secretary has no doubt, from the manner in which the coun try responded to the appeal of the Prest dent for 600,000 volunteers, that the force now in the field could easily have been swelled to 1,000,000. It was considered one of Bonaparte's greatest triumphs, that he increased his army from 200,000 to 414,000 between the months of April and September. Mr. Cameron contrasts this ef fort of the Emperor Napoleon, with that of our Government. He says : At the commencement of this rebellion inaugurated by the attack upon Fort Sum ter, the entire military force at the disposal of this Government was 16,000 regulars, principally employed in the West to hold in check marauding Indians. In April, 75,000 volunteers were called upon to en list for three months' service, and respond ed with such alacrity that 77,875 were im mediately obtained. Under the authority of the act of Congress of July 29, 1861, the States were asked to furnish 500,000 vol unteers to serve for three years, or during the war ; and by the act approved the 29th of the same month, the addition of 25,000 men to the regular army of the United States was authorised. The result is, that We have now an army of upwards of 600,000 men. If we add to this the number of the discharged three months' volunteers, the aggregate force furnished to the Govern ment since April last exceeds 700,000 men. We have here an evidence of the won derful strength of our institutions. With out conscriptions, levies, drafts, or other extraordinary expedients, we have raised a greater force than that which, gathered by Napoleon with the aid of all these appli ances, was considered an evidence of his wonderful genins and energy, and of the military spirit of the French nation. Here every man has an interest in the govern ment, and rushes to its defence when dan gers beset it. By comparing our present ability as a' nation with what Massachusetts did during the Revolutionary war when, out of a population of 350,000, she had at one time 56.000 troops in the field Mr. Cameron concludes, that should an emergency simi lar to that arise, our Government could promptly put into the field an army of over 3,000,000 a force the vastneas of which is unappreciable. The Secretary compliments the troops for the creditable degree of discipline to which they have attained, and is confident they cannot fail to achieve success. He then speaks of the vastuess of the conspirm-y, extending over an area of couu try of 733,144 square miles, with a shore line of 35,414 miles, a coast line of 3,523 miles, and an interior boundary line of 7,031 miles in length. Added to the vast expanse of country included in the insur rection, is the formidable character of the preparations made by the rebels having stripped us of arms and munitions and scat tered our navy to the most distant quarters of the globe, before they struck their first blow. The progress of onr arms is then taken up. The successes of the rebels are frankly acknowledged. The Bull Run defeat is at tributed to a premature advance which the impatience of the country demanded, but " the possession of Western Virginia and the occupation of Hatteras and Beaufort, are j considered as having nobly redeemed our transient reverses." The recommendations of the Secretary are, condensed, as follows : That the Springfield armory be enlarged until it can supply the demand of the conn try for small arras. The establishment of a national foundry for the manufacture of heavy artille ry at Bach point as may afford the greatest facili ties for the purpose. There-organisation, upon a uniform Labis, of the militia of the country. The increasing and strengthening of onr fortifications upon the seaboard and the lakes, and upou oar exposed frontiers. The increase of the corps of cadets in the military academy, and that the increase be taken from the loyal states. Authority to retire Col. Sylvanus Thayer, upon his full pay and enrollments, for his valuable ser vice in the Military Institute. That the systems of promotion in the regnlar service be applied to the volunteer forces in the respective States ; also a change in the system by which regular army of ficers rank volunteer officers of same grade, so that seniority of commission alone shall confer the right of command ; also abolish ing the distinctions between regulars and volunteers. A repeal of the law which prevents the regular soldier from drawing bis full pay monthly; and the payment of a reasonable bounty when enlisting, or an advance of $20 on the $100 dne him on the expiration of his term of enlistment. Limiting the number of aids of Major Generals to those who can be advantage- eusly employed upon their own proper staff. Urging the repeal of the act compelling the War Department to discharge minors on proof that their enlistment was without consent of their parents or guardians. Limiting the employment of regimental bands, the proportion now being being en' tirely too great. The construction of a double track rail road between Washington and Annapolis Junction, with improved sidings and facili ties. Also the construction of additional railroad facilities between Washington and Baltimore. Also the construction of a rail way through Washington from the Navy Yard to Georgetown, forming a junction with the Orange & Alexandria Railroad. The Secretary also suggests that a change be made in the boundary lines of Maryland, Virginia and Delaware, by agreement be tween the States named, such as was effect ed for similar purpose by Michigan and Ohio, and Vtfswntfl and Iowa. The change suggested, is - That the limits of Virginia be so altered as to make her boundaries consist of the Blue Ridge on the East and Pennsylvania on the North, leaving those on the South and West as at present. By this arrange ment two counties of Maryland (Alleghany and Washington) would be transferred to the jurisdiction of Virginia. All that por tion of Virginia which lies between the Blue Ridge and Chesapeake Bay could then be added to Maryland, while that por tion of the peninsula between the waters of the Chesapeake and the Atlantic, now jointly held by Maryland and Virginia, could be incorporated into the State of Delaware. To make the protection of the Capital complete, in consideration of the large ac cession of territory which Maryland would receive under the arrangement proposed, it would be necessary that that State should consent to modify her constitution so as to limit the basis of her representation to her white population. In this connection, it would be the part of wisdom to re-annex to the District of Columbia that portion of its original limits which by act of Congress was retroceded to the State of Virginia. But the portion of Mr. Cameron's Report which will arouse the warmest discussions and excite the people the most intensely, is that devoted to the discussion of the Con traband question. Additional interest is thrown around it because it is now known to have been urged directly in the teeth of Mr. Lincoln's moet positive objections. We copy it in full : It has become a grave question for de termination, what shall be done with the slaves abandoned by their owners oife the advance of our troops into Southernerri tory, as in the Beaufort district of South Carolina. The whole white popnlation therein is six thousand, while the number of negroes is thirty-two thousand. The panic which drove their masters in wild confusion from their homes, leaves them in undisputed possession of the soil. Shall they, armed by their masters, be placed in the field to fight against us, or shall their labor be continually employed in reprodu cing the me-ns for supporting the armies of the rebellion? The war into which this government has been forced by rebellious traitors, is carried on for the purpose of reposaesing the prop erty violently and treacherously seized up on by the enemies of the government, and to re-establish the authority and laws of the United States in the places where it is opposed or overthrown by armed insurrec tion and rebellion. War, even between independent nations, is made to subdue the enemy, and all that be longs to that enemy, by occupying the hos tile country, and exercising dominion ever all the men and things within its territory. This being true in respect to independent nations at war, with each other, it follows that rebels who are laboring by force of arms to overthrow a government, justly bring upon themselves all the consequences of war, and provoke the destruction mer ited by the worst of crimes. That govern ment would be lalse to national trust, and would justly excite the ridicule ol the civ ilized world, that would abstain from the use of any efficient means to preserve its own existence, or to overcome a rebellious and traitorous enemy, by sparing or pro tecting the property of those who are wa ging war against it. The principal wealth and power of the rebel States is a peculiar species of proper ty, consisting of the service or laaor of African slaves, or the descendants of Afri cans. This property has been variously estimated at the value of from $700,000, 000 to $1,000,000,000. Why should this property be exempt from the hazards and consequences of a rebel I lious war? j It was the boast of the leader of the re , bellioo, while be yet bad a seat in the Sen ' ate of the United States, that the Southern QtetuS wnlllr) ha nAimruirjtiraliT aafn anil frM from the barden3 of war, if it should be brought on by the contemplated rebel lion, and that boast was accompanied by the savage threat that "Northern towns and cities would become the victims of ra pine and military spoil," and that "North ern men should smell Southern gunpow der and feel Southern steel." No one doubts the disposition of the rebels to car ry that threat into execution. The wealth of Northern towns and cities, the prodnce of Northern farms, Northern workshops and manufactories, would certainly be seized, destroyed, or appropriated as military spoil. No property in the North would be spared from the hands of the rebels, and their ra pine would be defended under the laws of war. While the loyal States thus have all their property and possessions at stake, are the insurgent rebels to carry on warfare against the government in peace and secu rity to their own property? Reason and justice and self-preservation forbid that such should be the policy of this government, but demand, on the con trary, that being forced by traitors and rebels to the extremity of war, all the rights and powers of war should be exer cised to bring it to a speedy end. Those who make war against the gov ernment, justly forfeit all rights of proper ty, privilege, or security, derived from the Constitution and laws, against which they are in armed rebellion; and as the labor and service of their slaves constitute the chief property of the rehels, such property should share the common fate of war to which they have devoetd the property of loyal citizens. While it is plain that the slave property of the South is justly subjected to all the consequences of this rebellious war, and that the Government would be untrue to its trust in not employing all the rights and powers of war to bring it to a speedy close, the details ot the plan for doing so, like all other military measures, must, in a great degree, be left to be determined by particu lar exigencies. The disposition of other property belonging to the rebels that be comes subject to our arms, is governed by the circumstances of the case. The govern ment has no power to hold slaves, none to restrain a slave of his liberty, or to exact his service. It has a right, however, to use the voluntary service of slaves liberated by war from their rebel masters, like any other property of the rebels, in whatever mode may be most efficient for the defense of the Government, the prosecution of the war, and the suppression of the rebellion. It is as clearly a right of the Government to arm slaves, when it may become necessary, as it is to use gunpowder taken from the enemy. Whether it is expedient to do so is purely a military question. The right is unquestionable by the laws of war. The expediency must be determined by circum stances, keeping in view the great object of overcoming the rebels, re-establishing the laws, ami restoring peace to the nation. It is vain and idle for the government to carry on this war, or hope to maintain its existence against rebellious force, without employing all the rights and powers of war. As has been said, the right to deprive the rebels of their property in (laves and slave labor, is as clear and absolute as the right to lake forage from the Held, or cotton from the warehouse, or powder and arms from the magazine. To leave the enemy in the possession of such property as forage and cotton and military stores, and the means of constantly reproducing them, would be madness. It is, therefore, equal to mad ness to leave them in peaceful and secure possession of slave property, more valuable and efficient to them for war, than forage, cotton and military stores. Such policy would te national suicide. What to do with that species of property, is a question that time and circumstances will solve, and need not be anticipated further than to re peat that they cannot be held by the gov ernment as slaves. It would be useless to keep them as prisoners of war; and self preservation, the highest duty of a govern ment, or of individuals, demands that they should be disposed of or employed in the most effective manner that will tend most speedily to suppress the insurrection and restore the authority of the government. If it shall be found that the men who have been held by the rebels as slaves, are capa ble of bearing arms and performing effi cient military service, it is the right, and may become the duty of the government to arm and equip them, and employ their ser vices against the rebels, under proper mili tary regulation, discipline and command. But in whatever manner chey may be used by the government, it is plain that, once liberated by the rebellious act of their masters, they should never again be restor ed to bondage. By the master's treason and rebellion he forfeits all right to the la bor and service of his slave, and the slave of the rebellious .master, by his service to the government, becomes justly entitled to freedom and protection. The disposition to be made of the slaves of rebels, after the close of the war, can safely be left to the wisdom and patriotism ol Congress. The representatives of the people will unquestionably secure to the loyal slaveholders every right to which they are entitled under the Constitution of the country. Military Itsms. We find the following iu the Indianapolis Sentinel of Saturday : General Buell,in Kentucky, has issued an order forbidding all women, whether the wives of officers or privates, from following camps, or appearing in the vicinity of a field of battle. The Indiana troops in Missouri are at Se dalia, Syracuse, Tipton and Otterville, and all anxious to go to St. Louis and partici pate in the Mississippi river expedition. The New Albany Ledger thinks that Col. Dunham will be appointed a Brigadier General. The 47th Indiana, Colonel Slack, paraded the principal streets of the city yesterday, making a splendid appearance and reflecting, by their soldierly bearing, the highest credit to their accomplished officers. The case of Mason and Slidell is not the only one upon which the diplomatists of the United States and England will have to display their acumen. The offense if it be so considered of stopping an English steamer is counterbalanced by tbe conduct of the British authorities in regard to the Nashville. Tbe rebel privateer, at last ac counts was in Southampton harbor. We pass no opinion on the matter at present, but refer our readers to our foreign die patches as offering ample evidence that our relations with Great Britain are becoming complicated." Cincinnati Gazette. The Adjutant General of Maine re ports that the State has now in tbe service, iu its own regiments, 9,729 men; in forts along the coast, 1,082 men ; total, 10,711. In addition, there are enough men in regi ments now recruiting at home to swell the total to 15,261 men. No account is taken of tbe thousand who have enlisted on the sea.

We regret very much that a paragraph appeared in the Journal of Sat urday, reflecting on the operators in the telegraph office. We are sure it did injus tice, and had the Editor seen the no tice before it wag in type, it would not have appeared at all. It would appear to be high time that Mr. George D. Prentice if he is any longer editor of "that great paper," the Louisville Journal should be at bis post. While be has been East his associate editor has beep, making the Journal as mischiev ous as possible. The article of the Journal on the President's Message is so unwar rantable as to seem perfectly wanton, and has given the traitors in Kentucky substan tial "aid and comfort." Before the Journal receives any further aid and comfort from Union men, it would be well to have tbis matter understood. Cin. Commercial. A Steamboat on Whit" Rivbb! The Worthington Gazette says : We le a that a small steamboat is run ning fron- ewberry to the Ohio k Missis sippi Railroad, making two trips a week. This will enable the people in the lower part of the country to get their produce to market. The iut Intelligencer of the 28th says : The soldiers up in Cheat Mountain have built a very respectable mountain city in which to house tbis winter. When the disadvantages under which the men had to labor are taken into consideration, it will appear that a gigantic work has been per formed. One brigade had no tools except a few axes, one "secesh" auger, one ditto adze, one ditto drawknife, and with this meager supply four thousand men had to work. The greater part of the lumber had to be brought from a distance of half a mile, and that upon the backs of the men. It is a novel as well as a pitiable sight to see from twenty to twenty-five men stag gering along beneath a huge pine, and fairly dropping when they arrive, from pure exhaustion. The chimneys are all substantial stone structures, while the buildings are neatly roofed, and "chinked and daubed" thoroughly. WSf It is stated by the Indianapolis cor respondence of the Cincinnati Gazette that authorities claim here that Indiana will have over 65,000 men in the field this month, making over 89,700 more than her quota, for three years or during tbe war. The War Department will accept no more cavalry. All companies now organizing will be transferred to the infantry. fsjT The Louisville Journal is very sav age over tbe clothing which has been sup plied to the volunteers now in Kentucky, It says there is no plantation in the State where tbe slaves are as poorly clad as were many of tbe companies, and indeed regi ments, of Gen. Nelson's men when they passed through Louisville. Brig. Gen. Davis, late Colonel of the 22d, was an appointee of Gen. Fremont As nearly all of Fremont's appointments have been revoked, Uen.
