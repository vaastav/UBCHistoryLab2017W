On a charge of criminal libel, made by John D. Rocke feller, Jr., S. S. Carvalho, president of the Star company, publishers of ,Wil- liam R. Hearst's New York American, was arrested yesterday and arraigned in police court before Magistrate Finn. At the solicitation of the attorney for Hearst's publication, Carvalho was paroled in the custody of his lawyer until Dec. 26, for examination. Rockefeller's complaint says that an article published la the New York American Dec. 17, "under the Chicago date of Dec. 16, with the headline "J. D. Rockefeller, Jr., Originated Pe onage in Stockade, it is Said," tended to injure his good name, reputatjon and credit and to make him appear ridiculous. . - : Story Mow Under InveNtiKnlion.

Report has it that the meeting , between the president-elect and the speaker brought no agreement" as to - the manner in which the revision of the tariff is to be made. Another re port Is that Mr. Taft is in control o the situation, not at all pleased with , .the deportment of the standpat mem bers Of tho committee and insistent .that there be- a kind of tariff revision " which will be a compliance with the spirit of the party promises rather , than with the mere letter. .The. situation renews the hopes of the revisionists that ultimately the work will he consequential. The value of the proceedings "before tne ways and means committee seems to lie in its revelation of the deceptive policies bf. the leaders and the creation of an opportunity for a frank exposition of , the views of individuals and news papers of all political predilections as to the ' plain fallacies of protection, particularly in regard to such articles as sugar, hides, steel and other trust produced commodities. II Mr. .Taft had wavered in his for- , . Boycott and Bullet. In the good time coming it is quite possible that instead of fighting each other with gens the nations will make war with Lett lie tariffs. The boycott is only a form of prohibitive tariff put forth on individual initiative instead of taking statutory form, says the Philadelphia Record. The Chinese are now carrying on a boycott war against the Japanese. The young Turks are making exasperating ly effective use of the boycott as " a means of reprisal against Austria Hungary. One signal advantage 1n this form of warfare is that it does not involve gunpowder expenditure or the shedding of blood. The Chinese and Turkish govern ments calmly disclaim responsibility for the vagaries of their merchants and traders, whp must be permitted to buy and sell as they choose. " ' " - ; Marked for Death.

But they are not ordering as many water wagona as usual for those states that have gone PfohlbltiOD,"' - - Tou may come in," called Ethel, eyin approvingly the tall, well pro portioned figure in the doorway. "I'm bidiiig." she explained as Chisholm came ' forward. ' "I'm hiding from a maii." "Itemarkable!" was Chisholm's quiet comment as he dropped Into a chair opposite the settee ;n which Miss Spragr.e sat. "I have come here to hide from a woman a woman I never met." Ethel clapped her hands. "Wouldn't it be funny if it happened, that you were running away from me and I were running away from you and we both should bo hiding here together from each other?" "More than likely we are the. vic tims of Mrs. Bayard's well lutentloned efforts," asserted Chisholm. "It is edd that after dodging Mrs. Eayard we should find ourselves lu the same re treat with the common aim of avoid ing each other." "If you should tell me your name," suggested Ethel, "we could find out if we really are the only two victims of Mrs. Bayard's matchmaking craze." "And rob the situation of its piquan cy:' objected thisnoim. ".o, :uiss Miss cr Miss Dimples. I think we will enjoy a chat far more, because we arc not absolutely certain that pres ently we will emerge from our retreat only to be pounc-cd upon by the ener getic Mrs. Bayard, thereupon to be in troduced to each other while the world our ,little world looks on and smiles its commiseration. "Mrs. Bayard means well," declared Ethel, "but it is dreadful the way she joes around introducing people with a look that says. 'Now I have Introduced you young people 1 shall expect you to be married immediately, because you arc perfectly suited to each other.' Every one finds such amusement in Mrs. Bayard's matchmaking that her victims are marked persons, so they come to hate each other." "If she were content with mere hints I it Would not be so bad," continued Chisholm comfortably, "but she Tiad me over here this morning to tell me that tonight I should meet my fate." "And she wrote me," explained Ethel. "It seems that she has three sets of victims here tonight, so as soon as I came I made straight for this flirtation nook. Mrs. Bayard be lieves in flirtation booths to further her amiable ends, and It seemed a clever bit of satire to take refuge In one of her matrimonial traps." "I felt much the same way," assent ed Chisholm. . "Of course some time In the course of the evening I shall have to undergo the ordeal, but I am trying to defer her introduction until the last moment. "This Is the first time that I ever have been warned that 1 must marry. whether or no, and well, I don't sup pose that It would sound right to say that I am bashful, but I don't seem to fancy the Idea." "Which Is ungrateful when Mrs. Bayard goes to such trouble on our account," reminded Ethel. "She gives three or four balls a year just to 'bring Deople tosether.' as. she exDresscsit. just ns though the" people would not find each other if let alone!' comment ed Chisholm. with alaujrh. "Now, I can imagine that lu happier circunk stances I mihf'U-. "V ' "What?" demanded Ethel as Chis holm paused. " "I was going to say," he concluded, "that left to myself 1 ir.i-it perhaps have carried out Mrs. Bayard's wishes through natural impulse and not through a reuse of duty." Ethel colored softly nt the remark, for the meaning was not to be mis taken. Moreover, she suddenly re gretted the matchmaking propensities of her hostess, which had resulted in prejudicing the mind of this new found acquaintance against her. "I remember when I was. a young ster m short trousers." rcm'r.'bctU Chisholm. "that one day my father mixed a pall cf wbitew:::;li. placed a brush beside it and gave uie strict cr-. ders not to whitewash the thh-keu . coops because I did not have the requisite skill. Then , he went down town, and I took chances on a thrash ing to prove that I could do It." "We always want to do tho forbid den things.' assented Ethel. "I sup pose we Inherit the trait from our first parents." ; ?- . ;';v ."It's human nature." agreed Chis holm. "Now, If Mrs. Bayard had said. 'Above all things, keep away from Miss cr Dimples.' I 8honld have hnr.ted tip the introduction the very first thing instead of running off to hide." "And then you' make my acquaint ance the very first thing, ju6t the same." ' "But we are not certain, you knojv." pleaded Chisholm eageily. "You said yourself that there were four other victims. ' " ' (Continued on Pape Eleven.)
