It put the charge just as strong in these words: "To the best of the World's knowl edge and belief each and all of the statements made by Mr. Roosevelt and quoted above are untrue, and Mr. Roosevelt must have known they were tintrue when he made them." The World had beeu talking edi torially of the statement of facts set up bj the president in his letter that declared editors of the Indianapolis News and the New York Sun are liars. The World callb on congress to In vestigate Panama, and says: "Tho investigation of 1006 by the senate committee on Interoceanlc ca nals was blocked by the refusal of William Nelson Cromwell to answer the most pertinent questions of Sen ator Morgan. Since that time noth ing has been done because after Sen ator Morgan's death there was no suc cessor to carry on his great work of revealing the truth about Panama cor ruptions. "As to the detailed distribution of the Panama loot only one man knows It all. And that man Is William Nel son Cromwell. "The two men who were most in Mr. Cromwell's confidence are Theo. Roosevelt, president of tho United States, and Ellhu Root, former sec retary of war and now secretary of state. T

HE IS II "It was they who aided Mr. Crom well In consummating the Panama revolution, arranged the terms of the purchase of the Panama canal, made the agreement to pay 140,000,000 on the canal properties and on addition al $10,000,000 for a manufactured Pan ama republic, every penny of both of which sums was paid by check on tho United States treasury by J. P. Morgan & Co. not to the French gov ernment, ns Mr. Roosevelt says, but to J. P. Morgan & Co." Tlie World was the first paper to print the Panama charges last fall. The New York Post also takes a whack at the president, saying: "Mr. Roosevelt is himself to be come an editor In less than three months, and ho naturally wishes to prepare himself a welcome in the pro fession. "Such an advance greeting to his brother editors will smooth his way. Furthermore, the president doubtless wishes to show newspapers how easy It Is to avoid the weaknesses Into which they too often fall. "Among the chief of these are the temptation to be boastful and clamor ous; to advertise ono's aot and to make a sensation; to be lmmoderato In. language and violent In epithet; to speak first and ascertain the fact afterward. "If any school of Journalism Is looking for a model of the other thing of modesty, of moderation, of ac curacy It cannot do better than take the president's letter to 'Foulke."
