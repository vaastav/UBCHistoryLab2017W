Our Washington dispatches express the confident belief that the bill to confis cate the property (slaves included) of rebels, will pass Congress, and without unnecessa ry delay, and by a majority that will make a veto unnecessary, even should Mr. Lin coln find objections to such a measure. £3?* Warsaw Inlet, at which some of our naval vessels have entered, and by which they have drawn so near to Savannah as to see the steeples of the city,is some miles south of Tybee Island, and enters tbe Sa vannah river above Port Pulaski. The people have fled from the coast in hot haste: even the gallant “ defenders’ 1 fell to show themselves-, and if Gen. Sherman is ready, with the branch expedition of 6,000 men that he had assigned to duty dse where, the city of Savannah may be taken and razed to the ground. We have it in our power. The “blue jackets’ 1 have led the way and had a look at the promised land of Canaan. GKf. HALLECK’S ORDER NO. 3, In the House yesterday, Frank Blair read a letter from Gen. Halleck, reference to ■which, in detail, will be found in our dis patches. Gen. Hallcck expresses himself ready to cany ont any orders that may be given him, but claims for th& one in ques tion a military necessity. What Gen. Hal lock has already done in his department has Inspired new confidence and hope, and the latter largely in the direction of believing that he will see the necessity of using every means to prosecute the war, and the abro gation of the order which turns back upon the enemy a principal source of their strength and power. From this letter the inference is natural as to the paternity’ and birthplace of the order, confirming our earliest conviction that it lay with Gen. Halleck himself to amend it. ENGLISH NEWS. The news from Liverpool, in relation to the capture of Mason and Slidell, is not fa vorable. But the evident disfavor with which the intelligence of the capture was re ceived there, is not unexpected, and is not by any means to be considered as an indication of the temper of the English people. Liv erpool has suffered grievously by the war and the blockade. Among her merchants and ship-owners, a large number arc avowedly in favor of the recognition of the rebel Confederacy by the British Gov ernment—in favor of anything that will insure a revival ot the trade in cotton and the opening of the American market; audit is not wonderful that this affair of the Trent should be seized by them as. an entering wedge to be followed by direct intervention in our affairs. When they ascertain, as they will, that the law of na tions. the decisions of their own courts, and the common sense of mankind are op posed to their pretentions, and that Com modore Wilkes was exercising a right which has never been denied to belligerents, they will find occasion to recede from their unenviable attitude, and wait awhile before they force their “Ministry into another American war. MORE ACTIVE WORK DEMANDED. The following, from the "Washington cor respondence of the New York Evening Post of the 10th, will be read with interest. There is beginning to be manifested a gen eral feeling that this war and its policy is not for and with our military leaders, but that the people have an interest in this matter, and a right to criticise and super vise the expensive work they pay for. Not alone are the people of Kentucky “ heart sick.” in the language of Hr. Holt. "What is demanded is action, a movement, a wip ing out of the rebellion by actual deeds. And this must come. It has tarried over long. Mr. Joseph Eolt is on a visit to his home in Kentucky, and has written a letter here warmly approving the passage of re>-jlutiom» to place Messrs. Mason and Slidell in precisely the same situation that the rebels.have placed Colonels Cor coran and Wood.' He says that the only way of intimidating the rebels is to eho's them that the le {Hamate Government U in earnest and will punish treason. He further writes that the loyal people of Kentucky arc heart-sick waiting for an onward movement of the Union troops lii Kentucky. It is no secret that Mr. Holt also •askatbr an advance here jast as soon as the Gen eral-in-Command considers it prudent to move on ward: The political interests of the connin'. Mr. Holt writes, demand most active vork by the Gov ernment troops. This is the story told by almost ah Kentnckv and Tennessee men mow here. They assert that‘it will be impossible to keep up the public sentiment in cither of those States to the right pitch in favor of the government unless some advance be made. president Lincoln most fnlly sympathizes with this view of the subject. Mr. Holt’s letter, alln tied to above, was communicated to him, and he avowed his opinion freelv that Mr. Holt was right. He also stated that he had frequently expre**ed tf,i* opinion to Gen, McClellan, it is well known in Government circles here that the President and Secretary Cameron favor an early advance of our troops. ’ A 

VOICE FROM MASSACHUSETTS. Massachusetts, who earliest sent her sons to this war, whose troops at Baltimore lost the first blood shed in this unholy rebellion, sends through her Chief Executive, Got. Andrew, an indignant protest to the Com mander-In-Chief, asking that her soldiers be not made slave catchers. They have not left their homes to guard slave pens. And this protest should be respected. No word came from the brave old Bay State when her best blood was poured out like water in the carnage at Ball’s Bluff. She will smother and repress her grief over de cimated regiments that may come back to her, and send fresh levies to take the places of the fallen, in fight; but she does remon- strate when her boys, armed with Spring field muskets, arc set about no nobler er rand catching and returning flying fugitives. Gen. McClellan has promised, so the dispatch says, to order Gen. Stone to •desist. It was under this Gen. Stone and in his division that Massachusetts loyalty and daring have been put aimlessly, and without result, to the severest test this war has known, and from it they did not flinch; but all that Massachusetts desires to inter pose between her boys, and the officer ap pointed to lead them, is tins one request. It will be respected, as it should be. And this is the sentiment of the entire army. Our soldiers loathe the task of detaining and returning the slaves of rebels. Do these orders arise more from the sympa thies of our commanders than from a set tled policy controlling the war, "We hope it is only the Conner, for the lime then will all thf earlier arrive when our army will fall to work to save the Union, and let Slavery take care of itself. In the House, quite a spirited debate took place on the resolution concerning the “ third order” of Gen. Halleck, commanding in Missouri. During the debate, Representative Fouke, of Illinois, declared that it it passed, ail volun teering in the State of Illinois would cease.— WasJiihgtOTi Dvpatdi to the Chicago Times, This man grossly slanders Illinois. Her 00,000 sons have not gone forth to the tented field to send back slaves to their rebel masters, ns Halleck’s order commands them to do.. They have not enlisted to save slavery, but to stare the Union . “Put down the rebellion and let slavery take care of itself” is their watch word. Employ sword, torch, and confisca tion, until the traitors lay down their arms and submit to the Constitution and laws, is tbo sentiment of Illinois and her brave sons. Illinois demands that tile loyal slaves of rebel masters, shall not- be sent back; Umt the Gov ernment shall not continue to sacrifice the lives and waste the treasure of the people to guard, cherish and protect slavery for rebels. Phil. Fouke basely slanders this patriotic State, and he knows it. VOLUME XV. Gen. Buell’s Advance, The advance of the brigades ot General Bu ell’s army, in Kentucky, across Green river, is probably but the forerunner of an advance in force upon Bowling Green. The Cincinnati Commercial says it had been, expected the rebels would attempt to maintain themselves on the south bank of that stream, but it is evident they propose to fall hack on Bowling Green, which they have been busily engaged In rendering a Manassas in strength. Persons - familiar with the topography of tliat section say Bowling Green can he readily turned by a flank movement, and that the rebels will have to come ont and try a fair fight, or run, The advance was required primarily to guard the railroad, since an important bridge over Bacon Creek was, only a few days ago, a second time burned by the rebels, alter a month’s labor in rebuilding it. They were ordered to press forward as far as Green River, and to cross it, if the coast was clear, and this they seem done. Singularly enough, after this bridge had been rebuilt, with a view to the future use of the road in an advance on Bowling Green, it was left wholly unguarded! The irarso b«ing stolen, they have now has tened to lock£the door. But did they expect to advance on Bowling Green as an excursion party in a railroad train ? Shoepff and Zolllcoffer. Reports from the Cumberland river disagree as to the movements of the two armies of Shocpff and Zolllcoffer, whether they arc on the point of a battle or not. It is stated that Zollleoflcr has advanced across the river to attack Shocpff at Somerset; but this is initsdf improbable, as he would then be fighting with a river in his rear; and, besides, it is derived by a statement that after haring thrown a portion ofhis troops across, he recalled them and was making strong Ms positions on the south side. More troops arc being hurried forward to the assistance ofShoepff, and It is probable that the rebels, on their part, arc backing up Zollkoffer. The next battle we shall have to record, if a battle be fought any where this winter, will be on the Cumberland river between those two armies. They were getting down close to the work at last ac counts. A sort of preliminary skirmish took place on the Bth inst., in which Isaac Gilbert, of Company B, Capt, Stone, Soth Ohio regi ment, was wounded, and finding escape from the rebel cavalry impossible, threw down Ins gun and surrendered. His captors murdered him by hacking Mm over the head with their sabres. The 3oth OMo will not take many prisoners if they get a chance at the enemy. In the same aflair one rebel officer was seen to fall from his horse; and the road where they went back was sprinkled with blood. The letter writer says, “Wc can sec the en emy’s camp-fires to-night. We expect a big fight to-morrow or any day.” Major Hclveii and Captain Prince, of Shoepff’s staff, had been taken prisoners. &T Frederick P. Stanton is making a bold push for Jim Lane’s seat in the Senate, under the claim that the latter has technically va cated it to serve in the field, and that there fore his (Stanton’s) appointment by Gov. Robinson is good. It is an old quarrel between Robinson And Lane, apart of which luis been manifested by the election of Crawford, in Kansas, to contest Gov. Robinson’s place. The Lane-Stanton seat will be decided, it is said, on Monday, but we do not sec how it can be decided otherwise than favorably to Mr. Lane. He has received no military com mission from the Government or the State, and has been serving in a voluntary capacity without pay. He was indeed tendered a Brigadier’s commission, and was about to ac cept It, when Gov. Robinson came a snap Judgment upon Mm. This changed his mind. JSf* Great numbers of Union men arc flying from West Tennessee, especially from “Weak ley, Carroll and Henderson counties, into Ken tucky. They have escaped from conscription in the rebel service, and arc desirous of taking up arms for the defence of the Union. These refugees represent the Union feeling in the portion of West Tennessee referred to as strong and growing; the people arc said to be anxious for the arrival of the National troops, and it was thought that a quite general up rising would take place when aid should reach that section. The Hon. Emerson Etheridge goes thither from Washington at once, and will probably bear assurances of coming as sistance. 22T* A letter from a citizen in the western part of North Carolina to a friend in Washing ton passed the rebel lines, and was on Tues day placed in the hands of Gen. McClellan. It brings the clearest confirmation yet received that there is a large and determined organiza tion of Unionists in that Static. They arc putting themselves in communication with the Unionists in East Tennessee, and await only the dawn of hope for a general rising. They expect a reinforcement of Brownlow by the National forces, and will accept that movement as the signal for. their own action. pT On the 7th inst., a serious, if not fatal, accident befell Capt, G. W. Lattenstall of the flag-ship Minnesota, at Old Point. A block of wood, quite heavy, fell accidentally from the hands of a sailor, which struck Capt S. on the head, knocking b!m overboard. He fell a dis tance of some thirty feet, alighting on a small propeller alongside. So serious was the stun and wounds received, that very slim hopes were entertained of his recovery. Should tliis painful accident result fatally, our Gov ernment will lose one of its very best officers. £grGcn. Banks's command and all except Gen. Stone’s brigade of this military division, and Col. Geary’s battalion, who are still posted along the Potomac, have gone to the region of Frederick City, and encamped in that vicinity. About seventeen thousand are thus quartered, but how long they will remain there is not known. They have not yet arranged to go into winter quarters. Some are of opinion these troops will eventually unite with Gen. Kelley, who is at present operating on the Baltimore & Ohio railroad, near Cumberland. The Navy Department invites propo sals for furnishing, fitting and securing to vessels-of-war iron plates fifteen and a half feet in length, to have planed edges and coun tersunk holes, to be bent to the shape of the vessels from stem to stem, and fastened to the timber with conical headed bolts of one and a half inches in diameter. It is under stood that the Department designs to thus clothe the vcsscls-of-war with the least posal sible delay. In the Senate on Tuesday, Mr. Sumner presented a petition from Francis A. Tread way, setting forth that he had seme time ago presented complaints to the Supreme Court against Jeff. Davis and others, hut was told they were improper papers, after he had pre sented the complaint to the magistrate’s court, hut with no effect. It was ’referred to the Committee on Judiciary. The minute and comprehensive report of the Investigating Committee, of which John L. Potter, of Wisconsin, is chairman, now speedily forthcoming, contains a mass of evidence as to the treason in office of a multi tude of employees of this administration which will shock and revolt the country. Groat will he the fluttering when this report sees the light. jjr It is a noticeable change in phraseolo gy that the Southern press now habitually call the Federal soldiers “ferocious Hessians.” Not long ago it was “ cowardly hirelings.” This shows an improved perception based on experience. _ A delegation of citizens of Eastern Maryland waited upon Gen. Hooker recently, to ask what would be done with those who should return, and he replied that they would be allowed to resume their positions as loyal citizens on taking the oath of allegiance. pT On Tuesday, a .pamphlet written by Mr. Eilct, who has figured extensively as a civil engineer, was placed upon the table of each member of Congress. s lt contains a vio lent assault upon Gen. McClellan, but a cor respondent pronounces it scurrilous and malicious. |3f**Gco. H. Silts, of Chicago, has been pro moted to a First Lieutenant, Company, B, Major Barker’s McClellan Dragoons, and P. Puricy Page elected Second Lieutenant of the same company. The Affair at Freestone Point. A favored Washington reporter of the New York Tima witnessed from a balloon on Tues day the shelling out of the rebels at Freestone Point: , Six steamboats belonging to the upper flo tilla were seen near the mouth of Matawan creek. Presently, at half-past ten o’clock, the Jacob Bell, Lieut. McCrea commanding, got under weigh and went within about a thous and yards of Freestone Point. She fired five ten-second shells into the woods, and then put about. Several wagons were seen ap proaching the buildings near the shore where the rebels had some stores. Lieut. McCrea, . of the Jacob Bell, communicated with Capt. Austin, commanding the Anacosta, and both vessels then stood off Freestone Point, where they commenced shelling the woods and buildings. The Harriet Lane, flag ship of the flotilla, Capt. R. EL Wyman com manding, was stationed a mile or more be hind. She fired two ninety-six pound shots. On a line with her, and lower down the river, were the Reliance and the Herbert, with the Stepping Stones immediately behind, all in the month of Matawan creek. This was the position of the steamers, with a sloop lying near, when the cannonade commenced. For an hour and a half the two steamers pour ed shell into the woods. From the balloon I could see the shells burst over the tops of the trees and near the surrounding buildings. Some struck the residence of Mr. Fairfax, situated in a grove upon the hill. Fairfax is said to be a Colonel in the rebel army. The wagons moved away as quick as possible, and several mounted officers scampered off as well. While the vessels were firing into thewoods our gun’s at Budd’s Ferry sent a few shells across. The rebel batteries directly opposite, at Shipping Point, returned the'fire. Several of their shells exploded on this‘side without doing any damage, and one of ours burst right in their upper "batten’. The rebels ran in every direction. The Jacob Bell then went close tothc shore, and Lieut. McCrea, with four men in a small boat, accompanied by another boat from the Anacosta, landed and set fire to tbe buildings near the water’s edge, wMch they said con tained stores belonging to the rebels. One, containing empty barrels, was not bumed. The other buildings were soon enveloped in a sheet of flame. They were formerly used as a fish house, and rented for $3,500 per annum. The boats presently returned to tbeir respect ive steamers, which then fell back and an chored near the Harriet Lane. Gen. Prentiss at Work In North-west ern Missouri. [From the Quincy Whig, Dec. 10.] Reported Capture by Gex. Prertiss. — The St. Joe Journal of Saturday says that it “wasveiy currently reported on the street, yesterday, that Gen. Prentiss captured CoL John R. Boyd’s whole command of rebels, numbering 480 men. Wc do not know how true it is; no donbt Boyd is about here, as wc leam he madea speech atDeKalb last week to 500 men.” If true, we shall hear more about it soon. The Leavenworth Cunscn , aili t e, of the same day, says: “On Thursday Gen, Prentiss left St.' Joseph for Platte county at the head of four thousand men and six pieces of artillery. Before leaving St. Joseph he ordered every citizen to take the oath of allegiance, or go to work on the fortifications, TOO men came for ward and took the oath.” Gen. Prentiss made a speech to his soldiers, in which he boldly stated that he went to Platte county to end secession, and if devasta tation was necessary it should be done. From Benton Barracks* Mo. A letter from Benton Barracks says the 3d Cavalry regiment have received their pay up to November Ist, and that the hoys of company C caused $1,200 to be expressed to their wives, mothers, 1 children, <£c. This speaks well for company C. The writer thinks that the whole regi ment will send over 820,000 to lowa. On December Ist, there were ninety-nine of the regiment unfit for duty, fifty havihg the mea sles, and the rest colds, erysipelas, <fcc. A review of several regiments was held on Thursday and Friday last, preparatory to de parture, but whither was not known, though Cairo was supposed to he the place, and tliat among those to leave were three lowa regi ments, and one or two Illinois. Some of the lowa Second Infantry - thought they also were to leave. The Third Cavalry' Regiment is fully armed and equipped with carbines, sabres and navy revolvers, and with full uniforms includ ing extra caps and India rubber overcoats. Bast Tennessee. The New York Jbst’s correspondence of the 10th, says: Senator Johnson, of Tennessee, is here, and spent several hours with McClellan on Satur day, urging upon him the propriety of pash in gon the JFcdeml column of troops down in toXast Tennessee, to the relief the loyal peo ple there. He is to have another interview to-day upon the same subject. The heartiest sympathy is felt for the loyal men of Tennes see, but the reasons which prevent immediate advance upon Nashville arc purely militaiy. These reasons will probably not exist two months hence—they certainly will not in the spring. Skirmish in Cass County, Missouri, [From the Leavenworth Conservative, 9th.] On Friday last Mr. Etheridge, with thirteen men, all of whom hod been driven out of Mis souri. went back to Missouri to recover his ■ jcrsonal property. They met a superior rebel ; brec and deemed it prudent to return to Kan sas for help. At Olathe, their numbers were increased to 150, and with these they went back to meet the foe. Skirmishing began as soon as our men entered Missouri, and lasted through that day and Saturday. Three rebels were killed and five wounded. The hardest fighting was in Cass county, nca# the Big Blue, and not far from the Kansas line. The rebels were completely dispersed, and the Union refugees succeeded in regaining all their property. Mrs. Hartnnc at Albany—-Disagree ment of Judges—Sbe Is Released. Albany, Dec. 12.—Mis. Mary Hartung,who has been in prison for some three years and a half on the charge of the murder of her hus band, by poison, and who has been twice sen tenced to death, was to-day released from con finement by Judge Wright, of the Supreme Court, on proceedings brought before mm by her counsel. Immediately after her release, which was hailed with enthusiasm by a crowd ed court, District Attorney Slueffcr procured an order for a stay of proceedings from Judge Peckham, and served the papers on the Sheriff, who re-conveyed the prisoner to jail. This coming to Judge Wright’s ears, he ordered Mrs. Hartung to be again brought before him, and entered judgment for her unconditional discharge, disregarding the order of Judge Peckham. She was then set at liberty and was immediately conveyed off by her friends. The affair created much excitement. E5P* Great excitement was caused in Rich mond by rumors of the advance of the rebel armv on tbe Potomac, and anticipations were freely indulged of a battle soon to be fought between the contending forces. The Rich mond papers call Gen. McClellan a coward for not attacking Manassas, and call upon Jefil Davis and the leaders of the rebellion to ad vance and annihilate the Federal troops, and relieve Maryland and Virginia of their presence by the first of the new year. f3P*The inevitable “contrabands” latest report is, that on Friday there was a grand review at Centrcville of seventy-five or eighty thousand troops. He heard the last read by Major J. B. "Walton, of the "Washington Artil lery. There were at the review also one hun dred pieces of artillery—all light, except two 24-pound howitzers. ’Gen. Beauregard com manded, and President Davis reviewed the troops. Generals Johnston, Longstrect and Stewart were also there. Says the Washington correspondent of the N. T. Evening Fost of the 10th: Troops still arrive daily in Washington. Lost week twelve regiments came in. it is expected that as many more will come this week. Yet there is no fighting over the river, and no immediate prospect of an advance. It is rumored, however, that quite a number of the troops here will soon be sent South to operate along the coast. fsy Says a private letter from Kentucky, under date of the Bth inst.: “Iknow by the movements that arc on foot, that we are on the eve of a great battle; and one, too, that will he the hardest fought of this year, and the hottest fight ever known in this country. There will be at least 350,000 men engaged at Bowling Green. Gen. Buck ner (rebel) will have 100.000, and wc will have 150,000. The rebels will fight hard, for it is life and death with them.” There was a distinguished audience in the Senate chamber, on Wednesday, during the Baker eulogies. President Lincoln occu pied a seat on the right of Vice-President Hamlin, while the family of the President had scats in the Diplomatic gallery. Senator Pow ell, of Kentucky, the suspected rebel, had a few moments' conversation with Mr. Lincoln, who had quite a levee in the Capitol after the adjournment- of the Senate. distribution of seeds from the Pa tent Office to Congressmen, to be disseminat ed through their districts, will shortly be made. It has been retarded by rcasorr-of a de lay in the transportation of seeds from foreign countries to the United States. Mr. Caulfield, manager of the Govern ment’s railroads, has made arrangements for a through train from Hew York to Washing ton every twenty-four hoars for recruits, who will not be permitted to occupy the express train. On the 15th of last month an estimate was made of the sickness in the army, when it appeared that General Banks’s Division vae the healthiest by a considerable per centage. V* ■>

[Special Dispatch to the Chicago Tribune.] Washington, December 12, 1881. Officers high ih rank are renewcdly protest ing against the present inactivity of the army, aud arc urging an advance. The army is rap idly losing what it has gained, iu this long continued idleness. Wm. H. Johnston, of the Lincoln Cavalry, whose trial wc noticed last night, has been sentenced to be shot, and will be executed to-morrow at an hour to he fixed hy General Franklin, the division commanded. His crime is flagrant according to his own confession. He entered the army in order to desert, that he might thus reach New Orleans, where his mother resides. In carrying out his plans, he got beyond our lines, but mistaking our pickets for the enemy’s, he ran towards them throw ing up his hands and crying that he was a de serter. They assured him that they belonged to the other side, took his arms, and said that he must prove his good faith by giving infor mation. Thereupon he told them that they could capture part of our men behind him, where they really were, and gave abundant details touching our strength and position. He was taken prisoner and court martialed as soon as possi ble. A private letter from an officer inFortPick- eus, states that Col. Brown had all his -guns shotted for two or three days, waiting until all the rebel boats that habitually plyed between Pensacola and the Navy Yard were safely at the hitter place, when he opened fire. The result was, two of them, were sunk and others disabled. The Warrington navy yard was burned. The flag staff* of Forts Mcßae and Barrancas were shot away. The loss of life among the rebels is unknown. There was one killed in Fort Pickens and seven wounded. Many shells were thrown at its flag-staff, which was not hit, although the rebel gunnery was unexpect edly good. A shell, three days after it was thrown into Fort Pickens, exploded, apparent ly without cause, and killed six men, besides wounding another. Letters from Port Royal say that from our vessels, riding at anchor in Warsaw Inlet, ten miles from Savannah, the steeples of that city are plainly visible. WcreGcn. Shcrmanready, the city could he easily captured. Deserters and contrabands bring information that all the people on the coast have fled into the interior except Crackers, who arc furious. One de serter said that old Tatnall was so much affect ed while telling of affairs at Port Royal to some ladies at dinner, at the Pulaski House, that he burst into tears. In saying the other day that the majority of the House in favor of Mr. Lovejoy’s confisca tion and enfranchisement resolution, would have been larger had another made the motion, It was not intended to infer that Mr. Lovcjoy was personally unpopular, hut that some members are unwilling to seem to follow one so early in the field. Mr. Love joy, really, goes no farther than the Republi cans. At their last night’Bcaucus,heexpresscd himself in favor of supporting the Adminis tration whether ho deemed all its measures wise or unwise. He knew of no party in favor of making this war one to abolish slavery, and had it been in his power to have inaugurated civil war, and could he have foreseen that the overthrow of slavery would have been the result of that - war, he would have not done it; aud it was therefore unjust to charge upon any portion of the Republican party that their purpose in carrying on the war is to abolish slavery, al though we are for destroying slavery if that be needful in order to put down the rebellion. He was at present content to confiscate the property and liberate the slaves of rebels. No one at the caucus expressed any objections to this policy, and Messrs. Beaman of Michigan, Julian, Colfax, and Dunn, of In diana, spoke strongly in its favor. It is be lieved that the measure, if vetoed, would be passed by a two-thirds vote. The Senate was occupied to-day with the Naval Retiring bill, introduced by Mr. Grimes, of lowa, The only debate was upon the ques tion as to the time at which to turn the old hacks out to grass. In tlie House, Mr. Wickliffe and Mr. May nard pictured the terrible consequences of this -war to the loyal men of Kentucky and Tennessee, speaking in support of a bill or ganizing the Home Guards of Kentucky. Mr. Eliot, of Massachusetts, made an hour’s speech in support of the confiscation meas ure. Both he and Mr. Steele (Dcm.) of New York had too much to say about the causes of the war. Mr. Conway, of Kansas, made a thorough going Kansas speech, and had a little tilt with Colonel Foukc, of Illinois, as to whether the battle of Belmont was a de feat or not. Both Houses have adjourned tin Monday. Senator Sumner read to Mr. Cameron, this morning, a burning letter from Governor An drew, remonstrating against the employment of Massachusetts soldiers as “slave catchers.” Mr. Cameron promised to write to Gen. Stone to desist the practice. The amendment to the Fugitive Slave Law, of which Senator Clark has given notice, is intended to deprive rebels of its benefits, by j providing that the condition precedent to an : application under it be proof of loyalty. The passage of other laws may, however, render its information unnecessary. ■" The court martial in Surgeon General Fin ley’s case has been dissolved; the quarrel be tween him and Dr. Tripler having been amica bly arranged. Secretary Welles has withheld his approval from the court martial's verdict acquitting Commander Chas. H. Poor, tried for letting the Sumter escape from New Orleans. He cannot be tried again, nor can the decision be reversed, but he stands condemned by a court of inquiry, and by the Secretary, of gross neglect and mismanagement. , Two of our men strayed beyond the lines, and in endeavoring to return, were shot by mistake by our pickets. . 

FROM CAIRO. [Special Dispatch to the Chicago Tribune. Caxbo, December 13,1861. A report reached headquarters this after noon that rebel gunboats were loitering below here for the purpose of planting submarine batteries. Commodore Foote immediately ordered the gunboats St. Louis, Lexington, and Tyler to rcconnoiter down the river, and defeat their plans. Our boats discovered nothing further than recoding smoke beyond Norfolk The St. Louis fired shell and shot in the direction of the smote, hut the effect is not known. A grand review of troops was made to-day byGenMcClemand. The troops maneuvered well CoL Dickey’s new cavalry made a fine appearance, and excited general admiration. The storesliip Emerald, of the gunboat fleet, which had been aground for the past few days above Cape Girardeau, arrived last night, safe and sound. The steamer Montgomery, going to the re* lief of the gunboat Bentos, struck the bar at the foot broke in two,and is a total loss. The gnnVoat Benton got dear of trouble above Cape Girardeau, and steam ing confidently for Cainvagain grounded, last night, at Jacket Pattern.* It is thought, how ever, she will be got off and come down to morrow. • Numbers of Jeff Thompson’s men arc ar riving at Cape Girardeau,' anxious to return to their allegiance. FBOSI ST. LOOTS. [Special Dispatch to the Chicago Tribune.] St. Louts, December IS, 1861. An interesting feature of the contraband case before the British, Consul here is that the negro says his mother is hv Windsor, C. W.; while his pretended master says he can prove her here. The 13th lowa regiment left by the Pacific cars to-day; the and field officers alone- knowing their destiny.

HOUSE OP REPRESENTATIVES. Mr. BLAIR, of Missouri, rising to a ques tion of privilege, caused to be read the follow ing extract as farther explanatory of the re marks which he made yesterday on Mr. Lovc- joy’s resolution, having in view the revocation of a part of Gen. Halleck’s general order rela tive to fugitives. The resolution, it has al ready been stated, was Laid on the table. Heaikjuabtees Dbp’t Missouri. To Hon. F. P. Blair, Washington: Yours of the 4th inst. is just received. Order No. 8 was to my mind merely a military necessity. Unauthorized persons, black or white, free or slave, must bekept out of our comps unless we arc willing to publish to the enemy everything we do or intend to do. It was a military and not a political order. lam ready fo carry out mv lawful instructions in regard to fugitive slaves which my superiors may give me and to enforce anv laws which Congress may pass: but I cannot make law aud will not violate it. You know my private opinion on the policyof confiscating the slave property of rebels in arms. If Congress shall pass it. you mar be certain that I shall enforce It. Perhaps my policy as to the treatment of rebels and their property is as well set out in Order No. 13, issuedthe day before your letter was written, as I could now describe it. Yours, truly, H. W. Halle ck. Mr. LOVEJOT, of Illinois, replied, and in conclusion said if any soldiers want to fight simply for the purpose of returning fugitive slaves, he (Lovejoy) had only to remark that the army would be stronger without them. Mr. BLAIR, of Missouri, from the Commit tee on Military Affaire, reported a bill author izing the raising of a volunteer force for the better defence of Kentucky. Mr. WICKUFFE, of Kentucky, who sev- eral days ago introduced the bill, proceeded to show the importance of passing it. Ken tucky, he said, was to be *he great battle ground of this war. The people of that State hoped soon to see the day when the invader’s foot would be expelled from that territory, which is now invaded. Property has* been ruthlessly destroyed and carried off. Homesteads hare been made desolate, bridges burned, &c.; and it is to protect the State’while the army is marched elsewhere that the volunteer force is required. Mr. Wickliffe also said that he had received from the Military Board of Kentucky an ur gent application to call on the War depart ment and ask for just such a corps as the bill provided. He had brought the subject to the attention of the President and Secretary of War, and it met not only with their approval, but of all the Cabinet. Mr. 

MAYNARD, of Tennessee, spoke of a recent sojourn in the part of Kentucky so much ravaged and laid waste by the rebel troops, and would allude at a future time to the distressing condition of affairs in Eastern Tennessee, which he had alone the honor to represent. His people, he said, had been left unprotected by the Government, notwith standing their’ firm devotion to the Union. Ho held’ it to be a duty not only to protect loyal men in Tennessee and Kentucky, but iu South Carolina, and everywhere, as much so, as In Pennsylvania and the adjoining States. After further consideration of the bill, it was postponed till Monday. The House proceeded to the consideration of the special orders, namely tbc various pro positions involving the quasi ion of emanci pating the persons held os slaves by rcbeli Michigan legislature Galled.

The Federal Council of Switzerland had de manded satisfaction from France for a fresh violation of Swiss territory by French gen d’anns, near Geneva.

Bullion in the Bank of France increased one hundred thousand pounds. Capt. Kelson hud entered Ills protest against the capture and destruction of the ship “Har vey Birch,” by the rebel steamer “ Nashville.” ' The Southampton magistrates refused Capt. Nelson a warrant for the search of the ‘‘Nash ville,” and referred him to the Secretary of State. Capt. Pegram and Mr. Tancey had re turned from London together, and that the latter states that it has been intimated to him by a third party, that the “ Nashville” has been recognized by the British Government as a national vessel, and will be allowed to refit and repair at Southampton, as was the case with the “ James Adgcr,”soa3 to exercise perfect neutrality between the two contending parties. Livebpool, Nov. 27.—Most intense excite ment exists here to-day, under the intelligence of the taking of the Southern Commissioners, Mason and Slidell, from the British mail steamer “Trent.” An indignation meeting was promptly held, and resolutions were car ried by acclamation, denouncing the insult and calling upon the Government to maintain the dignity of the flag. Some prominent mer chants were against precipitate action, and Bind the matter had better be left to the Gov ernment The feeling of indignation, how ever, was general. Consols declined in London a half per cent The ship “Helm,” from Charleston, ar rived here to-day with a cargo of rosin and turpentine. The Hansa brings the London Times of the 28th, which contains the account of the meet ing in Liverpool. The following placard was posted on ’Change: '■'■ Outrage on the British fag—Soufhirn Consuls forcibly removed from a British tnail steamer—A public meeting will be held in the Cotton States Room, at 3 o'clock."

This resolution was received with great en thusiasm. The resolution was advocated by the Chairman, who considered he was ex pressing the-feelings of the people when he said it was the duty of the people to press on the Government the imperative necessity of vindicating the honor and dignity of the Brit ish name and flag. Mr. John Campbell con sidered there was reason to doubt whether the facts related and acted on by this meeting were in reality a breach of international law, and referred to opinions of the law of ficers of the crown as being in some measure inclined to show that such a step, as tuken with respect to the Southern Commissioners, was justifiable under the ex isting state of international law, and he urged the propriety of postponing the consideration of the subject until to-morrow. Mr. Tow sus tained Mr. Campbell’s views. The Chairman suggested that to meet the objections of Mr. Campbell to strike out the words “ by requir ing prompt reparation for tills outrage and thus amended, the resolution passed unani mously. Several merchants expressed their views after the adjournment that the meeting and its action was premature.
