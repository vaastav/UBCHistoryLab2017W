The < occlusion from this accrecy seemed irresistible that llie >n.?iructions pven him and the money turn is bed bim were for the purpose of getting > i. Kolliti* out of office, for political purposes. ?ladge I'.iles ruled that the letter of Mr. Rol lins was not pririlcfH from disclosure, as might I avc be? r the ease if it had been a State Depart ment or War Department secret; bnt that being i roved. tlie plaintitt must also show tl*at the de li nilaut acted with malice. The jury by their verdict deco'ed that he acted without malice. Iks Few ts. The Xaay. On' of the provoking causes of the present pgitaticn in England is the fact that the land* of that country are held by a comparatively smail number, who are thus created into a close ar.stoei acy, poMetaing i>eculiar and extensive privileges. It is estimated that out of ber im mense population less than 3J>,000 persons are o? ners of real estate, in even the smallest quan t.ty, ?iiilc 1M> persons only are the possessors of ov.e-balfof all the land in England and three ? owthsof Scotland. For instance, the Earl of 1' readaibaiie can ride on his own property 1?0 utiles fr? m his own house in a single direction. " he I?uke of Sutherland own* the county of the ^ime name, reaching from sea to sea. The Duke of Richmond holtfc possession of 340,000 acres at Gordon Castle and (roo<lwood, and the Puke ot Devonshire 96,000 acres in the county of Derby aione. Of course, the natural tendency under this state of things is a still further gravitation of real estate into few hands. This is shown by the fact that within the last two hundred years more thin T.OOfl.oftO acres of land have been absorbed by or added to estates already estab lished; and the absorption is understood to be going db now at a more rapid rate than ever before. Th*?e are si<rnitlcant facta, and should not be overlooked by those now controling the fntnrc- destinies of this country. At the rate at v? hich the public lands of the I"nited States are beinj voted awav. together with the progress l-eirg maile in the concentration of the railroad* ot the country into few hands, it will not be long rntil we have a ruling class here more g'*<?pin2 and oppress ve than the aristocracy tri-m wl ich tbe peoj le of England are now stnvii g to tree th* nisekes. Wonlerful! the difference of opinion between a :r tit mocratic and republican cotemporarie* it- re tard to the me-*?age' The Patriot thinks it a very poor mosage. It isn't long enough (!) It is too curt- It fails to convey an intelligent view of our national affairs, and so on. The l'*Uint Ei.ii evidently sighs for the good old times when a Presidential message Ailed from twelve to cglitecn columns. In thosetimesa Victim once tietincd it as the depth of human misery "to sit on a cold grindstone and read the President's message." The Pntrivt don't think so. If there L> anything in the world it hankers after it i* a good lon^ message. The republican morning papers think the message an excellent message. It is '-forcible, wi?e. br?iT ess-like.*' & We think the geneial verdict will be that it is a sensible temperate doc-inv-nt, dealing at si fficient length with the large number of sub jects reft rrtd to. and properly suggesting that matters ot particular moment will be dealt wit|> More 1 ullv in s|?ecial messages to Congress, 'v - ? ? ? ?? ? Not withstanding the fre<inent and heavy rain w >th ? bit h this locality has lately bee?i favored, there is now n< arlv as much complaint of scar city of water in the higher parts of the city as ?f;ir.ng the dry and dusty summer season. In tletd. in s. me bonnes hardly enough can be se cured during either day or night lor sanitary ami i nlinrtry purposes. It must be, therefore, cither ibat there is great waste of the preciou fluid iti the lower parts of the city, or that our l-opulation Las increased -o much that the ordi nary ?upply is no longer anywhere near alte rnate tor daily uses. It will be well, in either <a*c. tor the water registrar to take early and efficient strps to stop all leaks ami waste, as those who are thus deprived are getting tired of laying for what they do not get And, above all things, kt th*-work of putting in that new main be pushed forward with all possible haste. 1 nleMt something is accomplished in that direc tum, 'here will be absolute suffering for w ant of wateT in Washington next summer. ? ? ?? ?
