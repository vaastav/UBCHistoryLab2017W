Ha Devotes One-Third of th Document t a DUoustlnn and Harlan of Oar Foralga RelationsFisheries Question HI Reference to the Cuttlnc Case. WAsniNoroif, Dec. fl. President Cleveland' message open with the usual surrey forelgu relation, and one-third of it k devoted to a dlsousslon and review of suofa relation. Our government, he y, ha maintained It relations of friend-hip toward all other power, and of neighborly interest toward tuoe who possessions are continuous to our own. Few question hare arisen during the put year with other government and none of those are be jond the reach of settlement In friendly council Tho cruel treatment of Inoffensive Chinees In the far wast i alluded to and in peaking of a remedy, he says Ue para mount duty of maintaining public order and defending tbe interest cf our own people may require the adoption of measure of r. atrictlons, but they should not tolerate the oppression of Inrlvldual of a special race. Discussing the fisheries question, ao long a subject of anxious difference between the Unltod Bute and Great Britain, the president says the question Involved are of grare consequence, and from time to time, for nearly three quarters of a oentury, hare given rUe to earnest international discus iona, uot unaccompanied by Invitation. Temporary orrangeiueut by trtatiMhare erred to allay friction which, howerer, ha rerlred as wieh treaty was terminated. While desirous that friendly relations should exist between the people of the Unltod State and Canada, the action of Canadian official during the past season toward our fishermen bos snob, tho president thinks, as to threaten their continuance, and although disappoint! in his efforts to secure a settlement of the question, negotiations are still pending with reasonable hojw that before the do of the present session of congrens, announcement made be mode that an acceptable conclusion ha been reached. Alluding to our relations with Hawaii the president recommend an extension for msren year of the reciprocity treaty of 1875, lie urgently renews hit recommendations of legislation to carry Into effect the Mexican reciprocity treaty of January, 1853, and propose to initiate negotiations with Mexico for a new and enlarged treaty of commerce ami legislation. inferring to the Cutting case, be say the Incident has dlidoftsl a claim of Jurisdiction by Mexico, norel in ouo hlitory, wtisreby any offense, committal anywbore by a foreigner, pennl in the place of Its commission, ami of which a Mexican is the object, may, if the offender be found In Mexico, be there tried and punished In conformity with Mexican laws. This jurisdiction was sus tained by the court of Mexico, and approred by the executire branch of that govern ment, upon the authority .of a Mexican statute. The appellate court, In releasing Mr. Cutting, decided that the abandonment of the complaint by the Mexican citizen aggrieved by the allod crime . HMout publication), removed the base of further and also declared justice to have boen astUfied by the enforcement of a small part of the original sentence. The admission of such a pretension, the ' president would be attended with serious results, Invasive of the jurisdiction of the government, and highly dangerous to ourcltieiis in foreign lands, therefor he ha denied It and protested against Ita attempted exercise, as unwarranted by the principle of law and International usage. A sovereign bss jurisdiction of offenses which take effect within his territory, although concocted or commenced outside of It; but the right i denied of any forelgu sovereign to punish a of the United State for an offense con-. suramated on our soil, In violation of our laws, even though the offonse be against a subject or citizen of such sovereign. The Mexican statute In question make the claim broadly, and the principle, if conceded, would mule a dual responsibility in the and load to inextricable confusion, destructive of that certaluty in the law which Is an essential of liberty. When citizens of the United State voluntarily go Into a foreign country, they must abide by the laws therein in force, and will not lw protected by their own government from the consequences of an offense against thuno laws committed in such foreign country; but watchful care and Interest of this government over ita citizen are not relinquished because they have gone abroad; aud if chargod with crime committed In the foreign land a fair and open trial, conducted with decent regard for Justice aud humanity, will he domandod for them. With less than that the government will not be content when the life or liberty of Ita oitlzens is at stake. Whatever the degree to which extra territorial criminal jurisdiction may have been formerly allowed by content and reciprocal agreement among certain of the .European states, no such doctrine or practice was evor known to the laws of thl country, or of that from which our Institutions havo mainly been derived. In the case of Mexico, thera are reasons especially strong for perfect harmony in the mutual oxercise of Jurisdiction. Nature has made us Irrevocably neighbor and wisdom and kind fooling should make us friends. The overflow of capital and enterprise from the United la a potout factor 1 assisting tho development of the resource of Mex- J ico und In building up tho prosperity of both countries. To assist this (rood work, all ' grounds of apprehension for the security of ' person and property should be removed; and the president trusts that in the Interest of good neighborhood the statute referred to will bo so modified a to eliminate the prosent possibilities of danger to the jwace of the two conn trios. I The president recommends placing the consular service on a liettar footing and reiterates the necessity of some mode of inspec tion and report or the manner in which tha consulates are conducted.

Ho recommends that provision be mod for the Immodlate discbarge from custody of persons committed for extradition whore tha president is of opinion that surrender should not lo made aud renew hi recommendation of last year that existing legislation concerning citizenship and naturalization be revised. Wo have, he say, treaties with many states providing Tor the renunciation of oitizenihlp by naturalized ulloni, but no statute Is found to give effect to such engagements, nor any which provides a needed central bureau for the registration of naturalized citizens. discussed Is the tariff, and to this the dent devotes a great deal of space, arguing that the necessity for a reduction of tha j tariff is more urgent than over. The lncom of tbe government, ho says, by it Increased volume and through economies In H collection; h now moro than ever in excess of public necessities The application of tha lurplus to Die payment of such portion of the as la bow at ear option abject to extinguishment, If continued at the rata which ha lataly prevailed, would retire tfaatclaas of indebted within lew than ae year from thi date. Thu a continuation of our present rere.ua system would soon result In the receipt of an annual Income much greater than necessary to meet government ex peases, with no indebtedness upon which it could be applied. We should then be confronted with a vast quantity of money, the circulating medium of the people, boarded In the treasury wnen It should lie In their band, or w ihould be driren Into wasteful publlo extravagance with all the corrupting National demoralization which follow in its train. Hut it I not the simple existence of this surplus and it threatened attendant evil which furnish tha strongest argument against our present scale of Federal taxation. Its wont phase 1 tho exaction of such a surplus through a perversion of tha relation between It people aud thslr government, and a dangerous departure from the rules which limit the right of Federal taxation, Good govern msnt, and especially the government of which every American citizen boast, ha for It object the protection of every person within ita care In the greatest liberty consistent with the good order of society and hi jwrfect sectireinant In the enjoyment of his earnings with the least possible diminution for public needs. When mora of the people's substance i exacted through the form of Laxatlou than is necessary to meet the Just obligation of the government and the expense of it economical administration, such exaction becom rutbUs extortion and a violation of the fundamental principles of freo government. The indirect manner in which these aro m&do, lie a. tendency to conceit their true character and their extent, but w have arrived at a tags of superfluou revenue which has aroused the poople to a realization of tb fact, that the amount varied professedly fr the suppjrt of the government, l paid by them a absolutely, If added to the price of the thing which supply their dally w.int, a If it was paid at flxetl periods into the hand of tb tax-gatherer those who toll for dally wage or begin- nlng to understand tbat.capltal, though sometime vaunting In Ignorance and clamoring I for the protection and favor of the government, is dull and sluggish, till, touched by the , magical hand,of labor, It springs Into activity, furnishing on occasion for federal taxation, and the value wnlch enable it to twar ita burden. And the laboring man i thoughtfully inquiring whethsr iu those and the tribute ho continually pays into the publla treasury as he supplies hi daily want he hi fair (hare of advantages. There I also a abroad that the surplus of our revenue- Indicate abnormal and exo ptloual businv. profits, which under the sysiem which product- such surplus, Increases without corrospofidlug benefit to the people, the vast accumulation of a few among our citizens hIiismi fortunes, rivaling the wealth of the most favotvd in anti-democratic nations, nro uot Die natural growth of a steady, plain aud Industrious republic. ' i Our farmers, too, and those engaged directly and Indirectly in supplying the product of agriculture that day hyday aud, and as often as the dally wt s u( tiielr households recur, they are fonvl n piy ex cessive nnd needless taxation, while their products struggle in foreign inirkw. with the competition of nations, which by allowing a freer exchange of produetm is than we permit, enable their people to )ll for prices which distress the American farmer A every patriotic Itlztm rej nee Iu the constantly increasing prldn of our pope in American cltfrembip aud in the glory of our natural achievement an I pro;rji, a provalls that the lo.i Hug string iis.it ul to a nation In Its infancy, tn ly iw vll to a great extent discarded In profit sta;is of American ingenuity, courages an I fearless and for tho the prlvlle.i of thoseutlinent with true an and are -quite, willing to forego an Idle surplus In the public treasury, and all the peoplo know that the a rata of Federal taxation upon import Is to-day, in time of paco, but llttlo Iom, whilx upon some articlos of necessary consutnution it is actually morj than was Importod by tin grievous burden willingly Iwiie, at a tlmo when tho government reached millions to maintain by war tho afoty ami inUtgrity of the union. It ha been the policy of the government to collec tho principal part of Us revenue by a tax upon imports; and no change iu this po icy js desirable. Hut the prrennt condition of affairs constrains eur people to demand, that by a revision of our revonue laws, the receipt of tho government shall bo reduced to the necessary expnuMof its economic il administration; and this demand should be recognized and olyod by the people's representations In the legislative branch of the government In readjusting tho burdens of Federal taxation, r. sound publlo policy requires that such of our citizens as have built up large tnd Important industries uudor present conditions, should not be sud lenly and to tholr Injury deprived of advantages to which thoy hare adaptod their business; but if the good requires It, they nhould bo wmtant with such consideration n shall deal fairly and cautiously with their interest, whllo the just demand of tho people for rsllef from needlM taxation is honestly answered A reasonable and timely submission to such a demand sb uld certainly bo possible without a disastrous shock to any Interest; and a cheerful concession sometimes averts abrupt and heedless notion, often the outgrowth of impatience aud delayed Justice, Duo regard should bo also accorded In any proposed readjustment to tha interests of American labor, so far ax tbey are involved. W congratulate oursolvcu that there is among us no laboring cIuha fixed within yielding bounds nnd doomed under all to the exorable fato of dally toll W recognize In labor a chief factor in the wealth of the. republic, and we treat those who have it in thoir keeping as citlzeus entitled to tho most careful regard nnd thoughtful attention. This regard and teutlon should le a ward til them not only be- cause labor I the copltal of our workingmen, j Justly entitled to Ita share of government . laror, uui tor tue runner ana not loss tin- portant reason that the aborlng man, sur- rounded br - hi family .-... in hi humble .... home. ' m a consumer, la I vitally Interested in alt ft that cheapens tha cost t of living and enables Mm to bring within his domestic circle ad Utlonal comforts aud advantages. Thl relation of the working man to the revenue laws of the country, and the manner in which It palpably influences the question of wages, should not be forgotten in the justifiable prominence given to tbe proper maintenance of the supply nnd protection of woll paid labor. And these considerations suggest such an arrangement of government revonue as shall reduce the expense of living, while it does not curtail ths opportunity for work, nor reduce the compensation of American labor and injuriously effect its condition and the dlgnltlod state it hold (n tho estimation of oxt people. But our farmers and agriculturalists, those who from the soil produce th thing consumed by all, are perhaps more directly nd plainly concernod than any other of ov It i-ms, in a just and careful system ef Federal taxation. Those actually engaged In and mora connected with thi kind of work number nearly one-half our imputation. None labor harder or nore continually than thay. No enactments limit their hour of toll and no interposition of the gortrnraent to any great extent, the value of their product. And yet for tb many nocossarie of life, which the most scrupulous economy enable thsm to bring Into their bom, and for tfaslr lmplememunt of husbandry tbey are obliged to pay a price largely increased by an unnatural profit, which, by the a'ctlon of the government, I glren to the more favored manufacturer. I recommend that, keeping in view all these considerations, the increasing and unnecessary surplus of national lnooms annually accumulating, be released to th people, by an amendment to our rerenu laws which shall cheapen the prices of the necessaries of life give freer entrance to such Imported materials a by American labor may lie manufactured Into marketable commodities. Nothing can be accomplished, however, in the direction of this reform, unless the tubject 1 appi otched In a patriotic spirit of devotion to the iuterosU of th entire country, and with a willingness to yield something for the publlo good. While on the subject of tariff and revenue, the president especially direct the attention of congress to tho recommendations of the secretary of the treasury, touching the simplification and amendments of the laws relating to the oolloctlou of revemiM. Lest space Is devotod to the xllvor question this year than last, but hi opposition to compulsory coiuago Is uo less pronounced. The diifereuui In the bullion prico of the standard dollar, ninety-four nnd one-quarter cent, when first coined and Its bullion value, cents, on the 30th of last November, certainly does uot Indicate, tho president says, that compulsory coinage by the government onhsuens the priori of the commodity, or secures uniformity In its value. Ho has uu no reason to change the view expressed a year ago on tho subject of compulsory coinage and ajalu urges Its suipsnsloti on all the grounds contained in his former recommendation, reinforced by lucivase of our gold exportuttons during the last year and for t f urtbor reasons, that the more this currency is distributed among th people the greater become our duty to protect it rrom dlwwter, that wo now have an abundance for all our need nnd that there seem but little propriety In building vault to store such. ctirrnny, when the only for its coinage is the necessity of it uso by the people as a circulating medium. The attention of congress is called to the great uumW of suits in New York growing out of conflicting views by importers and collectors a to the interpretation of our complex ami indefinite revenue taw, and an amendment of the law Is recommended; but pending such amendment the present condition of this litigation should be relieved, by a law permitting the appointment of of an additional Federal judge in New York where tbraecasra hare accumulated, Of coast defenses aud fortifications, tho president says the condition of our sea coast and lake frontier are palpable, and the work laid out br the board on fortifications is delayed in default of congressional action. The absolute necessity of our preparation for effectual resistance agatntt armored shlpi tnd modern steal guns which may threaten our sea coast cities is so apparent that he hops effective steps will be taken in that direction at once. Thu condition of our navy, a shown by the secretary of that department, shoul I challenge tha early atteution of congress. The production in the United States of armor and is a question which it seems to Rttle at an early day, If the armored war vexKtls are to be completed with materials of home manufacture. In tha event that the present invitation of the depsrttnout for bids to furnish such of this material as is now authorized shall fall to induco domestic manufacturers to undertake the 1'irgt) vxendltures required to prepare for this new inumifarture, nnd no other steps are tnkou by congress at its coming iIon, tho secretary contemplates with dissathifactlon the of obtaining abroad the arms mid the gun-steel for tho authorized ships. It uould socnt desirable, the priwl.leut mid, that the wants of the army and the navy in this regard should be reasonably met, mid that by uniting their contracts, such inducement might le offered. as would result in securing the domestication of thrtte important lnt"rMf. Postal horvlco Hffilrs show maikedand gratifying improvement during the post year; the lncrcoso of rovenuo Is In a cainlng ratio over the incress of demonstrating the sullleieuey of the present cheap rates f postage ultimately to sustain tho frvlce.' Hie difference with vrt iin ocoi'i Htoiinship companies wore texinlnii'ed by tho the policy of tlw fcoreriiment. thus affording a service generally adoquato to the mvds of our intercoiirso. Tho question of establishing ocoan postal sorvico to IlnizII and the Argentina Republic is commended to the consideration of congritss.vaiul the suggestion Is offored, that a- distingnithed from a grant or subsidy for the mere beueflt of any line, whatever outlay may b required to secure additional, necesiary nnd proper service, should bo rsgardod as within the limit of legitimate compensation for such service. Tho president endorses the recommendation of the uttornoy gencrul for tho erection of a penltontinry for tho confinement of prisoners convictod Iu Unltod States courts. Uo couslder it a matter of very great , tance, which should at once receive sional action. More than ono of these Institutions might tie erected, and by omtiloylng tho prisoners in the manufacture of articles needed for uso by tha government qulto a largo pecuniary benaflt would be realized lu partial return for Hie outlay of construction. Ha endorse thu recommondatlotis of the attorney general for a change in the Federal judicial system, to obviate tho delay necos. sarily attending the present condition of affair in our court. Of Indian affairs, he say the present system of agencies htantltng alone is inudoquata for thu accomplishment of an object which ha8 become pressing In its moro rapid transition from tribal tlon to citizenship or such portions of tho Indian a are capable of civilized life, and !.,.,.. i,. nnn..ir r. .,.,.o..,.,.,.i .. mv,v mn iiwmj.j iui nuiiiJitJiuQIIIui nKUUUlt commission of six Intelligent from the army charged with tho manage . ment of such matter of detail as canuet with the present organization, be properly and tuccessfully conducted. The time is ripe, tbe president tells congress, for tha work of such an agency. The president recommends tha repeal of the pre-emption and timber culture aot, and that tbe homestead law be so amended as to better lecuro compliance with tkeir requirement of residence, Improvement and cultivation for five years from data of entry, without commutation or provision for speculative relinquishment. Referriug to the satisfactory exhibit of tbe operations of the pension bureau during the last fiscal year, and to peuslmi matters generally, the president say tho usefulness nnd tho justice of any system for tho distribution of pensions depend upon the equity and uniformity of operations, and as long a we adhere to the principle of granting pensions for service aed disability a th result of service, th allowance of pensions should be restricted to cases presenting these feature. "Every patriotic heart," he y, "respond to a tender consideration for tkoso who, having served their country long aud well, are reduced to destitution and despondence, uot a an Incident of their service but with advancing age and misfortune. We are all tempted by the contemplation of such a condition to supply relief, and ire often Impatient of tho limitations of public duty. Yielding to no one lu the desire, to indulge this feeling of consideration, I cannot rid myself of the conviction that if these ex-solder are to be relieved, they and tbIr cause are untitled to the benefit of an enactment under which rellof may bo claimed a a right, aud that such relief ihould bo granted under the sanction of law, not in evasion of It; cor should such worthy objects of care, all equally ontitlod, bs remitted to the unequal operation of sympathy, or the tender niercie of social and political influence with their uujust discrimination " Of the Pacific railroad debt extenstou proposition, he says, that congress lu considering the plan suggested by the secretary of tho interior, anl ondor 1 by the board of Kovernment directors, the sole matter which should be taken into accouuturo "the situation of the government as a creditor and the surest way to secure tho piyment of the principal and Interest of Its debt." Of interstate commorco he nays that by K recent decision of the supreuw court of the United States, it ha. been adjuiiged that the law of the soveral stittis are inoperative to regulate rates of transKrtatlou upon railroad, it such regulation interferes with tho rate of carriage from one state into another. This important fljl'l, of control and regulation having been thus left entirely unoccupied, the expediency of Federal action upon the subject is unworthy of consideration. Of the relations of labor to capital, the president think that "hen those differences between employer nnd omployed reach such a stage as to result In the interruption of ! commarce oetneen the states, thu application of nrliltration by the general government might hi regarded n entirely within Its constitutional powers, and he thinks we might rtaonably hopo that such arbitrators, If carefully seliK'tml and entitled to the confidence of the parties affected, would be voluntarily called to the hettlement of controversies of lens extent hnd not necessarily h itlun tho domain of Poderul regulation. The president recommends as a plain duty on the part of tbe government, the payment of a million and a quarter dollars due to Jsxviitg bank depositors. Civil servlcj reform is the last important topic discussed lu the message Tbe continued operation of the civil oorvico law, ho ha added the most convincing proof of its necessity ami usefulness. Every public ofllcer who has a just idea of his duty to the eop!e testifies to the value of this reform. Its staunchest friends are found among those who understand it best, and its warmmt sup porters are those who are restrained and protected by its requirements. The meaning of such restraint and protection is not appreciated by those who want place under the government regardless of merit or Inolll ciency nor by those who insist that the selection for such places sboul 1 rest upon a prowr credential showing active partisan work. They mean to public olllwrs, if not their lives, the) only opportunity afforded them to attend to publlo business, and they mean to tbe good people of the country tbe better imrformanco of the work of their government. It is exceedingly strange, the president thinks, th.st the scoe and nature of his reform are so little understood and that so many things not included within ita plan are called by Its name. When cavil yields more fully to examination, the system will have large additions to the number of ita friends. Our civil service reform, the presldont ay, may be imperfect in somo of IU details; it may be mUunderttood and opposod; it may not always bo faithfully applied; its designs may sometimes miscarry through mistake or willful intent; it may somitimea tremble under assaults of its anemias or languish under the misguided z;al of ticable friend, but It thu people of this coun try ever submit to the banishment of Its un-' ... .. .. . denying principto rrom tue operation of this government, they will abandon the surest guarantee of the safety and success of Amorl can institutions. In coucluslou bo Invokes for this reform the cheerful and ungrudging support of congress; urges an increase of the salaries of the commissioners and expresses the hope that such reasonable appropriation may be made as will enable them to Increase tbe usefulness of the cnuso tbey have in charge.

REPORT ANNUAL STATEMENT OFTHE UNITED STATES' FINANCES. A Comprehensive ltepnrt of the Operations of the Trunin ry for tlio Flsral Year Ending June 30, 1880, Furnished to the 1'ress IHItBr Washington News. Washikotojt, Dec, (. The annual report of Mr. Jordan, treasury of the United Stataj, has been gUeti to the press. Mr. Jordan presents a very comprehensive report of the oiraUous of the treasury for the fiscal year ended June SO, 1880, and ita condition on that and subsequent dates. The net receipts of the government for tho fiscal year were $3So the net expenditure waj tai.'.Wt.lSH. The receipts were $13,749,039 greater and the expenditures were $17,943,706 Jess than last year, making an increase in tbe receipts for the past year over that of 1883, of The exce&s of tho revenue over expenditures was $11 ..D5tl,58l). During the year bonds amounting to were nnd applied to the sinking fund. Treasurer Jordan suggests a revision of tho method heretofore adopted In making up the sinking fund by which th- sinking fund cliargo for the current year will be $37,410,-458, Instead of $49,843,723 uccording to pi esent method. Vy the present method tbe entire debt of the United States will U retired by tbe year IH08, and If tha method suggested by Treasurer Jordan is adopted the debt will be extinguished by the year 1903. At the close of the year tbe United States bonds held as security for national bank circulation amounted to $ J75.974.S00. a rcuuctiou m. oi . " . " durmsc tuo year. . '"" ce!1V lK,n(li u""g to $34,453, i.-UI were withdrawn during the year, most if which were surrendered for redemption. The amount of bonds deposited during tbe year wa $2il,0.MJJO. and tho bonds withdrawn amounted to $01,1143, 4000, snowing a decrease of J"4,U7,50i of the movement of redemption of National bank notes of late year. Treasurer Jordan says: Tbe National bank notes prejeutvd for redemption during the fiscal year amounted to $130,29(5,000, wnich was $19,013,533, or 13.30 percent, less than the amount presented for redemption in tbe fiscal year 1885. That there would bo a falling off In tho amount presented for redemption was indicated by the amount presented during the first three months of the fiscal year, and my opinion, based thereon and expressed in inj lost report, that the culminating point in the second upward movement in bank note redemptions had been reached In the fiscal year 18H5 has been verified. The rato of Increase in the redemptions of bank noW during tho second upward movement, covering the fiscal years 1883, 1883, 181 and I8i", is represented by the percentages 27, 31, S3 and 19, respectively, A feature of this upward movement was the constantly decreasing volume of National bank notes actually outstanding from on January 1, 1883, to $3 19,000,933 on June DO, lhSJ, a decreaso of $43,353,050. This seems to indicate that tha volume of bank notes outstanding during that period was excessive, or above the point at Thlch it could bo profitably maintained. Another fact, however, should bo considered In this connection, which is that during these four years of Increase in redemptions, the silver certificate circulation of the country was Increased $75,753,183, from $39,110,739 on June 30, 18SI, to $114,805,011 on December 31, 1834. This increase more than balauced the decrease In bank note circulation, and the apparent excessive hsuo of bank notes might, to a considerable extant, be due to that fact. The decline in the issue of bank note circulation has continued without interruption, until tbe amount outstanding on September 30, 1880, was $30.1,511,241, making a total reduction of $58,010,747, since January 1, 1884; and also after December 31, 18 W, thsidlver ceitltlcato circulation craduallr de creased, until on July 31, 1880, it had fallen $37,301,07 to $87,504,014. The average outstanding for a year preceding that data was about $01,000,0(10; since July 1, 1885, tha de-cline in tho bank note circulation has apparently bad tbe effect to check tha increase in bank note redemption, as they have steadily fallen off from that date until they now are, for the current fiscal year, about 31 per cent, less than In tbe precodlng year. Still further on while dlscusilog tbe question of re tire mont of National bank circulation tbe treasurer says: As there seems to be on the part of the publlo an idea that the treasury Ls looking up money in Its vault on iccount of this fund the whole operation of the retirement of the notes of National banks will be stated here In ordor to relieve any apprehension which may be felt on this subject. Tbe three per cent, bonds of the Washington National bank of Westerly, R.

INTERIOR JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT, STANFORD, KY., DECEMBER 7, 1886. tssxmsssmm day of October, 1894, ths bank tent it duplicate receipt to the office, the orlglnal'beiBfj held by the comptroller of th currency, with the request that a deposit of 90 per cent, ef the above amount should be made to retire It circulntioo with the treasurer of .tit United Stats agent for the redemption of the nob of tb National bank, and requesting a cl.tck for the 10 ier cent, difference Accoidlngly a credit wa placed upon th books of the treasurer, as agent for the National Unlit, for $90,000, and a check for $10,000 mid standing to th.i credit of ths I, m, It lu tha five per cent receinptlon fund- in tbU cum $4 to the bank 'ih amo.jnt of Redeemed note chaigwl u. tbi account since It was opened I $l,h93. Thn annual erceiitage of such' redemption is 45 83. and It will, therefore, Uks at least tour yeats lie fore the greater part of tbe notes of the bank will be redeemed. The smount credited to tha general fuul thu vrettad, stands on the books of th trea.urer, s agent, as a credit for the redemption nf the notes of tbo banks, and as the notes coins lu for redemption they are charged to this account, and the National bank outstanding is decreased by a amount At present, owing to the rtcti.e huainess, none but mutilated nous are vnt in for redemption. Porsona presiutlng these notes for redemption are paid lther by check In New York, or in such ri m of currency as may be desired by tbetn. Tbe Indebtedness on the part of tho treasury created as above described, is no doubt, due In legal tenders, b.ut I liquidated in th manner stated and no attempt is made to reserve any specific sum of legol tendor, or any other form of currency out of tbB general treasury balances iu which to pay these constantly accruing liabilities. There was on November SO, of thi kind of liability adding the five per cent, fund, which, ally, is also composed of legal tenders, the um of $71,752,389. The total amount of legal tenders in tbo treasury on tbe same date, exclusive of that held to redeem tbe legal tender certificates, which are ued in tbe bank as reserve in this stead, was $39,-518,188, thus showing thatthere must be held In tbe treasury in some other forms of money the balance of $05,304,301. The entire sum of $94,753,38 may bo said to bo composed of $39,r48,188 iegni tenders, $33,003,100 gold. If the books of the treasury stated accurately the balancs due by it as a depository the amounted now reported as a credit balance would be materially decreased. That those balances should not be so reported is, in tbe opinion of the treasurer, one of the greatest defects of the present treasury system. Discussing the question of silvor coinage, after referring to the fact that there are now in circulation f01,701,448 in standard dollar, the treasurer say ho thinks that $05,000,000 is the extreme limit of circulotion which may bo obtained. It certainly cannot be maintained at that sum when tho new one dollar and two dollar certlcatcs are in full supply, and a return to th treasury of one-half of the amount of standard dollars now in circulation must be looked for; and so ha asks whether, If tbe further purchase of silver bullion be detonnlnod upon, the coinage might not cease, and tho sum which it cost saved to tho treasury. Tha amount expended so far upon the colnajo of tha silver dollar, ouslde of ths cost and consequent loss upon the purchase of bulllou, amounts to $4,!MV 487. Alt of the cost in excess, say nf tha cost of tho coinage of tho sum of $75,000,000, represent pure loss, and amounts, at two cents per dollar, the cost of these coins, to $3,433,-407. To add to this loss would seem unnecessary, and the sum could be expended iu the purchase of tbe silver bullion. Tha adoption of thu plan would at least have the merit of addiug just so much to tbe credit of the fund. Desidos, the cost to tha government for transportation of these coins averages $1.95 per $1,000, nnd tha cost to the people of their return to the treasury averages, say $3 54 per $1,000. The average cost of transportation to tho government of the silver certificate par $1,0W U, say fifty cents, the cost to the pvople, say $1.35, a saving or $3.74 per $1,000; a stroug argument in favor of the issue of such amount of these certificates as the business of the country will permit to be carried ou without disturbing ita gold revenues or Interfering with the maintenance of a strict parity betweon the two metals. t The amount of silver dollars coined to data Is $340,073,380; the amount of gold coin and bullion on hand is $354,450,853. The cost of the $1110.073,388 is 3I0,049,3tS!, the present valuo $18f,014,351, showing an actual loss of $,034,0U. The bank of France 1 in this position: It holds in ita cash at par $330,273,8'!0 in silver, its present value at par of exchange excluslvo of abrasion, Is $100,. 609,091, showing a loss of its entire capital and surplus which amounts to, say and $10,00,000 In addition if called upon to liquidate its affairs to-day. Treasurer Jordan recommends alterations hi the present sub-treasury system, in order that It may conform to tbo financial changes which have taken place slnco this system was adopted. As the country increased in wealth and population, with tbe consequent increase of lte revenues and disbursements, it will be found Impossible to continue the system In Its present form. With tho extinction of the three per cent, bond which, without somo depression or event that cannot now bo foreseen, must tako place during the ensuing fiscal year, tbe only bonds available for tho purpose of the sinking fund will be tbe four and one-half and four per cent bonds. At the present cost of the collection of tbe revenue of the country, say $3.70 per $100, the loss on the existing sinking fund, say $45,000,000 per annum, will be $705,000 annually, assuming 2 per cent as the best rate whlcli the bonds can earn. Without discussing the, consequent possible derangement of our exixtlug financial system of the purchases for the sinking fund are to be maintained at their present figures, it will be found to bo Impracticable to make these purchases, tbo treasurer say, at such times and in such manner, as to reliove thu money market in tinje of financial distress, As these derangements happen almost at the time of the moving tbe crop of the country, this statement is equiralent to saying that erery productive interest iu the country mast pay toll to foreign buyers, through tha lower range prices which obtain at such times, because of the fact that our arrangements for collecting and our revenues are o defective, a to need an artificial and violent remedy, in order to place in active circulation the moneys withdrawn from the business of the country. This method of dealing with the publio moneys la net tru of any country, but this, and tbo practical sense of tha American people, as shown through its representative lu cougrees, should be adequate to find a remedy for thl constantly recurring evil; one sure to grow and becomo more burdensome in our future natural history. This remedy, he says, should be found and adopted with th coming session of congrew, became the evil complained of will be uKn us before its next meeting, and tha treasury left without any means of supplying the urgent needs of the country. 1 ' M ' i Iteath or Congressman Frioe, Mimvaukkit, Mien., Dec. .
