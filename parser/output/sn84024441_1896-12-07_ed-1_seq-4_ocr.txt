The A imcnlanoutraKcsarc portrayed in lurid ternu, and the hopes of pmir Cuba are brushed aside with a suggestion for the acceptance of Cuban autonomy. lie says that when the Inability of Spain to deal huccesplully with the insurrection has be come manifest, a Mtuatien will be pre scnted in Which our obligations to the sov ereignly, of Spain will be superseded by htglier obligatons, which we can hardly hesitate to recognize and discharge. Evi dently Mr. Cleeland has been lilladed by his bCTcro attack of the Spanish fever. This situational ready exists or Spain would have long since suppressed the insurrec tion. Unless Congress takes up theiiuestlon and forces the President to act, justice will not be accorded toCuba. Contrary to the general prolixity of the message, the Venezuelan uucstion Is dis missed with a short para graph, in which Mr. Cleveland tukes occasion to say that negotiations for a treaty for the arbi tration of all dilfcrenccs between the United States and Ureal Britain are well advtihccd. It seems almost cruel to thus bun thcr the old-time contentions between Uncle Sam and John Bull. What tall can we twist if the llntlsh lion is to besmnma rtly caged liy act of trea7 Considerable space is deotedto the sev eral Secretaries' reports, especially those of the Treasury, War, Ni.vy, and Agricul tural departments. Mr. Clevc'lind not only congratulates the country on the effi cient manner in which his administrative staff hae discharged their respective duties, but lie also indulges In a sclMiaiid shaking process, which betray a large amount of egotism. The result of the last election, however. Indicates that the gen eral public does not agree with him. In connection with these rcports.it might be said that the recent activity in naval cire'es and in strengthening our coast de fenses is in accord with iwpular sentiment. Wc may not have war, but adequate prep aration for that emergency will establish a more general feeling of confidence in future p;acc. The weakest part of the President's ver bose and apologetic document is his defense of the Wilson tariff. A law that creates a deficit of nearly $8,0011,000 a month is neither a public blessing nor a desirable addition to ourstatutes. Mr Cleveland rajs this deficit Is not a loss, but Is only a means of reducing an unnecessary Trcasurj- sur plus, which should not create public alarm. "The pajincnt, therefore, of any deficiency In the revenues from this fund," he argues, "is nothing more than Its pron"r and legiti mate us- " Such persiflage can be disposed of with the assertion that If our Treasury fund Is to he applied to any purpose other t'.iaa intended It should be in the payment of our public debt. Mr. Cleveland says there can be no finnucial peace until the government currencj obli-f-a'.ions upon which gold lnay lie demanded from the Treasury aie withdrawn from cir culation and cai.cclled. What, then. Is to lie our inrnetary basis? Upon what-foundalion is our financial structure to be reared? He sajs our business Interests long for a rest from fmincial agitation. True, but las rec ommendation will reopen and reie It throughout the cointrj-. The crowning lnglory of the message Is thcl'resident's refcrencetotrusts. He pnio-ticallj- gained his election by repeated platitudes denouncing the "communism of peir," "soulless corporate Influence" and similar catch phrases, and now in his last public utterance he speaks of "huge aggre gations of capital," which "crush out In dividual Independence" with a seriousness not warraniinl bj-as.!ngleactot his adminis tration. For nearlj- four jears he has had opportunity to prosecute trusts and demon strate his slnccritj-, but not an attempt is on record to show tli.it he is not in league with the corporations which he again de nounces. The Attorney General claims that no prosecutions luivc been ordered be cause his department has no funds to se cure the necessarj- evidence. Why, then, was this defect 111 the law not brought to the notice of Vingress three j'ears ago, and wh- was this la't dernagosic appeal in serted In this farewell message? Taking the mesigo as a whole, it should never have been written. It lacks the bold aggressiveness of previous similar docu ments, and Is not a fair illustration of a igorous public utterance. No definite American policy Is outlined, nor can it be construed as anything but an attempted uology for the mistakes of the present Administration. It is. in ratt, nothing but word, -18,000 words.

Through numerous and widely dcvi-rsificd sourceshe has learned that the rankandfilcof Wash tng'onllcpubllcansdo notwanthlmaschair- man of the inaugural committee.

INVESTIGATION WAS HELD Other Members of the Grand Jury Hnd Fountl That Somebody "Was "Lcakiqjt" Consultation ltcsulted in Actfoii IVhlcli Was Aunouuecd by Judge Cole. The sensation which has been expected around the City Hall for a week or more, developed todaj", when Judgo Cole, of Ciln.iiial Court, No. 1, discharged from further senice on the grand Jury Messrs. George Deats and George P. Blair. This Is a result of the consultation of tho Judges of the District supremo court, an account of which was-published exclu sively in The EvenlngTimes Saturdaj-. The meeting or the- Judge-s was at the In stance of Juilge Cole. He had been In formed of a " ehf ncult y among the Jurors ocr an alleged leak uinong their number. It was learned that the indictment or a certain part y for forgery had become knoivu on the outside, and the Jurors began an in quiry to disclose the guilty parties. The re-sult or their investigation on spe cial oath was n consultation- with. tho dis trict attorney's office as to what should be done with the parties, for it had been learned that there was more than one. JUDGES DECIDED. District Attorney Birnej- was not quite sure what punishment could be meteil out to the guilty members, anil Judge Cole was inrorn.c 1 of the affair. The other Judges were next let Into the secret, and they began to deliberate as to the best course to pursue. To discharge the entire Jury would lie to place a sticma unon the Innocent, when the blame it-sted only on a few. Finally It was decideel to make an example, and Saturday afternoon it was all arranged. Judge Cole asked the District altornej for the names or the parties to be excused, und Just berore noon Assistant District At torney Haney Glen handed Judge Cole a sliporpapercoiitalnlngtheuumesofDc.uies and Hlalr.

"I learned that on that same arternoon, within an hour nrtcr the Jurj" dispersed, the knowledge or their actlou and or wit nesses bc-rorci thejm was in the possesion or ouUIdc parties.

Key West, I"la , Dec. 7. ras--engero who have arrived from Havana gave iuter-c-silng Information as to the eorditlon of af fairs in Cuba. Feveri-h excitement pre-4-alls In Havana since the rumor spread that Wejler Intenileel to return, announc ing, as reported, that he had pactried the proUnce of I'inar del Rio, when it is a Wiowu fact that ilacco remain, liiddlng defiance to all forces sent to crush him. The bpanlsh arc hitter against Wejler's un-succe-rul efrort and say his return will meandefeat. The official statcn cnt or pacification Is ridiculed in thcraci" or the number of rebel-, in the province and the activity elisplajcd rccc-ntlj. Weyler's cowardice and Igno rance arc manifest, lie dares not attack I'.aceo in tbe hills. He has established fceadijuarterb nt I.os l'alacios and sends columns to sweep the country, leaving trails of fire and blood. Hisintenth.11 appe-ars to kill all Cuban pacificos in the country. Xo eiuarter Is given. All who surrender arc also killed. TLe- facts are positive. Honorable Spaniards are Loriifii-d at such slaughter and destruction, llelgulzo's re ported victory was simply a treacherous surprise ot a Cuban hospital. Forty-five fcelplets inmates were slaughtered. Meantime the rcliels are displaying great activity all around. Wednesday night they attacked A rtemlsa. wounded a lieutenant, llrce sergeants three corporals, five privates, and four civilians. It Is said that under cover of the attack a body of 400 Insurgents crosseel the line into I'inar del Kio, anil at night aga'n attacked the trocha, nt Zayas station. The details are unknown. It is rumored that 1,500 Insurgents are encampeil near Uuira de Jlclcna near the trocha. The leader Is unknown. It Is be lieved they will soon attack ami cross the line to re-enforce- Maceo. "When the re-bels entered Gunnabacoa Tuesday night alter burning twenty-six stores and looting sev eral stores Including Komcin the center or the town, they announced that tney would soon return, and carried nut the threat, as last night the town was again attacked, several houses burned and other stores sacked despite the garrison had been re-enrorced since the first attack. These raids on Guanabacoa are causing an immense sensation In Havana on nccount of the proximity and importance of the place. Desides at Guanabacoa the rebels lately attacked and burned many houses at Ar royo, Naraujo, El Cano, Santa Maria, Del Eosarlo. all within a radius of fifteen miles of Havana. The glares of fires arc nightly seen in the city. It is said news has been received at the palace that Col. Aldea had a serious encounter with Lacrct at Turgatorio Hills, In ilatanzas. The Spanish admit they suffered a loss ot seventy-five, but claim the victory, saying they killed 300 rebels. The censorship is so rigorous the above facts, while well known iu Havana, arc not allowed to be printed or cabled. It appears the present scheme Is to keep secret all happenings In order to impress the American public with the Idea that things are quiet and give color to Weyler's boasted ofrlcial "iiaelfication" of I'inar del Itio province. It is hoped to affect Mr. Cleveland and, Congrt-r-s In this way. It Is reiiortcd as soon as Wcylcr returns a delegation of Spanish plinters will peti tion to be allowed to start grinding. In case of refusal they will cable to Madrid asking "Weyler's" recall. Amongst Spaniards We-yler is considered doomed. It Is considered significant that he received a curt message from the minister of war saying "Saiga opera clones," that is "take the field."
