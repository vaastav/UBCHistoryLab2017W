SCENES OF WILD PANIC BOMB EXPLODED IN THE FRENCH CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES. NO ONE KILLED BUT MANY ARE WOUNDED. GREAT EXCITEMENT THKOG 11- OUT PARIS CAUSED BY THE AFFAIR. There is Every Reason to Believe That the Atrocious Deed Was the Work of Anarchists —Man Named Leuoir Strongly Suspected—The Bomb Is Hurled From an Upper Gallery and Bursts in the Air —Over Eighty Wounded—Dupuy’s Courage. Paris, Dec. U.—While a member of | the chamber of deputies was delivering ' a speech in the chamber this after-! noon, upon an unimportant subject, a 1 man in one of the galleries threw a' bomb on the lioor. The bomb exploded with tremendous noise and shoos. the building as it an 1 earthquake had struck it. Several members were seriously in jured. The explosion was followed by the greatest excitement. The police and several companies of gen d’armes were dispatched to the chamber, and the vicinity of the building for several blocks was put under guard. Ao one was allowed to leave or enter the chamber until an investigation had been made. The extreme estimates of the num ber of wounded early this evening place the total at fifty more or less seriously injured. This number in cludes leu or ufteeu deputies, among them Casonove de Pradiuo, leComte de Taujuinai, JLe Clech and Gouter. Two deputies who were present at the time of the explosion and who were allowed to leave the chamber volunteered the following statement: •‘The bomb was thrown from the gal lery above tue right blenches, into which the public is admitted without the formality of presenting cards. A fuse was attached to the bomb which exploded in the air. It is thought the shell may have contained a mixture of nitroglycerine and gunpowder, and no dynamite,” Date tonight the police have in cus tody a man, who, on entering, refused to remove his overcoat when request ed to do so in the cloak room. An other man, who attempted to evade the doorkeeper and escape from the cnamber is also closely watched, tiome of the spectators recognize him as the thrower of the bomb. At t> p. m. all the strangers present at today s sitting are still being detained. They are of all ranks and ages and in groups are engaged in discussing the outrage. Six suspects have been detained for ex amination. This evening the deputies and of ficers who desire to do so are allowed to leave the palais in order to reach their families. Ail Associated Press correspondent during the evening had uu interview with Dr. Mahay, who was prominent among the physicians in giving as sitauce to the wouuuded. Dr. Mahay said that most of the wounds are slight, but it is still impossible to give a complete account of their extent as the projectiles thrown from the bomb had in many cases penetrated the bodies, causing internal injuries likely to have serious results. The room reserved for the wounded at the Palais Bourbon has only one bed and this was occupied by a wound ed spectator. In the third bureau an Associated Press correspondent rec ognized Abbe De-Mire lying covered with blood on a mattress. The face of the wounded deputy was covered with bandages and he appeared to be suffering great pain. Many wounded were lying about the room. President Dupuy is said to have be haved with the utmost coolness, do ing much to allay the panic. He called the chamber* to order. Part of the deputies obeyed ,the summons, and Dupuy rose and said, as calmly as if nothing had happened. “Such at tempts should not disconcert the cham ber. I invite you to continue your dis cussions .with calmness. When the order of the day has been dealt with the proper officials will do their duty,” Adjournment was not taken until the order of business had been finished. Dupuy received a trifling scalp w’ound. One woman spectator, named Malley, was wounded in the leg and so mutilated that the doctors declare i she will be a cripple for life. A Rou ! manian woman named Mantel w*as also severely wounded. Up to the present time fifty wound ed persons have passed through the hands of Dr. Blet alone. Altogether over eighty persons were wounded. At midnight the excitement is still very great. There seems to be every reason to believe that the bomb w r as thrown by anarchists. The crime will undoubtedly result in strengthening the government and in weakening the socialists, although they take great pains to denounce anarchists. Nine deputies are known to be among the injured. It is now quite certain that a man named Lenoir, the man who would not remove his overcoat, threw the bomb. IN 

CONGRESS. Resume of the Routine Proceedings in Both Houses. Washington, Dec. 4.—The first senate session of the fifty-third congress as sembled at noon. Roll call showed fifty-six senators present. After the passage of the usual resolution notify ing the house of the meeting of the senate and the appointment of a com mittee from the house to wait on the president and notify him of the as sembling of congress, and one fixing the time of meeting at noon each day. the senate took a recess of an hour. On reassembling the committee to wait on the president announced the accomplishment of its duty and that the president would at once communi cate with the senate. Secretary Pru deu then stepped forward and deliv ered the message to the vice president, who laid it before the house, and Sec retary Cox at. once began its reading. All present, with a few exceptions, gave close attention when the reading began. There was a general changing about in seats when the portion of the document dealing with Hawaii was approached. Senator Dolph save notice that he would address the senate on the Ha waiian part of the message. The message was ordered to lie on the table. A message was received from the house announcing the deaths of Charles O’Neill and Win. Lilly, representatives from Pennsylvania. Mr. Cameron, rep., of Pennsylvania, offered suitable resolutions and a com mittee was appointed to attend the funerals. The senate then adjourned. Fully 300 members were in their seals when Speaker Crisp called the house to order. Conspicuous upon the floor were the two vacant chairs of Representative O’Neill, of Pennsyl vania. the "father of the house,” and his colleague, Mr. Lilly, the repre sentative at-large from the Keystone | state.

Washington, Dec. 5. —Senator Dolph presented a petition of the Oregon Horticultural society, favoring the maintenance of the present duty on prunes. After the morning hour the senate took up the Hawaii matter, and Dolph spoke against the president’s pro posed action. The senate passed with slight amend meuts the house joint resolution, ap propriating $50,000 for the employment of additional deputy collectors of inter nal revenue to aid in the execution of the Chinese exclusion act.

Washington, Dec. 6.—Senator Voor bees opened the pension question in the senate by introducing two bills, one declaring a pension a vested right, regulating suspension of pensions, and granting appeals to the supreme court of the District of Columbia; the other, defining sundry crimes against the United States in the administration of pension laws. Mr. Manderson introduced a bill to amend the internal revenue laws, Mr. Cullom, of Illinois, offered a resolution accepting from Illinois the statue of Gon. Shields and addressed the senate, eulogizing Gen. Shields. Others also spoke. Senator Hoar’s resolution of yester day calling for information relative to Hawaii was laid before the senate and the author proceeded to attack vigor ously the course pursued by the ad ministration. Mr. Hoar thought that the president’s intention in the matter of Hawaii w r as a thing which the sen ate and the people W'ere entitled to understand without delay. Mr. Mills, of Texas, spoke of Mr. Hoar’s “shelling the works” before he obtained the information which his resolution called for. He denied that the president was meditating an act of w r ar, and asserted that the president had respectfully subraited the ques tion to congress. The real question was whether tfoe government of the United States had interfered to overthrow the existing government of Hawaii. If it had, it was the duty of the president of the United States, representing the gov ernment, to make prompt reparation and to reinstate the government which it had overthrown. i Mr. Mills was followed by Senator i Vilas, of Wisconsin, who defended the administration and argued that the . senate was acting with undue haste in I discussing the subject "in the absence of facts. Senator Vilas thought there were reasons why the resolutions should not -be adopted at this time. He referred to the remarks of Hoar, as to the re ported action of the president being an act of war, and asked whether the binding of troops and the overthrow' 'of a government by virtue of their force was not an act of war. ’ Hoar replied that the troops were landed under the allegation that they 1 were to be used to protect the lives [ and property of American c’tizens. The queen yielded to an arn ed insur rection and not to American troops. 1 Hoar continued: “After the president sent a letter addressed to ‘My great and good brother, President Dole* it would be an act of infamy only ex celled by the act of Joab when he stabbed his neighbor under the fifth rib and then asked, ‘Art thou in good health, my brother?” (I-aughter.) Vilas protested that was not the ’ question. Mr. Hoar replied that the whole argument of the senator from Wisconsin and the senator from Texas was one that vould require the United States to give back Texas to Mexico today. “M e never got Texas from Mexico," said Mills. “Texas came into the Un ion involuntarily.” M ithout going into the question of the character of the instructions of the president to the Hawaiian minis ter, \ ilas declared that what, the presi dent instructed the minister to do he had ample and complete authority to do. Vilas moved that the resolution le referred to the committee on foreign relations. Senator Hill favored the resolution criticising the president for not in forming congress of the state of affairs in Hawaii and his instructions, and declaring that he should not commit . congress by any act of his. He did not understand Mr. Mills to oppose the passage of the resolution. To this Mr. 1 Mills assented. Mr. Hill, continuing, said lie had no word to say of Mr. Stevens or the .pres ent minister. Congress might conclude that it was proper to send more than one person to Hawaii to ascertain facts; he questioned the right of the president through force of the array and navy, without the consent of con gress, to restore the queen. Senator Sherman also spoke, and at some length. Mr. Hoar’s resolution was adopted unanimously and the senate then went into executive session. in the house Mr. Crosveruor offered a resolution giving the names of 1,900 Ohio pensioners dropped from the rolls and asking for a reason and other information from the secretary of the interior. Washington, Dec. 7.—The president has not replied to the Hoar resolution and some interest is expressed to know what, coni so he will take, or whether he will decline on account of the gen eral welfare for the present to make public ids instructions to Minister Willis. Senator Palmer took exception to the remarks of some republicans ana responded in defense of the president's policy. Some members of the senate have been asking themselves what the sen ate will do in case Cleveland should fail to take any notice of their request for information, but most of those who have spoken upon the subject say this is not a probable contingency. They admit, however, that it would not surprise them if Cleveland declined to transmit further information until af ter the next steamer arrived from J lonolulu. The senate passed tin* senate bill to reimburse Nebraska for expenses incur red in the Sioux outbreak of 1891: also the house bill to amend the railroad land of forfeiture act. A bill was passed granting a pension of 

SIOO a month to the widow of Gen. Corse. The senate adjourned till Monday. In the lower house the bankrupt -y bill was taken up, Mr. Hailey, of Tex as, speaking against it. Hailey antagonized (he Dill in a bril liant speech. An equitable bankruptcy law, he said, could work no possible injury to creditor or debtor, but as to the proposed bill, radical difference* exist as to whether it is a proper meas ure. He thought the objectionable features of the pending bill so inex tricably interwoven (hat it could not be amended and made acceptable. In closing the general debate lor the advocacy of the bill, Col. Oates explain ed that the charge that the bill pro vided imprisonment for debt was with out foundation. He denied that the bill had any harsh provisions and ex pressed a willingness to accept any amendments proposed in good faith and sustained by honest argument. Washington, Dec. 8. —The Torrey bankruptcy bill was killed unexpect edly by the house today just ns its | consideration under the five minutes rule was about to begin. Col. Oates, champion of the meas ure, declined to permit the house to ! vote on Bailey’s substitute, providing simply for a voluntary system of bankruptcy, whereupon Bland precipi j fated a ferment by moving to strike out the enacting clause of the bill. I Vainly the advocates of the meas ure protested that it would be unfair 1 to reject the bill before the house had i a chance to perfect it by amendment. ’ Pleadings were unavailing. The de -1 cisive vote was 142 to 111. Judge Torrey, of St. Louis, author of the measure, who for ten years has I been pushing the bill, sat disconso l lately in the gallery. The vote was not strictly a party one. An analysis shows that 115 democrats, eighteen republicans and nine populists voted to strike out the enacting clause and that sixty-four republicans and forty seven democrats voted against it, ! An attempt to drive the bill for the admission of Utah through the house during the morning hour was de feated by a determined filibuster led by Diugley, of Maine, and supported by almost the entire republican side. The course of the republicans fore shadows the policy upon the admis sion not only of Utah but of the other democratic territories of New' Mexico and Arizona, bills for which have al ready been favorably reported by the committee on territories. MADE POLITICIANS STARE. W. Bourke Cockran and Senator Mui phy Seen Dining Together. Washington, Dec. 9.—Those persons about the capitol who knew the drift of events in and around New York, and especially the so-called New York contingent, are discussing a little in cident witnessed in the senate restaur ant W. Bourke Cockran and Senator Murphy dined together there. To the ordinary observer this inci dent meant nothing. To the politician it was a source of wonder as to what it really did mean. This was the first public demonstration of anything like a reconciliation between these two gentlemen since the heated campaign for the succession to Senator Hlscock, and it naturally attracted the notice of New Yorkers. Lord Dufferin was elected to the presidency of the national conserva tive union at the meeting held at Card iff. The house of lords was thanked for rejecting the home rule bill.
