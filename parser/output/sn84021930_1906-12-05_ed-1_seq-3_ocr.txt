This morning's Record-Miner con- j tains an outline of the points touched in the president's message, which was I delivered to both branches of congress j at noon yesterday. Of Alaska, it says:1 "Alaska is given a great amount of at- j tention. President Roosevelt thinks j that a complete reorganization of the government of the territory is needed j at once aud is absolutely necessary. He ! asks that the reorganization be along 1 lines that ho has outlined before, in cluding a commission to revise the laws, a readjustment of taxes, and new laws necessary now through changed conditions. There is no suggestion j that territorial government should be provided. The President calls atten tion to the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific expo sition at Seattle and says that it should appeal to the citizens of the whole of the United States because it will be the means of upbuilding the commerce of the Pacific aud the United States. There can be no doubt, he says, that when in a few years more Alaska's de velopment has been increased that it will become a land of homes.
