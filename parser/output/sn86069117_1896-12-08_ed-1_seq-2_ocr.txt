The following Is a summary of President Cleveland's message te oengross. Ot affairs In Turkey the president 8 ays: Affairs In Turkey. At the outset of n reference te the mere Im portant matters affecting our relations with foreign powers. It would afford me satisfac tion If I could assure the cengres i that the dlsturbed condition In Asiatic Turkey had during the past year assumed a less hideous and bloody aspeet, and that either as a conse quence of the awakening of the Turkish gov gev eminent te the demands of humane civilize civilize ftlen. or as the result of deelstre action en the ?rt et the great nations having the right by roety te interfere for the protection of these exposed te the rage et mad bigotry and cruel xanatlelsm. the shocking features et the Bltu Bltu tlea had been mitigated. Instead, however, of welcoming a softened disposition or protective Intervention, we (have been afflicted by centlnncd and net un Xrequent reports et the I 'Wanton Destruction of Hemes and the bloody butchery et men, women and ehlldren. made martyrs te their profession et Christian faith. While noneof our citizens In Turkey have thus Tar been kIUe'3 or wounded, (heugh often in (he midst of dreadful saenes of danger, their safety in the future Is by no means as sured. Our government at home and our min ister at Constantinople have left nothing un done te protect our missionaries in Otteman territory, who constitute nearly all the Indl . t idnals residing there who hae a right te claim our protection en the score et Arncrcan citizenship Our efforts in this direction will Let be re laxed, but the de-p feeling and sympttby that have been r. eused among our people ought net te se far blind their reason and judgment as te lerd them te demand impossi ble things. Tbe ' utbreaks of blind fury which led te murder and pillage In Turkey occur suddenly and v.ltheut notlee, and an attempt en our part te force such a hostile presence there as mlht be effective ter prevention or protection r.euld net only be rcilsSyJ by tbs Otteman Government, but would bengardej us an Interruption et their plans te the great nations who assert their exclusive right te In tervene in thelr own ttme and method for the security of life and. property in Turkey. Several naval vessels are stationed In the Mediterranean as a meesure of caution and te furnish all possible relief and refuge in case of emergency. We hive made claims against the Turkish government for the plllige und dejtructlen of missionary prepsrty at Harpoot and Marash during uprisings at these places. Thus far the validity et these demands has net been admitted, though our minister, prier te such outrages and in antioipatlen or danger, de manded protection for the parson stiS property et our missionary citizens In the localities men tioned end notwithstanding that strong evi dence exists of actual complicity of Turkish soldiers In the work of destruction and rob bery. , Insurrection In Cuba. The insurrection in Cuba still eentlnues with all Its perplexities. It is difficult te per ceive that any progress has thus far been made towards the paotflcatlen of the Island er that the situation of affairs as depicted In my last annual message has In the least im proved. It Spain still holds Havana and the Seaports and all the considerable towns, the Insurgents still ream at will ever at least tv-thlrds et the Inland country, If the de termination of 8paln,te put down tbe Insur rection seems but te strengthen with tbe lapse) of time and Is evidenced by her unhesi tating devotion of largely increased military and naval forces te the task, there Is much reason te believe that the Insurgents have gained In point et numbers, and character, and rereurees. and are none the less Inflexible In their resolve net te sueeumb without practic ally Securing the great objects for which they tow up arms. It Spain has net yet re-estab-Udatd her authority, neither have the insur gents yet mids geed thalr title te be re garded Ae an Independent State. Indeed, as the contest has gene en, the pro pre pro teose that civil government exists en tbe attend, exeeptse far as Spain Is able te main tain H, has been praotleany abandoned. pain does keep en toot sueh a government, spare or less lmperfeetly, In the large towns nttd their Immediate suburbs. Det, that ex ' coptlen being made, the entire country Is either given ever te anarchy or Is subject te tne military occupation of Nene or the ether Jtrty, It is reperted, indeed, en reliable au au Sherity that, at the demand of the command" er-ln-chlef of the insurgent army, the Putative Cuban Government baa new given up all attempt te exercise Its functions ltvtag thtt government confeeeed cenfeeeed br (what there Is the hist reason for suppos ing It always te have been In faet) a govern Kent merely en paper.

American Interests la Cuba. The spectacle of the utter rutn et an adjoin ing country, by nature eae et the most fertile and eharmlng en the glebe, would eagege the serious attention et the government and the people et the United States under any clrcum clrcum steneea. In point of tact, they have a coaeern with it which Is by no means of a wholly phll phll anthreplcal or sentimental character. It lies se near te us as te be hardly separated from our territory. Our actual pecunlare'lnterest In It is second only te that of the people and government of Spain, It Is reasonably esUmated that at least 120,000,000 te 150,000,000 of Amerlepn cap ital are Invested In plantations and In rail road, mining and ether business enterprises en the island. The volume of trade between the United States and Cuba, which In 1839 amounted te about 184,000,090, rose fa 1893 te about (103,000,000, and In 18.1, the year before the present insurrection broke out, amount amount te nearly f 99,000.000. Besides this large pe cuniary stake In the fortunes et Cubu, the Unlted States finds itself inextricably In volved In the present oentest In ether ways both voxatleus and costly. Many Cubans reside In this country and In directly promote the Insurrection through the press by public meeting, by the purchase and ahlpment of arms, by the raising of funds and by ether means, which the spirit of our Institutions and the tenor of Our Laws De Net Permit Te be made the subject et criminal prosecu tions. Seme of them, though Cubans at heart and In all their feellngs and interests, have taken out papers as naturalized citizens of the Unit ed States, a proceeding resorted te with a vlew te possible protection by this govern ment, and net unnaturally regarded with much Indignation by the country et their origin The insurgents are undoubtedly en couraged and supported by the widespread sympathy the people of this country always end Instinctively feel for every struggle for better and freer government, and which. In the case et the mere adVcntcreus and restless elements of our population, leads In only tee many Instances te active and personal partici pation in the contest The result Is that this government Is con stantly called upon te protcet American citi zens, te claim damages for injuries, te persons and property, new estimated at many millions of dollars, and te ask explanations and apole gies for the acts of Spanish officials, whose zeal for tbe repression of rebellion sometimes blinds them te the Immunities, be longing tq the unoffending citizens et a friendly power. It fellows from the same causes that tbe United States Is compelled te actively police a leng Una of sea oeast against Unlawful Expeditions, The escape of whleh the utmost vigilance will netnlways suffice te prevent These Inevitable entanglements of the United States, with the rebellion In Cuba, the large American preparty Interests altseted, and considerations of philanthropy and hu manity In generaU have led te a vehement de mand In various quarters, ter some sort et positive Intervention en the part of the United States. It was at first proposed that belligerent rights should be accorded te the Insurgents, a propo prepo sition no longer urged because untimely and In practical operation clearly perilous and In jurious te our own Interests It has stnee been and Is new sometimes contended that the Independence et the insurgents should be recognized. Duj Imperfect end ijUlctcjl QJ the Spanish government et the island may be, no ether exists there unless tbe will of the military officer In temporary command et a particular district can be dignified as a species of government It ls.new also suggested that tbe United States should buy tbetlsland a suggestion possibly worthy et consideration If there were any evidence of a desire or willing cess en the part et Spain te entertain such a proposal. It Is urged finally, all ether meth ods falling. tEe existing Internecine strife In Cuba should be. Terminated Ily Our Intervention, even at the cost of a war botv.cen the United States and Spain a war Which Its advocates confidently prophesy could be neither large In Its proportions nor doubtful In Its Issue. The correctness of this forecast need be neither affirmed nor denied The Unlted States has, nevertheless, a character te maintain as a na tion, which plainly dictates that right, and net might, sbeuTd be tbe rule of Its conduct Further. though the United States Is net a na tion te which peace Is a necessity, It Is In truth the most paclfle of powers and desires nothing se much as te live In amity with all the world. Its own ample and diversified do mains satisfy all possible longings for terri tory, preeluds all dreams of conquest and pre vent any eastlng of covetous eyes upon neigh boring regions, however attractive. That our conduct toward Spala and her dominions has constituted no exoepttea te this national dis position Is made manifest by the course of our government, net only thus far during the pres ent Insurrection, butdurlng the ten years that followed the rising at Yara In 1868. Spain Should Offer-Autonomy. It would seem that If Spain aheuld offer te Cuba genuine autonomy a measure of home rule which, while preserving the sovereignty ei spam, would sauary an rational require ments of her Spanish subjeets-there would , uc bu jui reason way iai pMiacaiiea ei me Island might net be offeated en that basis. Such a result would appear te be in tbe true interest of all concerned It would at enee step the confllet, which Is new consuming the resources et the Island and making It worth less for whichever party may ultimately pre vail It would keep Intact tbe possessions of Spain without touching her honor, which will be consulted rather than Impugned by the adoquate redress of admitted grtevancca It would put the prosperity of the Island and the fortunes of Its Inhabitants within their own oentrol, without severing the natural and ancient ties wbleh bind them te the mother country, and would yet enable them te test their capaelty for self government under the most favorable conditions It has been objected en the one side that Spain should net premise autonomy until her insurgent subjects lay down their arma On the ether side, that premised autonomy, however liberal, Is insufficient, beeause, with out assurane of the premise being fulfilled. But the reasonableness of a requirement by Spain, of unconditional surrender en the part of the Insurgent Cubans before their autonomy la conceded Is notaltegether apparent It ig nores Important features of the situation the stability two years duration has glvea te the Insurrectien: tbe feasabllty of Its Indefi nite prolongation in tbe nature of things, and as shown by past experience: the utter and Imminent ruin of the Island, unless the pres ent strife Is speedily composed; abeye all, the rank abuses which all parties la Spain, all branches of her government and all her lead ing publle men concede te exist and profess a desire te remove. racing sneb ctreumstances, te withheld the prefer of needed reforms until the parties de manding them put themselves at tbelr mercy by throwing down their arms, has tbe appear ance of neglecting the gravest of perils and Inviting suspicion as te the sincerity of any Frefeflsed Willingness te Grant Reforms. The objection en behalf of the Insurgents that premised reforms ean net be relied upon mutt, et course, be considered, though we have no right te assume, and no reason for assuming, that anything- Spain undertakes te de for the relief of Cuba will net be done ac cording te both tbe spirit and the letter et the undertaking. Neyertheless, realizing that suspicions and precautions en the pari of the weaker of two ceabataau are always natural and net al ways unjustifiable being stneerely desirous la the interest of both as well as ea Its own aeaA4 that tne Cuba problem should be 44 trtt te least peeelMe tVetay-lt was by Wis eewMSMat te Mm severa- ft naeM eaewtlM Mm.

Ilea, tbe United States would endeavor te find a way net objectionable te Spain of furnish ing such guaranty. ' While no definite response te this latlaa latlaa tten has yet been ree'elve from the Spanish government. It It believed te be net altogether unweloeme, while, as already suggested, no reason Is perceived why It should net be ap proved by the Insurgents, Neither party can (all te see the Importance of Early Action and both must realize that te prolong the present state et things ter even a short period will odd enormously te the time and labor and expenditure necessary te bring aoeui me in dustrial reouperatloa et the Island. It la therefore fervently hoped en all grounds that earnest offetts ter healing the breaeh between Spain and the Insurgent Cu bans, en the lines above lndieated, may be at ence Inaugurated and pushed te a successful Issue. The friendly offices of the United States, either in the manner above outlined, or In any ether way consistent with our con stitution and laws, will always bejat the dis posal of either party. eWhen the Inability et Spain te deal suc cessfully with the Insurrection has become manlfest, and It Is demonstrated that her Sovereignty It Extinct In Cuba for all purposes et Its rightful exlstonce, and when a hopeless struggle ter Its re-establish-ment has degenerated Inte a strlfe which means nothing mere than the utalcss sacrifice of hnman life and the utter destruction of the very subject-matter et the conflict a sltua sltua atlen will be presented in which our obliga tions te the sovereignty et Spain will be su perseded by the higher obligations, which we ean hardly hesitate te recognize and dis charge. Deferring the ohetoe of ways and methods until the time ter action arrives, we should make them depend upon the procUe condi tions then existing; and they should net be determined upon without giving careful heed te every consideration Involving our honor and Interest, or the International duly we ewe te Spain. Until we faee the contingencies suggested or the situation Is by ether Inci dents Imperatively changed, we should con tinue In the line et cenduet heretofore pur sued, thus in all circumstances exhibiting our obedlenco te the requirements of public law and our regard for the duty enjoined upon us by the position we occupy In tbe family of na tions. Venezuela Boundary Question. The Venezuelan boundary question has ceascd te be a matter et difference between Great Britain and the United States, their respective governments having agreed upon the substantial previsions of a treaty between Great Britain and Venezuela submitting the whole controversy te arbitration The pro pre visions of the treaty are se eminently jt.it and fair that the assent et Venezuela thereto may confidently be anttclDatcd. Negotiations for a treaty of general arbitra tien ter all differences between Great Britain and the United State are far edvanced and premise te reaeh a successful consummation at an early date. Examination of Consular Applicants. The scheme of examining applicants for cer tain consular positions, te ten their comp cemp tency and fitness, was adopted under an ex ecutive order issued en the 0th of Septem ber, 1895, his fully demonstrated the lueful ness et this Innovation. In connection with this plan et examination, promotions and teansters of deserving Incumbent have been quite extensively made.wlth excellent results The Inspection et consular offices provided for by an appropriation for that purpose at the last session of the congress, has been pre ductive et such wholesome effects, that I hope this Important work will In the f uture be con tinued. I desire te repeat the recommendation con tained In my last annual messnge, In f iver of providing at publle expense official residences for our ambassadors and minister at ferelgu capitals, Preservation of Seal Life. We have, during the last year, labored faithfully against unfavorable conditions, te secure better preservation of seal llfe In the Behrlng sea. Beth the United States and Great Britain have lately dispatched commis sioners te these waters te study tbe habits and condition of the seal herd and the causes et their rapid decrease. Upen tbe reports of these commissioners, seen te be submitted, and with the excclse of patience and geed sense en the pnrtef all Interested parties. It la earn estly hoped that hearty co-operation may be secured for the protection against threatened extinction et seal life In the Northern Pacific and Behrlng seas. lteeelpts and Expenditures. The secretary of the treasury reports that hlurlng tbe fiscal year, ended June 30, 1890, the receipts of tbe government from all sources amounted te t(0SU73,-(0aTa During the snme period Its expenditures were (131,678,854 48 The excess of expenditures ever receipts thus amounting te 8A,:03,:t5.70.

Our Army. The report of the socretary of war exhibits satisfactory conditions in the saveral branch es of the publle servlce intrusted te his charge. Tbe limit et our military force, as fi zed by law, Is constantly and readily main tained. The present discipline and morals et our army arc excellent, and marked progress and efficiency arq apparent throughout Its en- lira organization With the excoptten et delicate duttes In the suppression of slight Indian disturbances along our southwestern boundary, in whleh the Mexlcan troops co-operated, and the com pulsory but peaceful return, with the consent et Great Britain, of a band et Cree In dians from Mentana te' the British possessions, no aettve operations have been required of the army during the year past During the past year the work et construct ing permanent Infantry and cavalry pests has been continued at the places heretofore desig nated. The socretary et war, repeats his rec ommendation, that appropriations for bar racks and quarters should tnore strictly con form te the needs of the servlce as judged by the department rather than respond te the wishes and Importunities of localities. Organised State Sllllatla. The organized mllltlt numbers 113 879 men The appropriations for Its support by the sev eral states approxtmate (3,800,003 annually, and (100,000 Is contributed by the general gov ernment Investigation shows these troops te be usually weft drilled and Inspired with much military interest, but in many instances they are se deficient In proper arms and equipment that a sudden call te active duty would find them Inadequately prepared for field service.. I therefore recommend that prompt measurcs be taken te remedy this condition, and that every cnoeuragement be given te this desrvlng body et unpaid and vol untary eltlzen soldiers, upon whose asslstanee we must largely rely In time of trouble. Erection and Armament of Fortification. During the past year rapid progress has been made toward the completion of the scheme adopted for the erection and arma ment of fortifications along our sea coast, while equal progress has been made In pro viding the material for submarfne defense In connection with these works. It Is peculiarly gratifying at this time te note the great advance that has been made In this Important undertaking since the date of jnj annual message te the fifty-third con gress at the opening of Its second session, In December, 18ES. At that time 1 Informed the congress et tbe approaching completion of nine 13 Inch, 0 10 Inch and 34 eight inch high power steel guns, and 76 13 inch rifled raor raer turn Tilt; Guns. Since that ttme the number of guns actually completed has been Increased te a total of 31 Ul-lnch. 66 10-Inch, 61 8-Inch high pewar breecb-leadlng steel guns, 10 rapid-fire guns and 80 13-Inch rifled mortars. In addition there are la process et construction one 16 Inch type gun, 60 13-lnch, 56 10-Inch. 37 8-lnch high power guns, and (6 12-Inch rifled mor mer tars: In all 433 guns and mortars During the same year, immediately preceding the mes sage referred te. the first modern gun carriage bad been completed and 11 mere were In pro cess of construction. All but one were et the nen-dlsappcaring type. These, however, were net such as te secure necessary cover for the artillery gun ners against the intense flre of medern ma chine rapid flre and high power guns. The Inventlve genlus of ordnance and civil ian experts has been taxed In designing car riages that would obvlate this fault, result ing, It Is believed. In the solution of this diffi cult problem, Since 1893 the number et gun carriages constructed or building has been raised te a total of 120, of which 90 are en the disappearing prlnclple, and the number of mortar carriages te 153, while the 05 emplace ments which were provided for prier te that time have been Increased te 389 built and building. United States Penitentiaries. The attorney general presents a detailed and Interesting statement of the Important work dene under bis supervision during the last flseal year. The ownership and manage-, ment by the government' of penitentiaries for tbe confinement of the convicted In United States oeurts et violation of federal laws, which for many years has been a subjeet of executive reoemmendatton, has at last te a slight extent been reaHzed by the utilization et tbe abandened military prison at Pert Leavenworth as a United States ponttentlary. This Is eertalnly a movement In the right dlreotlen: but It ought te be at once supple mented by the rebuilding or extensive en largement et this improvised prison and the construstlen et at least one mere, te be lo cated in the southern states. The capacity of the Leavenworth penitentiary la se limited that the expense of its maintenance, calcu lated at a per capita rate upon the number of prisoners It ean accomedate does net make as eoenomloal an exhibit as It would If It were larger and better adapted te prison purposes; but I am thoroughly con vinced that eeonemy. humanity and a proper senBe of responsibility and duty toward these whom we nunlsh for violations of federal law. dictate that the federal government should' have the entire control and management et the penitentiaries where convtcted violators are confined. It appears that stnee the transfer et the Fert Leavenworth military prison te Its new uses, the work previously done by prisoners confined, there, aad for whleh expensive ma chinery has been provided, has been discon tinued. This work oenslsted et ibe manufac ture of artistes for army use, new done else where.

The traaeaaltelea at the rate et one-cent a pound of serial libraries, advertising sheets, "house erganc (periodicals advertising tome particular "beuse" or institution), sample copies and the like, ought eertalnly te bt dis continued. A glanee at tbe rovenuec received for the work done last year will show mere plainly than any ether statement the grets abuse et tbe postal servlce and the growing waste of lte earnlngsi The free matter earrled In the malls for the departments, efQsts, etc, et the govern ment and for congress In pounds amount te 94,480,189. The entire expenditures of the department, Including pay for transportation credited te the Paclfle railroads was (92,180,106,11, which may be considered as the oest et receiving, carrying and dollverleg mall matter, though the seoend-class matter constituted mere than two-thirds et the total that was carried, the rorenue derived from It was less, than one ene thtrtteth of the total expense. The average revonue from each pound of first-class matter was93cents. Salaries Instead of Fees. It is most gratlf ylng te note the satisfac tory results that have followed the Inaugura tion of the new system provided for by the act et May 38, 1896,under Which certain federal officials are compensated by salaries Instead et fees. The new plan was put In operation en the first day of July, 1896, and already the great economy it enforces. Its prevention of abuses and Its tendency te a better enforce ment of the laws, are strikingly apparent Detalled evldence et the usefulness of this long-delayed but new happily accomplished reform will be found, clearly set forth In the attorney general's report. The growth in weight et soeond class mat ter has been from 399,000,009 pounds in 1891 te 313,000,000 In 1895, and te almeat (319,000,000 In 1896, and It la qutte -evident this Increasing drawback is far outstripping any possible growth of postal revenues. Abuses Should be Corrected. Our mall sorvtce should, et course, be suCn as te meet tbe wants and even the Convenien ces of our people, at a direct charge upon them se light as perhaps te exclude the Idea of our pest office department being a money making cencern: but In the faee of a constant ly recurring deficiency In Its rovenues, and In view et the fact that we supply the best mall service la the world, It seems te me It is quite time te correct the abuses that swell enorm ously our annual deflclt If we concede the publle policy of carrying weekly news papers free In the county of pub lication, and even the polley of carry ing at less than one-tcnth et thelr oest ether bona fide newspapers and periodicals there can be no excuse for subjeetlng the ser vice te the further Immense and Increasing less Involved In carrying at the nominal rate et one com a pound the scrUl libraries, some times Including trashy and even harmful literature, and ether matter which under tbe loose Interpretation of a loose statute, has been gradually glven second class rates, thus absorbing all profitable returns derived from first class matter, which pays three or lour times raare than Its cost, and producing a large annual' less te be paid by general taxa tion. If sueh second class matter paid merely the cost et Its handling, our deflelt would disap pear and a surplus result which might be used te give the peeple , Still Better Hall Facilities or cheaper rates of letter postage. I recom mend that legislation be at ence enacted te correct these abuses and Introduee better business Ideas In the regulation of our postal rates. Experience and observation have dem onstrated that certain Improvements In tbe organization of the J pest office department must be served before we can gain the full benefit of the Immense sums exponded In Its administration. I especially recommend such a recasting et the appropriations by congress ter the pest office department as will permit the postmas ter general te proceed with tbe work of con solidating pest offices. This work has already been entered upon sufficiently te fully demon strate, by experiment and experience, that such consolidation is productive of better servlce, larger revenues, and less expenditures te say nothing et the further advantage, et gradually withdrawing pest offices from the spoils system, The Werk of the Navy. , The work of the navy department and Its present conditions are fully exhibited In the report et the secretary. yhe construction of vessels for our new navy has been energetically preseeuted by the present administration upon the general lines previously adopted, the department having seen no necessity for radical changes In prier methods under which the work was found te be progressing In a manner highly satisfac tory. It has been decided, howevor, te pro vide In every ship building contract that the builder should pay all trial expenses, and It has also been determined te pay no speed pre miums in future contracts, -ei On March 4, 1893, there were In commission but two armered vessels, tbe double turreted monitors Mtantonemoh and Monterey. Since that date, of vessels theretofore authorized, there have been plaeed in thejr first commis sion three first class and two second class battle ships, two armored erutters, one har bor defease ram, and five deubled turreted monitors, Ineludlng the Maine and the Purl tan, just completed. Eight new unartnered cruisers and two new gunboats have also beeu eemm lsslened. The Iowa, another battleship, will be oempleted about March 1, and at least four mere gun boats will be ready fer sea in the early spring. It Is gratifying te state that our ships and their outfits are believed te be equal te the best that can be manufactured elsewhere, and that such notable reductions have been made In tbelr oest, as te justify the statement that quite a number et vessels are new being con structed at rates as low as these that prevail In European shipyards. The Government Navy Tarda. Our manufacturing facilities are at this time ample for alt possible naval oentingeaoles. Three of our government navy yards, these at Mare Islaad, Cat.. Norfolk, Va and Brooklyn, N. Y., are equipped for ship building, our ord erd ord nanee plant la Washington Is equal te any In the world and at the torpedo station we are successfully making the highest grades et smokeless powder. Three" first elate private ship yards at Newport News, Philadelphia and San Francisce are building battle ships: eloven contractors, situated In tbe states et Maine. Rbode Island, Pennsylvania, New Jer sey, Maryland, Virginia and state of Wash ington are constructing gunboats er teryede beats. Twe plants are manufacturing large quanti ties of first etass armor, aad Amerleaa factor ies are producing aufientebUe torpedoes, pow der, projectiles, rapid-fire guns, and every thing else necessary for tbe complete eutnt et naval vessels. . There bave been autherised by ceigres since atareb, 1893. five battle ships, six light draft gnnbeats, sixteen torpedo beats and Oaa submarine beat Contracts for the bulldjeg of all et them have been let Tbe secretary expressed the opinion that we bare for the present a auffioient suDply of cruisers tad gunboats and that beresAer the ponttruetlpa of battle ships and torpedo beats will supply our needs.

The amount paid oxelustvely teri pensions during the year was llM,tl4,TfllOI,i , asllrht decrease trew that of the nreeedlnen year, while the total exptaniturei en teeeant) et pensions, Ineludlng the oeM et stain talnlng the department and the ex penaesi attending pension distribution! amounted te 1141,206,530,69, or within a vern small fraction et one-third of the entire ex pense of supporting the government duxler' the seme year. The number of new pension oertlfleatcs tutted was 95,610. Of these 40.374. represent original alie wanoe of claims and) 16,878, Increases of extstlng pensions. The number et persons receiving pension ' from tbe United States but resldlng in foreign oeuntrles at the oleso et the lata flseal year was 3,781, and the amount paid te them during! the year (582,735.33. The sum appropriated for the payment of pensions for the ourreet fiscal yetr esfllug June 30, 1879, Is (140,000.000. and for the suo sue suo eeedlcg year It is estimated that the same ' amount will be necessary. The commissioner of pensions reports that during the last flseal year 319 Indictments were found against violators of the pension laws. Upen these lndletments 167 convictions resulted ' In my opinion, based upon such statements' as these and auch ether Information and ob servations, the abuses which have been al lowed te oreep Inte enr pension system bare dene incalculable harm In demoralizing our people and undermining geed eltlzentblp. I have endeavered within my sphere of official duty te protect our pension roll and make it what it aheuld be, a roll of honor, oentatalee; the names of theso disabled In our country's sorvlce and worthyet their country's affection ate romembranee. , Agricultural Department. The department of agriculture Is se Inti mately related te tbe welfare et our people and the prosperity of cur nation that itthcruid constantly Yoeelve the oare and encourage ment of the government, Large sun of meney are annually appropriated for t maintenance of this department, nnd it mult be confessed that the legislation relating Uip has net always been directly In the lnterenftt practical farming or properly guarded atMaJV waste and extravagance. Se tar, howevefaa publle money has been appropriated fattl and sensibly te help 'theso who aetumf till the soil, no expenditure has been merd profit ably made or mere generally approved by the poeplo. , Under the present management of tbe it- i partment Its usefulness has been enbancedin every dlroctten, and at the same time strut economy has been enforced te tbe utmost dx tent permitted by congressional action. Vtim the report et the secretary It appears that thpeug h carefut and prudent financial man agemtnt he has annually saved a large 8Uft from bis appropriations, aggregating during his tncuubeney and up te the close et too toe tee present fiscal year one-fifth et the entire amount appropriated. Farm Pred acts Expert. The secretary reports that the value of our experts during the flseal year amounted t (570,000003, an Increase et tir,j00,tO0 eyer thf thf year Immediately preceding. This statement Is net the less welcome be cause et the feet that, notwithstand ing sueh Increase, the propertloh e.t' ' experted agricultural produett te our total experts of all descriptions fell oft durlfif the year. The benefits of en Inerease In at , rleultural experts being assured, the decrease In Its proportion te our total experts Is te mere gratifying when we consider that it It owing te the fact that such total experts for the year increased mere than I75.000.0W. The large and Increasing exportation et our ogrteultucal products suggests the great use fulness of the organlzattea lately established In the department for the purpose et giving te these engaged in farming pursuits reliable In formation concerning the condition, needs and advantages of different forelgn markets. The Present Tariff Law. I desire te recur te the statements Ise- ', where made concerning the government's re ceipts and expenditures for the purpose of . venturing upoifseme suggestions touching , our present tariff law and its operation. I Tbls statute took effect en the SSth day or August, 1891 Whatever may be Its short comings as a complete measure e? tariff re' form, it must be conceded that it bes esened . the way te a freer and greater exehanf fi 6J commodities between us and ether oeuncf Q, and thus furnished a wider market for Our produets and manufactures. Tbe only entire flseal year during whteh. this law haa been In foree ended en the 8594 day of June, 1896. In that year ear Imports lnereased ever theso of the previous year year mere than t6,500000,'whlla the value et the de- mesttc preducte we experted and whreh teuad . marketa abroad, was nearly (70,000,000 more mere than during the preeedlng year. These who Insist that the cost te our people of articles coming te them from abroad for fer thelr nredful use should only be tncreased through tariff charges te an extent necessary te meet the expenses of the government, as well as these who elnlm that Urtff churges may be laid upon sueh nrtleles beyond the ne cessities of go eminent revenue, und with the additional purpose et se increasing their prlee In our markets as te give American manufac turers and producers better and mere profita ble opportunities, must agree that our tariff" laws are primarily Jujtlded ae seurees et rev enue te enable the sqverhment te meet the necessary expenses ei its maintenance. Con sidered as te its suffloleney in this aspect tbe present law can by no means fall under Jnttri . condemnation. vV I believe our present tariff law, If allewed a fair opportunity, will In the near future yields -a revenue, which, with reasonably eoenemloali'1 expenditures, will overcome all deficiencies. The Deficit Need Net Disturb Us. In the meantime no deficit that boa oa ea oa eurred or may ecaur need excite or dis turb us. Te meet any sue,h deficit we have In the. treasury, In additions te a geld reserve Ait one hundred million, a tarplut of mere than one hundred and twenty-eight millions of dollare dellare dollare applleable te the pcymeatef tae expenses e tbe government, aad which must, unless ap pended for that purpose, remain nuleaa heard, or, if net extravagantly wasted, mt In any event be. perverted frea tbe purpose of Its exaction from our people.
