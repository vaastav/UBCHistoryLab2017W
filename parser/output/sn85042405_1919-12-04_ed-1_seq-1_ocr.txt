LEAGUE STEAM AGAIN IN ACTI INDEPENDEN Two-th®"ds Lacks Fbor to Six Votes in. House. Bismarck, N. D., Dec. 5.—(Spe cial.)—The league steam roller was oiled up and trotted into action Tues day afternoon when by votes of 32 to 16 in the senate and 68 to 42 in the house a number of important meas ures essential to the administration were passed or recommended for final passage, while by the same ma jority bills to which the administra tion was opposed were retired for in definite postponement. The league was shown by this first real test of passage of emergency clauses givins strength to have a bare two-thirds majority, which is necessary to the measures immediate effect, in the senate, but in the house it is from four to six votes short of the requir ed two-thirds majority. The day's results were the passage by the senate of a bill removing from Attorney-General Laager the power conferred upon him by this sapie as sembly in its last regular session the slaying for the second time at the hands of the league majority of a nonpartisan primary ballot bill the introduction over the protest of the minority of an administration house bill empowering the governor to ap point a state sheriff and to create a state constabulary .the passage by ^-tbe-\eeHate of a bill exempting all bank deposits from taxation the re jection by the house of an independ ent measure repealing the present re quirement that electors vote for presr idential candidates at the March pri maries, when ordinarily there are no bona fide presidential candidates recommendation for passage of a house bill defining an election pre cinct recommendaton for passage of the house administration resolution urging the supreme court of the United States to speed action on the 42 taxpayers' suit against the lea gue"" program recommendation for passage of the administration amend ments to the soldiers' bounty act and of the administration house measure reducing the legal reserve for de mand deposits from 20 per cent to ten and on time deposits from ten to seven, and the rejection -by the solid league majority in the house it a bill Introduced by the independents requiring the state banking board to examine the Bank of North Dakota at least once each year. The senate has passed on third reading S. B. 7, relating to the de struction of predatory animals S. B. 22, providing increased salaries for court stenographers, and S. B. 4, re pealing the special assistants granted the attorney general during the last session, in addition to the concur rent resolution ratifying women's v suffrage. The house has passed on none of its own bills on.third read ings, and has passed to date but two senate bills, the suffrage resolution and the measurb dealing with preda tory animals. Final action in the senate on S. B. A, regarded as'a punitivp measure di­ rected by the league against Attorney. General Langer,, called forth a sharp tilt between Senator Mess, an insur gent leaguer, opposing, the bill, and Senator Cahill, leaguer, and author of. the measure. The yote was 32 to" 16, with Senator Sikes absent and nOt VOjting.

LLER Removes Powers Granted Attorney General Lahger at Last Regular Session, Kills Nonpartisan Primary Ballot Bill and Rejects Measure Requiring State Banking Board to ^Examine Bank of North Da^ ^f Least Once Each Year -^taarae Has Bare MEASURES Majority in Senate and ponement 68 to 42, with three ab sW, Two "liuonte^were presented by the elections commf&ae on the nonparti san ballott bill intrtduced by Burt ness and O'Connor oh^V^nd Forks. The league majority recommended indefinite postponement, the minor ity urged the passage ~of the bill. Leaders of the independents, headed by O'Connor, called attention to the fact that a nonpartisan ballot was included in the league's original plat form that the league members of the first house voted unanimously for such a bill, and that a change in sen timent had become apparent only during the last regular session. Walter J. Maddock, league floor leader, seemed to voice the senti ment of many of his Nonpartisan as sociates, when he said: "I don't know why the majority is against this bill I am neither for it ot against it, but the majority is oppos ed to it, and I see no reason for not voting with the majority." The vote by which the nonparti san ballot wafe'kfllefl was 63 to 45, a gain of ,ten for acfvBcates of this measure over the vote on the same bill in the regular session last win ter. Representative Burtness expressed inability to grasp the theory un^er which the league majority on the elections committee reported for slaughter Representative Reishus' bill eliminating from the presidential primaries the necessity of voting di rectly for a presidential candidate. Mr. Burtness called attention to the fact that in the last presidential pri mary-republican electors were called upon to choose between Esterbrook and LaFollette and that neither was the candidate finally placed before the national convention Chairman Whipple of the elections committee gave as the reason for his recommendation that the bill was un important and would take up too much of the time of the house?. "Cause for Suspicion." Cause for suspicion was found by minority members in the report of the majority on banks and banking recommending the killing of a bill requiring the state banking board to examine at least once each year the Bank of. North Dakota, repository for $17,500,000 in public funds. "I was surprise to hear the report of this committee read," said said Burtness of Grand Forks. "If the majority takes the position of refusing to let the banking board, composed of ex ecutives elected by the people, exam ine this bank, it win simply^ lend col or to the stories current that there is something within this bank which will not bear investigation." "I voted for some of the public utilities sponsored by the league at the last session," said O'Connor of Grand Forks. "This bank -is consid ered a part of the league program. The only way to establish faith of the people. in these institutions is to make them amenable to constituted authority. The public business is the public's business. Refusal to permit an examination creates suspicion. The banking- board has the authority to got into every private bank in the state and examine its books. This •public: bank should ,be as open to in spection, Jtoshow, tiie public '-that there are no "securities"'twere or other things that will riot .stotqd! examina tion." Every county, every school district and township and municipality in the stite is required to keep 'its funds in this bank," said Peterson of Gwlnner. "Every taxpayer in the state has'- an interest in this bank. The public should have the same safeguards that are thrown around private depositors. ..There must be something about this bank that the majority in this house want to shield. That is the impression that the pub lic is bound to set from this ,action here today.- '"'v V'' Reishus of Ward gently called the 1 i '•41.-. V' ','T, i "fr- fpt T" house's attention to the fact that less than a year ago it was voting more power and larger appropria tions to an official who stood high in the league counsels, and that the minority which attempted to oppose this action had short shift. Tpday, he said, the same league mapority is doing everything In its power to strip this official of his appropriations and new powers. "The presumption is that the Bank of North Dakota is in good shape to day. But administrations change, and it is reasonable to suppose that as administrations change the man agement of the bank will change, an'l the public which has Its millions in this bank is entitled to ordinary pro tection." The only defense of the commit tee report came from Strom of the majority who declared the state examiner waq required to examine the bank once a year and that Gov ernor Frazier could have it examined oftener if he desired. The State Sheriff. The state sheriff, as created by Representative Alberts' administra tfcm bill, carrying out a recommenda tion of Vne governor, would receive $3,000 per annum ami-an appropria tion of $10,000. He would be the head of the state constabulary, which he is to form, and would have ppwer to name not more than three agents to assist him in enforcing the laws, suppressing riots and prosecuting crime. Report of Free Love. The report of the so-called free love investigating committee of the house is a special order for five this afternoon. It is understood the com mittee, a majority of whom are lea guers, will present a report admit ting that the volumes attacked by Rep. Burtness are in the state library and the traveling libraries that go to rural schools, but that it will attach a complete list of the volumes in the state library, to prove that not all of them are of socialistic tendencies. The state affairs committee in the senate will vote out for favorable action a bill reaving Insurgent State Auditor Kositzky from the state auditing board and substituting for him Insurance Commissioner Ols ness, a regular leaguer, who will also be secretary of the board. Other punitive measures directed at the state auditor and the attorney general are expected to come up for final action today. Battle Over Curtailment 01 Powers of the Attorney General Carried to House (By the Associated Press) Bismarck, Dec. 3.—The political battle between the independents and Norpartisan League factions of the North Dakota legislature over a bill curtailing the powers of the attorney general todgy shifted to the floor of the house on presentation of the measure which yesterday developed 32 to 16 victory for the league in the senate. The senate bill before the repre sentatives would repeal a law author izing the attorney general to appoint special assistants, and a bill spon sored by £he administration and now pending provides for placing in the hands of the governor the power of these appointments. The league's efforts to obtain the. required two-thirds vote for adop tion of an emergency clause which would make the legislation immed iately effective is expected to develop a bitter fight.

COMPARISON OF N. D. AND MINNESOTA TAXES Grand Forks, N. D., Nov. 29.— Minnesota is a gang-governed state, controlled by "Big-Biz," hostile to the interests of the farmers, accord ing to the Grand Forks Herald. Well, let's see! We'll begin at home. Grand Forks county, North Dakota, and Polk county, Minn., adjoin each other. In general the actual average value of farm property in the two counties is about the same. So a comparison of the state taxes paid by the farmers in the two counties ought to be a fair one. So here is the comparison in tab ulated form of the taxes on farm property in the two counties. The Polk county figures include struc tures: Grand Forks county, N. D.—Aver age assessed valuation, per acre $50.80 state tax rate, mills, $2.97 average state tax, per acre, 15c. Polk county, Minn.:—Average as sessed valuation, per acre, $12.01 state tax rate mills, $8.15 average state^tax, per acre, 9c. In other.. ,words in Polk county, Minn., the average farmer owning 160 acres of land will pay to the state this year a tax of $15.62. In Grand Forks county, North Dakota, the av erage farmer owning 160 acres of land will pay to the state a tax of $22.22, or $9.62 more than the Min nesota man paid. Therefore the average state tax on a quarter section in Grand Forks county, N. D., is 61.4 per cent higher than average state tax on the same amount of land in Polk county, Minn. H. WOLFER.

COMMITTEE FINDS RADICAL BOOKS IN STATESUBRARIES Librarian Says That All of the Books on Socialism, Anar chy, Free Love and Sabot age Were Not Sent Out in Every Box. Bismarck, N. D„ Dec. 2.— (Spe cial.)—The house committee Inves tigating Representative C. B. Burt commission, dominated by the state board of admiinstration, has prepar ness' charges that the public library ed for distribution thru circulating libraries destined for the use of coun try schools treatises advocating free love, socialism and anarchism, met following a visit to the public library commission's office and an interview with the deputy librarian last eve ning and agreed upon the following points: 1. That all of the books whose ti tles were read in the house by Rep. Burtness were actually in the library. 2. That practically all of the books known were found to be in the trav eling libraries, designed for use n the rural schools. 3. That the deputy librarian de fended the presence of these volumes in the library, declaring them to be by reputable authors and to be good material for the traveling libraries which furnish the rural school chil dren of the state with their reference works. On point four, submitted for agreement by Rep. J. F. T. O'Connor of Grand Forks, a minority member of the committee, there was a warm argument. Mr. O'Connor submitted the fact that the books found in the list read by Rep. Burtness were found in the traveling library, in travel ing library box No. 107, or -on top of the same. At this juncture the majority mem bers of the committee blew up. They insisted that this proposition created an inference that these books "were actually being sent out to the schools." Rep. O'Connor replied: "What we're interested in gentlemen, is facts, not inferences. Here are the facts: Traveling Library Box No. 107," the books in that box and on top of the box you can read the titles for yourselves. There are the facts, gentlemen and that is all the house of representatives asks of this committee." The committee met early this .af ternoon to decide upon its full re port to the house. It is not believed there will be any necessity for a divi sion as to the facts, which minority members declare clear and incontro vertible. In Two Divisions. Miss Peterson, the deputy librar ian, recently brot here from New York, explained to the committee that ther are two classes of volumes in the public library, those classed as educational and those which make up the traveling libraries, which are sent out to the rural schools. She testified that not all of the works on socialism, anarchy, free love, sabo tage, positive criminalogy and syn dicalism were always sent out in the same box, but when a request came In from a country school for Informa tion on sociology she selected from these works volumes which she felt would best answer the purpose. She declared that traveling library Box 107 had been assembled and giv en a place near the door of the li brary for -the benefit of the legisla tors, whom she regarded as "men of discretion" and whom she was con fident would be interested in these subjects.. These works, which she declared she had ordered on her own initiative and. responsibility, were, she said, the latest and best on the Subjects covered—socialism, anarch Ism, free 'love, sabotage, positive criminology,, syndicalism. .Marxism, the Russlon sovlets, Bolshevik! and world's peace, Trotzylsm, etc. New List Is live One. 'An invoice of these "latest and best works," which is dated Novem ber 26, has been furnished members of the legislature. "This list shows," said a member of the" committee this morning, "that the library commis sion, whlh is under the direction of the state board of control, is order ing Only books that breed contempt tor the government and which teach distrust of the courts and of con- ALERT. WILSON'S MESSAGE TOUCHES ON GREAT PROBLEMS OF DAY Recommends Legislation to Combat High Cost of Liv ing, Labor Unrest and Rad icalism—Will Discuss the Peace Treaty Later. y the Associated Press) Washington, Dec. 2.—General rec ommendations on legislation to com bat the cost of living, labor unrest, radicalism and a readjustment of the. nation to peace time basis were the features of President Wilson's an nual message to congress delivered today. The peace treaty, the president told congress, will be discussed in aj separate message later, as will the railroad question. For the second time only since the president established the practice of addressing congress in person his message was read today by the clerk. The president's principal recom mendations were: Establishment of a budget system for the national finances. Reorganization of the taxation system with simplification of the in come and excess profits. Readjustment of the tariff system if necessary, to meet the changed world conditions and make the sys tem conform with the fact that the United States is the "greatest capi talist in the world." Recognition and relief for vet eran soldiers of the world war, par ticularly in the way of government farms as proposed by Secretary Lane. I Proper measures to foster the dye stuff industry built during the war to keep the United States independ ent of foreign supply. An enlarged proferam for rural de velopment in recognition of the farmers' part in the war. Measures which "will remove the causes" of "political restlessness in our body politic." At this point the president made his most extensive reference to the peace treaty by saying the causes for the unrest are "superficial rather than deep seated" and that they arise from or are connected with the failure on the part of our govern ment to arrive speedily at a just and permanent peace permitting return to normal conditions, from the trans fusion of radical theories, from seething European centers pending such delay, from heartless profiteer ing resulting from the increase of the cost of living and lastly from the machinations of passionate and Malevolent traitors. With the return to normal conditions this unrest will rapidly disappear." The president renewed his rec ommendations for legislation to deal effectively with "those persons who by violent methods would abrogate our time tested institutions." Several recommendations, some re newals of previous ones, were made by the president to bring down the cost of living. Among them were ex tension of the fod control law to peace times for the emergency regu lations for transportation of foods in interstate commerce a cold storage law modeled after the law in New Jersey a law requiring a mark to show the length of time foods are kept in storage, and a law to "se cure competitive selling and prevent unconscionable profits" by federal li cense of corporations selling food in interstate commerce. A long portion of the message was devoted to a discussion of the condi tions and rights of labor. "A defi nite program to bring about an im provement in the conditions of labor" and bring about a genuine democrati zation of industry was recommended. stituted authority." There are three volumes of Anar chism and Socialism seven copies of "Positive School of Criminology," ten copies of "Class Struggles of America," all ot which, it ls-Intimat ed, would in due time h|ve found their way into the hands-of the "school children of the state, together wifh Ellen K*y's latest argument in favor of fret, .dve and the abolition of the marriage relation and live other works by the same author on similar subjects. "As yet," said a minority member of the committee, "none of these books has, so far as we can learn. Holders Killed. -€si $
