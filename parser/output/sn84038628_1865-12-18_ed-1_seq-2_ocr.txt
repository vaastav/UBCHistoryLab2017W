DAILY AMxUS. Monday Evening: Vec. 18. HOPEFUL SIGNS. For years past the Argus has agitated the matter of speculations in county orders, bowed how town collector and county treasurers violated the law and thus depre ciated the credit of the county and increased the taxes of the people. No other paper n the county has ever raised its voice against this illegal praotioe or said one word to stop the abuse. At last we are gratified to see an indication that something is to be done. Sup'r Buffum, ot Andalusia, has, by the resolutions he introduced, on the subject, (and which were adopted by the board) made a move in the riKht direction. We ar thankful to see one man break loose from the trammels of party and the dictation of the court house clique, and strike out lor the peoples' interests. The resolutions are a little milder than we would have drawn them, bat still they show that something is to be done. If Bailey Davenport had been eleoted county treasurer he would have put his foot down hard upon all the brood ot snarns woo speculate out of the peoples taxes. Mr. Thomas could do it, if he would; but he wants to make money out of his office, just as Wait did, and we look for no better things from him.than from Wait. Davenport did not seek a nomination for the office, and, personally, did not desire it, the only reason he would have taken it at all would be to benefit the people, raise the oredit of the county, and break up the gang of specula tors. But, as he was not elected, our only hope, for the next two years, is in the people and the supervisors' they elect. Sup'r Buffum has boldly started the ball, and if the people will now follow it up by electing the right men, next epring.the whole system of county order speculations can be broken ;up. But, to do it sure, no man must be elected who oan, by any possibility, be controlled or in fluenced by the court house clique, for there are numberless abuses about the court house which need correcting, as well as this one. It would be well for the people in each town to hold public meetings and denounce the people who thus speculate out of their money and bring in extortional bills for al lowance. Let committees be appointed to look up and ascertain from such tax payers in their several towns, exactly what sum of money they paid the town collector, and what sum in county orders. Let tbis com mittee make op a report of these facrs from each town, and send it to the board of super' visors. Then let the supervisors request ech township collector to report to the board what sum of money he paid to the cour.iy treas urer, and what sum in county orders. Let this system, be carried out, thoroughly, aud in earnest, and the board can then ascertain who has violated the law, and have each one of them exposed and prosecuted, thus com pelling theui to suffer the penalty of the vio lated law, and prevent them from ever beinjr elected to any office again. We hail the movement of Sup'r Buffum as the dawning of a brighter day for the people. Let him follow it up with determination and show that he was io earnest ; that he meant business, and'be will earn the grati tude of the great mass of the people ot the county. Sup'r Buffdiu also procured the passage ot an order for a complete statement of county finances, an important niuvr, biinilar to that originated by Sup'r Kimball, sometime ago, and one that, if fully and intelligently complied with, will enable the people to know how they stand. Sup'r Buffutn evi dently means business. ANOTHER GOOD MOVE. Sup'r Crawford, of Hampton, also procur ed the passage of a resolution requiring col lectors to pay over to the treasurer and the treasurer to the chairman of the board, as fast as collected, money to liquidate county indebtedness. This is a good move, and will apply the money, at once, as fast as collec ted, to pay debts and stop interest, instead of allowing it to remain for months in the hands of these officers to use lor private speculation. Sup'r Crawford did a good thing, one the people will appreciate and thank him for. No man in the board looks out sharper for the peoples' interests than Sup'r Crawford. LAHGE 11 ILLS. By referenoe to the proceedings of the board of supervisors it will be seen that the following items were allowed for the court house people, via : Joseph Conet, clerk $2,032.31 M. D. Merrill, sheriff 1,233.09 Stationery, &c. 37C.15 Union office, blanks, &c. 103.40 Issuing road orders 85,00 Total $3,730.55 And this was for only three months Look at the clerk's bill $2,032.31 for 3 months, or $8,129.24 a year directly from the peoples' taxes. And this does not in clude his fees, for probate business, and all .the matters connected with the office for which fees are allowed probably as much more. The sheriff's bills, by the same calculation, would be $4,934.76, directly paid out of the peoples' taxes, and fees probably as much more. What are the items to mike up these heavy bills f They may be all necessary, reasona ble and unavoidable but we propose, bv wj.n, oau IOr copies ot each item of these bill a an n il r .. . . r- " luopecuon ana icism or the people from t ii navav XOV.ClS moy comes to pay them. oounty clerk $2 a day for attendance upon the probata court. This is in aocordance with previous custom, but we think no such allowance ever ought to have been oaade, or any such practice continued. The county elerk gets large fees for doing the probate business, every item of labor he performs be ing provided lor in the fee bill, and mast be paid from the estates settled except the bare keeping of what is called the "general rec ord" a book in which is recorded the open ing and closing of court, Ac, Ac, a very small affair to keep and requiring very little time. For every other book, such as the rec ord of wills, accounts current, bonds, &c, Jfcc, fees are provided, and when the fee bill was made the legislature, no doubt, thought that county clerks could well afford to keep a memorandum of the opening and closing of court without charge, considering the high fees allowed for everything else. The idea was to make the probate court self-sustain ing, except the judge, and he was wisely re- refused fees, thus removing from him any prejudice towards parties by the temptation of fees. But, in 1855, the county clerks, al though the best offices in the counties, were greedy for more fees, and they persuaded the legislature to pass a law giving the supervis ors permission to allow any sum they pleased. not to exceed $3 a day, for keeping the gen eral record. The result was that Mr. Conet, for a long time, got exactly the same yearly pay for keeping that book, (besides all his prabate fees, which were large,) that the county judge got for his entire services. Our board of supervisors, after seeing how the thing worked, persuaded Conet to come down to 2 a day, and since that time the county clerk has regularly received from the peoples pockets S2 tor every day the probate court has been in session simply for keepiog this memorandum ot the opening and closing of oourt, to , Lo. This is wrong and ought not to be permitted any longer. During the late canvass for county officers we wrote to somj 50 or more county clerks in this state, for information as to the practice in their counties, on this subject, and we have official answers showing that, in some counties they do not allow the clerk anything for keeping this record ; in others they allow $1 a day ; and in others $2 a day, and in a few $2 a day. The matter rests wholly with the supervis ors whether they will allow anything or not. They can allow nothing, or any sum from one cent to three dollars, in their discretion. We thought, w;th the legislature which made the lee bill, that, in consideration of the enormous fees of the county clerk, he ought not to be allowed anything for keeping this record book, and the people will remember that Burton II. Cook, during the lata can- i Vii?!, publicly proposed, through the columns ot this paper, that if be was elected he would never make any charge for keeping this rec ord book. We do not wish the board to do injustice to any one, but we really think that no pay should be allowed, in future, for keeping this record book, for the reason that none was originally intended. There is no law requir ing any, or at least nothing above the nomin al pay cf one cent ; and the office being the fattest one in the county the people ought not to be taxed fur this service. The order allowing $2 a day oughs to be rescinded as soon as the board meets again. The board very properly rejected a bill for unauthorized repairs on the court house A resolution was, sometime ago, paed by the b.ard, givine notice tbat, in future, no bills would be allowed for such thing", unless the work was previously ordered by the board. Let the supervisors not buck down from the stuud they took on tbis subject. PROCEEDINGS Or" THE BOARD OF rStPERVlSOUS. FOtRTH DAT.

Bloom ikgtok, III., Dec. 14. COSGRKmSIONAL 

GRANT TOR AN INDUSTRIAL I'NI VERS1TT. - In accordance with a call issued by the board of the state-agricultural society, at the time of the late state fair at Chicago, a con vention assembled at tbis place to day to take action in reference to tbe grant ot land made by congress to the state of Illinois, tor tbe es'aolishment ol an industrial university. ThH grant donates "to the several states and territories, which may provide colleges for the benefit of agriculture and the mechanic arts," pubiio lands in the proportion of 'MO, 000 acre for e oh senator and representative iu oouerass. 1 oe amount of land to vibich the state is eutitled under this act is 450,0J'J acres. Bv further terms -f the act. the sev eral states were left to their cwo discretiun in the matter cf location for the university but no portion of the money derived from the sale of aid land was to be appropriated to the erection of buildings, thtt bring left for tbe states individually to do, tbe whole of tbe fund guing to tbe endowment if the intitu tion and the professorships. It was further made incumbent upon the states to accept and act in a postive manner upen the gran previously to the 1st of June. 18G7, or the right to accept would be forfeited. LOCATION CF THE UNIVERSITY. Several attempts haye been made to decide upon a location for tbe proposed university but so far without succead. The Blooming ton convention was called to take action the matter, and was timed to occur at or sear the period of the meeting of the horticultu ral society, when prominent ruin identified with the agricultural interests of the state are expected to be pre-eut. After oraLizati.n,appv.iiitmc:.t of commit tees, &o., the following resolutions were adopted : aESOLUTIOXS. Whereas, The true principles of education.like the true principles of civilized government every where, reoutre the greatest practicable uaion, co operation, and concentration in all its higher de partments, c mliined with the utmost practical diffusion in its lower eVpartment ; therefore, Hftalved, That the state f Illinois, should at present attempt tobuiid only one univerity of the h:ghest order, and that the energies and resources ot our people should be directed to that one end, and the undivided fundsot our congressional grant be appropriated thereto. HtsohtJ. That we approve of the principles of location adopted by former stale conventions and presented to the slate legislature at Us last ses sion by the committees ot the state agricultural Suritt. htilred. That we approve of the general prin ciple adopted and approved by all parties at the last seteion of the legislature, that in preparing the character for the university, ail mere details of organization and government should be left to the future iiecesiues the of institution, tne dis cretion ot the people, and the existing board of trustees; and that the charier should limit their freedom only to those pointe indispensible to a fundamental law. KtiolieJ, That a committee be appointed to urge these views upon the next legislature or, if ntec'lul. call another representative convention in tbe summer or fall of lsoo. Ktsolved, That we urge upon the people tbe ne cvssity of keeping the principles embodied in these resolutions before aspirants to -liice, and that they emphatically repudiate any man as a candi date ho is unfavorable to tbtse views. AN 

ADDITIONAL RESOLUTION. The following resolution, which was in tended to modify the fifth resolution of the serioa was offered and adopted : Hftolrtd, That the committee who bave pre sented tbe report now before this meeting, shall constitute the committee contemplated in the res olutions, aid that we instruct them to secure the revision of the bill presented to the legislature of this state at its Isst session by a committee sp po ntpd by the stale agricultural society, and cause 1,000 cop'ies of the bill to be printed ; also that they be instructed to secure the appointment ot sub-committees in each of the representative and senatorial districts of this stale, w hose duty it w ill be to present a copy ot said bill to each and every person w hose name shall be before tbe people as a candidate for nomination to the office of represen tation in the senate or legislature of this state, and shall receive the public pledges of such candidates for nomination, that they will use all laudabis en deavors, if nominated and elected, to secure the passsge ol said bill ; and that, in case any candi date shall refuse or neglect to give such pledges, such sub-coaitnittees shall publish the fact or audi refusal throughout the district in which such can didate resides, through the newspapers published tberin.
