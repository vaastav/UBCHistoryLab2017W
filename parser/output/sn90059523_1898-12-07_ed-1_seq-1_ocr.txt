WASHINGTON, Dec. 6. — Advices from Paris to the effect that it might be reasonably presumed that the peace commissioners will be ready to sign a treaty of peace within a day or two are fully confirmed here. It is learned that the president's instructions to Judge Day were to hasten the con clusion, and to that end the American commissioners have been authorized to limit the treaty closely to protocol points, leaving other matters, such as the acquisition of cable stations and naval stations, to be dealt with here after. As such separation of the points is entirely in line with the expressed desire of the Spanish commissioners, there appears to be no reason, now that an agreement has been reached as to all of the protocol points, why those should not immediately be reduced to the form In which it is desired they should appear In a treaty and be at once signed by the commissioners. In this case it Is possible that the treaty of peace may be submitted to congress even before the Christmas recess. It is believed that it will make toward a speedy treatment of the points of the protocol. As to the other points which our com missioners were instructed to negotiate upon, they may or may not be disposed of at Paris by the present commission ers, but the Indications are now that they will be left to adjustment in the future by the ordinary methods of di plomacy, the Spanish government be ing under no compulsion whatever, save such as may be exercised by the Spanish people who may suffer from the lack of proper treaty safeguards to regulate commerce between Spain and the United States. Perhaps con sideration for this threatened evil will lead the Spanish commissioners to con sent to an inclusion in the peace treaty of a clause providing for a renewal of the old treaties of commerce and comity, and extradition, at least tem porarily, until other treaties can be agreed upon to take their place. If this should not be the case, however, there will not be an entire stoppage of trad.p between the two countries, but American merchants will suffer from the imposition of the maximum tariff in Spanish ports, and many other petty charg-es which will amount to consider able discrimination against them, while the United States statutes already con tain clauses that might operate against the Spanish merchants In the same manner, if not In the same degree. 

QUEENLY WOMEN MEET. Wife of Senator Davis, of Minne sota. Visits Ex-Empress Evffenie. PATHS, Dec. 6.—^Mrs. Cushman K. Davis, wife of the United States peace commissioner and senator, had an in teresting interview today with ex-Em press Eugenic, who is living incognito at the hotel where the United States peace commissioners are residing,while on one of her periodical visits to Paris. The senator's wife left her card as a formality. The ex-empress promptly sent an attendant to request Mrs. Da vis to call In person. The latter com plied and was received, she said after ward, by a stately, white-haired, sad faced woman, having little of the ap pearance of the invalid which the pub- He supposes her to be. The ex-emprest» 6ecmed to be pleased at being address ed as "your majesty," and said she had the deepest regard for the Ameri cans, "because for my escape from Paris at a perilous tlrne I was chiefly Indebted to an American," the refer ence being, of course, to the late Dr. Evans. Although Mrs. Davis Btudiously avoided mentioning the American-His pano war, remembering that the ex empress is a Spaniard, the latter broached the topic, saying: "After the destruction of the Maine war was inevitable, although I do not believe any Spaniard was responsible for that calamity. I am sure any na tion would have done, under the cir cumstances, as the United States did." Mrs. Davis, on retiring, kissed her hand. The ex-empress seemed deeply touched and exclaimed: "I am most grateful." MAY BE TABLED. Report in tlie Senator Hui-Ue Dis barment Frweedingß. CLEVELAND, 0., Dec. 6.—lt seems now very probable that the report of the trial committee of the Cleveland Bar association, in the proceedings against State Senator Burke, will be tabled indefinitely at the meeting of the association next Saturday. It Is said that both the friends of Senator Burke and Judge Dellenbaugh are In favor of disposing of the verdict in that manner. It is claimed by many lead- Ing attorneys that the report is obvi ously unfair so far as it relates to Del lenbaugh, inasmuch as the judge was not on trial and was not given an op portunity to defend himself at the hear ing. AT $10_PER FISH. Delightful Time in Prospect for Andrew Johnson, Fisherman. RE© "WING, Minn., Dec. 6.—(Special.) —Andrew Johnson, a fisherman, at tempted to send two barrels of fish to the Maryland Packing company, Dcs Moines. A deputy game warden seized them at the express office. The state law imposes a fine of $10 on each fish; and as nearly 1,000 fish were confiscated the shipment may prove expensive. HEROES OFJTHE MAINE. Joint Resolution Authorizing a Monument to Their Memory, WASHINGTON, Deo. 6. — Senator Hale today introduced a Joint resolu tion authorizing the secretary of the navy to erect a monument In Havana, Cuba, to the memory of the Bailors and marines who lost their lives by the ex plcsion of the Maine. The bill Is rec ommended by the navy department. WEDNESDAY MORNING-—DECEMBER 7, 1898. NATION OF WARRIORS SENATOR VIQST SOUNDS THE FIRST WARNING AGAINST THE EX PANSION IDEA HE OBJECTS TO MILITARISM Says It Would Be Better for Amer icans to First Turn Their Atten tion to Acquisition of Ships of Colmmerce, Rather Than Ma chines of War—Dislikes Ceas ing: to Be a Nation o>f Traders. WASHINGTON, Dec 6.—The first note of the aniti-ex.par.&ionists was founded in the senate today, by Sena tor Vest, of Missouri, who introduced the following- Joint resolution: "That under the constitution of the United States no power is given to the federal gov ernment to acauire territory to be held and governed permanently as colonies. "The colonial system of European nations cannot be established under our present con stitution; but all territory acquired by the government, except such small amount as may be necessary for coaling stations, correc tion of boundaries and srtiuilar governmental purposes, must be acquired and governed with the purpose of ultimately organizing such territories into states suitable for ad mission into the Union." A brief discussion of the navigation laws was precipitated by the considera tion of a bill amending those laws by the addition of a provision that foreign built vessels, wrecked in the United States, purchased by citizens of this country and repaired to the extent of three-fourths of their value shall be subject t3 forfeiture If they engage sub sequently in the coastwise trade of the United States. Mr. Vast, a member of the connmlttee on commerce, expressed Ma opposition to the bill, principally because lit af forded protection to the coastwise trad 9 which needed no protection. Cur gen ea-al carryingl trade, Mr. Vest believed, needed protection. Under the present system of navigation laws, this trade had decreased from 75 per cent to 11 per cent, and this country is now pay- Ing $150,000,000 annually to foreign ship owners for carryingl trade that ought to be carried in American bottoms. This condition of affairs, Mr. Vest de clared, was "a scandal and disgrace." lie said he had been amused at the suggestion of the president, made in his message, submlttted yesterday, that our carrying trade be encouraged by the payment of subsidies. "In othor wca-dis," said he, "it is pro posed to substitute for the present vic ious system of navigation Laws a scheme of subsidies that Is even more vicious than is the evil it proposes to remedy. Under the proposed policy of the administration," continued Mr. Vest, "we are to build a great navy. We are to cease to be a nation of trad ers, and, under the impulse of the policy of expansion, become a nation of warriors. It would seem to me better first to build up our carrying trade. I would also let our people, through the beneficent effects of such trade, buy r.here they can buy cheapest." Mr. Caffery, of Douisiana, wlho is a member of the committee on, commerce, opposed the bill. Finally it was made a special order for next Monday. At 1:80 p. m. the senate adjourned.

Gillett, the cattle plunger, is In that city. He has Jiot been arrested, oocording to the dispatch, and is not likely to be. Detectives arrived in Chluhuahua yesterday in quest of Gillett.

Many Spanish families are leaving the inte rior towns, fearing that the insurgent forces will take possession of them be fore the arrival of the American troops. A committee representing the native irregular troops, who fought under the Spanish flag against the insurgent troops, has called at the headquarters of the United States commission, say- Ing that these men are ready to return to their homes, but are afraid to do so on account of threats contained In some of the Cuban newspapers.
