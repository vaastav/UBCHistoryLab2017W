Joseph Chamberlain, secre tary for the colonies of Great Britain, delivered a speech on Thursday night which will, no doubt, tickle the ears of a good many people of the United States who enjoy flattery and nlca word?, but who do not always take the trouble to penetrate their meaning. Mr. Chamberlain has been doing a great deal of this sort of talking since the war Between the United States and Spain began. .And, inasmuch as Lord Salisbury has remained silent, it may be just possible that Mr. Chamberlain knows that he is speaking by the book and is, in consequence, as profuse in his compliments as not a great many years ago he was with his sneers, as directed toward th's country. Mr. Chamberlain took for his text, m his recent address, the general subject of British interests in Eastern China, and discussed, with much freedom, the relations «f the several nations just now Interesting themselves in the se lection of points in the Chinese em piie with a view to the improvement of commerce and the opening of trade in the Orient The activity of Russia has perhaps been the most vexing in cident of this scheme of partition of China through the acquisition of rlghja within certain limits of territory. [dent McKinley, in his message, call< (1 attention to the work that was going on Ln China, with reference to the Improvement of the commerce of European countries, and made the rec ommendation that a^ommission be ap pointed to inquire into all the bearings Upon the situation and report upon the best methods to be pursued by the United States for the promotion of its rapidly growing business with thw Orient. Mr. Chamberlain's remarks were pa cificatory, both with reference to Rus sia and Germany, but he took occasion to speak almost rhapsodically over the relations existing between England and the United States, as an indication of which he pointed to the president's pleasing allusion, in his recent mes sage, '.o the growth of the friendly sen timent between England and the Unit ed States. Ever since Mr. Chamberlain's utter ance last summer at Birmingham, hinting at an alliance between this country and England, the press of I. mdon has been almost uniform in its praises ;nd approval of the United States ::mil the Imperial colonial policy upon which the country seems to be entering. Mr. Chamberlain is an adept in diplomacy and is probably as insincere as any man who ever sat on a min isterial bench in parliament. By em phasizing and reiterating whenever oc casion offers the idea of an Anglo- American alliance, it is plain to be seen that Mr. Chamberlain has acquired a considerable knowledge of Uncle Barn's native game of bluff. He pats the czar and the German emperor upo« the back and gives utterance to many honeyed words; but just about that mo ment he winks that other eye, hall concealed behind a monocle, and smiles, while he gently elevates his little American eagle fledgling of Anglo- Saxon alliance. Mr. Chamberlain undoubtedly means to convey the impression to the Euro pean powers, in the carving up of China, that they ought all to get along togethi r Binoothly in the business, but, Ir tlic event of any misunderstanding between them, Great Britain will not be long in need of a friend whose in terests in the Pacific are just now ex panding. Mr. Chamberlain is playing a very neat little game, but he ought not to flatter himself that it fails altogether of comprehension by those who are possessed of the X-ray qualification of seeing through a diplomatic stone wall. Treaty Ready for Signature. The commission representing the United States and Spain to arrange terms for a treaty of peace between the two countries has concluded its work in Paris, and the document only awaits proper engrossment and signa ture to mike ihe conJition-a ready for ratification. The sessions of the commission have extended over a period of more than two months. The actual negotiation began Monday, Oct. 3. The progress has hi on slow, and, at times, some what tedijus, but the conclusions ar rived at are practically those which were anticipated when the protocol ■was arranged at Washington. There or--, of course, many details which are not known by the public, but thest? ai" of immaterial import and over shadowed by the larger propositions involved. It is understood that the trea-ty now ready for signatuie omits many points •uliich will, at a later day, become sub jects for future negotiations; but their consideration cannot be entered upon until the principal document is rati fied —of which result there is consider able doubt. The representatives at the United Sjetes government were Cushman K. Davis, United Slates senator fiom Min nesota, chairman; Senator William V. Frye, of Maine; Senator George Gray, of Delaware; William R. Day, late sec retary of state, and YVhitelaw Reid, of New York. The "Oang;" in Control. The municipal court of St. Paul un doubtedly needs to be cleansed and fumigated. Judge Hinc shows a laudable desire to have the work done. Judge Orr may perhaps share the.de slre, although we have seen nothing to indicate it, nothing, in fact, that might he accepted as a 'clincher." The Globe has pointed out certain irregu larities on the part of the court's em ployes which demand attention' Bail money has been sequestrated and mis appropriated. One of the men whom Mayor Kiefer indorsed for a subordi nate position has been caught In the act j of extorting money from a poor fellow who was so unfortunate as to haye dealings with the municipal court, and compelled to refund. Why wasn't h« disir.is.sed from the public service as being an unworthy servant? Because he is a Republican and helpful to the mayor's political organization? And now comes a further exposure ' of the irregularity of methods pursu< d by the court attendants. Judge Hine i 3 the complainant in this case. Tlie judge has the sympathy and will re ceive the support of The Globe in his crusade But will he accomplish anything? Isn't the political ring which dominates the city h,UI too strong to be injured by any Republican, however virtuously inclined he may be? Mayor Kief or has a duty to per form. Why doesn't he discharge it? The "gang" is in control. There can be no doubt about that. Grain Inspector's Report. Chief Grain Inspector Clausen has his annual report to the rail road and warehouse commission. He pays, among other things, that the receipts of winter wheat at the terminal points in Minnesota during the past year were the largest in the history of the department and were the most nearly approached, heretofore, in IS9O-91. He also staies that wheat is received at Minneapolis and Duluth from eight different states, namely, lowa, Nebras ka, Kansas, Washington, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Min nesota. The principal recommendation made by Mr. Clausen is with reference to a change in the present, methods of ap peal. In his judgment all terminal in spection should be decided promptly and at the point where the controversy originates. To do this would necessi tate the appointment of an appeal com mittee at the terminal points of Minne apolis and Duluth. A dispatch from Jersey says hazing is dead ait Princeton. What? Again? Chicago has a cat show. Chicago sausage factories must be running on half time. Mrs. McKinley is shopping in New York. This will give the merchants of Washington great joy. Haverhill, Mass., has elected as mayor a Socialist grocery clerk. Bos ton will cut Haverhill dead. Michigan and Texas are neck and neck and running easy. Both have had a blizzard during the week. The powder mills of Delaware are now holding peace jubilees. Five of them exploded in a bunch yesterday. Frank Gould was presented with $10, --000,000 on his birthday. Be careful with your money, Frank. Nobody will ever repeat that act. Financially speaking, the election in Wisconsin went wrong. It cost So'ofleld $6U7.25 to be elected and Sawyer $1,947. --80 to be defeated. During the next two years the presi dent can keep one eye on Theolore Roosevelt and rivet the other to Caen-man K. Davis. The next 29th of February that comes around will have to be introduced to itself. The time lapse is from Feb. 29, 1596, to Feb. 29, 1904. The Massachusetts December elec tions show a still further heavy Demo cratic drift. Massachusetts had read the president's message, too. An editor down in Illinois suggests William J. Bryan and John M. Palmer I for the next Democratic ticket. That fellow is looking for a "scrap" pure and simple. The New York Journal claims the [resident's message is only an indorse ment of its position. Come to think of It, that's quite easy. Will the Journal name a Paw subjects It doesn't talk on all sides of in the course of a year? Senator Tillman is nothing if not emphatic. Speaking of the Spanish treaty, he said: "I am not going to vote away $20,000,000 of the people's j money for a lot of niggers, a lot of islands we don't want and a pile of scrap iron." Epistles to St. Paul. Dawn in tho vicir.ty of Tenth and Wacouta streets there lives a small boy who inherits some of the argumentative powers of his father, an attorney, and also a portion of the father's fondness for tobacco. It so happens th»t the presiding parent in the family Is blessed with an aversion for the wesd, and has a particularly decided manner of express ing her disapproval. For some time the youth has been in the bafcit cf indulging in furtive smokes around in the barn and in the alley back of the house, and, having been undetected except as to the odor, he has become emboldened In his eviidoing. One day last week the youngster provided himself with a corncob pipe and a dime novel and proceeded to regale himself with both on the rear steps of his home. He was awakened from a dream of life on the Span ish main by noticing a very uncomfortable feeling stealing over him, and. glancing up, wns horror-struck to see the presiding parent in nuestion gazing, speechless with anger, at him from above en the stoop. It was clearly a critical moment, and the boy's trousers tingl?d in anticipation, but be rallied his nerve and thus addressed his parent: "Say. ma, I know I'm a worthless, disrepu table scapegrace thai won't never amount to nothing ard a disgrace to the family, and this dreadful tobacco will stop my growth and I'll grew up a degenerate g>od-for-noth ing. like pa, and that 111 be ruined and bring your back hair in sorrow to the grave ;'.nc".—" Here the boy paused for breath and glanced up. to fir.d that his mother had disappeared. She had nothing to say. The occurrence has not sines b?en referred to in the household, but the youth no longer ,_.V;kcs in the vicinity of hU home. His escape waa too narrow- THE ST. 

PAUL GLOBE The President's Message. IVo Redaction In War Taxed. McKinlcy's message says nothing of reduc ing the heavy war taxes which fail &o heavily upon the peop!e and interfere with the ordi nary round of business. He gives no hope of any immediate modification of the law or re- Ik r from the vexatious impositions which are necessary to collect revenue in this extra ordinary way.—Brooklyn Times. A Dull MeNNKK'**. A longer or a duller message has not been sent by the president to the congress since wa first had presidents and congresses. The dullness is not in the topics discussed; it is in the discussion. At no time since the ending of the Civil war has there been more stirring event or more commonplace imminent. — I'hilaaelphia Record. DiMappoln tints'. It is disappointing that the president makes no reociumcndatien lo^kiug to repeal of the war taxes. The continuation of these taxes in their present form can not be defended. The government ought not to be so admin istered in time of peace as to necessitate the : continuance of such burdens upon the people. i —Buiialo Evening Times. Expenditures and Deficiencies. A noticeable thing about the message is the cheerful style in which the president recommends the flinging of millions right and left and accepts an enormous perma u< i:t increase in expenditures as a matter of course and as an incident of glory to which no one can possibly object. in :he president's reference to the report of the secretary of the treasury we read: '"It i is estimated upon the basis of the present i revenue laws that the receipts of the gov ernment for the year ending June 30, 1899. will be $577,874,C07 and its expenditures $689, -574,€47, resulting in a deficiency of $112, --000,000. This is tossed off without comment as a matter hardly deserving of passing no tice.—Chicago Chronicle. Keinnrknlile for OmlssionN. The message which President McKinloy sent to congress yesterday is most remarkable in what it omits to say. The absorbing ques tions to be settled by our nation at present are those arising out of the evidences that the president intends to depart from th* traditional policy of the nation, end the as sertions of some who claim to reprsssnt him, that the principles on which this ration is founded will also be abjured. The whole na tion has been expecting that the message would state the considerations which have led the president to abandon the old principle of non-interference outside of the American continents, and give some statement of how far along the path of imperialism he propose! to go.—Pittsburg Dispatch. McKinley a Follower, Not a Leader. Mr. McKinley is a follower rather than a leader. He was led into the sound-money ranks. He was led into expansion. If con gress will pass a bill to reform the currency he will sign it. But will he do anything to secure its passage by congress? Only upon one issue has he ever assumed the attitude of a positive leader. He had hardly taken his seat before he called con gress in extra session to pass a new tariff bill. Acd he did this notwithstanding the fact that the tariff was by no means the first issue in his campaign; that It was al together subsidiary to the financial issue, on Which he was elect 3d. When the president puts forth one-half the effort to secure financial legislation that he put forth to secure tariff legislation we may feel con fident that his desire for currency reform is at least as strong as the desire of his comp troller of the currency to prevent currency reform.—Louisville Courier-Journal. The Stop Watch. It must have cost the president severe toil to make it appear that he approved of the war in the beginning when everybody knows that he was utterly opposed to a war with Spain until forty or fifty Republican members of congress "held a stop-watch o.ver him," as Congressman Boutelle said, and gave him forty-eight hours in which to surrender to them. After he had surrendered to them ho held the same stop-watch over Spain, and although he had led her government to expect that a fair trial would be givon to the plan of Cuban autonomy which had beon adopted at our instance, he changed his tone suddenly and ordered her to haul down her flag within forty-eight hours. This was done in pursu ance of a resolution of congress which, ha says, "was approved by tho executive."— New York Evening Post.

STATE HAS GAINED HALF A MILLION STATEMEN OF INTEREST ON STATE FINDS PREPARED BY TREASURER. Mr. Koierner Will Suggest to the Legislature That the State In vestment Board Be Permitted, to Put li.'t Surplus In City Bonds. State Treasurer Koerner yesterday completed a statement of the money received by the state from interest on the various funds since 1873. Previous to that time the investment of the state funds was left to the discretion of the treasurer, who either kept the funds In the state's strong box or invested them in saw mills, grocery stores or most anything that in those days seem ed a promising investment. The legis lature of the same year authorized that ofileial to put the surplus cash out at interest in sta.te and national banks throughout the state, which has n?tted the state a very substantial revenue during- the last twenty-five years. Mr. Koerner's statement gives the total amount received by the slate from in terest as $444,083.55. The largest amount received durinar any one j'ear was dur ing 1594, $56,919.72, and the smallest in 1879, $170. During this year it was all the state could do tJ meet all the appropriations made by the legislature, and but an insignificant sum was placed out at in terest. The sumniary of the amounts is a-3 follows: 1873 $7,024 3911887 $9,426 46 1874 7,245 441888 13,209 01 1875 5,736 821889 18.947 59 lS<7t> 5,087 62J1500 16 354 07 1877 4,974 391891 2G,t97 31 IS7B 1,953 84 1892 32,505 66 1879 170 701893 56,708 31 1880 7.531821894 56 919 72 1881 10,872 'A'lftio 44 242 04 1882 8,437 23J1896 37301 ti3 1883 3.218 16 1897 31.465 98 1 ISS4 2.919 91 IS9S 21,805 34 ISBS 6,475 42 i 1886 6,191951 Total $444,C53 55 In many of the states state funds are kept in the state treasurer's vault, and earn nothing from year to year. This is particularly true of some of the newer and more Western states. At present Minnesota has a surplus in the permanent BChool fund of a quar ter of a million dollais for which no in vestment could be found by Mr. Koer ner and Auditor Dunn, while in the bond market in New York a few weeks ago. In view of this fact Mr. Koerner has recommended in his report, which haa just been completed, that a law be passed by the legislature authorizing the state board to loan money to cities of a certain class, at the usual 3 per cent Interest. Mr. Koerner regards the bonds o£ Mtnnfsotll cities as siit-edged, and thinks it will be particularly de sirable and advantageous for the state to place its surplus funds at home, where it is safe and advisable. __^ i H.

TRAOEJNJTLOOK GOOD DEMAND UNDIMINISHED FOR AMERICAN PRODUCTS OF ALL SORTS EXPORT DEMAND IS HEAVY Wheat, Though Lower, 1m Being; Held for Better Prices Tone of Woolen Good* Market Is Much Improved Over the Previous Week Rupture of the Rail Com bination. NEW YORK, Dec. 9.— R. G. Dun & Co.'s weekly review of trade will say tomorrow: The most significant thing this week has been the entire absence of the customary nervous fright before and after the meeting of congress, the pres ident's message and the treasurer's re port. No one showed the least alarm, and nobody could find a reason fur any. Money and stock and grain markets moved on exactly as if the government were automatic, certain to do or say no more than the people had already decided and expected, and so the grad ual betterment since October continues. There is a large demand in nearly all industries; larger export demand for foreign needs; a more healthy domestic demand since seasonable weather ar rived, and a comforting conviction that November business, the biggest ever done in this country in any month, was but a step towards something better. Exports last year in December were marvelous, but this year are starting far ahead. Cotton is sharing in the export movement fully, and has risen three-sixteenths in price, with a feel ing that estimates of yield may have been excessive. At the extremely low price yet-quoted, foreign buyers do not stop to calculate commercial and mill stocks on hand. The consumption in this country is not very large, beins? but little changed by troubles about wages at the South, though by more voluntary curtailment in New Englano, but the demand for goods is bettei and has lifted the price of print cloths an eighth, and some of the other goods a shade. Woolen goods have been in much better demand, and many of the small er mills have been buying after con cessions secured by the larger. Much broader market is more healthy and promises far more for the industry, and sales of 10,655,200 pounds in two weeks past at the three chief markets, against 10,852,700 pounds in the same weeks of 1892, are quite in line with demand in prosperous years. Prices yielded about half a cent in November, according to one hundred quotations by Coates Bros., and from Philadelphia dispatches appear to be about a cent lower this week. The rupture of the incohate rail com bination, it appears, resulted in lower prices and larger sales in the first week of sharp competition than were real ized a week ago. Prices were made in some transactions much lower than were then or are now quoted, and while $17 at Pittsburg is now named, special orders are said to cause lower figures. The purchase of 50,000 tone Bessemer pig at $10 at Valley furnaces and 100,000 billets for Pittsburg works at $15.50, of which 40,000 tons went to a hoop mill, with 11,000 tons sold at Chicago at $22 and 22,000 tons plates for one concern at Pittsburg, besides enormous orders for bars and plates in car and ship building, a steamship con tract on the Delaware and a contract for 5,000 tons for bridges at Chicago, give some idea of heavy business com ing forward, just when the works us ually expect a season of idleness ana waiting. Pig iron has risen at the East to $11.50 and quotations average for pig throughout the country a shade higher than at any time this year, though prices for finished products have recently been declining, and are lower than in the early months of the year. This week's failures have been 248 In the United States against 312 last week, and 22 in Canada, against 29 last year. FINANCIAL OUTLOOK. Bradstreet's Report Shows Condi tions Are Generally Favorable. NEW YORK, Dec. 9.—Bradstreet's financial review tomorrow will say: "Transactions in both stocks and bonds this week have been active, and the market shows a broadening tendency. The specula tive undertone has been very strong and any slight depressions seem to develop renewed buying power. London shows increasing fa vor for American stocks, and its purchasing has been sufficiently steady to give material aid to the bull side. The ease of the money market here facilitates buying by the public, although the fact that stocks are being car ried to an unusual extent on call loans does not escape attention. It might be added that the activity and advances in so ma-ny low priced and hitherto inactive stocks increases the proportion of soich securities carried on margin or in loans, but as yet no danger is apparently apprehnnded from that score. The market at large is impressed only with the favorable trade situation, the encouraging business outlook, the abundance of capital seeking investment and the excellent earnings which railroads are generally reporting. Ac tual and possible dividend payments by rail road and industrial companies also play a part in sustaining the decided bullish feel ing of the market, and the more prominent operators are generally active on that side of the market, or if they take profits in one part of the trade do bo for the advance ment of other stocks. "Tho meeting of congress seemed to pro duce little effect, the prevailing idea being that its time would be tak n up with war and ©olonial questions, miminizing the possi bility of measures being considered which might have an unfavorable effect on business and financial sentiment. The president's mes sage was favorably received, and the expected speedy signing of the treaty of peace with Spain was a factor in causing the very strong tone at the end of the week." 

RETAIL TRADE ACTIVE. Satisfactory Feature of the Busi ness Outlook of the Country. NEW YORK, De«. 9.—Bradstreet's tomor row will say: Business conditions continue of a most | encouraging character. A very satisfactory j feature, and oue full of encouragement to all wholesale lines of trade, i.s the activity shown in retail trade, in nearly all markets. I Reports received as to the holiday trade | proper, too, point to the present year con- | stituting a record-maker in thi3 respect. The j importance of the t-arly arrival of real win- j tcr weather to the retail distribution of heavy clothing and similar seasonable goods can hardly be overestimated. In the wider domain of general trade and industry per haps the mest notable feature has been the continued activity and advancing prices shown for classes of iron and stsel, but rir ticularly pig iron and steel billets. So pro nounced has this demand become since the placing of the first large orders that what is ordinarily regarded as a duli period in this industry has given place to exceptional ac tivity and the stimulating effect already im parted to values seems likely to be adde<! to, rather than diminished, so far as the ou'uook for the coming year can at present be foreshadowed. Features of the week have bfen immense sales of Besscnrser pig Iron; larga saUs at < steel billets and heavy orders for ship plates, the Waiter at Western points. Car builders too, have pia-ced extraordinary large orders, impelled thereto by the enlarged demand from railroads, which find their present fa cilitities for handling goods overtaxed. Export trade continues encouraging and of a favorable nature in ihis respect is the weakening in freights reported towards the close of the week. Increased supplies con s-quent on the heaviest movement frrm farm ers' hands ever known, have constituted a bearish feature in wheat prices this week, notwithstanding continued heavy shipments abronci. and the coarser grains have sym pathized with this important cereal. Activity in "he lumber trade has been a feature caK- Ing for comment in many markets, the plac ir,g of large £overnment orders for yellow pin? lumber, ment of which is for export to Cuba, having insured plenty of work for a number of Southern mills until far in the rew year. From other branches of trade re rcrt? are of sustained deir.acd of proportions sufficient to take care of seasonably smail receipts, and prices retain firmness. Cotton is again higher, partly owing to smaller esti mates becoming fashionable, this feeling be ing reflected in improved demand at many markets. Wheat, including flour, shipments for the ?f«\-o g? ref ate ?- 758-9-^ bushels. against r,483,909 last week; 6,2(50,159 bushels in the corresponding week of 1897, 4,222 714 hu he is in 1896, 2.418 323 bushels in' 1895 and 2 536 280 bushels in 1894. Since July 1. this year, tha exports of wheat aggregate 102.967,094 bushels against 114,204,698 bushels last year. Corn exports for the week aggregate 4,888 535 bushels, against 4,623,988 last work, 3 123 554 bushels in this week a year ago, 3 ivh 288 1896 ' 2-391-184 bushels in 1895 and 292,277 bushels in 1894. Since July 1 this year, corn exports aggregate 69,026.828 bushels against 67,251,656 during the same period a year ago. Steadiness of prices has been a notable feature of business this fall, though th» natural drift of values has been to a lower level. Of 107 staples, 49, or a little lea 3 than one-half, are unchanged as a result of the month's work, while 32 staples advanc ed and only 26 declined, while, as compared with Dec. 1 a year ago, 54 staples, or slight ly more than one-half, are higher, 42 are lower and 11 are unchanged. Business failures in the United States t'als week number 237, as against 212 last year. 292 in this week a year ago, 381 In 1896", 313 In 1895, and 385 ln 1594. Business failures in the Dominion of Canada for the week number 29, as compared with 25 last week, 23 in this week a year ago, 42 in 1896, 39 in 1895 and 34 in 1894. 

DEARTH KNEW IT BEFORE HIS CRITICS INSURANCE COMMISSIONER CON DEMSED THE HAIL INSURANCE LAW NEAKLY A YEAR AGO. His Report Shows That Back In March He Called Attention to the Things Which Sume Papers Are Now Commenting On. A few of the state papers are crit icising the administration of Insurance Commissioner Dearth for the way in which he has dealt with certain mutual hail and cyclone insurance companies. They claim that these companies should not have been allowed to ao business. Mr. Dearth said the same thing himself nearly a year ago, or when he prepared his annual report way back in March. Mr. Dearth called the attention of the coming legislatura to the defects in the law which made him powerless to deal with these hart companies as he should otherwise have done in the interest of those who rely on them for protection of their crops. Mr. Dearth's report, issued under date of March 1, 1898, calls attention to the defects of the law on page 7, of part 1. He says: "As the statute practically legalizes such a condition of affairs, the commissioner was practically pow erless under the law to refuse such companies a renewal of their license. Each and every company was, how ever, arbitrarily required by the com missioner to pass a resolution and file a copy of the same with the depart ment, limiting to a reasonable amount the compensation of officers at a stip ulated salary and prohibiting the pay ment of any officers In addition there to." A little later Mr. Dearth says: The present statute should be very ma terially amended, so as to throw every safe guard about the management of the affairs of this class of companies, thus preventing the possible repetition of extravagant or ex orbitant expenses in the future. The com panies were also required to pass a further resolution providing that at the next regular annual meeting of the members the provision of the by-laws requiring the members to ac cept their pro rata share of the amount real ized from the assessments levied in any one year as payment in full of their claims should be eliminated so that in the future all com panies which may be unable to pay their claims for losses in full will bo treated as in solvent, thus empowering the insurance com missioner to proceed ag-ainst it, whenever the condition of a company is found to be insol vent. With the by-laws thus amended the farmers, who may become members of these companies, can have the assurance that their losses will be paid in full; otherwise the companies must cease doing business. I can say for the officers of the majority of the companies that no objection was raised against limitation c f salaries and prohibiting the allowance of commissions in the fu'ure the required resolutions covering this matter being apparently cheerfully passed and copes of same promptly filed with the insuiunce de partment. There can be no question but that the pur pose or object of the legislature in placing j upon the statute books of this state the law providing for the organization of mutual hail and cyclone insurance companies was that of affording our farmers an opportunity to mu tually join together and protect each other at a mere nominal expense against excessive losses, sustained through hail or cyclones to their crops, and they certainly should not be required or asked to pay assessments cover ing excessive commissions voted certain offi cers of the companies by the board of direct ors. It is to be sincerely hoped thtjt the statute in question will be so amended as to render such transactions in the future legally impossible. Had the present criticism of Insur ance Commissioner Dearth been made a year ago it might have carried some weight, but as it comes a year after Mr. Dearth had called attention to how the commissioner's hands were tied ln the matter by the Minnesota statutes it naturally has little weight and less justice.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 9.-Chalrman Dingley, of the ways and means com ■ mittee, has received a letter from the commissioner of internal revenue T B. Scott, recommending a number of amendments to the act of June, 1898 Known as the war revenue act In paragraph 1, section 2, relative to bankers, it is proposed to insert in the proper place the following: Undivided profits shall be ton-idere-cl • a s u - plus in estimating the tux due from banks the amount to be estimated by taking the- av erage lor the preceedi;:g year, p.-ovi.JoJ that the word -capital" shall not be under-o.d to mean money borrowed or received from time to time as deposits, in the usual ci v se of business, from any person not v par nor interested In the bank, association or firm. Paragraph 4, section 2, relative to 'commercial brokers:" The supremo court held in case of Slack vs Tucker, 23 Wail, 32, that persons who receive into their possession any go-.d-; or m aise and sell them on commission, cannot be regarded as commercial brokers. This re lieves many persons who would otherwi c b' liable. There is no tax imposed on commis sion merchants, auctioneers, or n 1 agents or brokers. There seen s no esp dal reason for singling out commercial brokers and requiring a specmia] tax from especially as the tax falls in the main on a poorer class of people. It is recommended, therefore, that the tix en commercial brok ers be repealed or that other cljss^s < f bu ! ness, such as commission merchants and real estate agents be also required to pay spc-ial tax. Add to the paragraph in schedule A, relative to bank checks, the following: Provided that .papers in the nature of re ceipts or otherwise used as bank checks or orders for the payment of money Bhall be taxable as checks, except in the ca-:e of with drawal of funds from savings banks by a de positor on presentation of his bank book, or else impose a tax on all receipts. Provided, that any instrument purporting on iis face to be a statement of weights or rates of merchandise when cashed as a check or order for the paymtnt of money shall bo held liable to stamp tax the same as a check. USE OF STAMPS. Under the head of "express and freight," in schedule A, add the fol lowing: And provided also that no stamped receipts or stamps shall be required for any bale, bund'.e, box, article or package transmitted for the United States governmo.it, nor lor any bales, bundles or packages as are tnin eported by such companies or persons with out charge therton. No stamp duty shall be required on any powers of attorneys accompanying a bond or note or pledge or certificate of stock when such bond or note or pledge or certificate of stock shall have affixed thereto the s^amp or stamps denoting the duty required, and when ever any bond or note shall be secured by a mortgnge, but one sU,jnp duty shall be re quired to be placed on such pap rs; provided that the stamp duty placed thereon is the highest rate required for such instruments or either of them. Insert in the proper place a provision that no stamp shall be required on deeds of re lease. Strike out under the head of "contracts" the provision taxing brokers' note or memo randum of sale of goeds, merchandise, shocks or bonds, exchange note of hand, real rs ato or property of any kind or description issued by brokers or persons acting as such, 19 cents. If brokers pay the special tax' re quired that should be deemed sufficient.
