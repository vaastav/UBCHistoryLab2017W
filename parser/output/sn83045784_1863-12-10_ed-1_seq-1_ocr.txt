OPENING OF CONGRESS We need uot rewind our readers that this is the day appointed by law lor the assembling of the Thirty-eighth Congress of the United States. It meets under circumstances which will give to its deliberations and decisions an*interost sccond only to that which attended the proceedings of the last Congress, when, in its opening session, it was call ed to devise ways and means for the defenoe of the Government from an armed sedition threatening the safety of the very Capitol in whioh the Repre sentatives of the Loyal States were gathered. The time has passed when any apprehensions of this kind can longer excite the solicitude of the people in behalf of the National Legislature. But when we rtfloct how largely the measures that shall be adopted by the present Congress must tend to give color to our national destiny in all time to oome, it is safe to say that rarely has any body of men been oalled to uct as the depositaries of inte rests so vast, or the arbiters of issues involving so much of good or evil to this great people. Con vened under auspices which give so much of dig nity and solemnity to their deliberations, 'lie Rep resentatives of the Lojal S tntrs and people aie now called, if ever men weio so called, to put aside | passion and prejudice, that they may keep a single eye to the welfare of the nation, and that, dis charging all their duties under a profound sense of their responsibility to God and the country, they may be able by their wise counsels and prudent measures to restore union and peace throughout all our borders, and transmit the blessings of free constitutional Government to our latest posterity. THE 

CONSERVATIVE PLATFORM The following are the resolutions adopted at a meeting of the conservative members of the Mouse of Representatives, held on tho 28th of Juno last. They were promulgated at the time as the expres sion of the views whioh then obtained among their authors with regard to the origin and objects of the "war for the Union." These resolutions were originally published in the lutelligenoer of July 1st, 1862. THE RI SOLUTIONS. Feeling the great weight of our responsibility an mem bers of Congress, We have met in no party spirit nor for any party purpose, but fur the purpose of df libe rating and consulting together how we may best perform our Con gressional duties in the prerent great and perilous crisis of our country's fate, and we have come to the following conclusions, namely: 1. Resolrr.d, That the Constitution and the Union and the laws must be preserved and maintained in all their proper and rightful supremacy, and that the rebellion now in anna against them rnu>t be suppressed and put down, and that it is our duty t<> vote for all measures necessary and proper to that end. 2. Resolved, That the true interests of the country, as well aa the dictates of humsnity, require that no more war or acts of war should be prosecuted or done than are necessary and proper for the prompt and complete sup pression of the rebellion. 3. Resolred, That the States are component and essen tial parts of the Union, bound together inseparably by the Constitution of the United States; that none of them can cense to exist as *uch so long as that Constitution sur vives, and that it is the exclusive sphere and duty of the States to order and direct their own domestic affairs. While the rebellion, therefore, has not annulled or de stroyed the constitutional relations of the s< -railed " Seced ing States" to the Federal Government, neither has it divested those States of any rgbts or powers, municipal or otherwise,'properly belougii g to theiu as members of the Federal Union. The actual exercise of those rights and powers may for a tune be interrupted or obstructed by lebelliou, and some illegitimate authority may be substi tuted iu its p!uce, but as moil as that rebellion is suppress ed, these States will be entitled, as of right, to resume the exercise of all the rights m.d powers, dignities and immunities which properly belong t? them as States of this Union. 4 Reiolved, That the prereut war, as avowed by the President aud Congress, and understood by the people, was commenced and pr> serutetl for the purpose of sup pressing the rebellion, and preserving mid vindicating the ConsVtution, the Union, and the laws, ai.d f?r I ha) purpose only It was a great and noble purpose high above any mere sectional or putty object*, and i.t once it inspired ami united in its support all lo)a! men of every creed, party, and section At the call of the Governin-nt n n ighty army, the most patriotic, sprung at once into the fiId, arid is bleeding and conquering in the defence of its Government. Under thesecircuuistaiioes it would, in our opinion, be most unjust and ungenerous to give any new chaiacter or direction to the w?r for the accomplishment of any other than its great first purpose, aud especially for the accomplishment of any mere party or sectional scheme. 5 Resolved, That the many and great victories lately achieved by our armies and navies, whilst they ought to convii,ee the world of the vast military power of our Gov ernment. give us the pleading assurance that our deplo rable civil wsr will soon be brought to a close, should the [roper objects of the war, a< herein before defined, he ept steadily in view. When that is done, and when such punishment is infl cted on such of the guilty, leaders as will s itiaTy public justice, at d upon such others as have made themselves conspicuous for crimes committed in the prosecution of the rebellion, it is our opinion that our Government should adopt such wise measures of clemency as will tend to b'ing back cordial reconciliation and peace to the whole country. f> Ritoltid, That the doctrinen of the secessionists and of the abolitionist*, as the Utter aro now represented iu Congress, are alike false to the Constitution aud irrecou Citable with the unity and peaco of the country. The first liave already involved us in a cruel civil war, and the others (the abolitionists) will leave to the country but little hope of the speedy restoration of union or peace, it the schemes of confiscation, emancipation, and other unconstitutional measures which they have lately carried, and attempted to carry, through the Mouse o! Representatives, shall be enacted into the form of laws, and remain uurebuked by th? people 7 Retolvtd That Congress ha? no power to deprive any person of hia piopeity for any criminal offence, unless that person has been first duly convicted of the oflTonoe by the verdict of a jury. And tint all acts of Congress like those lately passed by the House of Representatives which as sume to forfeicor confiscate the estates of men for offences of which they have not been convicted upon due trial by., jury are unconstitutional, and lead to oppression aud tyranny. It is no Justification for such tic's that the crimes committed in the prosecution of the rebellion are of unexampled atrocity, nor is there any such justification aa " State necessity" known to our Government or laws. H. The foregoing resolutions are in explanation Mid re affirmation of the resofntiop passed at the extra session of the present Congress, known as the "Crittenden resolu tii n," aud winch declined " that this war is not waged on our part in any spirit of oppression, nor for any purpose of conquest or subjugati n, nor tor the purpose of over throwing or interfering with the rights or established in stitutions of those States, hut to defend and maintain the supremacy ol the Constitution, and to preserve the Union wiih all the d guity, eq iality, and rights of the several States unimpaired, and that as soon as th< se objects are accomplished the war ought to cease." THE 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Tie following is a copy of the Annual Message of the President of the United States whioa was yestwrday laid beforo both Houses of Ocngress : Fellow citiztns of the Senate and Houit of Repre,?entatioe$ : Another year of health, and of efficiently abundant harvests, has patted. For thete, and especially for the improved condition of our national .fftirs, our renewed and piofoundest gratitude to God it due. We remaiu iu peace and friendship with foreign Powert. The efforts of disloyal ci'izens of the United States to in volve ut in fore gn wart, to aid an inexcusable insurrec tioo, have lepn unavailing. Her Britannic Majesty's Government, at was juatly expected, have exercised their authority to prevent ihe departure of new hostile expedi tions from Britith ports. The Emperor of France has, by a like proceeding, promptly vindicated the neutrality wbioh he proclaimed at tbe beginning of tbe contest. Questions of great intricacy and importance have aiiten out of tbe blockade, and other belligerent operations be tween the Government and several of the maritime Powers, but they have been discussed, and, at far at was possible, accommodated in a spirit of frankness, justice, and mutual good will. It is especially gratifying that our prize courts, by the impartiality of their adjudications have commanded the respect and confidence of maritime Powers. Ihe supplemental treaty between the United States and Great Britain for tbe suppression of tbe African slave trade, made on the 17th day of February last, hat been duly ratified, and carried into execution. It is believed that, so far as American ports and American citizens are concerned, that inhuman and odious traffic has been brought to an end. I shall submit for the consideration of the Senate a con vention for the adjustment of possessory claims in Wash ington Territory, arising out of the treaty of the 15th June, IH4?;, between the United States and Great Britain and which have been the source of some disquiet among the citizens of that now rapidly improving part of tbe country. A novel and important question, involving tbe extent of the maritime jurisdiction of Spain in the waters which surround the island of Cuba, has been debated without reach.ng an agreement, and it is proposed, in an amicable tpuif, to refer it to the arb.trament of a friendly Power. A convention for that purpose will be submitted to the Senate. ? 1 have thought it proper, subject to the approval of the Senate, to concur with the interested commercial Powers man arrangement for tbe liquidation of the Scheldt dues upon the piinciples which have been heretofore adopted in regard to tbe impoatt upon navigation iu the waters of Denmark. The long pending controversy between this Government and that of Chili touching the seizure at Sitania. in Peiu, by Chilian i fficers, of a large amount of treasure belong ing to citizens of the United States, has been brought to a close by the award of his Majesty the King of the Bel Kians, to whose arbitration tbe question was referred by the parties The a-^bjeet was thoroughly and patiently examined by that justly rejected magistrate, aud, although the sum awarded to the claiuiauts may not have been *s large as wat expected, there is no reason to distrust the wisdom of his Majesty's decision. That decision was promptly complied with by Chili, when intelligence in re gard to it reached that country. I he joint commission, under the act of ihe last session for canying into effect the convention with Peru on the sutject of claim*, has been organized at Lima, and is en gaged iu the business entrusted to it. Difficulties oonc-rmng inter.weanic transit through Ni caragua are iu course of amicable adjustment. Iu conformity with pnuciplea set forth in my last an nual message, I .have received a representative from the United States of Colombia, and have accredited a minister to that Republic. Incidents occurring in the progress of our civil war have forced upon my attention tbe uncertain state of interna tional questions touching the rights of foreigner* iu this country and ol Uuited States citizens abroad. Iu regard to some Government! these rights are at least partially defined by treati. a. In no instance, however, it it ex pressly atipulated that, iu the event of a civil war, a for eigner residing in this country, within tbe lines of the in surgents, is to be exempted from the rule which classes him as a belligerent, in whoa* behalf the Government of hi? c< u ltfy cannot expect any privileges or immunities distinct from that character. I regret to say, however, that such claims have been put forward, and, in some in stances, in behalf of foreigners who have lived in tfaa Uni ted Statea the greater part of their livea. There is. reason to believe that many persons born in foreign countries, who have declared their intenti >n to be come .citizens, or who have been fully naturalized, have evaded the military duty required of them by denying the fact, and thereby ttrowing upon the Government the bur den ot proof. It bat been found difficult of impracticable to obtain this proof from the want of guides to the proper sources of information. These might be supplied by re quiring clerks of courts, where declarations or intention may be made or naturalizations effected, to tend peiiod:* cally lists of the names of the persons naturaliz-d or de claring their intention it become citizens, to the Secretary of the Interior, iu whose department those mum's might be arranged and printed for general information. I here is alto reason to beli ?ve that foreigners frequently b< co ne citizens of the United States f >r the sole purpose of evading duties imposed by the laws of their native coun tries, to which, on becoming naturalized here, they at ?i,c? repair, and, though never returning to the United States, they still claim the interposition of this Government as citizens. Many altercations and groat prejudice hare heretofore arisen out of this abuse. It is. therefore, sub mitted to jour serious consideration. It might be advisa ble to fix a limit, beyond which no citizMi of tbe United States residing abroad may claim the interposition of his Government. r The right of suffrage has often been assumed and exer cued by aliens, under pretences of nVura'.zition, which they have disavowed when drafted into the military ser vice I submit the expediency of such an amendment of the law a< will make the fact of voting an estoppel against ai.y plea of exemption from military service, or other civil obligation, on the ground of alienage In c,Mimon with other western Powers, our relations with Japan have been brought into serious jeopardy through the perverse opposition i.f the hereditary aristoc racy of the empire to the enhghteued arid liberal policy ?f the l ycK.n, designed to bring the corintry into the society of nations It is hoped, although not with entire confi dence, that these difficulties may be peacefully overcome I ask your attention to the claim of the minister residing there for the damages he sustained in the destruction by fire of the residence of the legation at Yed.t Satisfactory arrangements have been male with the Em peror of Kustin, which, it is believed, will result in effect ing a continuous line of telegraph through that empire from our Pacific coast. K I recommend te your favorable consideration the subject <> an international t-legnph across the Atlantic ocean; 1 * '?tagfaph between this capital and the na ii ?, or * "long the Atlantic seaboard and the Gulf of Minxhtlm Cora?,1,,n'p,ltions, established with anyrea aids In th?,^-,,ukWO? ^ <"r!',",,,T>'cal a* well as effective aids to the diplomatic, military, and natal service en[ctmsn^!!

This acknowledg ment jui?tly includes those consuls who, residing in Mo rocco, Egypt, Turkey, Japan, Ch>u4, and other Oriental countries, are charged with complex fuuctious aud extra ordinary powers. 'J'be condition of the several organized Territories is generally sati*lactory, although Indian disturbances ^ iu New Mexico have not been entirely suppressed. The mineral resources of Colorado, Nevada, Idaho, New Mexi co, and Arizona are proving far richer than has been here tofore under?t -od. I lay before you a communication on this subject from the Governor of New Mexico. 1 again submit to your consideration the expediency of establish ing a system for tte encouragement of immigration Although this source of national wealth aud strength is again flowing with greater freedom thau for several yram before the insurrection occurred, there is still a great de ficiency of laborers in every field of industry, especially in agriculture and in our mines, as well of iron and coal as of the precious metals. While the demand for labor is thus mcreas<d here, tens of thousands of persons, destitute ol remunerative occupation, are thronging our loreign con sulates, aud offering to emigrate to the United Hiatus if essential, hut very cheap, assistauce can be afforded them. It is easy to see that, under the slnrp discipline of civil war, the nation is beginning a new life. This noble eflort demands the aid, and ought to receive the atteutiou aud support of the Government. Injuries, unforeseen by the Government and unintended, may, ill tome esses, have been inflicted on the subjects or cit>Z'ns of loreign countiies, both at sea aud on land, by persona in the serv:ce of the United Statt s. As this Government expeots redress from other Powers when ximilar ii juries are inflicted by persons in their service upon citizens of the United States, we must be prepared to do justice to foreigners If the existing judicial tribunals are inadequate to this purpose, a special court may be author ized, with power to hear and dtcide such claims of the oharnctr referral to as may have ari-eii under treaties aud the public law. Conventions for adjusting the claims by j lint commission have been proposed to some Govern ments, but uo definitive answer to the proposition has yet been received from any. In the course of the ?ession I shall probably have occasion to requett you to provide indemnification to claimants where decrees of restitution have been rendered, aud dam ages awared by admirality courts; and in other cases, where this Government may be acknowledged to be liable iu principle, and where the amount of that liability has been ascertained by an informal arbitration The proper officers of the Treasury have deemed them selves required, by the law of the United States upon the subject, to demnud a tax upon the incomes ol foreign Con sul* in this country. While such a demaud may u?.t, in strictness, be in derogation of public law, or perhaps ol any treaty b^tw^on tbrt United State* and a foreign country, the expediency of so fur modifying the act as to exempt from lax the income of such consuls as are not citizens of the United States, derived from the emolument* of their office, or from pioperty not situated in the United States, is subinitt -d to your serious con sideration. I make this suggestion upon the ground that a comity which ounbt to be reciprocated exempts our coin-ills, in all other countries, from taxation to the extent thus indicated The United Slates, I think, ought not to be execptioiiably illiberal to international trade aud com Uierce. _ ... , '1 h-i operations of the Treasury during the last year have been successfully conducted Theenactment by Ongre-s nf a national banking law h?s proved a valuable support of the public credit; and the general legislation in relutmu to loans has lully answered the expectations ot its favorers Nome amendments may be required to perfect ex sting Uws ; but no change iu their priucipl-s or general scope is believed to be needed . .. j Since these measures have been in operaton, a I de mands on the Treasury, including the pay ot the army and uavy, have been promptly met and fully satisfied No considemb'e body of troops, it is bdieved, were evermore amply provided, and more libently and punctually paid ; and it may be added that by no people were the burdens incident to a great war ever more cheerfully bor.ie. The leceipts during the year from all sources, includ ing loans and the balance in the Treasury at its commence ment, were $901.1*25 

IVT-I 80, and the aggregate disburse meuU $-9?,796630 65 leaving a balance on the 1st July, 1*63 of $">1129,044 21 Of the receipts there w. rede rived from customs $f.9.069 642 40; from internal .eveuue, $37.<>40.787.9f?; from direct tax, $ 1,4*5.103.61 :fr??nl?nds, $ 167 617 l^^B^^fciifcellaneous sources, $3,046,6lo .??>; andfr. ru 361 f>7 ; making the aggregate, $!K)1 Of the <Rs1i5irsements there were f..r the civil s^mc , $23 253 922 08; for pensions and lnd ans, $4,210 .?-?> <?'; for interest on public debt, $24 7*?,846 51 ; for the W *r Department, $fc9J,2y8,000 83; tor the Navy Department, $63 211 105 27; for payment of funded and temporary debt. $181,086,635 07 ; making the aggregate $?9r>,7%, 030 05; and leaving the balance of $."? 329,044 21. hut the payment of funded and temporary debt having been male from moneys borrowed during tne year, must be reg irded as mer<-ly nominal payments, and the moneys borrowed to make them ?s merely nominal receipts; and their amount, #181,0M> 035 07, should therefore be de ducted both from receipts ant di?buraements Ihw done, there remains as actual receipts $720,0?>y,U.i'.J.7.?; and the actual di?burtema?ti, #*14 leaving the balance as already staled. The actual receipts and disbursements for the hrst quar ter, and the estimated receipts and disbursements for the remaining three-quarters of the current fi-cal year 181.1 will be shown in detail by the report of the Secretary of the Treasury, to which 1 invite your attention. It is sut ficent to say here that it is not believed that actual results will exhibit a state of finances less favorable to the coun try than the estimates of that officer heretofore subiuitt-d; whilst it is confidently expected that at the close of the year both disbursements and debt will be found very con ? derably less than has been anticipated The report of the Secretary of War is a document of great interest. It consists of? 1. The military operation* of the year, det iled iu the report of the Geiieral-in-Ch:ef. 2 The organization of colored per* in* into th<j war service. . .. 3. The exch mge of prisoners, lully set forth hi the let ter of Geu. Hitchcock. 4. The operations uuder the act for enrolling and cnll ing out the national forces, detailed in the report of the Provost Marshal General 5. Tb-i organization of the invalid corps; and 0. The operation of the several departments of the Quartermaster General, Commissary General, Paymaster General, Chief of Engineers, Chief of Ordnance, and Sur geon General. It has appealed impossible to make a valuable summary of this rep ?rt, except such as would be t ?o cite de-1 for this p'&oe, and henco I content myself by a?kiiig your careful attention to the report itself. The duties devolving on the naval branch of the service during the year, and throughout the whole of this unhappy contest, have been discharged with fidelity and eiu ueiit slices*. '1 he extensive blockade has been constantly in creasing in efficiency as the navy has expanded ; yet on so long a line it has so lar beeu impossible to euluely sup press illicit trade From returns received at the Navy Department it ap pears that more than one thousand ves??ls have beeu cap tured since the blockade was instituted, and that the value of prizes already sent in for adjudication amounts to over thirteen millions of dollars The naval force of tho United States consists at this tima of five hundred and eighty-eight vessels, completed and in the course of completion, and of these seventy fire are iron-clad or armored steamers The events of the war give an increased interest aud importance to the navy, which will probably extend beyond the war itself The armored vessels in our navy completed and in ser vice, or which are under contract or approaching comple tion, are believed to eiced in number th >se nf any oilier Power. Hut, while these may be relied upon for harbor defence and coast service, others of greater strength and capacity will b<* necessary for cfuismg purposes aud to maintain our rightful position on the ocean. The change that has taken place iu naval vessel* and naval warfare since the introduction of steatu a* a motive power for ship* of war demands either a corresponding change iu som- of our existing navy yards, or the establish merit of new ones, for the construction and necessary re piirol modern naval vessels. No inconsiderable embar ias?Dient, delay, and public injury have been experienced from the want of such Governmental establishments. The necessity of such a navy yard, so lurnished, at some suit able plaoe upon the Atlantic seaboard, has on repeated oc cations been brought to the att -ntion of Congress by the Navy Department, and is again presented in the report of the Secrettry which accotnpinie* this communication 1 think it my duty to invite your special attention to this subject, and als > to tint of establishing a yard and depot for naval purposes upon one of the Western rivers. A naval force has been created on those interior waters, and uuder many disadvantages, within little more than two years, exceeding in numbers the whole naval force of tin country at the commencement of the present Administra tion Httisfactory and important a* have been the per formance of the heroic men of the navy at this interestu g I erii'd, they are >^are?-ly mo*e wonderful than the success ofoir mechanics and artisans in the production of war vessels, which has created a new lorui ol naval power. Our country has advantage* auperior to any other nation in our resource* of iron and timber, with inexhaustible quantitias of fuel in the immediate vicinity of both, and all available and in clone proximity to navigable water*. Without the advantage of public work*, the resource* of tbe nt.ion have be. n developed and it* power displayed in thei conatryction of a navy of Hiich magnitude which ban, at Uie very period ..f it* creation, rendered aigual aervice to the Union. B The increase of the number of aeamen in the public *er 8'!Ye" lhiiu*4nd five hundred tueu, in the *prmg of 1801, to about thirty-four thousand at the present time ha* been aoeomplshed without special legialatiou, or ex traorduiary bounties to promote that increaae. It ha* been fouui, however, that the operation of the draft, with the high bounties paid for army recruita, ia beginning to affect "juri^ufly the naval aervice, and will, if not cor rected, be llk-ly to impair it* efficiency by detaching sea men troui their proper vocation and inducing them to enter the army. I therefore re*p.ctfully suggest that Con Hid b ?tb the army and ntVHl services by a definite provision .11 thi* subject, which would at the same time be equitiible to the communities more especially in tr rested. r ' I commend to your con*ideratiou the auggeationa of (he Secretary ot Iho Navy in regard u> the p(.licy ol foatermg nud training s^ainou, and alao the education of officer* and engineer* for the naval service. The Naval Academy is rendering signal hi i vice in preparing midshipmen for the hiadily responsible duties which iu alter life they will be required to peifiuin. In order that the country should not be deprived of the proper quota of educated officer*, for which 1 ga! provision ha* been made at the Naval School, the vacancies caused by the neglect or omission to make nominations (rom the State* in insurrection have been filled by the Secretary of the Navy. The school i* now more full aiiil complete than at any former period, and in every respect entitled to the favorable consideration of Congress. During the past fiscal year the finauc'.al condition of the Post Olficrt Department has been one of increasing pros perity, and I aiu gratified iu being able to state that the actual postal revenue has nearly equalled the entire ex penditures, the latter amounting to $11,314,20(5 84. and the former to $11,16.1,(8!!.of), leaving a deficiency of but #l-?",II' lu IrtOU, the year immediately preceding the rebellion, the deficiency amounted to ffi 656,705 49, I he postal receipts of that year being f2,64f>,7&?.19 less than thoie of 186:1. The decrease since 1*00 in the annual amount of trans porta ti<n hat been only about twenty-five per cent, but the annual expenditure oh account of th? same has been reduml thirty-five uer cent. It is manifest, therefore, that the Post Office Department may become self-sustain ing in a few yt ars, even with the restoration of tbe whole aervice. , ? The international conference of postal delegates from the principal countries of Kurope and America, which was called at the suggestion of the Poet master General, met at Paris on the 11th of May last, and concluded its delibera tion- nu the 8th of .June. The principles established by the conference as best adapted to facilitate postal inter course between nations, and as the basis of future postal conventions, inaugurate a general system of uniform inter national charges, at reduced rates of postage, and cannot fail to produce beneficial results I re er you to the report of the Secretary of the Interior, which is herewith laid bet??re you, for useful and varied information iu relation to the public lauds, Indian affairs patents, pensions, and other matters of public concern per taming to hi* departm-nt The quantity of land disposed of during the last and the fir?t quarter of the present fiscal years was three million eight hundred and forty-one thousand five hundred and forty nine acres, of which one hundred and sixty-one thou sand nine huudred and eleven acre* were sold for ca?h, one million tour hundred aud fifty-si* thousand five hun dred and fourteen acres were taken up under the home stead law, and the residue disposed of under lawe granting lands for militaty bounties, for railroad, and other f.ur pi aes. It alao appeara that the sale of the public land* ia largely ou the increase. It has long been a cherished opinion of some of our wisert statesmen that the people of the United States had a higher and m ire endii in? interest in the early settle meat and sub-tantial cultivation of ihe public lands than in the amount of direct revenue to be derived from the sa'e of them This opinion his had a controlling influence in shaping legislation up m the subj-ct of our national domain I may cite, as evidence of tlra, the liberal m>nsure* adopted in reference to actual settlers; the grant to the States of the overflowed land within their limits in order to their being reclaimed and rendered fit for cultivation ; the grants to railway companies of alternate aections of land upon the contemplated lines of their roads, which, when completed, will so largely multiply the facilities for reaching our distant p isaesvions. This policy has received it-, most mgual aud beneficent illustration in the recent enactment grafting homesteads to actual settlers. Since the first day of January last the before mentioned quantity ol one million four hundred and fifty-six thou,and hve hundred a<id fourteen acres of land have be^n taken up under it* provisions. This fact aud the amount of *ale* furnish gratifying evidence of increasing settlement upon the public lands, notwithstanding the great struggle in which the energies of the nation have been eugag.-d, and which ha* required so large a withdrawal of our citizena from their accustomed pursuit*. I cord'tilly concur iu the recommendation of the Secre tary of the Interior, suggesting a modification of the act iu favor of those engaged til the military and naval service of the United States I doubt not that Cougreas will cheer fully adopt such measure* as will, without essentially changing the general leatures of the system, secure, to the greateet practicable extent, its benefit* to thus* who have left th-ir home* iu the defence of the country in thi* ar duous crisi*. I invito your attention to tbe view* of the Secretary as to tbe propriety of raiting, by appropriate legislation, a re venue from the mineral hnd* ot the United State*. The measure* provided at your last session for the re moval of certuoi Indian tribe* have been carried into effect. Sundry treaties have been negotiated, which will iu due time be submitted for the constitutional action of the Senate. They contain stipulations for extinguishing the possessory right* of the Indiana to large and valuable tracts of lain). It is hoped thai the effect of these treaties will result in tbe estiblnbuieiit of permanent fri-ndly relation* with such of these tribe* as have been brought into frequent aud bloody collision with our outlying aettlements aud emit rants Sound policy and our imperative duty to these wards ot Ihe Government demau I onr anxious aud con *taut attention to their material well-being, to their pro greas in the art* ol civilization, and, above all, to tha^ mural training which, under the blessing of Divine Provi tnee, will confer upon them the elevated and sanctifying iiifl ieuces, tbe hope* aud consolation* of the Christian faith. I suggested in my last annual message the propriety of rem -deiliug our Indian system. Subsequent events have atisfied ine ol its necessity. The details set forth in the report of the Secretary evince the urgent need for immo late legislative action, 1 commend the benevolent institutions, established or patronised by the Government in this District, to your ?iierou* and fostering care. I'm* attention of Congress, during last session, was en gaged to some extent with the proposition for enlarging the water communication between the Mississippi river and the northern seaboard ; which proposition, however, failed I r the tim \ Since tnen, upon a call ol the greatest re-|M'f lability, a convention has been beld at Chicago upon e ?:iiu ? subject, a summary of whose views is contained a memorial addressed to the President and Congress, and v\hich 1 now have the honor to lay before you.

Augmented interest is given to this subject by the actual Commence ment a! work upon the PaCifie railroad, under auspicea so v or able to rapid progress and completion The enlarged vig iti >n becomes a palpable need to Ike great road I transmit Lue sec >nd annual report of the Commission of the Department of Agriculture, asking your atten in to the developments in that vital interest of the nation. When Congress assembled a year ago the war had al ready la?te I nearly twenty months, and there had. been many c inflict* on both land and sea, with varying results. The rebellion ha I been pressed back into reduced limits; yet the tone of publio feeling and opinion, at ho mi and abroad, was not satisfactory. VVith oiher sign*, the popular elec tions, th-*n just past, indicated uneasiness among ourselves, win It* amid much that was cold and menacing the kindest words coining from Kurope were uttered In accents of pity that, we were too blind to surrender a hopeless cause. Our commerce was suffe.ing greatly by a few ariued vessels built up 'ii and furnished from foreign shores, aud we were threatened with such additions from the sBine quarter as would sweep our trade from th ? sea and raise our block ade We had failed to elicit from European Governments an, thing hopeful upon this subject. The preliminary einittC patioit proclamation, issued in September, was rui - ning its asaigneil period to th ? beginning of the new year. A month later the final proclamation came, including the announcement tint colored men of auitable condition w. u'd be received into the war service. Tbe policy of e ulncipfttion and of employing black soldiers gave t? the u ure a new aspect, about which hope, and fear, and doubt contended in uncertain coi.flict, According to our politi cal system, as a matter of civil administration, tbe Gene ral Wovernmeut had no lawful power to effect euiaucipa turn hi any Slate, and for a long tiiue.it bad been hoped that the rebellion could bo suppresaed without snorting t<? it aa a military meaaure. It w*a all the while deemed p< asible that (he necessity for it might come, and that, il it should. the criaia of the contact would then be pre sented. It eaue, and. as we anticipated, it waa followed by dark and doubtful days hleveu months having uow parsed, we are permitted to take another review. The reb I bordera are pressed atill further back, and by the complete opening of the Missis sippi the country dominated bv the rebellion is divided into < istinet parts, with no practical communication between them Ienneaaee and Arkansas have been substantially cleared of maurgent control. and influential citizen, in each, owner, of .laves and advocates of slavery at the be ginning ol the rebellion, now declare openly for emancipa tion 10 their respective Stat?a. Of those States not m cudediu the emancipation proclamation, Maryland and s* neither of which three years ago would tolerate any restraint upon the extension of slavery into new Ter "tore* only dispute now as to the best mode of removing it within their own limits. Of those who were alaves at the beginning ol the rebellion, full one hundred tlnmand are now in the United States m.litary service, ab >ut one halt of which number actually bear arms in the ranks thus giving the double advantage of taking so much labor from the insurgent cause, and supplying the places which otherwise must be filled with so many white men. So far as tested, it is difficult to say they are not as good sol dier* as any. No servile insurrection, or tendency to vio lence or cruelty, has marked the measures of emancipation and arming the blacks. These measures have beeu much discussed in foreign countries, and contemporary with sueh discussion the tone i f public sentim-nt there is uiuctj.iin proved. At home the same measure* have been fu'ly dis cussed, supported, criticised, and denounced, and the aiiiiml ejections following are highly encouraging to those whose official duty it is to bear the country through this great trial, llius we have the new reckoning The crisis which threatened to divide the friends of the Union is past. Looking now to the present, and future, and with re ference to a resumption of the national authority within the States wherein thai authority has been suspended I have thought Gt to issue a proclamation, a copy of which is herewith transmitted. ? ^"examination <d this procltmutiori it will appear, as is believed that nothing is attempted beyond whit is am ply justified bv tbe Constitution. True, the form of mi oath is given, but no man ia coerced to take it, The man is only promised a p,r lou in case he voluntarily take* th ? ..nth. JLhe Constitution authorizes the Executve to grantor with hold the pardon at his own absolute discretion ; and this 'ii Chides the power to grant on terms, as is fully established by judicial and other authoiities. It is also proffered that if, in any of the States named, a State Government aha be, in the mode prescribed, set up, such (J. vemm. nt ? hall be recognised and guarantied by the lTmt*'?l States and that under it the State -hajl. on the constitutional conditions, be protected against iuvasion and domestic Violence. I he constituti mal obligation of the United Stales to guaranty to evry State J(, the Union a republi c-u form of government, and to protect the State in the cases stated, is explicit and fuH. But why tender he beu-lits of thi. provision only to a State Government set up iu this particular way 1 Th a section of the Constitution contemplates a case wherein the ele ment within a S'ate, favorable to republican government, in the Union, may be t o feebje for hii opposite and hos tile element external to or even within the State; and such are precisely the c^-s with wb ch we are n?w deal ing. An attempt to guaranty and protect a revived State Government, constructed in whole or in preponderating part |rem the very element against whose hostility nDd violence it is to be protected, is simply absurd. There must be a test by which to ?eparate the opposing elements 8. ai to ouild o ?y from the suund ; and that test is a suffi I cieutly liberal one which accepts as sound whoever w:ll recantation of Lia former una jdnma '' But if it be proper to require, as s teit ol admission to the p.dttical h. dy an osti of allegiance to the Constitution of the lifted States and to the Union under it, why al? . to t e la* j and Declamations in regard to slavery ' Tho.e laws and proclamations were enacted and put forth for the purple of aiding in the suppression of the rebellion To give them the.r fullest effct, there had to be a pledge for ih or maintenance.

Kor th-se and o?h-r reasons it i- thougat best that support of these measures shall be included in the oath ; arid .t is believed the Eiecu rLVi'r?Bf "T- , yA n 11 ret'irn r?r P"4rtn "?'Ho ratio.! of f, rreited Iignu. which he has clear eonstiitttioual power to withhold altogether, or gunt upon the terini which he shall deem w sest for the public interest.

Why ahall A ad..pt tbe plan of B rather than B that of A I And if A nnf!

Say ing that o? certain terms, certain cla?se, will be pardoned. with right* rested, it ia not said that other closes, or other U rms. will never be included. Saying that recon struction will be accepted if presented in a specified way. it is not said it will never be accepted in any other way.

In the midst of other cares, however important, we must not lose sight of the f ict thai the war power is at l| our main reliance. To that power alone can we look yet for a time, to give confidence to the people in the contested regions, that the insurgent power will not again overrun th*m Until that confidence shall b* established, little can be done any where for what is calbd reconstruction Hence our chiefest care still be directed to the army and navy. Who have th IS f,r borne their hard-r pa.t so nobly and well. And it may be esteemed fortunate that if, givnig the greatest efficency to these indispensable arms, we do also honorably rec.gni.e the gallant men. from com mander tt# sentinel, who Compose them, and to whom more than to others, the world must stand indebted for the home of freedom disenthraled, regenerated, enlarged, and perp dnated.
