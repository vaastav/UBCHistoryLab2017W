WELL TAKE. - -OMAHA, Dee. 15. To the Editor of The Bee: Tour reference to the dls ......... ih.i .. . k . I..,, i. k.v. k .. i, I compensation from the Institutions they examined, and your remark about similar practices elsewhere, are apt and timely, but do not go far enough. You know, or you-' ought to, tbot here In Nebraska salaried offlc.le.ls are constantly accepting employment on the outside, which they would never get except for the fact that they are public officials. Thla practice ought to be stopped all along the tine. B. a. li. ; Our correspondent makes a good point and one that will strike a popu lar chord. The trend of public senti ment everywhere, is against the old idea that a public office is to be re garded, if not as an Instrument of graft, as a means of promoting private interests elsewhere. Without going Into specifications, it is notorious that here In Nebraska, state and local officials of all political parties have greatly abused thelr posi tions by"' making them merely a base of operations for private activities. In many case the public official has per- suaded himself to look at hU salary aa merely a retainer, entitling the peo ple to his time and attention only when no' one else Wants It or he has nothing else to do. Schemes are pro jected And employment' '. accepted whose financial success -depend upon fator procured in an official capacity. That this Is all wrong and should be1 stopped is perfectly obvious, but how to stop It is not so clear. IX the salaries' we pay our officials were on a scale by which we could rightly de mand their exclusive services, all out side work could be prohibited". Under present conditions and In this day of publicity, perhaps the abuse 'could be obviated by requiring all these sal aried officials to record publicly all private, business engagements during their terms r of office and make sure that they'dd not conflict with" their public" duties.' ' 'the CEiravs enumerators. Congressmen, republicans' and dem ocrats alike, have joined In rejecting the recommendation ' )t " President ftooseveltlthat the enumerators to "be employed in the taking of the next census be appolned only after, a com petitive examination. ' The charge was mltdo In ttits course of the' house de bate on the question that the repub licans and democrats were to share alike in the appointment of enumera tors; thus placing the distribution of patronage on, a "pork" basis and se curing the votes of all who expect to share in it. The bill as agreed upon by the house provides that the enumerators In the several congressional -districts be selected by the congressmen, lea v ing the director of the census no op tion "but to appoint the men ' thus named' As there will be about 3,000 additional clerks appointed for the service in Washington and a good many thousand enumerators for the work in the field, this will give the congressmen the- largest volume of patronage they have had for yetrs. ' The present director of the census and all his predecessor's' nave pro tested against this method of appoint ing 'clerks 'and 'enumerators; insisting that the work of thfe "census" de layed 'land is efficiency impaired "by fthe 'failure of 'congress '' to - provide men selected by merit rather than by personal 'Influence" '6r 'political' ' pull. Apparently we have" ndt ' yet' reached the stage where our congressmen will voluntarily forego the filling of a few Jobs'" with political' 1 camp followers, oven though the census "work 'suffer.

INSURGENTS. The close fight in the house over a resolution lookfng to change the re iport or tne committee on rules rur- Ll.l . 11 L . I . . l . I. nisoes aa iiiubiiuliuu vl iud (iuhih of the sentiment among members for a modification r of the existing system of conducting the business of that body'."'' This fight is now being made as 'a matter of principle and not as a display of personal opposition to Speaker Cannon.- While opposition to the speaker's re-election has practically subsided, the sentiment; in favor of placing ' important limitations on the excessive 'power lodged in: that office is growing rapidly." with promise of real' results when the new congress comes in with a considerable number Of its first-term members pledged to a revision of the rules. Congressman Hepburn of Iowa, who has always been classed as a close supporter and personal friend of Speaker" Cannon, is leading the movement for reorganlza tlon of the rules. '418 program,' ac cording to a published statement, : Would confer n the-speaker authority to appoint one-third of the members of each committee,' on the party caucus au thority' to name another third, and on the minority' authority select the remain ing third. He would ' delegate ' to the committees so selected ' the ' right to elect their own chairmen, and would make It obligatory ., on the speaker to call . the committees- once or -twice a . week ao that they oould . present, without' the-permission of. the speaker, measures on which they desire action by the house. Mr. -. Hepburn would also abolish the rule which makes It optional with the speaker, ,wiethr ? or not- he shall recognise a member who addresaea the chair. Some action of this kind would do much to restore the house f.o greater freedom of action; and make it nearer an open forum for discussion. It is, of oourse," necessary that an unwleldly body like the house f ould have Us order of business arranged in advance, its time assigned for bills and speak ers recognized by agreement, but it is evident that the program should be made up after -'a more general Consid eration by the membership of ' th house, Instead of having it firmly and definitely fixed by - the committee on rules, dominated by the speaker.1 This committee now really exercises ' abso lute power of life and death over legis- j r ; -.' ' ' latlon, practically denying tU Irlgnt of consideration by the house. . The proposition of Mr. Hepburn to have the spoaker name one-third of the committees, the party caucus to name the second third and the minor ity party to name the other third strikes at the real seat of the trouble a the bouse at present. It would de prive the speaker of two-thirds of his power in choosing members of the committees and deprlvi him wholly of the power to name 'chairmen, who would naturally bo favorable to his legislative program. These proposi tions of change are radical, almost to the extreme, and it is doubtful if they can all be effected, but the ap pearance of an effective sentiment for revision Of the rules promises some corrective measures by the new con gress. - TTIEPMLIPP1XE SUGAR TARIFF. The reported agreement of the ways and means committee or con gress to admit annually 300,000 tons of Philippine 3urar' free -Of duty, with duty of 75 per cent of the regular tariff ' on all ekcess of that amount, will probably be accepted by congress, as It is Urged, by; Mr. Taft and Is gen erally felt to be due as a partial per formance of the pledges' made to the Filipinos to grant them trade conces sions under the tariff laws'. The present production of sugar in the Philippines is' only slightly in ex cess 67 home demands and but little of it is sent to this country Those familiar -with conditions in the islands contend that it will be ten years or more before the sugar available for export to the United States 'from the Philippines can amount to anything IlkO 300,000 tons; The importation of that amount, duty free, from the Phil ippines would not seriously affect this country, although it would act as a stimulus and encouragement to the in dustry in the islands. The free ad mission pf 300,000 tons annually from the Philippines would be felt only -by other sugar exporting countries, Ger many, Cuba and the Dutch East Indies, which ' now ' send annuajiyy to the A United States- more than' 1,600,000 tons of tPSgar. There is apparently ho danger that" sugar Importations' from the Philippines will' make any marked Inroad on the 'domestic market for years to come. " L THE 

JANUARY DIVIDENDS. In face Of all the complaints of financial' and "business" depression throughout the country in the early months of the present year, reports show that the January dividend dis"- burBements 'will be the largest on rec ord, amounting to more than $200,- 000,000, and exceeding last year's di vidends by nearly -120.000,000." ' :; The money to be thus disbursed has been earned largely by the railroads and the big industrial corporations, nearly all of which have not only met their regular' dividend payments, but have added to their" surplus resarvrs. The record appears to discount the complaints made by the railroad man agers and the captains of industry to the effect ' that ' the . administration policies of the' government were ruin ing Investments and frightening in vestors. ""The opposite 'effect appears to havo been produced, the legislation and Investigation relating to the oper ation ' of big corporation and indus trial enterprises having reassured the people of the soundness of these con cerns. -It 1b expected that most of the $200,000,000 to be disbursed in dividends will seek reinvestment, thus assuring an abundance of money' for safe and sane enterprises. - . Mr. Bryan wants the coming Ne braska legislature to enact -into law all the pledges in' the' Denver plat form applicable to state legislation.

BITS OF ""-VAMIIXflTO-e; I.irK. Mlaor See nee aad IarMents Sketrke a tke Spot. "Last year when congress adopted the proviso restricting the employment of secret service men, a restriction denounced by the president in til resnllar message, there waa a rood deal of excitement among cer1flin"Tnembrr 'or connren, ' whd Wife led to believe they were watched and spied upon by a cabal of political police. Capitol gossips spread the stories In all directions, and eventually brought about the clause restricting the Operations ot the secret service men. That there waa some basis for tho stories about spying Into the private afralrs of members appears from recent Inquiries, but the' spying was not done by government secret service men. A Washington correspondent of the New York Tribune explains this feature of the controversy He" says: ""The "rumof that the president emptoyed secret service men to watch the personal conduct of members of congress appears to have grown out of the misguided enterprise of a member of the local pollce'force.' This mad sought to obtain an Increase of pay for -District of Columbia policemen. Palling to do so, he undertook to shadow a number of mem bers of congress. He obtalred evidence, as he believed, to insure the increase of pay, but when ho laid It before his superior he was dismissed from the service. Noth ing ever came of Ms efforts, but some members of congress learned that they had been shadowed, and they immediately assumed that It was by secret service men aetlng under the direction of the president, although nothing could be further from the fact." - The quarters occupied by the ways and means commltte In conducting the tariff hearings is known as the marble hall, or audience chamber, of the new House of Representatives' office building. The room Is arranged with a Studied design to lend the committee the pomp and dignity of 4 high court; but the actual result laugha bly overshoots- the purpose, hays a Wash ington letter. The committee members are seated on a raised platforrrt "be:hIfiaa,Sefn"I c'rCular desk or bar of dark, rich wood, mounted and polished stone. They ' thus look flown upon th6 witness, who stands, as It were, tn a well at the center of the semt-clrcle, While the seats for the publlo extend to the other end , of the long but comparatively harrow hall. If properly treated, it might have been a beautiful rodm; in fact.' It was beautiful until 1 its effect was marred. It has a high vaulted J celling, with arches springing from pillars ert 'either side, and its windows are large. But some one with barbaric eye for stage effects has provided - elaborate - and costly hangings of deep crimson. Not only do these shroud the windows,' but at the rear of the -committee's platform there hangs from a carved and golden cornice a similar folded curtain of crimson which stands out from the wall a distance equal to ' the concealed steps, which on either side lead down to the' special door which the curtain hides. This detailed description Is given because of the Instant Impression which the scene has made on more than oh observer. 1 With the crimson window curtains drawn together and the brilliant electric chan deliers; hideously swathed In flags, the long and lofty chamber takes on the as pect ot a chapel or temple. The likeness is ' intensified to the last degree by the crimson hangings which stand out from the end wall behind the committee, as If an altar, the very holy of holies, were hid beneath the richness of their folds. Embarrassing and amusing incidents crop out in the tariff hearings. Somo enemy of the protective- system,- anxious to score on his opponents, discovered that .the towels In use by the , committee were of foreign manufacture,-' the'' imprint,' "made in Great ' Britain,"' being conspicuous ; on the linen. Bays the Washington correspond ent of the New 'York Evening Post Snent the episode. Chah-man Payne is reported to have ' fceen Visibly " embarrassed When Ms attention was ' dlrected' to the circum stance that his committee "had discrimi nated against' an AmeiicAn" industry by- purchasing foreign towels. Representative Dalzell, another high priest of protection, turned red In the face and refused to make any comment when he was questioned about the damning ' foreign towels. The chances are that the imported towelling in the ways and means committee room will give way to a domestic' product within a day or two. One 'of the republican members of the committee,' whose desire for a downward irevlslon of the tariff Is well known, chuckled audibly when a newspaper clip ping containing the above story Was shown to him. ' "Look, at the bottom of the chairs In which you are sitting," waS his message to the press table in. returning the clippings. An examination 'of theae chairs disclosed that they are labeled, tn large printed let ters, "'Vienna, Austria." 'As a matter ot fact, many of the furnishings in the ways and means committee's room are Imported. When the gypsum men were making their plea for protection on their product they called attention to the fact that the plaster used, on the walls of the committee room waa manufacured from gypsum Imported from -Nova Sootia. - Champ Clark and his democratlo . col- league - laughed gleefully when It waa brought to their attention that the advo cates of the protective policy who have been olamOrlng for a home market for American products went abroad lor their purchase in fitting out headquarters of the tariff committee of 'the house. They re called that- when, eleven years ago, Mr. Dlngley was making a speech In the' house and pointing out the advantage that would accrue to American Industry under his tariff Mil, Representative Jerry Simpson of Kansas turned the' table on the Maine Congressman by calling the attention - of the house to the fact that the lining of Mr. Dlngley' silk hat bore the mark of a London maker.
