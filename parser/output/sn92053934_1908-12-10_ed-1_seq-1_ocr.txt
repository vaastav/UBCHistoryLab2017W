Ransdell, president of the congress, and other speakers.

"The low water at this time of the year is not of course to be compared with the low water stages that are re corded in the summer months," said Observer Sherier of the United States weather observatory when asked about the river stages. "As a rule the low water in the winter months is caused by the formation of ice gorges, which act as dams and cause the river below them to quickly drain out and drop to a very low stage. As soon as the gorge breaks the river Just as quickly comes up again." Mr. Sherier is of the opinion that ice gorges up the river, possibly above Dubuque or even above Prairie du Chien, are responsi ble for the present low water. At this time of the year the Davenport office receives no report from the up-river cities, .and the local stage is the only positive information at hand. The present stage is still quite a bit above the lowest mark ever reached here, for Jan. G, 18J0rthe"5TTrge' wa registered at .8 below zero of the gauge. This zero mark was fixed in 1S64, and all of the river reckonings are based on the low water of that year. Not Much Left. There is not a great deal of water, comparatively, left in the river, and the stage has gone so low that the pilots of the ferry between Rock Is land and Davenport are nearly ready to swear there is nothing but dry land between the two cities, and to swear othervhings that would not look well In print. The boat has been having more or less difficulty, but has man aged so far to continue plying between the two landings, without mishap. The boat did try a little mountain climbing over a bar near the Daven port landing yesterday, but gave it up and went around. The" river has been falling steadily and rapidly for nearly two weeks. All I.tichtM Oat. Notice has been given that the gov ernment post lights between Ham burg, III., and Grafton, 111., on the Mis sissippi river will be lighted for the last time this season tonight.
