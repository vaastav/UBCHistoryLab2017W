gfinottatw WESTMINSTER, MD. 1 ■ 1 SATURDAY, DECEMBER 12,1885. | Cleveland’s First Message. The first annual message of President , Cleveland was presented to Congress at j noon on Tuesday, and we lay it before our ( readers this morning in a supplement. i It was the first annual message from a * Democratic President for twenty-five years, s and its coming was awaited with great in- ( --Merest hy men of all parties and by men of , r no party. For the first time in many years, * too, the message was attentively listened to f by Senators and Representatives, nearly all . of whom remained in their seats during the ] two hours occupied in its reading. Here- | toforc the reading of a President’s message j was a mere formality, and few members of ■ cither house remained until it was finished. . The change in party supremacy created an , interest in the first official promulgation of governmental policy, and the message was eagerly awaited and attentively listened to. j . President Cleveland has the faculty of j expressing himself clearly and strongly in j f graceful English. 11 is message is compre hensive, Vnd shows a complete mastery of all the details of government, while his vifcws on all subjects arc plain and straight forward. There is no shrinking from deal ing with ((uestions of paramount importance and upon which men differ. All are treated with a frankness born of conscien tious! convictions, and are handled in a manntr that is convincing. X Jmy half of the message is taken up with foreign affairs, and the details of our j % diplomatic intercourse with other govern- I monts are sot forth minutely. Besides the * information given, which should bo closely read hy everybody, the President reiterates the doctrine of non-intervention with the affairs of other governments, opposes the ! acquisition of new and distant territory, or \ the incorporation of remote interests with our own. The three chief subjects of our internal a flairs —Finance, Tariff and Civil Service- Reform—are boldly met and convincingly treated. ()n the subject of Finance he forshadows and discusses the evils of the unlimited • coinage of silver; shows how, if unchecked the country will he drained of gold, the international money; silver coin will depre values be unsettled, and boldly " i IVmllllllrll'i till' -11-]" "t fSj* '■ ■ ■ ill-1_• ■"f -iivi r lb-ll;ir ill, law pa— .-.1 in I" filial} ivi "■ - ,i "' '' m r ■ ■ "’ii- *" - Uty ■!;- ■[■■ml - i\- ill" t ai■ t that tin- ivwmn - KHBBhB r\n ■.t' ill" Ilia-'i- "f all t "I BllyM::.; ia- t h.• -11111.. 1.:. ,1 u--ii■ - 'ii in if" aini.im: . \ H i" i IV-m ili" V f"i- its -uppnrl. ill making a tv figlg; li" m 1 \ - j u- t ii* ami lairiifs- > 1 i- t ali- industries and interests that have been encouraged by the present laws should not I beLthlessly injured or destroyed; that care K should he taken that the interests of A mer- K ioaßßihiir lie jirotecteil, and recommends reduction be made in the revenue Hb from a tax upon the imported ne -111", lie I' Mill-' li' 1 if", -.ii a BL B Illle'la ■ la- "I— I-" 1..-la ..-la -I ill" Mill "I' a 1 lain I 1.11 .1 I!

The press of the country, without respect to party, have spoken of the President s message to Congress in terms of commen dation, with here and there an exception. These two or three exceptions have charac terized it as a plain businesslike document, but “lacking brilliancy of expression and novelty in suggestion.’’ This seems to partake of hypercritcism. The truth is, Mr. Cleveland is a terse and vigorous writer, much on the style of William Cobbet, for strength and cogency, and of Addison, for simplicity and perspicuity. There is no effort at fine writing or meretricious orna ment, but his style is graceful, lucid, and t-haste in diction. There are no stilted, sonorous or high-sounding sentences, such as a graduate would strive after on com mencement day, but a pure and limpid transparency, with nothing awkward or involved about it. The President writes pure English, in an easy and graceful style, such as is suited to the plain, practical de tails of business affairs with which such state papers have chiefly to deal. If he were writing a thesis to be read in some j college or university, a style more ornate 1 might be deemed more appropriate. But , the document just sent to Congress is ex actly what it should he, a clear, comprehen sive summary of the business operations of the government, with such suggestions for fresh legislation as the needs of the coun try seem to require. Exit Mahone. The Democrats of the Virginia Legisla ture have selected Hon. John W. Daniel to succeed Mahone in the I uited States Sen ate, and as they have two-thirds majority in each house Major Daniel s caucus nom ination is equivalent to an election. Major Daniel was sworn in on Monday last as a Representative of the Lynchburg district in the House of Representatives, and will : serve out his term there, which ends March 4, 1887, and will then go over to the other end of the capitol. Although but forty three years of age, he is one of the ablest men in the country, and as an orator has no superiors, if, indeed, any equals. Ihe Democrats of Virginia arc to be compli mented on the wisdom of their choice, and the party throughout the country is to be congratulated upon having so able and so eloquent an advocate and defender of Dem ocratic principles and policy in the upper house of the national legislature. The recent possibility of an interregnum has prompted Congress to consider the 1 matter, and a law will probably be passed providing against any possible vacancies in the Presidency hereafter. Tlie law will provide for the succession, after the death ' or inability of both the President and I'ice President, to fall upon the Secretary of 1 State, and then in turn to the other mem bers of the Cabinet. By a hill of this sort 1 party ascendancy would be continued throughout the presidential term, in accor dance with the popular will, as members of the Cabinet are of the same political asso ciatinii as the President, whereas the Pres ident pro tern of the Senate or the Speaker might not be. Besides, under the present law, there might not be either a President of the Senate or Speaker of the House, as has twice occurred within four years. The Maryland Democratic members of Congress held a conference at the residence of Senator Gorman last Friday night, all being present except Senator Wilson, who was not in Washington. Mr. Findlay was not invited, of course, as he has placed him self out of the Democratic party, although elected as a Democrat. It was agreed that those present would act as a unit in every thing to come before Congress affecting the interests of Baltimore and Maryland, and it was resolved that the delegation would bend all efforts to securing the necessary appro priation for the widening of the ship chan nel at Baltimore. Wind, Snow and Cold. A high wind prevailed on Friday of last week al Kansas City and Riverview, Missouri, the direction being from west and north. Much damage was done to property, aud tel graph wires were leveled in all directions. | A workman was blown from a scaffold in Kansas City and fatally injured, and in the 1 afternoon the children were dismissed from three of the public schools because of the I violence of the gale. In Riverview, Mrs. ; Peterson was struck by flying boards aud so badly injured that she died soon after. A dispatch from Rurton, Kansas, says that during the high wind a prairie fire broke out seven miles north of that place, which swept over an area of about thirty miles, destroying one thousand stacks of hay and grain and numbers of.slice]), hog and cattle sheds. The cattle ranch of Tomlin & Webb, in Indian Territory, was entirely destroyed, with from four to six hundred head of cattle. Edward Countryman was fatally burned, and Kohn Seeper and John Berry are not expected to live. At Gaylord, Kansas, James Phillips was killed and two of his sons were injured, one mortally, while trying to secure the roof of a barn during the wind storm. A blizzard set in at St. Paul on the same day, the snow being driven in blinding sheets through the streets. Four inches of snow fell at Duluth. The storm was general throughout Manitoba, Dakota, Minnesota, Eastern Mon tana and Northern Wisconsin and lowa. The great storm of wind and snow which prevailed throughout the Northwest on Thurs day and Friday of last week cleared up by Saturday morning, leaving the temperature , very low. The gale was exceptionally severe . upon the Lakes. Railroad travel at various points was interrupted by the snow. The • temperature varied from 23° above zero at Chicago to zero at St. Paul and 14° below zero I at Winnipeg. At Omaha the velocity of the | , wind was 60 miles per hour, and trains were j unable to cross the Union Pacific bridge. At Central City, Nebraska, part of a new college j building was blown down. Snow fell through- j out Canada, the depth in the Province of j Quebec being two feet on a level, and in On tario from 6 inches to 4 feet. The temperature in Chicago fell to zero at j 9 o’clock Sunday night. At Milwaukee it was ; 6° below zero. The severest snowstorm I known in Cleveland, Ohio, for several years, j raged there Sunday afternoon. A heavy storm of wind and rain, accompa- j nied by thunder and lightning, raged at Mali- i fax, Nova Scotia, during Saturday night. j Another terrible gale raged on the Lakes j during Sunday, accompanied by furious snow ( squalls. There are fears for the safety of a number of vessels which were out on Lake Michigan. A temperature of one degree be low zero was reported at Chicago on Monday o morning. Fifteen below zero was reported at = Ottawa, Canada; C below at Dubuque, Iowa; 14 below at Fargo. Dakota, and 20 below at y Winnipeg, Manitoba. A heavy snow storm set in 00 Toesday norning at Chicago, the temperature rising ibout twenty degrees. The depth of snow £ vas from six to eight inches. The storm ex- ® ended west to the Rocky Mountains, and from - Duluth to Omaha. At St. Paul the temper- | itwe was 3 degrees above zero, and a colder , _ rave jtfas expected, likely to last for several i — Cheaper Than the Cheap Johns. 0 'rom the Harford Democrat.

Tlltleu to Con gressman Carlisle. New York, Dec. 4.—Hon. Samuel J. Til den has sent the following letter to Hon. John G. Carlisle: “Gbeystoxe, Yonkers, N. Y., December 1, 1885. —Dear Mr. Carlisle: As public opin ion points to you as the Speaker of the next House of Representatives, 1 desire to submit a suggestion as to one of the public objects for which an appropriation ought to be prompt and liberal. In considering the state and management of the public revenues, the sub ject involves the questions whether we shall extinguished the surplus hy reducing the revenue ; or weather we shalll apply the surplus to payments on the public debt; or, whether we shall seize the occasion to provide for our seacoast defences, which have been long neglected. lam of the opin ion that the latter is a paramount necessity which ought to precede the reduction of the revenue, and ought also to precede an exces sive rapidity in the payment of the public debt. The property exposed to destruction in the twelve seaports —Portland, Portsmouth, Bos ton, Newport, New York, Philadelphia, Bal timore, Charleston, Savannah, New Orleans, Galveston and San Francisco —cannot be less in value than $5,000,000,000. To this must be added a vast amount of property depen dent for its use on the seaports. Nor does this statement afford a true measure of the damage which might be caused to the prop erty and business of the country by a failure to protect these seaports from hostile naval | attacks. They are the centres not only to foreign j commerce, hut of most of the internal trade ) and exchanges of domestic productions, io this state of things the machinery of trans- j portation of the whole country has become | adapted. The interruption of the currents ot j traffic by the occupation of one or more ot our principal seaports by a foreign enemy, or j the destruction of them hy bombardment, or j the holding over them the menace of destruc tion for the purpose of exacting contribution j or ransom, would inflict upon the property ! and business of the country an injury which can neither be foreseen nor measured. The elaborate and costly fortifications, which were constructed with the greatest engineering skill, are now practically useless. They are not capable of resisting the attacks of modern artillery. A still greater deficit exists in our coast de- 1 fences. The range of the best modern ar- j tillery has become so extended that our pres j ent fortifications designed to protect the har j hor of New York, where two-thirds of the im j port trade and more than one-half of the ex- j 1 port trade of the whole I nited States is car ' ried on, are too near to the great populations of New York City, Jersey City and Brooklyn j to be of any value as a protection. To provide effectual defences would be the work of years. It would take much time to j construct permanent fortifications. A small provision of the best modern guns would take several years. Neither of these works can be ; extemporized in presence of emergent danger. A million of soldiers with the best equipments, on the heights surrounding the harbor of New York, in our present state of preparation, or rather in our total want of preparation, | would he powerless to resist a small squadron of war steamers. This state of things is discreditable to our . foresight and to our prudence. The best guarantee against aggression, the best assurance that our diplomacy will he suc cessful and pacific, and that our rights and honor will he respected hy other nations is in their knowledge that we are in a situation to I vindicate our reputation and interests. Mhile 1 we may afford to be deficient in the means of : offence, we cannot afford to be defenceless. |*The notoriety of the fact that we have neglect ed the ordinary precautions ot defence invites want of consideration in our diplomacy, injus tice, arrogance and insult at the hands ot 1 foreign nations. It is now more than sixty years since we announced to the world that we should resist any attempts, from whatever quarter they might come, to make any new j colonization on any part of the American j continent; that while we should respect the status quo, we should protect the people of j the different nations inhabiting this continent from every attempt to subject them to the dominion of any European power, or to inter fere with their undisturbed exercise ot the rights of self-government. This announce ment was formerly made hy President Monroe, after consultation with Mr. Madison and Mr. | Jefferson. It was formulated by John Quincy ! i Adams. Our Government has tirmlyadhered j to the Monroe doctrine, and, even so late as ! 1865, it warned Napoleon 111 out of Mexico. ! It is impossible to foresee in the recent scram- I hie of the European powers for acquisition of colonies how soon an occasion may arise for our putting in practice the Monroe doc- j trine, ft is clear that there ought to be some relation between our assertion of that doc trine aud our preparation to maintain it. It is not intended to recommend any attempt to rival the great European Powers in the creation of a powerful navy. The changes ; which have rapidly occurred by the diminu tion of the relative resisting power of the de- | fensive armor of iron-clads and by the in creased efficiency of modern artillery, which on the whole has gained in the competition, suggest that we should not at present enter j largely into the creation of armored vessels. In the questions that beset this subject, until they shall have reached a solution, we j cau content ourselves with adding but sparing ly to our navy. But what we do add should be the very best that science and experience can indicate. This prudential view is rein forced hy the consideration that the annual 1 charge of maintaining a war vessel hears an important proportion to the original cost of construction. In constructing permanent for tifications, and providing an ample supply of the best modern artillery, the annual cost ot maintenance is inconsiderable. Nearly the whole expenditure is in the original outlay for construction. If we do not make the expen diture necessary to provide for our coast de , fences when we have a surplus, and have no need to levy new taxes, we certainly will not 1 make those expenditures when we have no lon ger a surplus in the Treasury. To leave our vast interests defenceless, in order to reduce the cost of whisky to its consumers, would be a solecism. The present time is peculiarly favorable for providing for this great national necessity too long neglected. Not only does 1 the surplus in the treasury supply ample < means to meet this great public want without laying new burdens upon the people, but the , work can now he done at a much lower cost , than has ever before been possible. The de fensive works would consist almost entirely I of steel and iron. These materials can now | J be had at an unprecedented low price. A vast supply of machinery and of labor, | called into existence hy a great vicissitude in J the steel and iron industries, offers itself to • J our service. We should have the satisfac- ' tion of knowing that, while we were availing ourselves of the supplies which would ordi- ] t narily be unattainable, we were setting in c motion important industries and giving em- r ployment to labor in a period of depression. With encouragement hy the guarantee of work, 1 j or, perhaps, by the Government itself furnish- g ing the plant, the inventive genius of our j ] people would be applied to the creation of new means aud improved machinery ; and establishments would spring into existence ' capable of supplying all of the National wants, j and rendering us completely independent of 1 j all other countries in respect to the means of National defence. 1 endeavored to impress . these ideas upon Mr. Randall the last time I 1 had the pleasure of seeing him. ? With my highest regards to Mrs. Carlisle ! 11 and yourself, 1 remain very truly yours, 0 S. J. Tildes. c Hon. J. G. Carlisle. Death of Wm. H. VanelQrhilt- The ICiehest Man in the World Hies J J Suddenly. William H. Vanderbilt dropped dead at his h residence in New York on Tuesday afternoon, c lie was in the 65th year of his age. His p death was entirely unexpected, and none of si his family were with him at the time. He t’ was conversing with Mr. Robert Garrett, of si Baltimore, when suddenly his speech became indistinct and he fell forward on his face upon g the floor, killed by the rupture of a blood 2 vessel at the base of the brain. It is the gen- ’[ eral opinion that Mr. Vanderbilt’s death will c not in any way affect the management of the tl great corporations with which he was con- a nected, and that it will have but little effect upon the stock market. Mr. Vanderbilt’s wealth was estimated as high as $200,000,000, and his income at $10,000,000 a year. He ° bad nine children, eight of whom and their k motfier survive him, and there are nineteen 11 grandchildren, “ EBLICUOVg
