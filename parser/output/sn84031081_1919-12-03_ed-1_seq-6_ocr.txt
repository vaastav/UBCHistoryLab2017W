WEDNESDAY . .DECEMBER 3. 191 THE I'KESIDEXT S MESSAGE. The message ot President Wilson to congress on its reassembling is a strong state paper, from the pesident's standpoint. He expresses his views with all of his old-time vigor. How ever much his physical strength muy he impaired, his mind has lost noth ing of its virility. The strongest point made by the president is his demand that collective bargaining shall be recognized. With out discussing the value of unions the Journal believes in them it Is dif ficult to see just how the president ex pects congress to compel the union!-1 zntion of labor. Only a comparatively small percentage of the labor of the country Is now unionized. The great! majority of lubor Is not in unions, because it prefers not to be. How is labor to be compelled to unionise, so us to make collective bar gaining possible? How is capital to be compelled to deal with tho union? If capital is to be legally bound to col lective bargaining, the unions must also be bound so they will become re sponsible for their contrai'te. Samuel (jumpers admits the logic of this con-j tention, and" he is bitterly opposed, therefore to any such program. Unless the president means that congress shall authorize compulsory arbitration and compel the unioniza tion of all labor, why does he make such suggestions in his address? There is always the matter of par tizan politics to be looked for in any utterance by Woodrow Wilson. Great as he is intellectually, he never has lost sight of advantage to his parly through his own official acts and ut terances. That was evidenced in his appeal to the country to elect all democratic candidates to the national congress in order to win the war. In his message, the president blames the industrial unrest chiefly upon fail ure of the senate to ratify the covenant of nations as he brought it from l'aris. It will be recalled that he charged the strike of the Boston, po lice to the same cause. And that he also charged the high cost of living and the race riots and about all the other evils to the obstinacy of the re publican senate. That there is a demand for a na tional budget system, we can all agree. It is a crying need, nnd was urged upon a democratic congress for eight years. The republicans may pass such n bill, or they may not. There is little disposition among congressmen to take out of their hands ability to log-roll for appropriations. That greater econ omy should be exertiised, everyone will also agree. Hut that might have com menced in the departments more than a year ago. Also the president urges reduction in taxation, but he falls to take note of the fact that on his recommenda tion the late democratic congress laid the taxes for 1920, as well as for 1919 But, notwithstanding, the president delivered a strong message to con gress, and It wa9 expressed In beauti ful and forceful language. The Jour nal, following its habit, prints the ad dress in full. ' no probability that the president will stand out against sppe'ific,reservations regarding the Monroe doctrine and our control of our domestic affairs. Certainly he will not insist that the United States endorse the Shantung agreement. The real fight In the next campaign probably will be between radicalism and the sentiment which stands for the preservation of the authority of the government as approved by ma jority of the electorate. .

'LANES. Two practical uses for aviation have already been reduced to an ey-ery-day business basis. First, for carrying the mails; second, for pa trolling forests for discovery of forest fires. The last named is the more vital, since destruction of timber lands In jures every person in the country by making building materials scarce. Every forest region should be equip ped at once with airplane observers. and should be carefully watched so that fires may be fought when they first start. An airplane could apparently be handled in ordinary forest regions by cutting landing places. Thus some fire-fighting equipment could be transported in a minimum of time, and the airplane fire-engine may be the next thing. Forest lands may yet become nearly as safe as city proper ty. If their fire hazards could thus be reduced, there would be an induce ment to raise timber. Building ma terials would become once more abundant. The airplane will be found of use in mining, engineering, Irrigation ana water-power projects In rough or des ert country. It may now take days to cross a canyon or desert with some needed article of equipment, where the airplane could do it in a few minutes. How far the plane will be used In ordinary farm country is as yet a problem. So far as can now be Judged, it will require a certain tem perament nnd ability to operate one. It looks now as if It would be a very long time before the average farmer would use it for quick transportation to his city market. But it Is never safe to set limits to the achievements of technical science-. Tho people who now look askance nt aviation may eventually seem as eccentric as those who used to be fearful of railroad trains. of a Modern Maid Maxims BY MARGUERITE MOOERS MARSHALL Once a lover wrote sonnets to his lady's eyebrows, but nowadays he knows it s the eyebrow pencil that de serves the credit.

When you have been wrangling bit terly with your husband about the League of Nations, it is comforting to find that at least you can agree with him on a subject as Important as the style of his new overcoat.

A kiss is a flying spark from love's flame. PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE IS DELIVERED TO CONGRESS (Continued from Page One) . economical lines, to improve market ing, and to make rural life more at tractive and healthful, is obvious. I THE NEXT CAMPAIGN. There Is little doubt that tho League of Nations question will be nettled before the political conven tions are held next year, therefore will not be an Issue In the presidential campaign. Of course, H IS qulto pos sible that the president will stand firmly by his position that Article X is the heart of the treaty and that to modify It would kill the wholo league feature. There is no doubt that the senate wilt stand by Its reservation. Thus a deadlock and referenco to the voters ot the nation Is a possibility. Article X reads as follows: "The members of the league under take to respect and preserve as against external aggression the territorial in tegrity and existing political independ ence of all members of the league. In case of any such aggression or in case of any threat or danger of such ag gression the council shall advise upon the moans by which this obligation shall be fulfilled." The reservation, adopted by the senate by a vote of fifty-four out of a membership then of ninety-five a clear majority of thirteen follows: "The United States assumes no offli gation to preserve the territorial in tcgrity or political independence of any other country or to interfere in controversies between nations whether members of the league or not under the provisions of Article X, or to employ the military or naval forces of the United States under ans article of the treaty for any purpose, unless in any particular case the con gross, which, under the constitution, has the sole power to declare war or authorize the employment of the mill tary or naval forces of the United States, shall by act or Joint resolution so provide," I there is a deadlock and a national campaign launched to break it, it will come from differences between the chief executive and the senate over that one point. It is not conceivable that the president will seriously object to limiting the vote of the British em ptre in the league to the same number that a United States will have. .Thore is no Hf'ftse.forJJtaJn.to ha,v i'ix yo(es fo our one. &.lso there, is 

GOING AFTER OVIt RIGHTS. The convention of advocates of Ir rigation in western states, held at Salt Lake, was a direct result of the meet ing of governors of arid states whom Governor Larrazolo asked to assemble to start effective plans for securing release of the public lands to the states. , , The irrigation representatives form ed a reclamation association with an executive committee composed of one member from each of tho thirteen states classed as arid. This associa tion Is to at once vigorously go after congress for ' an appropriation of $250,000,000 for completion of many projects in order that 17,000,000 acres of land may become available, for settlement and production for the good of the entire nation. Immediately a fund will tie raised to pay for the expense of having a delegation from the Btates go to wash lngton. to interest congressmen of tho cast in the merits of the plan. The American Legion will be askod to send delegates to co-operate with the reclamation forces In order that greater opportunity may be made for soldier settlement, to provide employ ment and homes for those who served tv,oif r-riiintrv in war. It was recom mended that in all reclamation work ex-service men should be' given pref crence. New Mexico is ably represented on this executive committee by Francis O. Tracy, the president of the Water Users' association of the pioneer gov ernment project at Carlsbad, where complete success has been achieved tinder the reclamation law. The quota this elate is asked to contribute to forward tho movement is but $2,000 which tho legislature, if need be. may well provide at the probable extra ses sion. If congress bo not willing to provide liberally for the reclamation of the now almost useless domain then the challenge from Governor Larrazolo to the federal government to redeem the lnnds or turn them over to the states that will do so. if given the areas as a basis for securing the requisite funds, will become more emphatic. Two million dollars go Into Okla homa's school fund annually as reve nue from oil lands. Let the teachers of New Mexico take hope! A begin ning has been made here with about one-twentieth of revenue from leased lands, that Oklahoma gets from roy alties, bonuses and leases, even before this state has any commercial supply of oil. Should the coal strike continue the United States fuel administrator should use that expert sawyer. Bill Hohenzollem; to some advantage if Holland would let him come over this way.

' She Thev say the new sWrts Will be short and narrow.. ' i i fte-Then' they'll match thJ In comes. i , would urge approval of the plans al ready proposed to the congress by the secretary of agriculture, to secure the essential facts required for the proper study of this question, through the proposed enlarged programs for farmi management studies and crop estl-l mates. I would urge, also, the con tinuance of federal participation In the building of good roads, under the terms of existing law and under, the direction of present agencies; the need of further action on tho part of the states and the federal government to preserve and develop our forest re sources, especially through the prao-i tlce of better forestry methods on pri vate holdings and the extension of the publicly owned forests; better sup port for country schools nnd the more definite direction of their courses of study along lines related to rural problems; and fuller provision for sanitation In rural districts and the building up of needed hospital and medical facilities In these localities. Perhaps the way might be cleared for many of tnese desirable reforms by a fresh, comprehensive Survey made of rural conditions by a conference com posed of representatives of the fnrm ers and of the agricultural agencies responsible for leadership. Political Restlessness. "I would call your attention to the widespread condition of political rest lessness In. our body politic. The causes- of this unrest, while various and complicated, are superficial rath er than deep-seated. Broadly they arise from, or are connected with the failure on the part of our government to arrive speedily at a just and per manent peace permitting return to normal conditions, from the transfu sion of radical theories from seeth ing European centers pending such delay, from heartless profiteering re sulting in the increase of the cost, of living, and lastly from the machina tions of passionate and malevolent agitators. With the return to normal conditions this unrest will rapidly dis appear. In the meantime It does much evil. It seems to me that in dealing with this situation congress should not be impatient or drastic, but should seek rather to remove the causes. It should endeavor to bring our country) back speedily to a peace basis, with ameliorated living conditions Under the minimum of restrictions upon per sonal liberty that Is consistent with our reconstruction problems. Ana it should arm the federal government with power to deal In its criminal courts with those persons who by Vio lent methods wcnld abrogate our time tested Institutions. With the free ex pression of. opinion and with the ad vocacy of orderly political change, however fundamental, there must De no interference, but toward passion and 'Hnalevolence, tending to Incite crime and Insurrection under guise of political evolution, there should be no leniency. Legislation to this end has been recommended by the attorney general and 'should be enacted. In this direct connection I would call your attention to my recommenda tions on August 8. pointing out legis lative measures which "would be ef fective in controlling and bringing down the present cost of living, which contributes so largely to this unrest. On only one of these recommenda tions has the congress acted. If the government's campaign is to be effec tive. It is necessary that the otner steps suggested should be acted on at once. would Extend Food Control. I renew and strongly urge the necessity of the extension of the ores ent food control act as to the period of time in which it shall remain in operation. The attorney-general has submitted & bill providing for an ex tension of this act for a period of six months. As it now stands It Is limited in ODeration to the period of the war and becomes inoperative upon the formal proclamation of peace, it is imperative that it should be extended at once. The department of justice has built up extensive machinery for the purpose of enforcing its provi sions; ftll of which must be abandoned upon the conclusion Of peace unless the provisions of thin act are ex tended. - ' VJDurlng this period the congress will have an opportunity to make similar, permanent provisions and regulations with regard to all goods destined for Interstate commerce and to exclude them from interstate ship ment, if the requirements of tne law are not complied with. Some such regulation is imperatively necessary. Tho abuses that nave grown up in the manipulation of prices by the wltn holding of foodstuffs. and other nec essaries of life cannot otherwise be ef fectively prevented. There Can be no doubt of either the necessity or the legitimacy of such measures. Public MuHt i nac-stand. "As I pointed out in my last mes sage, publicity can accomplish & great deal .in this campaign. The aims or the government must be clearly hrnno-ht in the attention of the con suming public, civlo organizations and state official, who are in a position tn lend, their assistance to our efforts. You have made available funds with which to carry on this campaisn, but there is no, provision in the law au thorizing their expenditure for the purpose of makmg the public fully informed about the efforts of tne gov eminent.- .Specific recommendations has been made by the attorney-gener al In this regard. J would strongly urge upon you its Immediate adoption, as It constitutes one or tne preumi nary steps to this campaign. "I also renew my recommendation that the congress pass a law regulat ing cold Storage as it is regulated, lor example,- by the laws of the state of Ne Jersey, which limit the time Our lug jfhtch koods maj,', be keyt in start age, prescribe the method of, pos ing of them-If kept beyond thet per mitted period and require that good released from storage shall in all cases bear the date of their receipt. It would materially add to the service ability of the law, for the purpose we now have In view, If it were also pre scribed that all goods released from storage for interstate shipment should have plainly marked upon each pack age the .selling or market price at which they went Into storage. By this means tho purchaser would always be able to loarn what profits stood be tween him and the producer or the wholesale dealer: Wants Prices Known. "I would also renew my recommen dation that all goods destined for In terstate commerce should in every case, where their former package makes it possible, be plainly marked with the price at which they left the nands or the producer. "We should formulate a law requir ing a federal license of all corpora tions engaged in Interstate commerce and embodying In the license, or in the conditions under which it Is to be Issued, specific regulations designed to secure competitive selling and pre vent unconscionable profits in the method of marketing. Such a law would afford a welcome opportunity to effect other much needed reforms in the business of interstate shipment and In the methods of corporations which are engaged in it; but for the moment I confine my recommenda tions to the object immediately in hand, which is to lower the cost of living. i Must Improve Labor. "No one who has observed the march of events in the last year can fail to note the absolute need of a definite program to brinj about an improvement in the. conditions of la bor. There can bo no settled condi tions leading to increased production and a reduction in the cost of living if labor and capital ate to be nntag onists instead of partners. Sound thinking and an honest desire to serve the Interests of the whole nation, as distinguished from the Interests of a class, must be applied to the solution of this great anil pressing problem The failure of other nations to con sider this matter In a vigorous way has produced bitterness and Jealousies and antagonisms, the food of radical ism. The only way to keep men from agitating against grievances Is to re move the grievances. An unwilling ness even to discuss these matters pro duces only dissatisfaction and gives comfort to the extreme elements in our country, which endeavor to stir un disturbances In order to provoke governments to embark upon a course of retaliation and repression. Tne seed of revolution is repression. The remedy for these things must not be negative In character. It must be constructive. It must comprehend the general Interest. Tho real anti dote for the .tinresj which manifests Itself is not suppression but a deep consideration of the wronss that be set our national life and the applica tion of a remedy. Must Deiti(K'rati.e Ijabor. "Congress has already shown its willingness to deal with these indus trial wrongs by establishing the eight-hour day as the standard in every field of labor. It has sought to find a way to, prevent child labor. It has served the Whole country by leadijg the way In developing the means of preserving and safeguarding lives and health In dangerous indoM tils It mt'st now help l.i the diffi cult task ot finding a method that will bring about a genuine democra tization of industry, based upon th full recognition of the right Of those who work, m whatever rank to par tlcipate In some organio way In every decision which directly affects their welfare. It is with this purpose in mind that I called conference to meet In Washington December 1 to consider these problems in all their hrosrl asnects. with the lde of bring ing about a better understanding be tween these two Interests. "The great unrest throughout the world, out of which has emerged a demand for an immediate considera tion of the differences between capita! and labor, bids us nut our own house in order. Frankly, there can be no Dermanent and lasting eettkments on tween capital and labor which do not recognize the fundamental concep' for which labor has been struggling through the years. The whole world gave its recognition and endorsement
