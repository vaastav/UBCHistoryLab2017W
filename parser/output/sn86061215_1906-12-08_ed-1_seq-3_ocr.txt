In all of the columns of the message of President Roosevelt there is no mention of the tariff except as it .re lates to the Philippine islands. This is something extraordinary, the rule of presidents for years having been to make observations of conditions and comment thereon inasmuch as they related to the tariff law in effect. President Roosevelt has heretofore done this himself. There was no little curiosity as to what the message might say on this subject, for while his letter to Con gressman Watson upon the opening of tiie campaign was in no uncertain terms and with no expression of favor tpward immediate revision, certain Washington correspondents have for months been telling the people that Soosevelt would probably favor it in ifis message. They have been persist ant in their claims upon Roosevelt as a revisionist for three or four years £nd as often- as he speaks he disap points them. They take a new lease jn life, however, in the fact that the tariff was not mentioned at all, and say that it is probable that he will make it tfye subject of a special mes sage. There may be ground for this belief, but In the matter of the ^anama canal the President refers to it in his message and informs the congress that he will give further attention to it in a special document to be placed in their hands, •r At present there is no particular reason to believe that the President has changed his views, for as his last message riscloses nothing. Us last ut terance on the question lemains in the letter to Congressman Watson. 

$TTITUDE TOWARD JAPANESE It is quite evident that the difficulty aver the Japanese in the United States is not to be ended soon. The Presi dent has been stirred to action, Cali fornia authorities have become indig nant and Japan herself is not the least interested. President Roosevelt has Indicated tirat the matter shall not be settled un til it is settled right, and not only has he expressed himself positively in this but he makes known what he believes "right" is. In this he has aroused the Californians to an unusual degree. He strikes where he believes they will feel it, and surely they ought to be affected by his statement that the $100,000 that the Japanese sent to the j?*- Diseases that have gilplalist who gives his time $£|F YOU

Throughout Japan Americans are well treated and any failure on the part of Americans at home to treat the Japanese with a like courtesy and consideration is by just so much a confession of inferiority in our civilization." if this fails there will ultimately be no alternative to a constitutional amendment. 

ELECTING SENATORS New York Tribune:—A convention to be held in Des Moines next (this) week is likely to cause renewed inter est in the question of the popular election of United States senators. On a joint resolution' passed by the Iowa legislature last winter Governor Cummins invited the governors of the various states to send delegates to Des Moinesto discuss the direct elec tion of senators and devise means to further it. The object of the conven tion is described officially as follows: "An effort to effect the crystalliza tion of public sentiment to afford an opportunity for consultation to devise plans for cooperation between the states, and, if deemed advisable, take steps to secure a permanent organiza tion for the promotion of a movement looking to the election of United States senators by direct vote of the people." The governors of thirty states have responded. If there should be any ap proach to unanimity among the dele gates, if a permanent organization should be effected to promote the di rect election of senators, if the dele gates should go home to their various states and urge an application to con gress for a constitutional convention, some important results might follow the convention. The delegates are likely to be con fronted by two plans fer bringing about direct elections—one by an amendment to the constitution, the other, without amendment, by having the senators chosen by tfce people at the state elections and .the choice sub sequently ratified by the legislatures. For the amendment of the constitu tion it is provided that on an applica tion of two-thirds of the states a con stitutional convention shall be called by congress. Thus, if all of the thirty states which have sent delegates to this Des Moines convention should, through their legislatures, request •congress to call a constitutional con vention, one must be called. To rati fy any amendment drawn up by such a convention three-fourths of the states must vote in favor of it. Since 1901 seven states—Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, Nebraska, Oregon, Iowa and Montana—have through their legis latures sent resolutions to congress asking for a convention.' In the last twenty years seventeen, other states have made similar requests to con gress. It may be doubted, however, wheth er the Des Moines convention will, if it decides, to try to do so, succeed in bringing about a joint request of two thirds of the states for an amendment. The constitution is notoriously hard to amend, and state legislatures are likely to prove indifferent to a pro posal to strip them of one of their powers. The popular election of sen ators has, moreover, only an academic interest in many of the states. One third of them have already that sys tem in effect, and will not feel con cerned about a constitutional amend ment. Nebraska, Alabama, Illinois, Michigan, Oregon, Virginia, South Car olina, Louisiana, North Carolina, Ten nessee, Wisconsin, Arkansas, Wash ington, South Dakota and Minnesota already select their senators by popu lar vote, either at general primaries or at state elections, and the constitu tional function of their legislatures is in practice restricted merely to giving effect to the popular choice. That system follows the line of least resist ance, amending the meaning rather than the words of the constitution. It also leaves the change to the popular election of senators optional with the states, instead' of making it compul sory. If states do not have the direct vote it is because public opinion is not strong enough to demand it. There are reasons for thinking that there is no great demand for a change. The average citizen will assent in an indifferent way to the statement that the legislative election of senators is not satisfactory, and there his interest ends. The change to a popular elec tion is simple, without the necessity of an elaborate constitutional conven tion, yet the growth of the movement among the states has been compari tively slow. In 1875 Nebraske started it with a provision in its constitution authorizing the voters to express their preference for senate candidates.

As this change in the method of electing sen ators is so much easier to bring about than a constitutional amendment, the Des Moines convention may confine itself to recommending its general adoption by the states. a OF INTEREST TO LOVERS. New York Globe.—Nothing is too sacred nowadays to be hauled into the limelight of the modern Forum—that is, the newspapers. Everything from the removal of superfluous hair to how to win a husband ,is discussed by high ly paid experts in the daily press. Love making of the most delicate and slop py nature is analyzed in broad day light, and directions only less frank than those of Ovid placed within reach of the humblest among us for the insignificant consideration of 1 cent. How long love making has been as sociated with winking, and why it ever was thus associated, are ques tions unanswered in dictionary or any other reference book we have been able to locate. There is nothing in herently amorous or even affectionate about the wink. A cow or a cat can wink till her eyelids are tired and no one sees anything coy in the process. But, let a young man or maiden, or any man-made thing, wink, and im agination runs riot with the hidden depths of lve thus indicated. To the student of human custortts this is a very curious phenomenon. Science, indeed, is quite at a loss when con fronted with the fact, absurb, but none the less uncontrovertible—that a flir tation without one or several winks imbedded in it somewhere lacks the true spice of adventure. Although science can not explain the eloquence of the wink, she never theless has good sense enough to ad mit the fact and order her conduct accordingly. At the Jamestown Ter centennial exposition, to be held next year in commemoration of early En glish settlement in this country, ar rangements have been made for a flirtation path," the shrubbery along either side of which will contain 1,000 winking, or so-called "skiddoo" elec tric lamps. Each of them will wink 300 times an hour. And as there are 2,000 lamps and they will be lighted five hours every day, the total per diem winks will run up to about 3,000,000. If this Niagara of roguishness, doesn't bring some of the visiting swains to time we shall miss our guess. Electricity has already conquered most fields c.f human endeavor. It looks now as if love making also is to be brought under its sway. THE BIBLE THE BEST SELLER. Des Moines Capital.—The annual re port of the American Bible society shows that the bible is still the most sought for book that is printed. Other books appear, challenge the approval of the masses for one brief hour and are then forgotten. In all languages' and dialects and tongues the demand for the Book of Books fcontinues from one year's end to another and still the demand is not supplied. Commenting upon the report of the above named society, the Louisville Courier-Journal says: "Oddly enough this, the greatest clas sic is often neglected by persons who assume the virtue of good taste in lit erature, and not a few 'smart' persons, young and old, are quite as proud of their lack of knowledge of the scrip tures as a city girl is of her profound ignorance of the things that country folks know. Without the great clas sics of the uninspired writers such persons admit that the pretender to a love of literature has nothing upon which to prop a claim, but with them the Bible is a volume to be read as religious duty, or left unread, and not a book to be read and re-read because it contains far more of the 'pictures, robes and gems of thought' than the works of William Shakespeare, the contents of which were so described by the late Colonel Ingersoll, whoso agnosticism rendered him unable to appreciate the literary value of holy writ." The New York Times, commenting upon Professor Phelps' contention that every candidate for entrance to a uni versity should be required to be fami liar with the Elglish classics, says of the Bible: "Its influence is, of course, direct and dominant over all literature its style, whether narrative, descriptive, poetical, dramatic, argumentative, or oratorical, has been the supreme mod el for the Lincolns, the Burkes, the Cokes, for the Carlyles, the Addisons, the Swifts, the Defoes, and it over shadowed Milton and Shakespeare. The product of the entire range of English literature and history may be sonsidered only as corollaries to its mighty argument. How profound must be the ultimate ignorance of these to students who have not approached them through the noble and simple master medium." In these morning hours of the twentieth century the man who scoffs at the bible presents a spectacle cal culated to excite pity rather than con tempt. It shows sensibilities deaden ed to the most patent facts in the universe. It betokens not the intel lectuality of the honest skeptic, but the prejudice of the individual who considers that his own narrow view point represents the horizon of human knowledge. The bible is to millions of souls to day what it was to the Psalmist when he said: "Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path." The permanence of its illumination in a world that would otherwise have been dark finds happy expression in the words of Cowper. "A glory gilds the sacred page, Majestic like the sun It gives a light to every age,'? $£7 It gives, uut borrows none." THE PRESIDENT AND THE TARIFF. Cedar Rapids Republican.—True to predictions frequently made in the last campaign, President Roosevelt in his message tc congress did not mention the subject of tariff revision. He did mention the subject of tariff arrange ments between the United States- and ly urging tariff concessions, if not free trade with the Philippines. This he based on the ground that the United States cannot afford to discriminate against its own possessions, but can, on me other hand, afford to favor them. But of the general subject of tariff revision there is no mention. The President's omission may be taken as another evidence of the fact that he has no desire to have the subject of general tariff revision undertaken dur ing his present term as President. The President has frequently expressed himself to that effect in semi-official conversations. He has admitted that there are inequalities in the tariff, but after any revision that might be sug gested such inequalities would, in all probabilities, still remain in the tariff. If those inequalities could be removed the President would be glad to see it done. But the undertaking is of such a precarious nature that he has not been inclined to urge it upon congress. President Roosevelt's position on this subject is one of great importance. Whatever may be his own views, he has not been induced to regard it as a wise thing to open up the subject at the present time. It will be said that he will later in the year send a special message to congress upon this subject, but that is mere conjecture. The chances are he will not do so. Every other subject that he wants considered by the present congress he has laid be fore che members with much explicit ness and at considerable length.
