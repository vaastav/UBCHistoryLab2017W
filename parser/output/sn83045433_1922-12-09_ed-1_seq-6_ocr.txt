7 ?? 1 9 \ } ? 1 1 Complete Text of President Harding's Annual Message to Congress Itambarf of tlx Cunti ? Bo many problem* are calling tor solution that a recital of all of them. In tha face of the known limitation of a abort aaaslon of Congreaa. would seem to lack sin cerity of purpose. It la four years since the world war ended, but the Inevitable readjustment of the soda] and economic order la not more than barely begun. Thar* Is no acceptance of pre-war conditions anywhere In the world. In a very general way humanity harbors individual wishes to go on with war-time compensations for production, with pre-war re quirements In expenditure. In ahort. everyone, speaking broadly craves readjustment for every body except himself, while there can be no Just and permanent rsadjurtment except when all par ticipate. The civilisation which measured Its strength of genius and the power of science and the re sources of Industries, in addition to testing the limits of man power and the endurance and heroism of men and women? that same civilization Is brought to its severest test in restoring a tranquil order and committing humanity to the stable ways of peace. 

TEST CIVILIZATION. If the sober and deliberate ap praisal of pre-war civilization makes It seem a worth-while in heritance. then with patience and courage It will be preserved, e never again will be precise ly the old order; Indeed, I know at no one who thinks It to be de alrable. For out of the old order came the war itself, and the new order, established and made se cure. never will permit Its re currence. It Is no figure of speech to say we have come to the teet of our civilization. The world has been passing ? la today passing ? through a great crista The con duct of war Itself Is not more dif ficult than the solution of the problems which necessarily follow. I am not speaking at this moment of the problem In its wider aspect of world rehabilitation or of Inter national relationship. The refer ence Is to our own social, financial, and economic problems at home. These things are not to be considered solely as problems apart from all international rela tionship. but every nation must be able to carry on for Itself, else its international relationship will have scant Importance. I U. S. FORTUNATE. Doubtless our own people have emerged from the world war tumult less Impaired than most belligerent powers; probably we have made larger progress toward reconstruction. Surely we have been fortunate In diminishing un employment, and our Industrial and business activities, which sere the lifeblood of our material ex istence. have been restored as In no other reconstruction period of like length in the history of the world. Had we escaped the coal and railway strikes, which had ?O excuse for their beginning and Jess justification for their de layed settlement, we should have done Infinitely better. But labor was Insistent on holding to the war heights, and heedless forces of reaction sought the pre-war levels, and both were wrong. In the folly of conflict our progress was hindered, and the heavy cost l?as not yet been fully estimated. There ran be neither adjustment nor the penalty of fhe failure to readjust In which all do not somehow participate. The railwav strike accentuated the difficulty of the American farmer. The first distress of re adjustment came to the farmer, and it will not be a readjustment fit to abide until he is relieved. The distress brought to the firmer do** not affect him alone. Agricultural ill fortune is a na tional ill fortune. That one fourth of our population which produce* the food of the Repub lic and adds so largely to our ex port commerce must participate In the good fortunes of the na tion. else there Is none worth retaining. AGRICULTURAL AID. Agriculture Is a vital activity In our national life. In it we had our beginning, and !ts west ward march with the star of the empire has reflected the growth ?f the Republic. It has Its vicis situdes which no legislation will prevent, Irs hardships for which no law can provide escape. But the Congress can make available to the farmer the financial facili ties which have been built up un der Government aid and super vision for other commercial and Industrial enterprises. It may be done on the same solid funda mentals and make the vitally im portant agricultural Industry more secure, and It must be done. This Congress already has taken cognizance of the misfortune which precipitate deflation brought to American agriculture. Your measures of relief and the reduc tion of the Federal reserve dis count rate undoubtedly saved the country from widespread disaster. The very proof of helpfulness al ready given Is the strongest argu ment for the permanent establish ment of widened credits, hereto fore temporarily extended through the War Finance Corporation. The Farm Loan Bureau, which aire dy has proven its useful ness through the Federal land banks, may well have its powers enlarged to provide ample farm production credits as well as en larged land credits. It is entirely practical to create a division In the Federal land banks to deal with production credits, with the limitations of time so adjusted to the farm turnover as the Federal reserve system provides for the turnover in the manufacturing and mercantile world. Special pro vision must be made for live stock production credits, and the limit of land loans may be safely enlarged. Various measures are pending before you, and the best judgment of Congress ought to be expressed In a prompt enact ment at the present sedfclon. 

FARMERS HARD HIT. But American agriculture needs more than added credit facilities. The credits will help to solve the I pnatel probtaai growing out of mrtidMid land values and tba Initio deflation of throe yean ago. but permanent and deserved ?TWlKnl goad tsrtune depend* oa bettor and'cheapsr transpor tation. Hero la aa outstanding prob lem. demanding the moat rlgorouo consideration at the Concrete and the country. It haa to do with more than agriculture. It pro vides the channel (or the flow of the country's commerce. But the farmer Is particularly hard hit. Bis market, so affected by the world consumption, doss not ad mit of the price adjustment to meet carrying charges. In the last half of the year now cloalng the railways, broken in carrying ca pacity because of motive power and rolling stock out of ordsr, though Insistently declaring to the contrary, embargoed hie ship ments or denied him cars when fortunate markets were calling. Too frequently transportation failed while perishable products were turning from possible profit to losses counted io tens of millions. I know of no problem exceed ing In Importance is this ons of transportation. In our complex and Interdependent modern life trans portation la essential to our very existence. Let us pass for the moment the menace In the pos sible paralysis of such service aa we have and note the failure, for whatever reason, to expand our transportation to meet the na tion's needs.. RAILWAY NEEDS. The census of 1830 recorded a population of 50,000.000. In two decades more we may reasonably expect to count thrice that num ber. In the three decades end ing in 1920 the country's freight by rail increased from 831,000,000 tona to 2.234.000.000 tons; that la to say, while our population waa Increasing leee than 70 per cent, the freight movement Increased over 250 per cent. We have built 40 per cent of the world's railroad mileage and yet find It Inadequate to our present requirements. When we contemplate the Inadequacy of today it Is easy to believe that the next few decades will wit ness the paralysis of our trans portation-using social scheme or a complete reorganization on some new basis. Mindful of the tremendous costs of betterments, extensions, and expansions, and mindful of the staggering debts of the world today, the difficulty Is magnified. Here Is a problem demanding wide vision and the avoidance of mere makeshifts. No matter what the errors of the past, no matter how we ac claimed construction and then condemned operations In the past, we have the transportation and the lionest Investment In the transportation which sped us on to what we are, and we face con ditions which reflect Its inade quacy today. Its greater Inade quacy tomorrow, and we contem plate transportation costs which much of the traffic can not and will not continue to Jfcy. 

LIVE IN MOTOR AGE. Manifestly, w# have need to be gin on plans to co-ordinate all transportation facilities. We should more effectively connect np our rail lines with our carriers by spa. We ought to reap some benefit from the hundreds of mil lions expended on Inland water ways. proving our capacity to utilize as well as expend. We ought to turn the motor truck Into a railway feeder and dis tributor Instead of a destroying competitor. It would be folly to ignore that we live in a motor age. The motor car reflects our standard of living and gauges the speed of our pres ent-dny life. It long ago ran down Simple Living, and never halted to Inquire about the prostrate fig ure which fell as Its victim. With full recognition of motor ear transportation we must turn It to the most practical use. It cannot supersede the railway lines, no matter how generously we afford It highways out of the publlo treasury. If freight traffic by motor were charged with Its proper and proportionate share of highway construction, we should fine much of it wasteful and more costly than like service by rail. Yet we have paralleled the rail ways, a most natural line of con struction. and thereby taken away from the agency expected service much of its profitable traffic, which the taxpayers have been providing the highways, whose cost of maintenance Is not yet realized. LOWER RATES VITAL. The Federal Government haa a right to inquire Into the wisdom of this policy, because the National Treasury Is contributing largely to this highway construction. Costly highways ought to be made to serve as feeders rather than competitors of the railroads, and the motor truck should become a co-ordinate factor In our great dis tributing system. This transportation problem can not be waived aside. The demand for lowered costs on farm products and baslo materials can not be ig nored. Rates horlsontally' In creased, to meet increased wage outlays during the war inflation, are not easily reduced. When some very moderate wage reduc tions were effected last summer there was a 5 per cent hortsontal reduction In rates. I sought at that time. In a very Informal way, to have the railway managers go before the Interstate Commerce Commission and agree to a heavier reduction on farm products and coal and other basic commodities, and leave unchanged the freight tariffs which a very large portion of the traffic was able to bear. Neither the managers nor the commission saw fit to adopt the suggestion, so we had the horizon tal reduction too slight to be felt by the higher class cargoes and too little to benefit the heavy tonnage calling most loudly for relief. Railways are not to be expected to render the most essential serv ice In our social organization without a fair return on capital Invested, but the Government has gone so far In the regulation of rates and rules of operation that it kaa the r?ponrtWHty of point In* the way to tha reduced freight ooato ao e?en Hal to our national mbn. ? Government operation doe* net afford tha oura. It ?u Govern ment 'operation which brought ua to the very older of things against which wa now rebel, and we are atlll liquidating the coata of that supreme folly. Surely the genius of tha rail way bulldera haa not become ex tinct among the railway manag ers. New economies, new efflol enclea in cooperation muat be found. The fact that labor takes 60 to (0 per cent of total rail way earnings makea limltatlona wlthm which to effect eoonomlea vary difficult, but tha demand la no leae Inaistent on that account. Clearly the managera are with out that lntercarrler, co-operative relationship ao highly essential to the beat and moat economical operation. They could not func tion in harmony when the atrlke threatened the paralysis. of all railway transportation. The re lationship of the aervlce to pub-' lie welfare, ao Intimately affected by State and Federal regulation, demanda the effective correlation and a concerted drive to meet an inaiatant and Justified public demand. SUGGESTS REMEDY. The taerger of llnea into aya tems. a facilitated interchange of freight oars, the economic use of terminala, and the consolidation of facilities are suggested ways of economy and efficiency. I remind you that Congress pro vided a Joint commission of agri cultural inquiry, which made an exhaustive inveetlgation of car aervlce and transportation, and unanimously recommended in ita report of October 15, 1921, the pooling of freight cars under a central agency. This report well deserves your aerloua considera tion. I think well of the central agency, which shall be a creation of the rallwaya themselves, to pro vide. under the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission, the means for financing equip ment for carriers which are other wise unabls to. provide their pro portion of car equipment adequate to transportation needs. This same agency ought to point the way to every possible economy in maintained equipment and the neceasjyy interchanges In railway commerce. In a previous address to the Congress, I called to your atten tion the Insufficiency of power to enforce the decisions of the Rail road Labor Board. Carriers have ignored Its decisions, on the one hand: railway workmen have chal lenged Ita declaions by a strike, on the other hand. PLEADS FOR LABOR. The intent of Congress to estab lish a tribunal to which railway labor and managers may appeal re specting questions of wages and working conditions cannot be too strongly commended. It la vitally Important that some such agency should be a guaranty against sus pended operation. The public must bs spared even the threat of discontinued service. Sponsoring the railroads as we do, it la an obligation that labor shall be assured the highest Jus tice and every proper considera tion of wage and working condl tiona, but it Is an equal obligation to see that no concerted action in forcing demands shall deprive the public of the transportation aerv lce essential to its very existence. It Is now Impossible to safeguard public Interest, because the decrees of the board ara unenforceable against either employer or em ploye. The Labor Board ltaelf Is not so constituted as best to serve the publio interest. With six partisan members on a board of nine, three partisans nominated by the em ployes and three by the railway managers, it is inevitable that the partisan viewpoint la maintained thoughout hearings and In de cisions handed down. Indeed, the few exceptions to a strictly parti san expreaalon In decisions thus far rendered have been followed by accuaatlona or betrayal of the partisan interests represented. Only the publio group of three is free to function in unbiased de cisions. Therefore the partisan membership may well be abolished, and decisions should be mads by an Impartial tribunal. FAVORS BOARD. I am well convinced that the funotlona of this tribunal could be much better carried on here In Washington. Evan war* It to be continued as a separate tribu nal. there ought to bo oontact with the Interstate Commerce Commission, which has supreme authority in the rate making to which wage cost bears an Indis soluble relationship. Theoretically, a fair and living wage must be determined quite apart from the employer's earning capacity, but in practice, in the railway aervlce, they are .inseparable. The record of advanced rates to meet In creased wages, both determined by the Government. Is proof enough. The substitution of a labor divi sion in the Interstate Commerce Commission, made up from Its membership, to hear snd decide disputes relating to wagea and working conditions which have failed of adjustment by proper committees created by the rail ways and their employee, offers a more effective plan. MORE MEMBERS. It need not be surprising that there ia dlaaatisfactlon over de layed hearings and decisions by the present board when every trivial diapute is carried to that tribunal. The law should require the ratlroada and their employes to Institute means ahd methods to negotiate between themselves their constantly arising differences, limiting appeals to the Govern ment tribunal to disputes of such character aa are likely to affect th?" public welfare. . This suggested substitution will Involve a necessary Increase in the membership of the commis sion. probably four, to constitute the labor diviaion. If the sug geetlon appeals to the Congress, it 

PRESIDENT READING MESSAGE will be well to specify that the labor division shall be constituted of representatives of the four rate-making territories. thereby assuring a tribunal conversant with the conditions which obtain in the different rate-making sec tions of the country. I wish I could bring to you the precise recommendation for the prevention of strikes whicii threaten the welfare of the ppople and menace public safety. It is an impotent civilization and an Inadequate government which lacks the genius and the courage to guard against such a menace to public welfare as we ex perienced last summer. You were aware of the Government's great concern and its futile attempt to aid In an adjustment. It will re veal the Inexcusable obstinacy which was responsible for so much distress to the country to recall now that, though all dis putes are not yet adjusted, the many settlements whioh have been made were on the terms which the Government proposed In mediation. 

DUTIES OF LABOR. Public Interest demands that ample power shall be conferred upon the labor tribunal, whether It Is the present board or the suggested substitute, to require Its rulings to be accepted by both parties to a disputed question. Let there be. no confusion about the purpose of the suggested con ferment of power to make de cisions effective. There can be no denial of constitutional rights of either railway workmen or railway managers. No man can be denied his right to labor when and how he chooaee, or cease to labor when he so elects, but, since the Government assumes to safeguard his Interests while em ployed In an eesentlal public serv ice, the security of society Itself demands his retirement from the service shall not be so timed and related as to effect the destruc tion of that service. This vitally essential public transportation service, demanding so much of brain and brawn, so much for efficiency and security, ought to offer the moat attractive working conditions and the highest of wageii paid to workmen In any employment. In essentially every branch, from track repairer to the man at the locomotive throttle, the rullroad worker Is responsible for the safety of human lives and the care of vast property. His high responsibility might well rate high his pay within the limits the traffic will bear; but the same responsibility, plus Gov ernmental protection, may justly deny him and his associates a withdrawal from service without a warning or under circumstances which involve the paralysis of necessary transportation. We have assumed so great a responsi bility In necessary regulation that we unconsciously have assumed the responsibility for maintained service; therefore, the lawful power for the enforcement of de cisions Is ?ecessary to sustain the majesty of government and to administer to the public wel fare. 

DEFENDS TARIFF. During Its longer session the present Congress enacted a new tariff law. The protection of the American standards of Uvlng de manded the Insurance It provides against the distorted conditions of ' world commerce. The framers of , the law made provision for a cer tain flexibility of customs duties, whereby it is possible to readjust i them as developing conditions may j require. The enactment has im posed a large responsibility upon the Exacutive. but that responsi bility will be discharged with a broad mindfulness of the whole business situation. The provi sion itself admits either the pos sible fallibility of rates or their unsuitableness to changing condi tions. I believe the grant of au thority may be promptly and dis creetly exercised, ever mindful of the Intent and purpose to safe guard American industrial activity, and at the same time prevent the exploitation of the American con sumer and keep opeh the paths of such liberal exchanges as do not endanger our own productivity. No one contemplates commercial aloofness nor any other aloofness contradictory to the best Ameri can traditions or loftiest human purposes. Our fortunate capacity for comparative self-containment affords the firm foundation on which to build for our own se curity, and a like foundation on which to baild for a future of in fluence and Importance in world commerce. Our trade expansion must come of capacity and of poli cies of righteousness and reason ableness In all our commercial re lations.
