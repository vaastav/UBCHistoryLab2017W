It Is known not lo bo a scIKnIi pun'"'. It Is known to hare In It no thought of taking ad vim Inge of any government In this heinl ephefe or pis;, lug its pulltlml f- rnincn for our own benefit. Ail the govern ments of America Ktand. so fir ns vte are I'oncen.ed, upon a fooling of genu ine eijuull'.y and uutjui-titioui-d lnde peodvut'e. Put te th Test In Mnieo. We have Iwin put to the tt In the case of Mexico, and have mood the text W belli T we have l iii fited Mcx co by Uie coure vte have pursued re mains to lie seen. Her fortune nrv In ber own hands. It i it ttt have at leut proved that we will not tatio advau tag of her In her distress and uuil'T take to linpoi-e upon her an order aud government of our own chooNlng. Lib erty Is often a tierce and Inimitable thing, to wbh b no hounds cun be set and to which no bounds of a fuw men's rhooaing ought ever to be set. fcvry Amcrhan who bus drunk at th true fountains of principle and tru lltluu must subscribe without reserva tion to th high do-1 line of the Vir ginia bill of rights, which lu the greut days lu which our government wtis tip whs everywhere among u accept ed aa the creed of free men. 'J'hut doc trine Is, Thut government Is or ought to be Instituted for the common bene fit, proieetlon and security of the peo ple, nation or lomuiuult) ;' Unit "of II tne various mode and form of eoverntnent, that It the best which Is , eapabl cf producing the greatest de gree of happiness and safety and 1 nxwt effectually secured against the danger of nislsdmlnlstratlon, and that hen any government shall be found lundeuat or contrary to these pur puei-s a majority of the community hath an Indubltuble, Inalienable and Indefeaxlhle right to reform, alter or abolish It In sin h manner as shsll lw Judged mist conducive to the public weal." We have unbrstiailiigly ap plied that liernto principle lo the cane of Mexico aud now hopefully await the rebirth uf the troubled republic, which had so much of w hich to purge Itself and so little simputhy frcm anj outside (juartcr In the rndlcitl but nc esary pro cs. We will aid an ! y friend Mexico, but we will not coerce her. aud our couiv w ith regaul to her ought tu I sutiicleut 'roof to all Amer ica that we seek no poiitli si susernlnt or sellmli com rol. The moral Is that the atate of Amer ica are not hostile rlvsls. but co-op era ting friends, and that their ginn ing sense of community of Interest, alike lu matters polltlcul and In mat tern economic, la likely to give them a new slgnlllcance as factors !:i interim tlounl a(Talr and in the political hi. tory of the world. It presents them as lu a Very deep and true sense a unit lu world affair. Kplrltuul partners, stauillug together I miuh thinking to getlier. quii-k wllh loiuuinu tyuipsthU-s mid eoiiiiiiou Ideals.

It Is the cmlKMliiiicnt. the eftis tual cuibiHlliuenl. of the spirit of laiv and Imlepeudeiice and lllsriy and niuttml service. A very iiolul.le Usly of men recently met III the city of Washington, at the Invitation and aa the gticut of this government. whoe delileratlons are likely lo he looked Kick to as marking a mcmornhle turning point In the hl lory of Auierba. They were repre sentative sxkfsuieii of the several Imleliendeiit slates of tills hemisphere and Were assemblil lo dbx-usa the finouclal n ud couiuiereial rol.ttlous of the repiiblb-a of the two continents which nature and political fortune bnve so intimately lliil.cd together. I earnestly recommend to your Mrusal the norts of their pro-eelliigs nnd of the actions of their committee. You will get from them. I think, a fn p'i conception of the ease and Intelligence and advantage with which Americuns of both continents may draw together In practical co-operation and of what the material foundations of this hope ful partnership of liitcret must eon sht-of how we should build them and of how nereassry it Is that we should hasten their building. There Is. I venture to point out, an espechil significance Just now attach Ing to this whole matter of drawing the Aiuerl. es together In bonds of hon orable partisanship and mutual ndviin tage becaune of the economic readjust menta which the world must Inevitably wltuess within the next generation, when ieaee shall have at last resumed Ita healthful tasks. In the jierfonn ance of thee taika I believe the Amer tfis to bo destined to play their parts together. I am Interested to fix your attention on this proeiwct now because unless you tske It within your view and permit the full slgnillciince of It to command your thought I cannot tind the right light lu which to sot forth the pnrtb ubir mutter that lies ut the very front of my whole thought ns I address ou today. 1 menu uutlonHl defense. No one who really comprehend 'be spirit of the great pie for whom w are appointed to s,Hnk can full to per ceive that their pii'-ulon Is for peine, their genius Im si displayed In the pi.ic tice of the arts of peif e. lireut deiieH racies arc ted belilgi .eiiL j ne.r do not seek or ilesire nai. ihelr thought i of Individual liberty aud of the free al or that supports lite mid the un censored IhoUL-ht that tjub kens It. Comjucst und dominion are not in our recUontng or ui cable to our pliiicl pies, I'.ut Just be uuse we dcuiuud nil inoleslctl devclopiuent and the uiiiIim tor. e.l got eriiineiit f our own ihe upon our mui piiuclples of rlubt snd liberty, we resent, from whulever tin!'lcr It may c'-ine, llu- Hi.'rcssion we oiirschcs will in I I la' lice. We InsKt upon security In prosecuting our self choM-ii hue of national development. We do inoie tl an ll.at. W e deniund It also for i tu. e do not cniine i r utbiisiiisui for 1 1 I i;.. l lilierty snd fu e national elopuieiit to the lini dents and ino eoieiitt of affairs wlib h uffi'd only ourselves. We leel II wher ever I he re Is a eoplc that tiles to walk lu these ihlll' nit paths of Inilcpcnilcic e and right. From the hist we have made common cuuse wllh all piirtlsima of liberty on this side the sea and have deemed It us Important that our m lb burs should be free from all outside domlniitbin as that we oihhcIick should be; bave set America aside us a whole fur the uses of Independent nations and political freemen. Out of such thonghls grow all our pollele.. We regard war merely as a means of u-iMcrting the rights of a peo ple agajnsi aggression Aud we are as fiercely Jealous of coercive or dicta torial power within our own nation aa of aggression from without. We will not maintain a standing army ex cept for use which are as necessary In limes of peace a In times of war, aud we shall always see to It that our military peace es'iibllnhment Is no larger thnn la actually and continuous ly needed for the use of dnya In w hich ho enemies move against us. lint we do believe lu body of fre citizens rer.dy and suftVlcnt to tk care of themselves and of the governments which they have set up to serve them. In our const lttitlons themselves we have commanded thut "the right of the cople lo keep and lear arnisslvill not be tiiftingnd," and our confidence ha been that our safety lu time of danger would lie In the rising of the nation to take care of Itself, as the farmers rose at I-cxlngtou. War Disciplined Might. But wnr tins never been a mere mat ter of men and gun. It Is a thing of disciplined might. If our citizens are ever to fight effectively Umh a sudden summon, they must know how modern lighting Is done, and w list to do when ths summon come to render themselves Immediately avail able arid linliiiillstcly effe tlve. And the government must be tlclr servant lu thi matter, must supply them with the training they need to lake cure of theuiKclvo and of it. The mllltury in in of their g'lvernni'iil. which they n III not allow t ' direct ilictu, they Inny properly ue to serve them und make Ihelr Indcpeiideii' e ei ilre, and lint th-lr own Indepeiideii' e merely, but the rights als.i if thie ith whom they have made common cause, should they nli lie put in Jeopard). They must lie tltt'-d to play the great role lu the world, and particularly In this hemisphere, for which lliey are ipiall 'Icil by prlie lp and by chasten, d am bition lo play. It Is with these ideals In mind that the plans of the department of war for more adequate national defense were on, elved which will Is- Is id Is-fcre you. nnd which I urge you to sanction .-mil put Into effect as soon us they can I' proie:ly scrutinized nnd discussed. I hey m-ciu to me the essential first steps, and they seem to me for the present sullbieut. They contemplate an Increase of the stsiiding force of the regular army from Its present strength of f,icu ottl rem and br.MwO enlisted men of nil services to a si length of 

T.I.'UI olttcors und I.'M,7i7 enlisted men, or UI.MII all told, ull services, ruuk and tile, by i be addition of llfty two companies of oast artillery, fifteen companies of en gineer, ten regiments of Infantry, four 'e.ilnieuts of field artillery nnd four icro siUudro!is, liesldes 7."o olttcers re pilred for a great variety of extra service. ewcally the all liiipoitant Inly of tniinlng the citizen foiOe of which I shall presently !cak. tC lion on'tnlssloiied olllcers fur service In trill, recruiting und the like and the uo-osnry iptotu of enlisted im"i for the ipiurtermuster corp, the hosjiltal corps, the ordnuiice depurtmelit and ither similar auxiliary services. These are the additions lie. es-;i.-y to render ho army ncle-iuale for Its present du ties, duties which It bus lo perform not only upon our own continental oasts and border and nt our Interior army posts, but ulso lu the I'hlllppliics, In the Hawaiian Islands, at tho Isth mus and lu l'ori'i l:h o. Hy way of making the country ready to ert Some part of It leal power promptly nnd upon a lin ger tile should occasion arise the plan also isiiitemplates supplementing the uriuy try a force of 4ii.v"i disciplined IU lens, raised In Increment of l.i.'!,isi a year ttuoimlcul a 'iod of three year. Tbl It Is proposed to do by a process of enlistment under which the serviceable men of the country would be usked to hind thcmsclvi- to serve with the colon for purpose of train in' for short peilo.ls throughout thro rears nnd lo come to the color at call at any lime throughout nu additional furlough" 'riil of three year. This fci'if of 4nmii men would be pro vided with personal aceniitci incut in fast as eiilisti'd iiimI their eipilpment for the field made ready to be supplied at any lime. They Would be a.eiu bled for training at stated Intervals at cfinveiilent plinc In association With suitable uiil's of the regular army. Their period of annual training would hot necessarily exceed two months In the j ear. It would depend upon the patriot!,; feeling of the younger men of the country whether they responded to si.K h it rail to service or not. It would depend upon tlie patriotic splilt of the einploveis of tlie country whelh er they mii'le It possitilc fur the young er men lii their employ to respond un der faroiuble conditions or not. I for one do not doubt the patriotic devotion either of our young mill or of those who give them employ incut those for whom iM-netit and protection they v.. ..It lu fact enlist 1 Would look forward to the success of sin li an ex periment with entire confidence. At least so much by way of prepara tion for defense seems to me to be ab solutely ImpvrutWe now. We cannot do less. The program which will be laid be fore you by the secretary cf the navy Is similarly conceived. It Involves only ii shortening cf the time within which plan long matured shall la cairbsl out, but It doc luiike definite and ex pll.lt a program wlibh bus heretofore been only Implicit, held In tlie mind of the committees on naval nflalis and disclosed In I be debates of the two houses, but nowhere fin mutated or for mally adopted It seems tu me very clear that It will tie tu the advantage of the country foe the conn res to adopt a comprehensive plan for putting the navy upon a final footing of strength and eincieney and to press tiint plan to completion within the next five year. We have always looked to tlie navy of the country aa our first and chief line of defense: we have always seen It to be our uutulfeat course of prudence to he strong on the seas. Year by year 'ww have been creating a navy which now ranks very high In deed among the navies of the tnnrltlme nations. We should now definitely de termine how we shall complete what we have begun and bow soon. Th Navy Program. The program to he laid licfore you contemplates tbo construction within five years of ten battleships, six bat tle cruisers, teu aooiit cruisers, fifty destroyers, fifteen fleet submarine, eighty-five const submarine, four gun floats, one bo-pltul ship, two iimmunl It' ll ship, two fuel oil ships nnd one repair ship. It Is proposed that of till nuuitsT we shall the first year provide fur the construction of two battleships, two battle cruiser, three scout cruiser. fifteen destroyers, live Meet submarine, twenty live coast suluuai hie, two gun boats and one hospital ship: the second csr two bait lea hip, one scout cruiser, teu destroyers, four fleet submarines, fifteen co-it submarines, nu.. gunlaait nnd one fuel oil ship: the third year two battleship, one bnttte cruiser, two .suit cruiser, live destroyer, two fbid submarine and fifteen const subuui rlnes. the fourth year two battleships, two battle cruisers, two woul irulser, ten destroyer, tun licet submarines, fifteen coast subniurlne. one smmiinl Hon ship und one fuel nil ship, ami tlie fifth year two battleships, one bat tle cruiser, two scout cruiser, ten de stroyer, two fleet submarines, fifteen const submarines, otn guiila'iit, one am munition ship and one repair ship. The secretary of tlie navy I asking also for the Immediate addition to the sr,innel cf the nnvy of 7,.i sailor, '.'.oiiii apprentice seamen and 1..VMI mi rlnes. This tin rease would be sulli clent to cure for the ships which are to Is' completed within the (Weal year 11)1? Hii'l also for tlie number of men which must tie put In training to man the ships which will Is completed early In lt'l. It I also neis-ssary that the tiimilx-r of llMh!pni"ti at the Na vnl academy nt Atinnpoll should 1st Increased by at least mm In order that the force of officer should Is- more rapidly added to, and authority Is ak ed tu appoint, for engineering dutbst only, approved graduates of engineer ing coliege, and for service In tlie avi ation corp a certain number of men taken from civil life. If this full program should be carried out we should have built or building In lb'-'I, according to th estimate of sur vivid and sUni'lmds of classltUuitiou followed by the general board of the department, an effective navy consist ing of 2", battleships of the first Hue. 0 battle cruisers, battleships of the second line, Id armored cruiser, i:i scout cruisers, 5 llrst clsss cruiser, 8 seouM (inn cruisers, lo third class cruisers, 1ns destroyer. H fleet sule murines. l.",7 coast submarine. 0 luoii Itors, 'Jii gunboats, 4 supply ships, 15 fuel ship. 4 trunsiKirt. 3 tenders to torjaslo vessels, s vessel of special ty(cs and two ammunition ships. 'Ihls would Is- u navy titled to our Heed and worthy of our traditions. Hut armies and instruments of war are only part of what has tu t con sidered If we are to consider the il preine mailer of national self sufficien cy nnd security lu all it aspei t. There ure other great matter which will be thrust upon our attention wh"ther we will or not. There t. for example, n Very pressing question of trade and shipping Involved In this great problem of national ndcipincy. It is nei-c-sury for many weighty rea sons of national eltb Icie y nnd (level ophcht that we should have n gient merchant marine. The great merchant fleet wc once used to make u rich, that great body ef sturdy sailor who Used to i any our (lag Into every sea, ami who vvciii the pride nnd often the bulwark of the iialloii, we have a, most driven out of existence by Inexcusable neglect and IndlfTcience and by a hojie lessly blind and provincial policy of so calbsl economic protection. It Is high time we repalnsl our mistake and resumed our cou uicrelul ludepcndrucc on the seas. Ships of Pcae Needed. I'or It Is n (Ueslioii of Independence. If other nation go to wur or seek lu hamper each oilier' commerce our merchants. It seems, are at their mer cy to do with u lli -y pieuse. We must use their ships nnd ue them as they determine. We have not ships enough of our own. We cannot handle our own commerce on the sea. Our Inde pendence la provim-lul, and I only on land and wllhlu our own bonier. We nre not likely to I permitted to use even the ships of other nation lu rl valty of their own nsde and are with out mean to extend our commerce even where the doors are wldo open I unci our goods deslied. Much a situa tion pot to In- endured. It Ss of capi tal importance let only thut the I hit el Mate should tie lis own carrier on the sea und enjoy the C'coiiuuiIl' lode peudeuce which only an adcipiufe men hunt marine would give If, but also that the American hemisphere as a whole should cnloy a like ludcpcnd eiice and self sulll leucy, If It Is not to Ik diawn into tbo tangle of Curo penii affairs. Without such Independ ence the whole ipiestlou of our polit ical unity and self determination Is very seriously clouded aud complicated Indeed. Moreover, we ran develop no true or ef fective A ten lean p.illev wllhmit ht of eur own-not tilr of war, but lop of peai , carrvliia iohmU anil eai rvlua inU'-li nioie; creating fi i.-nltili snd leiKlorln liiitlspeowtilr cervices tu all Intel rata on ttil stile tlie water.
