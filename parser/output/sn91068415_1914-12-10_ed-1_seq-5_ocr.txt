The victory off the Falkland Islands, where the British squadron sank the German cruisers Schamhorst, Gneisenau and Leipzig, and the success of the Indian troops on the Gulf of Persia, where they compelled the surrender ! of a Turkish army, have for the mo ment overshadowed, so far as Eng land is coHcerned, the larger events which have taken place on the con tinent of Europe. The Dresden and Nurnberg made off during the action and are being pursued. Two colliers also were captured. ! The Vice-Admiral reports that the British casualties are very few in number. Some survivors have been .rescued from the Gneisenau and the Leipzig. The sinking of the German cruis ers materially lessens the menace to British shipping, while the success of the Indian forces gives Great Britain control of the Persian Gulf and the Delta of the Tigris and Eu phrates and threatens that part of Turkey on which German railway builders have had their eyes set for many years.
