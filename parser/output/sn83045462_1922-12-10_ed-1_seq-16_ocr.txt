P. G. Harding. Efforts to have the National Asso- j elation of State Agricultural Com- : missioners go on record against the j reappointment of W. P. (1. Harding] as governor of the Kederal Reserve , Board failed yesterday at the closing session of the fifth annual meeting J of the organization. j A minority resolution of protest on the subject was presented from the j committee on resolutions, but it was withdrawn after a brief but sharp debate. The principal argument advanced against the adoption was that the commissioners should keep ?^ear of personalities. The subject of Mr. Harding's reappointment was first brought before the commissioners by Senator h Hefltn of Alabama, who has been I waging a long light against the i I former governor. : g rne association aiu go on recora 111 i favor of the appointment of a "real,} actual" farmer to the reserve board, j In approving the resolution it struck i out the generally used term "dirt" I farmer on the ground that it was un- ' dignified. } The immigration restriction law \ was approved in another resoluttion, but an amendment was urged provid- j ing that only immigrants announcing an intention to become American citizens be admitted. Legislation for widened farm credits somewhat along the line of that recommended by President Harding in his annual message to Congress was urged in still another resolus tion. which set forth that, if necessary. the farmers' credit should run for two or three years. George W. Kolner of Richmond, agricultural commissioner of Virginia, was elected president of the assooiotlnn with M .T. Hnlmhprir nf St. Paul, agricultural commissioner of Minnesota, vice president. Dr. A. W. Gilbert of Boston was re-elected sec retary and treasurer.
