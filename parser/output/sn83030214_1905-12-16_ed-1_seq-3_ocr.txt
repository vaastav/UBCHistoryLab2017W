DEBATE ov THE CANAL OUTBREAK BY TILLMAN. flic South Carolina Senator Taken in Hand by Mr. Spooner. (From The Tribune Bureau.] Washington, Dec. 15. — Senator Tillman in the f^nate to-day undertook to castigate the admin istration and the Isthmian Canal Commission, but his strictures were so interspersed with statements founded on erroneous impressions tnd rumors that the strength of those of his criticisms -which were based on fact was iJinost entirely lost through the constant ef fectual rebuttal of Republican Senators. Mr. Tillman prefaced his remarks with a gen eral characterization of the course of the pres ent administration as "imperialism" and "kai jerism." and then launched into unqualified and vn guarded criticism of the course of the Presi dent in connection with Santo Domingo, a coarse vhich he described as "trickery." This brought Senator Spooner to his feet. Mr. gjpooaer declared that "trickery" was an undig nified and improper word for any member of the Senate to apply to the President of the United States, and then proceeded to excoriate the Sen ator from South Carolina until he reduced the latter to an almost abject state of subjection. The Senator from Wisconsin vigorously de fended the course of the President with regard to Santo Doming^. He said that he was willing to admit that the Senate should not have ad journed last Spring without ratifying or reject. ing the Dominican convention, but when the Senate did that the President had pursued the only course open to him. and had conducted the affair with dignity and propriety. Having been utterly routed in his efforts to cas*. an improper reflection on the President In connection with Santo Domingo, Mr. Tillman turned to the conduct of the Isthmian Canal Commission and indulged in general criticism of its work and methods, reading at great length from newspapers of various dates. In the course of his remarks.. Mr. Tillman de clared it to be his belief that Chairman Shouts had assumed his present office with the under standing that he would resign from the presi dency of the "Clover Leaf" railway, but he had failed so to resign. He also said that he had been Informed '.hat "W. Leon Pepperman. chief of office on the Canal Commission, was asso ciated with that railway. While he was speak ing, the Senator from South Carolina received information which made it necessary for him to retract his charge against Mr. Pepperman. who is not and never has been associated with the railway named, but he persisted in his allega tion that Mr. Shonts still retained the presi dency of the "Clover Leaf." While several Re publican Senators declared their belief that this •was not the cats, no one appeared to be pre pared to state as a fact that Mr. Shonts had severed his connection with that road. Before adjournment the Senate was advised that the House had rejected the Teller resolu tion passed by the Senate, whereby it was sought to place the Panama bond issue on the lame footing as other bonds used by banks as a basis for circulation, on the ground that this was a revenue measure and must, under the Constitution, originate in the House. Without the enactment of the legislation provided for both in this resolution and the appropriation bill &£ passed by the House, the appropriation bill Itself would prove inoperative, and it is expected that pome arrangement will Be made by Sen ator Aldrich. chairman of the Finance Commit tee, and Speaker Cannon to-morrow whereby the desired end can be attained. Many members of the Senate are disposed to admit the contention of the House that the action of the Senate in passing the Teller resolution was unconstitu tional. Senator Allison, who Is in charge of the Panama Appropriation bill, obtained unanimous consent to vote on that measure before adjourn ment to-morrow. _ This, of course, means the enactment of the measure before the holiday mcefr, even though it may be necessary to send the measure to conference. The Payne resolution providing for the holiday recess fixes the date of adjournment on Decem ber 21. and of reconvening on January 4. 

ATTACKS CANAL SECRETARY. Senators Criticise the Intelligence Bureau of the Commission. TBy The Associated Press.]. Washington, Dec. 15. — In the discussion of the Panama Canal to-day. Mr. Tillman criticized the emj'loyn-.ent of Secretary Bishop a? a "press representative." and Mr. Hale joined in this censure, saving that Mr. Bishop's employment In that capacity v.as a reflection not only upon Congrv?s. but upon the press. In the discussion of Mr. Bishop's connection with the commission, Mr. Tillman said that Mr. Bishop ha<i never pone to the isthmus, and that any .S2.O«i or $3,000 clerk could perform his ■ervioes. as thai would he ample pay even for I • lass newspaper man for such service. He characterized Mr. Bishop's wtork as "a process of hypnotizing public opinion," and expressed the opinion that "people entirely innocent would reed r.o defence and would not be so worried as to esaploy a $10,000 man to defend them." Mr. Hale interrupted Mr. TUknan to call at the fact that Mr. Bishop had ex pressly disavowed any effort to manufacture puhii" opinion, hut that hf bad preferred the expression "creator of public sentiment."

CONFER ON HAZING. Mr. Moody Asked About Navy De partment's Powers of Dismissal. ■Washington, Dec. 15.— The question of "v.!i ther the Superintendent of the Naval Academy or the Secretary of the Navy, or both conjointly, have the power summarily to dis iriss from the Naval Academy without trial by court martial a midshipman guilty of hazing.' and whether such action, if taken, would "prove a bar to proceedings in the civil courts for assault or other criminal elements involved in the offence," are those which the Attorney Genera] at the request of the Secretary of the Navy will render an opinion on to-morrow. This opinion will shape the action of the Navy Department on the recommendation of Rear Admiral Sands, superintendent of the Naval Academy, for the summary dismissal of Midshipman Trenmor Coffin, Jr., for hazing, anu of Midshipman Warren A. Van Deveer for countenancing the practice. If Attorney General Moody rules that the Secretary has such power these midshipmen will be summarily dismissed from the academy. If such power is lacking their immediate trial by court martial will be ordered. Otherwise Secretary Bonaparte will direct that action be brought against the dls- The doubt in the mind of the Navy Depart ment regarding the limits of its jurisdiction arises from the apparent conflict between an act of June 23. 1874, which calls for the trial by court martial of cadets found guilty of hazing, and that of March 3. 1903. which provides that "any cadet found guilty of participating in or countenancing such practice shall be summarily dismissed." In his letter to the Attorney Gen eral the Secretary says interpretation of these statutes ''has become necessary in view of the tact that two midshipman, after investigation 'by a board of officers appointed by the superin tendent, have been found guilty of the offence of hazing." Hazing was the subject of two conferences to-day between Admiral Sands and Secretary Bonaparte. The admiral informed the Secretary that the cadet officers and cadet petty officers, at a conference which the admiral held with them several days ago, voluntarily pledged him their support in his insistence upon a strict obedience to all rules .of the academy. The opinion is expressed at the department that hazing has existed at the Naval Academy for a long time under cover. Admiral Sands re turned to Annapolis this afternoon. A search is being made for evidence against midshipmen who have hitherto been guilty of hazing, and these, as well a.s any hereafter apprehended, will be recommended tor dismissal. An immediate Congressional investigation of hazing at the Naval Academy probably will not be made a"s provided for in the resolution of Representative Loud, of Michigan. Members of the Rules Committee have agreed to delay con sideration of the resolution until they learn of Secretary Bonaparte's purposes. WANT IIAZERS PUNISHED. Parents of Kimbrough Act, in Spite of Son's Pleas. [By T»lesrar>h to The Tribune. 1 Memphis, Term.. Dec. 15. — Mr. and Mrs. A. G. Kimbrough, fatherland stepmother of the midshipman who was hazed by Annapolis upper class men, are determined to prass for the pun ishment of the hazers in spite of their son's pleas to let the case drop. Mr. and Mrs. Kimbrough arrived in Memphis to-night from Hot Springs, Ark., to consult with Representative Patterson, who appointed Midshipman Kimbrough, as to the proper pro cedure in assisting the academy authorities in the investigation of the cases of Coffin. Vander veer and the other midshipmen implicated in the hazing- of Kimbrough. •'I favor sifting the matter to the bottom and punishing the guilty parties," said Mrs. Kim brough to-nipht. She admits that the youth is pressing them to do nothing and deeply regrets the entire matter. GOVERNOR STOKES TAKES ACTION. Asks Secretary Bonaparte for Careful In vestigation in Vanderveer's Behalf. [By Telegraph to The Tribune.] Trenton, N. J.. Dec. 15. — Governor Stokes has become interested in the case of Midshipman Warren A. Vanderveer, of Mount Holly, N. J., who has been recommended for dismissal from the Naval Academy for failure to report the re cent hazing episode. The Governor this after noon sent to Secretary Bonaparte the following telegram: I have the honor to request a careful investi gation of the case of Warren A. Vanderveer, naval cadet, recommended for dismissal from the academy at Annapolis. May he not have a chance for defence? The Governor also wrote to United States r Dryden to-day, asking that he use his Influence to secure ihe midshipman a hearing, at which his defence could be put in. Representa tive Gardner, who recommended Vanderveer for appointment, has also taken up the case, and it was at his request that th<» Governor took th^ course he did. NEW- YORK DAILY TRIBUNE. SATURDAY. DECEMBER 16. 1905. COCKRAN OX INSURANCE. r0.YT7?07- BY TAXATION. Suggests That to Congress in Attack on Big Companies. [From The Tribune Rureau.l Washington, Dec. 10. -The feature of to-day's «ie >ate In the House, which was based on the ques on of committee reference of that portion of the resident's message which rrl.ites to possible fed ra] control of ! nsurnnr*e. was the long speech of epreseniativ.^ Bourko Cockran. Mr. Cockran poke Tor nearly an hour. In the course of his remarks he reviewed the re ent exposures of scandal in the management of nsurance companies, paid his respects to Paul lorton, criticised Grover Cleveland, whom he de ribed as having been "called from the *hade of Mm-eton,' !t nr] ridiculed young Hyde, who had, :e said, flaunted his wealth in the face of the pub ! "with an indiscretion not possessed by his o der partners In crime," and so had opened to the ew of the public the wanton methods by which eir savings were squandered. Mr. Cockran dwelt lf-ngth on evlla attending the accumulation of ea. fortunes and declared that the wealth of ohn D. Rockefeller w:ts a "monument to crime." Mr. Cockran was heard with attention by the cuse. There was an exceptionally large at tendance, and at the close of his remarks he was applauded on both sides of the chamber. He con tended that th« insurance section of the President's message should go to neither the Ways and Moans nor the Interstate Commerce Committee, but to a new committee, which should be created to con der this subject which, in his estimation, must be alt with by the federal government, having en rely outgrown the control of the several States. Mr. Shirley (Ky.) started the discussion. AH of the startling disclosures regarding life ln rance, he said, had been made by State agencies, md he favored emphasizing the importance of ate supervision of such affairs in preference to ational. There was, he said, a constant tendency oward concentration of authority; the States -were sing to the national government, and the national government was tending to one supreme head, and that head in power for life. 

ARGUES FOR STATE CONTROL. Mr. Grosvenor (Ohio) asked how two govern ments, State and national, could administer con trol of the same subject without one becoming supreme at the expense of the other. Mr. Sherley said there had been nothing in the New-York in surance situation so far ' that New-York was not able to handle. This defence of State sovereignty was cheered on both sides of the chamber. Mr. Crumpacker (Ind.) asserted that Mr. Payne had raised an issue in stating that the taxing power was the only control Congress had over in surance. For the House to vote to send the ques tion of Insurance to the Ways and Means Commit tee, he said, would be to give notice to the country that Congress had decided it could not control in surance. It was insisted by Mr. Mann (111.) that there was not a line in the President's message which referred to taxing insurance. He opposed reference to the Ways and Moans Committee. Mr. Cockran maintained that the power of taxa tion was a legitimate weapon for the control of the privileges of commerce. The reason the Senate was steadily increasing in power, he said, was be cause tt constantly exercised every vestige of its power. Emphasizing the relations of the Houses, he asserted that Dowers unused would decay, and that the House now possessed all the power neces sary to establish its predominancy. Mr. Cockran •aid It had been assumed that corruption and vices were inherent qualities in the insurance system, and said: The gentleman from Kentucky wants State regu letion; the gentleman from Illinois wants federal jurisdiction. I maintain the remedy can be had without either. Within my memory three large companies have accumulated $1,250,000,000, and it will not be a generation before this sum will be $5,000,000,000 or $6,000,000,000. The utter viciousness of this condition is that these funds are under the control of men who have no personal interest in them. This money Is a trust fund, and yet the persona who are the beneficiaries of the trust cannot have a word to say regarding them. This system has been the growth of but a few years, and the system must be wholly uprooted to effect a cure. MR. 

COCKRA.VS PLtAN. Mr. Cockran's remedy was to confine insurance companies to the State in which they were organ ized, as savings banks are confined. "Believe me," he declared, "there is no need of paying a salary of $150,000 a year by any Insurance company to pro tect its policyhclders, but it is necessary to get a man to swindle them." It was an awful spectacle, he said, for these men to mount the -witness stand and boldly confess their misuse of the peopled funds. "There is now the spectacle in New-York," he said, "of the District Attorney working day and night to prosecute those guilty of violating the purity of the ballot box. This ie commendable. But at the same time the insurance officers do not go to jail, but back to their offices, after their confessions. It is a de plorable confession to make, but I can assert that it would be absolutely impossible to put the pos sessor of $10,000,000 in any jail in this country." Mr. Cockran described the method of "stock gam bling" practised by insurance companies, and said that the thousands of successful instances left no record behind— lt was only of the few failures, where the companies were required to make good, that a record was made. As a proof that no spe cial skill is necessary in insurance for insurance purposes, Mr. Cockran said: We have but to look at the method by which these three companies havo undertaken "to reor ganize themselves. What is the first thing they have done? Do they go out and look for insurance experts? Not by any means. The first thing they did was to send them all away. The Equitable company has been reorganized on a somewhat i*'culiar basis. A very rich gentkmar. whom we all have the right. I suppose, to call a philanthropist— for lie himself has said it, and it is greatly to his credit— has purchased the contrcl of this company and given ja.SOO.OOft for the stuff that can pay him but jr., 500 a year. That is to say, through his philanthropy Y\p has given an earning power of $2,500,000 for $3,500. He is too good a business man to have done that as a matter of course. There is no explanation for it except philanthropy. Now. in order to appep.se the popular mind on tho philanthropic enterprise, what has he done? Has he pone to the insurance worlri to find this >. .ni« til" Grand 6750 IS NOT GENUINE WITHOUT THE WORD I ,  . .^^ mjm^^mm^mmm^mmm* I fit is always sold in bottles J like this I The Natura Cure for DYSPEPSIA and STOMACH TROUBLES The Standard Preventative for GOUT I Drink In the Morning sad at Meals talent that is worth $150,000 a year or $75,000 a year? Hy no means. He has gone outside and appointed a kind of financial vigilance committee, and no; one of tho vigilantes has ever had any thing to do with an insurance company, except that possibly one of them may have borrowed money from it. A very eminent statesman, one of the most illus trious of our time, has been called from the classic shades of Ifincoton. where he has been spending- the decline of an illustrious life in com posing philosophical contributions to the thought of the country, and placed in the chair of an in surance company wltii which, so far an I know, he haa never had the sliijhrest acquaintance what ever. Another grentieman, who may have borrowed money from an insurance company, but certainly never had anything to do with the administration of one himself, a financier of no mean distinction, is associated with him. And the third Is a jadge, an eminent Judge, a Judge whose motives nobody will ever question, but who in taking on this peculiar function of a vigilante has been compelled to disqualify himself from sitting in a great number of cases which the State of New- York had expected him to adjudicate. And in order to make effective this reform a gentleman is selected who may have be?n a good railroad man— l believe he was— and we hfive the authority of the President for it that he was an excellent Cabinet officer— tog good ; in fact, to re main — and this gentleman, who in the walks of life where he had proven his efficiency I do not believe could command over $2.~>,W>j or $20,u00 a year, gets 

SSO.OOO in a calling for which he has had no quali fication or preparation whatever. Now, that is re form as the insurance companies themselves con cede it. In the Mutual we have the very board of trustees who had themselves either been active agents of these frauds or been privy to them choosing a new head, and that selection is generally attributed to the influence of a gentleman who had leaped into a peculiar fame through magazino articles, which seem to describe him as the triumphant and successful hero of a hundred larcenies. In the New-York Life, the third, we find the vico presldent, after a vow ©f crime, after swearing on his own oath that he had purchased bonds one day and sold them the next to the same company at an advance of 2 per cent, driven out by the in dignation of tne community, followed by the adu lation of this board. And complimentary resolu tions—complimentary to his efficiency in plunder have been spread through th>> public press as ad vertisements paid for out of the funds of the pol icyhulders whom ho had rubbed. Mr. Cockran paid his respects to Mr. Perkins and Mr. MoCurdy, saying they doubtless were surprised at their own modesty. "It is time we should consider the awful effect of criminals still holding the offices they have ahused," Mr. Cockran added. Mr. Cockran, in finishing, declared Congress was bound to take action. 

HAZING TAKEN UP. Mr. Adams (Pennsylvania) called attention to the recent hazing at Annapolis and the provision for the expulsion of midshipmen engaged In hazing, and declared it was time for Congress to take ac tion to prevent the recurrence of recent disgraceful performances. Mr. Adams expressed the opinion that the Secretary of the Navy was too lenient in dealing with Cadet Meriwether. Mr. Williams, the minority leader, criticised life insurance officers In New-York, declaring that if they had not stolen, they had abused their trust, especially when they gave large campaign con tributions where the money was not their own. Mr. Burke (Pennsylvania), interrupted to ask if the courts of the State of New- York were not under the control of the political party to which Mr. Will lams belonged. This was resented by Mr. Will lams, who said It was degrading the discussion of a broad question by a partisan fling. He might make return in kind if he wished to, he continued. URGES SAVING CHILDREN. President Addresses Delegates on SoutJiern Correction School. Washington, Dec. 15.— President Roosevelt to day addressed delegates representing the South ern States, who met here to consider the estab lishment in the South of an interstate school of correction for dependent and delinquent children. The delegates gathered in response to a request from the Central Juvenile Reformatory of Georgia, and a committee consisting of Judge W. R. Hammond, chairman; the Rev. Crawford Jackson, Atlanta, Ga., and Dr. J. L. Mann, of South Carolina, was appointed to advise with Southern Governors, Senators and Representa tives regarding plans. President Roosevelt re ceived the delegates at the White House to-day. He said: About all I can say to you is to express my very hearty sympathy with and belief in your purpose. The time of my life when I was brought into closest touch with conditions sim ilar to those which you are trying to remedy was while I was Police Commissioner in New- York City At that time my closest friend and associate" in all of my work was Mr. Jacob Rlis, with whose books and writings you are all more or less familiar. I was even more impressed than I have been all along, ever since I have been grown up, with the fact that if you are going to do anything permanent for the average man you have got to begin before he is a man. The older man is al most impossible to reform. Of course, there are exceptional individuals, men who have been completely changed, not only after they have reached years of manhood, but after very ad vanced periods of life. But speaking generally the chance of success lies in working with thu boy and not with the man. That applies pecul iarly to those boys who tend to drift off into courses vvhir-h mean that, unless they are checked, they will l>o formidable additions to the criminal population when they grow older. It is eminently worth while to try to prevent those boys becoming criminals, to try to prevent their being menaces to and. expenses and sorea in society, while there is a chance of reforming them. A year ago T 'was approached by the people interested in Colorado in their Juvenile court, and th*y set an example whl<-h I wish could be followed all over the country, and particularly here in the District of Columbia. To the people of Colorado I expressed, as I express to you. my very earnest oellef in their work, and toid them that "of course, so far as my very limited powers here go. those powers will be at your disposal." I think people rather often com pletely misapprehend wh.it are really the im porfctfnt questions. The question of tho tariff, the currency, or even the regulation of railroad rates, are all subordinate to the gr«--ai basic mural movements, which mean the preservation of the individual in his <>r her relations to 'hf home, because if the homes are all straight the state will take care of itself 

CRANE ON CO2OTERCE COMMITTEE. (From The Tribune Bureau.) Washington, Dec. 1">. — An important commit tee assignment has come to Senator Crane, of Massachusetts. Senator Millard. of Nebraska, has asked the Committee on Committees to re lieve him from service on the Committee on Inter-State Commerce, and the seat so vacated has been assigned to Senator Crane. Senator Crane is a close friend and an ardent supporter of the President, and his assignment is regarded as strengthening- the forces in favor of the administration programme for railway rate legislation. It is recalled that Senator Crane was instrumental in bringing about the coal strike arbitration, and there is considerable curiosity expressed as to how radical he will prove when the committee again takes up the railway rate question. The Committee on Committees has practically completed its work, but it is not expected that tht results will be made known to the Senate until Monday, when a caucus of the Republican members probably will b« held to ratify the work at this committee.

Wishes Power to Ask Aid Under Treaty Given to Its Congress. Washington, Dec. 15.— 1t developed at a meet ing of the Senate Committee on Foreign Rela tions to-day thai.it is Santo Domingo and not the United States that is anxious to have amended the pending treaty in relation to Do minican financial affairs. The seventh article of the treaty provides that the United States, at the request of the Do minican republic, shall grant the latter such assistance as the United States may deem proper to restore credit, preserve order, increase the efficiency of the civil administration and advance the material progress and welfare of the Dominican Republic. This article is con strued to give the United States authority to send warships to the ports of the republic to enforce the terms of the treaty and put down any disorders that might threaten the smooth operation of the convention. Secretary Root was before the Senate Com mittee to-day and testified that the Dominican people desired to have the treaty amended to provide that such assistance may be called for by the Congress of Santo Domingo. Under the present phraseology it appears that the author ity to call on the United States rests with the President of Santo Domingo. Opposition to the placing of such great powers in the hands of President Morales has been manifested in the republic. It is said by the Dominican oppo nents to the present treaty that if put into op eration in its present form Morales could hold the presidency forever and that his heirs would take it in succession. Secretary Root gave the committee no light on this feature of the demand for the amend ment, merely ascribing the request to a desire : on the part of the Dominican people to make a change In that portion affecting internal affairs ' In Santo Domingo. No action was taken con- i cerning the treaty, as consent has been granted i to the committee to sit in sessions of Congress. Secretary Root will have a further hearing. j Most of the time to-day was occupied by Sec- I retary Root in completing his report in relation j to the reorganization of the consular service.
