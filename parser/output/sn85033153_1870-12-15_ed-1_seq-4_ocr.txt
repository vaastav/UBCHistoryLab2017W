A year of peace and general prosper! tj to this nation has passed since the last assembling of Congress. We have, through a kind Providence, been blessed with abundant crops and have been spar ed from complications and war with foreign nations. In our midst compara tive harmony has been restored. It is to be regretted, however, that a free ex ercise of the elective franchise has by violence and intimidation been denied te citizens in exceptional cases in sever al of the States lately in rebellion, faud the verdict of the people has thereby been reversed. The States of Virginia, Mississippi and Texas have been restor ed to representation in our national councils; Georgia, now the only State without representation, may confidently be expected to take her place there also at the beginning of the new year, and then let us hope will be completed the work ot reconstruction. With sn acquiescence on the part of the whole people in the national obliga tion to pay the public debt, created as the price of our Union, the pensions to ourdisabled soldiers and sailors, and their widows and orphans, and in the changes of the Constitution which have been made necessary by the great rebel lion, there is no reason why we should not advance in material prosperity and happiness as no other nation ever did, after so protracted and devastating a war. THF. WAR 'IN 

FRANCE. Soon after the existing war broke out in Europe, the protection of the United States Minister ir. Paris was invoked in favor of the North Germans domiciled in French territory. Instructions were is sued to grant the protection. This has teen followed by an extension of Ameri can protection to citizens of Saxony, Hesse and Sax Coburg, Gotha, Colum bia, Portugal, Uruguay, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Chili, Paraguay and Venezuela in Paris. The charge was an enormous one requiring constant and se vere labor as well as the cxerchse cf patience prudence and good judgment. It has been performed to the entire sat isfaction of this government, and, as I am officially informed, equally so to the satisfaction of the government of North Germany. As soon as I learned t.tat a republic had been proclaimed at Paris, and that the people of France had acqutseoj in the change, the Mini-ter of the United Sta res was directed by telegraph to re cognize it, and tender my congratulations and those of the people of the United States. The re-establishment in France of a system of government disconnected with the dynastic traditions of Europe, appeared to be a proper subject for the felicitation ot Americans. Should the present struggle result in attaching the hearts of the French to our simpler forms of representative government, it will he a subject of still further sati-fac tion to our people. While we make no effort to impose our institutions upon the inhabitants of other countries, and while we adhere to our traditional neutrality in civil interests elsewhere, we cannot be indifferent to the spread of American political ideas in a great an 1 highly civ ilized country like France. We were asked by the new government to use our good offices jointly with those of the European powers in the interest of peace. An-vver was made that the es tablished policy and (he true interests of the Unit ’d States forbade them to inter fere in European questions jointly with European powers. J ascertained infor mally and • noffiei ally timt the govern ernmeur of North Ger many was not tin. u disposed tu listen to such representations from any powers, and though earnestly wishing to see the blessings of peace re stored to the belligerents, with all of whom the United States are on terms ot friendship, I declined on the part of this government to take a step which could only result in injury to our true interests, without advancing the object for which our intervention was invoked. Should the time come when the action of the United States can hasten the re turn of peace by a single hour, that ac tion will be heaitily taken. THE 

NEUTRALITY - PROCLAMATION. I deemed it prudent, in view of the number of persons of German and French birth living in the United States, to issue, soon after official notice of a state of war had been received from both bel ligerents, a proclamation defining the duties of the United States as a neutral, and tne obligations of persons residing within their territory, to observe their laws and the laws of nations. This pro clamation was followed by others, as cir cumstances seemed to call for them. The people, thus acquainted in advance of tlicit duties and obligations, have assisted in preventing violations of the neutrality of the United States. CUBA. It is not understood that (he condi tion of the insurrection in Cuba has materially changed since the close of the last session of Congress. In an early stage of the contest, the authorities of Spain inaugurated a system cf arbitrary arrests, of close confinement, of military trial and execution of persons suspected of complicity with the insurgents, and of summary embargo of their properties, and requisition of their revenues by executive warrant. Such proceedings, so far as they affected the orsons or property of citizens of the United States, wore in violation of the provisions of the treaty of 1795, between the United States and Spain. 11 .'presentations of injuries resulting to several persons claiming to be citizens of the United States, by reasons of such violations, were msde to the Spanish government. From April. 1869, to .June Ja-t, the Spanish Minister at Washington had been clothed with a limited power to act in redressing such wrongs. That power was found to be withdrawn, in view, it was said, of the warlike situation in which the island of Cuba thou was, which, however, did rot load to a revo cation or suspension of the extraordinary and arbitrary functions exercised by the executive power in Cuba, and we were obliged to make our complaint at Mad rid. In the negotiations thus opened and still pending there, the United States only claimed that for the future the rights secured to their citizens by trea.y should be respected in Cuba, and that as to the past a joint tribunal should be established in the United States, with full jurisdiction over all such claims. Before such an impartial tribunal each claimant would be required to prove his case. On the other hand, Spain would be at liberty to traverse every material fact, and thus complete equity would he done. A case which at one time threat ened to seriously affect the relations be tween the United States and Spain has already been disposed of in this way. The claim of the Col. Lloyd AspinTall, for the illegal seizure and detention ol that vessel was referred to arbitration by mutual consent, and has resulted in an award to th>* United States for tlie own era of the same of SIS 702,50 in gold. Another and long pending claim of like nature, that of the whaleship Canada, been disposed of by fried!}* arbiua- tion during the present year. It was referred bjr the joint consent of Brazil and the United States to the decision of Sir Edward Thornton, her esty’s Minister at Washington, who kindly undertook the laborious task of examining the voluminous mass of cor respondence and testimony submitted by the two governments, and awarded to the United States the sum of $100,700,- 09 in gold which has since been paid by the imperial government. These recent examples show that the mode which the United States have proposed to Spain for adjusting the pending claims is just and feasible, and that it may be agreed to by either nation without dishonor. - It is to be hoped that this moderate demand may be acceded to by Spain without further delay. Should the pend ing negotiations unfortunately and un expectedly be without result, it will then become my duty to communicate that fact to Congress and invite its action ca the subject. 

SPAIN AND THE SOUTH AMERICAN RE PUBLICS. The long deferred peace conference be tween Spain and the allied South Ameri can republics has been inaugurated in Washington, under the auspices of the United States, pursuant to the recom mendation contained in the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 17th of December, ISC6. The Executive Department of the Government offered its friendly offices for the promotion of peace and harmony between Spain and the allied republics. Hesitations and obstacles occurred to the acceptance of the offer. Ultimately, however, a con ference was arranged and was opem 1 in this city on the 29th of October just, at which I authorized the Secretary of State to preside. It was attended by the Ministers of Spain, Peru, Chili and Ecuador. In consequence of the absence of a representative from Bolivia, the conference was adjourned until the at tendance of a plenipotentiary from that republic could be secured, or other measures could be adopted toward com passing its object. The allied and other republics of Span ish origin on this continent may see in this fact anew proof of our sincere in interest in their welfare; of our desire to see them blessed with good govern ments capable of mantaining order and preserving their respective territorial in tegrity, and of our sincere wish to extend our own commercial and social relations with them. The time is probably not far distant when, in the course of natur al events, the European policical con nection with this continent will cease. Our policy should be shaped in view of this probability, so as to ally the com mercial interests of the Spanish Ameri can States all the pre-eminence and all the advantage which Mr. Monroe, Mr. Alatus and Mr. Clay contemplated when they proposed to join the Congress of Panama. SAN 

DOMINGO. During the last session of Congress, a treaty for the anexation of the Republic of San Domingo to the United States failed to receive the requisite two-thirds vote of the Senate. L was tnoroughly convinced then that the best interests of the country, commercially and materal ly. demanded its ratification. Time lias only confirmed me in this view. I now firmly believe that the moment it is known that the United States have en tirely abandoned the project of accept ing as a part of its territory the inland of San Domingo, a free port wii! be nego tiated tor by European nations, in the Bay of Samaria. A large commercial city will spring up, to which we will be tributary, without receiving correspon ding benefits. The government of San Domingo has voluntarily sought this an nexation. It is a weak power, number ing probably less than one hundred and twenty thousand souls, and yet possess ing one ot the richest localities under the sun, capable ot supporting a population of 10,000.000 of people in luxury. The people of San Domingo are not capable ot maintaining themselves in their pres ent condition, and must look for outside support. They yearn for the protection of our free institutions and laws, our progress and civilization. Shall we refuse them ? The acquisition of San Domingo is de sirable because of its geographical posi tion. It commands the entrance to the Caribbean Sea and the Isthmus transit of commerce. It possesses the richest soil, the best and most capacious har bors, the most salubrious climate, and the most valuable products of the forest, mines and soil of any of the West India Islands. Its possession by the United States will in a few years jiuild up a coastwise commerce of immense magni tude, which will go far toward restoring to the United States our lost merchant marine. It will give to us those articles which we consume greatly and do not produce, thus equalizing our exports and imposts. In case of a foreign war, it will give us command of all the islands referred to, and thus prevent an enemy from again possessing himself as a ren dezvous upon our coast. At present, our coast trade between the States bor dering on the Atlantic and those bor dering on the Gulf of Mexico, is by tho Bahamas and the Antilles. Twice we must, as it were, pass through foreign countries to get by from Georgia to the east coast of Florida. San Domingo, with a stable government, under which her immense resources can be developed will give remunerative wages to 10,000 laborers not now unen the island. This labor will take advantage of every availa ble means of transportation to abandon the adjacent islands and seek the bless ings of its freedom, as a sequence each inhabitant would receive the reward of his own labor. Forto Rico and Cuba will have toaboli-h slavery as a measure of self-presesvation to retain their labor ers. San Domingo will become a large consumer of the. products of our North ern farms and manufactories. The cheap rates at which her citizens can be furnish ed with food, tools, land and machinery, will make it necessary that the contigu ous islands should have the same advan tages, in order to compete with the pro duction of sugar, coffee, tobacco, tropical fruits, etc. This will "open to us a wider market for cur products. The produc tion of our supply of these articles w ill cut off more than one hundred millions of our imports, besides largely increasing our exports. With such a picture it is easy to see how our large debt abroad is ultimately to bo extinguished. With a balance ©{'trade against us, including the interest of bonds held by foreigners, and money shipment to the citizens traveling in foreign lands, equal to theentire yield of precious metals in this country, it is not so easy to see how this result is to bo otherwise accomplished. The acquisi tion of San Domingo is an adhesion to the Monroe doctrine; it is a measure of national protection ; il is asserting our just chiiiu to a controlling influence over the great commercial traffic soon to flow from east to west by the way of the Isthmus of Darien ; it is to build up our merchant marine ; it is to furnish new markets for the products of our farms, shops and manufactories; it is to make slavery uusupportable in Cuba and Forto Rico at once and ultimately so in Brazil; it is to settle the unhappy condition of Cuba, and end an exterminating conflict; it is to provide honest means of paying our honest debts, without overtaxing the people it is to furnish our citizens with the necessaries of every day life at cheap er rates than ever before ; and it is in fine, a rapid stride towards that greatness which the intelligence, industry and en terprise of the citizens of the United States entitle this country to assume among nations. In view ef the impor tance of this question, I earnestly urge upon Congress early action expressive of its views as to the best means of acquir ing Saa Domingo. My suggestion ie that by a joint resolution ol the two houses of Congress the Executive be authorized to appoint a Commission to negotiate for a treaty with the authori ties of San Domingo for the acquisition of that island, and that an appropriation be made to defray the expenses of such commission. The question may then be determined by the action of the two houses of Congress upon a resolution of annexation, as in the case of the acquisi tion of Texas. So convinced am lof all the advantages to flow from the acquisi tion of San Domingo, and of thegreat dis advantages—l might almost say calami ties—-to flow from its non-acquisition, that -I believe the subject has only to be in vestigated to Ije approved. THE MEXICAN FREE PORTS. It is to be regretted that our represen tatives in regard to the injurious effects, especially upon the revenue of the United States, of the policy of the Mexican Gov eminent in exempting from import duties a large tract of territory on our borders, have not only been fruitless, but that it is even proposed in that country to extend the limits within which the privilege adverted to has hitherto been enjoyed. The expediency of taking into your serious Consideration the proper means for countervailing the policy refer red to, will, it is presumed, engage your earnest attention. CENTRAL AMERICA, It is the obvious interest, especially of neighboring nations, to provide against injury to those who may have com mitted high crimes within their borders, and who may have sought refuge abroad. For this purpose extradition treaties have been concluded with several of the Cen tral American Republics, and others are in progress. VENEZUELA. The sense of Congress is desired, as early as may be convenient, upon the proceedings of the Commission on Claims against Venezuela, as communicated in the messages of March 4th. 1869, March Ist, 1870 and March 31st, 1870. It has not been deemed advisable to distribute any of the money which has been receiv ed from that government until Congress shall have acted upon the subject. THE CHINESE MASSACRE. The massacres of French and Russian residents at Tien-Tsin under circumstan ces of great barbarity were supposed by some to have been premeditated, and to indicate a purpose among the populace to exterminate foreigners in the Chinese empire. The evidence fails to establish such a supposition, but shows a complic ity by the local authorities and the mob. The government at Pekin, however, seems to have been disposed to fulfill its treaty obligations, so far as it was able to do so. Unfortunately the news of the war between the German States and France reached China soon after the massacre. It would appear that the pop ular mind becaate possessed with the idea that this contest, extending to Chi nese waters, would neutralize the Chris tian influence and power, and that the time Was coming when the superstitious mass might expel all foreigners and re store mandarin influence. _ Anticipating trouble from this cause, I invited France and North Germany to make an author ized suspension of hostilities in the East, were they were temporarily suspended by act of tlie commanders, to act together for the future protection in China of the lives and property of Americans and Eu ropeans. 

TREATY WITH ENGLAND. Since the adjournment of Congress, the ratification of the treaty wiih Great Britain lor abolishing the mixed courts for the suppression of the slave trade, have been exchanged. It is believed that the slave trade is now confined to the eastern c.>ast of Africa, whence the slaves are taken to Arabian markets. The ratification of the neutralization convention between Great Britain and the United States have also been ex changed during the recess, and thus a long-standing dispute between the two governments has been settled in accord ance with the principles always contend ed for by the United States. THE BRITISH BOUNDARY LINE. In April last, while engaged in locating a military reservation near Pembina, a corps of en p mers discovered that the commonly aeived boundary line be tween the United States and the BritUh possessions at that place, is about fifty seYcn hundred feet south of the true po sition of the zenith parallel, and that the line when run on what is now sup posed to be the true position ol that par allel, would leave the fort of the Hud son’s Bay Company at Pembina within the territory of the United States. This information being communicated to the British government, 1 was requested to consent, aud'l did consent, that the Brit ish occupation of the fort of the Hud son’s Bay Cos. should continue fur the present I deem it important, however, that this part of the boundary lines should be definitely fixed by a joint com mission of the governments, and submit herewith estimates of the expense of such a commission on the part of the United States, and recommend an ap propriation for that purpose. The land boundary is already fixed and marked from the summit of the llucky Mountains to the Georgian Bay. It should now be in like manner marked from the Lake of the Woods to the sum mit of the Hooky Mountains. THE 

ALABAMA CLAIMS. I regret to say that no conclusion has been reached for the adjustment of the claims against Great Britain, growing out of th-; course adopted by that govern ment during the rebellion. 'I he cabinet of London, so tar as its views have been expressed, does not appear to be willing to concede that her Majesty’s govern ment was guilty of negligence, or did or permitted any act during the war by which the United States has just cause ol complaint. Our firm and unalterable convictions are directly the reverse. 1, therefore, reccommend to Congress to authorize the appointment of a Commis sion to take proof of the amounts and the ownership, and press their claims on the notice of the representatives of her M agosty at Washington, and that au thority be given for the settlement of those claims by tbo United States, so that the government shall have the ownership of the private claims as well as the responsible control of all the de mands against Great Britain. It cannot be necessary to add that whenever her Majesty’s government shah entertain a desire for a full and friendly adjustment of these claims, the United States will enter upon their con sideration with an earnest desire lor a conclusion consistent with the honor and dignity of both nations. THE FISHING QUESTION. The course pursued by the Canadian authorities toward the fishermen of the United States during the past season has not been marked by a friendly feeling. By tno first article ot the convention of 1818 between Great Britaii and the United States, it was agreed that the inhabitants of the United States should have forever, in common with British subjects, the right of taking fish in cer tain waters thereiq cleaned. Iq the waters not included in the limits named in the Convention, within three miles ot ports of the British coast, it has been the custom for many years to give intrud ing fishermen of the United States a reasonable warning of the violation of the technical rights of Great Britain. The Imperial government is understood to have delegated the whole or a share of its jurisdiction or control of these inshore fishery grounds to the Colonial authority, known as the Dominion of Canada, and this semi-independent but irresponsible agent has exercised the delegated powers in an unfriendly way. Vessels have been seized without notice cr warning in vio lation of the custom previously prevail ing, and have been taken into the coloni al ports, their voyages broken up and the vessels condemned. There is reason to believe that this unfriendly and vexa tious treatment was designed to bear harshly upon the hardy fishermen of the United States, with a view of political effect on this government. The statutes of the Dominion of Canada assume a still broader and more untenable juris diction over the vessels of the United States. They authorize officers and per sons to bring vessels hovering within three marine miles of any of the coasts, bays, creeks or harbors of Canada, into port, to search the cargo, to examine the master, on oath, touching the cargo and voyage, and to inflict upon him a heavy pecuniary penalty if true answers are not given, and if such a vessel is found pre paring to fish within three marine miles of any' such coasts,bays, creeks or harbors without a license, or after the expiration of the period named in the last license granted to it, they provide that the ves sel, with her tackle, etc., etc., shall be forfeited. It is not known that any con demnations have been made under this statute. Should the authorities of Cana da attempt to enforce it,it will become my duty to take such steps as maybe neces sary to protect the rights of citizens of the United States. It has been claimed by her Majesty’s officers that the fishing vessels of <he United States have no right to enter the open ports of the British possessions in North America, except for the purposes of shelter and repairing damages, of purchasing wood and obtain ing water; that they have no right to enter at the British custom house, or to trade, except for the purchase of wood and water, and that they must depart within 24 hours after notice to leave. It is not known that any seizure of a fi-hing vessel carrying the flag of the United States has been made under t'njs claim. So far as the claim is founded on the al leged construction of the Convention of Isis, it cannot be acquiesced in by the United States. It is hoped that it will not he insisted on by Her Majesty’s Gov ernment. During the conference which preceded the negotiation of the Conven tion of the British Commissioners proposed to expressly exclude the fisher men of the United Stapes from the priv ilege of carrying on trade with any ot’llis Biitanic Majesty’s subjects residing with in the limits assigned for their u>c. and also that it should not be lawful for the vessels of the United States engaged in such fishery to have on board any goods, wares or merchandise whatever, except such r.s may be necessary for the prosecu tion of their voyages ta and from said fishing grounds, and any vessel of the United States, which shall contravene this regulation, may he seized, condemn ed and confiscated, with her cargo. This proposition, which is identical with the construction now put upon the language of the. convention, was emphatically re jected by the American Commissioner, and thempon was abandoned by the British Plenipotentiaries, and article one, as it stands in the convention, was sub stituted. If, however, it be said that this claim is founded on provincial or colonial statutes, and not upon the con vention, this government can not but re gard them as unfriendly, and in contra vention of the spirit, it not of the letter of the treaty, for the faithful execution of which the imperial government is alone responsible. Anticipating that sn at tempt may possibly be made by the Canadian authorities in the coming sea s n to repeat their unneigborly acts to ward our fishermen, I recommend you to confer upon the Executive the power to suspend, by proclamation, the opera tion of the laws authorizing the transit of goods, wares and merchandise in bond across the territory of the United Statso to Canada ; and further, should such an extreme measure become necessary, to suspend the operation of any law where by the vessels of the Dominion of Cana da sre permitted to enter the waters of the United States. MAVIGATION*OF THE BT. LAWRENCE. A like nnfriondl3 r disposition has been manifested on ilit part of Canada in the maintenance of a claim of a right to exclude the citizens of the United States from navigation of the St. Lawrence, This river con stitutes a natural outlet to the oceau for eight States, with an aggregate population of seventeen million six hundred thousand inhabitants, and with an ag gregate tonnage of 6ti 1,357 tons,upon the waters which discharge into it. The foreign commerce of their ports on these waters is c pen to the British eti tion and the major part of it is done in British bot toms. If the American seamen be excluded from th.s natural avenue to the ocean, the Monopoly of the di rect commerce of the lake ports with the Atlantic would he in foreign hands, their vessels on the trans At lan tic voyages having an access to our lake ports, which would bo denied to American vessels on simi lar voyages. To state such a proposition is to refute its justice. Duriugthc administration of John Quincy Adams, Mr.' Clay unquestionably demonstrated the natural right of the citizens of the United States to the navigation ol the river, claiming that the act of the Congress of Vienna in opening the Rhine and other rivers to all nations, showed tlie judgement of European justice and statesmen, that the inhabitants of a country through which a navigable river passes have a natural right to enjoy the navigation of that river, to and Into the sea, even though passing thro* the territory of another power. This right does not exclude the co-equal right of the sovereign possessing the territory' through which tlie river debouches into the sea, to make such regulations relative to the pol icy of the navigation as may be reasonably necessary. But those regulations should be framed in a liberal spirit of comity, and should impose no needless bur dens upon the commerce which has the right to trans fer it. It has been found in practice more advantageous to arrange these regulations by mutual agreement. The United States are ready to make any reasonable arrangements as to the navigation of the fed. Lawrence which may be suggested Croat Britain. If the claim made by Mr. Clay was just w hen the population ot the States bordering on the shores of the lakes was only 3,4UU,O<H), it now derives greater force and equity from the increased population, wealth, production and tonnage of the Slates on the Canadian frontier. Since. Mr. Clay advanced his argument in behalf of our right, the principles for w hich he contended have been frequently and by various nations recognized by law or by treaty, and have been extended to several other great rive.s. By the treaty concluded at May ence in 1031, the Rhine was declared Iree from the point where it is lirst navagableiiito the sen. By tho convention between Spain and Portugal, concluded,in 1£35 the navigation of the throughout u> whole extent was made free for the subjects of both crowns, iu 1353 the Argentine Confederation, by treaty, threw open the liec navigation of the Parana Uruguay to the merchant vessels of all nations. In 185’j ihe Crimean war was closed by a treaty w hich provided lor the free navigation of the Danube. In Ibo3 Bolivia, by treaty, declared it regarded the rivers Amazon and La Plata, iu accordance with fixed prin ciples of national law, as highways or channels open ed by nature for the commerce ol all nations, Iu ISS'J the Paraguay was made free by treaty, and in December, 1306, the Emperor of Brazil, by imper ial degree, declared tiie Amazon to be open to the frontier of Brazil to the merchant ships of all nations. The greatest living British authority on this sub ject, while asserting the abstract right of the British claim, says it seems difficult to deny tdat Great Brit ain may ground her refusal upon strict law. But it is equally difficult to deny, first, that in so doing she exercises harshly an extreme ami hard law ; second, that her conduct with respect to the navigation of the St. Lawrence is in glaring and discreditable inconsis tency with her conduct with respect to the navigation of the Mississippi on the ground that she <posesses a small domain ir which the Mississippi took its rise. She insisted on tha right to mivigare r Jbe entire vol ume of its waters* on the ground that she posesses both banks ol the St. Lawreiite wlfttelVdGenibofich cs itself into the sea. fche denies iA thtbUpßedStates the right of navigation, though cqtt half the waters of Lakes Ontario, Erie, Huron aim’Superior and the whole of lake Michigan, through which the river flows, are tlie property of the United States. The whole nation is interested in securing cheap transportation from the agricultural States of the West to the Atlantic seaboard. To the citizens of those States it secures a greater return for their la bor. To the inhabitants of the seaboard it offers cheaper food : to the nation an increase in tliesncnr-J surplus ol wealth. Ir is hoped th. t the Government of Great Britain will see the justice of abandoning the narrow’ and Inconsistent claim to which her Canadian provinces have urged her adherence. OCEAN NAVIGATION. Our depressed commerce is a subject to which 1 called your special attention at the last session and suggested that we will in the future have to look more to the countries south of us, and to China and Japan, fur its revival. Onr representative* to all these Governments have ©Edited tlieir iuflutnc* to encourage trade t ©tween the United States and the countries to which they are accredited; but the fact exists that the carrying is done almost entirely in foreign bottoms; and while this state of affairs exists we cannot control our due share of the commerce of the word. That between the Pacific States and China and Japan is about all the carrying trade now conducted in American ves sels. I would recommend a liberal policy toward that line of American steamers; oue that will insure its success and even increased usefulness. of building iron vessels, the only ones that cau compete with foreign ships in the carrying trade, is so much greater in the United States than tin foreign countries, that, without some assistance from the Government, they cannot be successfully built here. There will be several propositions laid before Congress in the course of the present session looking to a remedy for this evil. Even if it should be at some cost to the National Treasury, I hope sacb encouragement will be given as will secure American shipping on the high seas, and American ship-build ing at home. 

BUILDING FOB DBPABTVKNT OF STATE. The condition of the archives at the Department of State calls for the early action of Congress. The building now rented by the Department is a frail structure at best, at an inconvenient distance from the Executive Mansion and from the other Depart ments, It is ill-adopted to the purpose for which it is used, has not capacity to aacommodate the archives and is not fire-proof. Its remote situation, its slen der construction, and the absence of a supply of wa ter in the neighborhood, leaves but little hope of safety for either buildeng or its contents in case of the accident of a fire. Its destruction would involve the loss of the rolls containing the origioual acts and resolutions of Congress, of the historic records of the revolution of the confederation of the whole series of diplomatic ami consular archives since the adop tion of the Constitution, and of the many other valu able records and papers left with that department when it wsw the principal depository of the Govern ment archives. I recommend an appropriation for the construction of a building for the Department of State. DEPARTMENT POWERS AND DOTIES. I recommend to your reconsideration the propriety of? transfer ring to the Department of the interior, to which they seem more appropriately to belting, all powers and duties in relation to the territories with which the Department of the State is now charg ed by law or usage; and from the Interior Depart ment to the War Department, the Pension Bureau,so far as it regulates the payment of soldiers* pensions. I would further recommend that the payment of naval pensions bo transferred to oue of the bureaus ol the Navy Department. GOVERNMENT EXPENSES. The estimates for the expenses of the Government for the fiscal year are $18,244,346 less than for the cur rent one, but exceed the appropriations for the pres ent year for the same items, $8,972,756. In this esti mate, however, is included $22,338,278.27 for public works heretofore begun under Congressional permis sion, and of which only so much is asked as Congress may choose to give. The appropriation for the same work for the present fiscal year was $11,984,518.08. I 

CURRENCY, GOLD AND TAXES. The average value of gold as compared with nation al currency for the whole of the year 1869 was 134, and for eleven months of 1870 the same relative value has been about 115. The approach to a specie basis is very gratifying, but the fact cannot be denied that instability of the value of our currency ia prejudicial to our prosperity, and tends to keep up prices to the detriment of trade. The evils of a depreciated and fluctuating currency arc so great that, now, when the premium on gold has fallen fo much, it would seem that the time has arrived w ten by wise and prudent legis'ation Congress should look to a policy which would place our currency at par with gold i t no distant day. The tax collected from the people has been reduced more than $80,000,000 per annum. By steadiness in our present conrse,th©re is no reason why in a few short years the national tax-gatherer may not disappear from the door of the citizeu al most entirely. With the revenue stamp dispensed by postmasters in every community, a tax upon liquors of all sorts and tobacco in all its forms, and by a wise adjustment of the tariff, which will put a duty only upon those articles which we could dispense with, known as lux uries. and on those which we use more of than we produce, revenue enough may be raised after a few years of peace and consequent reduction of indebted ness, to fulfill all our obligations; and a further re duction of expenses in addition to a reduction of in ter*. * account may be relied on to make this practic able. 

REVENUE REFORM. Revenue reform, if it means this, has my hearty support. If it implies a collection of all the revenue for the support of the Government; for the payment of principal and interest of the public debt, pensions &c., by directly taxing the people, then I am against revenue reform, and confidently believe the people are with me. If it means failure to provide the ne cessary means to defray the expenses of tlie Govern ment, and hereby repudiation of the public debt and pensions, then I am still more opposed to such kind of revenue reform. Revenue reform has not been defined by any of its advocates, to my knowledge, but seems to be accent ed as something which is to supply every man's wants without any cost or effort on his part. A true revenue reform cannot he mc.de in a day, bm must he the work of natural legislation and of time. A s ion as the revenue can be dispensed with all duty should bo removed from coffee, tea, and other articles of un iversal use not produced by ourselves. The neces sities of the country compel us to collect revenue from our imports. An army of assessors and collect ors is not a pleasant sight to the citizens, but that or a tariff for revenue is necessary. Such a tariff, so far as it acts in encouragement to labor at living wages in contrast to the pauper labor of the old world.and also in the development of home resources. Under the act of Congress of the 15th day of July, 1870, the army has gradually been reduced, so that on t lie first day of January 1871, the number of com missioned officer.' and men in all will not exceed the number contemplated by that law. DEPARTMENT Bl ANG. The Department building I- .n old structure, not fire-proof, and entirely inadequate in dimensions to our present wants. Many thousands of dollars are now paid annually for rent of private building, to accommodate the various Bureaus ot the Department. I recommend an appropriation for anew War Depart ment building, suited to the present and growing wants of the nation. 

ARMY AND NAVY. The report of the Secretary of War shows a very satisfactory reduction in the expenses of the army for the last fiscal year. For details you are referred to hip accompanying report. The expense of the navy foi the . *9 of the last year, i. e. t from Decem ber 1, 1869, the da*3 of the last report, are less than $19,000,00*, or about $1,000,000 less than they were the previous year, The expenses since the commencement of this fiscal year, t>., since July l,shuw for the five months a decrease of over $2,400,000 from those of the corres ponding months of last year. The estimates for the current year wore $28,205,- 768.03. Tqos© for the next year are $20,683,817, with $955,100 additional for the necessary permanent im provements. There estimates are made closely for the maintenance of the naval establishment as it now is, without much in the nature of permanent improve ment. The appropriations made for the last and current years were evidently intended by Congress and are sufficient only to keep the navy on its present footing, by the repairing and refining of our old ships. This policy must of course gradually but surely destroy the navy; and it is in itself far from cconiomical, us each year that it is pursued the ne cessity for mere repairs in ships and navy yards be comes more imperative and more costly, and our cur rent expenses are annually increased for the mere re pair of ships, many of which must soon become un safe and useless. 1 hope during tl nresent session of Congress to bo able to submit to u a pian by which naval vessels can be built and repairs made with great saving upon the present cost. It can hardly be wise statesman ship of a Government which represents a country with over five thousand miles of coast line on both oceans, exclusive of Alaska, ami containing forty millions of progressive people, with relations of every nature with almost every foreign country, to rest with such inadequate means of enforcing any foreign policy either of protection or redress. Separated by the ocean from the nations of the Eastern continent our navy is our only means of pro tection to our citizens obroad, or liir the enforcement of any foreign policy’. 

POST-OFFICE DEPARTMENT. The accompanying report of the Postmaster Gen eral shows a most satisfactory working of the depart ment. With the adoption of the recommendations contained therein, particularly those relating to a re form in the franking privilege, ami the adoption of correspondence cards, a self-sustaining postal system may speedily be looked for, and at no distant day a farther reduction of the rate of postage attained. I recommend authorized by Congress to the Post master General and Attorney-General to issue all commissions to officials appointed through their re spective departments. At present these commissions, where appointments are Presidential, are issued by the State Department, except those of the Postotfice and of Justice, a itliorizes each to issue its own com missions. 

CIVIL SERVICE REFORM. Always favoring practical reforms, I respectfully call your attention to one abuse of long standing, which I would like to see remedied by this Congress. It is a reform in the civil service of the country. 1 would have it go beyond the mere fixing of the* ten ure of office of clerks and employees wln do not re quire the advice and consent of the Senate to make their appointments complete. I would have it gov ern not the tenure but the manner of making all ap pointments. There is no duty wii.ch embarrasses the executive and heads of departments .as that of appointments, nor is there any such arduous and thankless labor imposed on Senators and Representa tives as that of finding places for constituents. The present system does not secure the best, and often not even fit men for public places. The eleva tion and purification of the civil service of the Gov ernment will be bailed with approval by the whole people of the United States. 

INDIAN AFFAIRS. Reform In the management of Indian affairs has received the special attention of the Administration from its inaugniation to the present day. The exper iment of making it a missionary work was tried with a few agencies given to the denomination of Friends, and has been found to work most advantageously.— All agencies and sui>erintendencies not so disposed of were given to officers of the army. The act of Congress regulating the army renders army officers ineligible to civil positions; Indian agencies being civil offices, I determined to give all the agencies to such religious denominations as had heretofore established missionaries among the Indians, and perhaps to some other denominational ho would undertake the work on the same terms, t.e., as a mis sionary work. The soc’otios selected are allowed to name their own agents, subject to the approval of the Executive, and arc expected to watch over them and aid them as inissii arics to Christianize and civilize the Indian, and to train him in the arts of peace. The Govern ment watches over the official acts of the*© agents, and requires of them as str i tr n accountability ns if they were appointed in ant other manner, 1 enter tain the confident hope that the policy now pursued will, in a few years, bring all the Indians upon reser vations, where they will live in houses, have school houscs anil churches, will be pursuing peaceful and self-sustaining avocations, and where they may be vjs*-ted by the law-abiding wlute man with the same impunity that he now visits the civilized white set tlements. I call your especial attention to the report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs for full infor mation on this subject. 

PUBLIC LANDS. During the last fiscal year 8,095,413 acres of public laud were disposed of. Of this quautitj’ 3,698,910 acres were taken under the homestead law, and 2,159- 515 acres sold for cash. The remainder was located with military warrants, college or Indian scrip, or applied in satisfaction of grants to railroads, or for other public uses. The entries under the homestead Uv. during the iast year covered 991,646 acres There than those during th* preceding year. Purveys hare been vigorously proft.cnted to the full extent of the means applicable to the purpose. The quantity of land in the market will amply supply the present demand. The claim of the settlers under the home stead or pre-emption laws is not, however, limited to lands subject to sale at private entry. Any unappro p- .ated surveyed public land may \o a limited amoot be acquired under the former laws, if the party enti tled to under them will comply with the re quirements they prescribe in regard to residence and cultivation. The actual settler’s preference to right of purchase is even broader, and extends to lands which were un survey ed at the time of his settlement. His right was formerly confined within much narrower limits; and, at one period of our hktor y, was conferred only by special statutes. They were enacted from time to time to legalize what was then regarded as an unau thor; zed intrusion upon the public domain. The opinion vbat the public lands should be regarded chiefly as a source of revenue is no longer maintain ed. The rapid settlement and cultivation of them is now justly considered of more importance to our well-being than is the fund which the sale of them would produce. The remarkable growth and pros perity of our new States and Territories attest the w isdom of the legislation which invites the tiller of the soil to secure a permanent home on terms within the reach of all. The pioneer who incurs the dan gers and privations of a frontier life, and thus aids in 1 tying the foundation of the now commonwealth, renders signal service to this country, and Is entitled to its special favor ax;d protection. The laws secure that object and largcdy promote the general welfare. They should, therefore, be cherished as a permanent feature of our land system. Good faith requires us to give full effect to existing grants. The time-honored and benificicnt policy cf setting apart certain sections of public land for educational purposes in the new States shonld be continued. When ample provision shall have bees made for these objects, I submit, as a worthy of seri ous consideration, whether the residue of our nation al domain should not be wholly disposed of under the provisions of the homestead and pre-emption laws. 

INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS. In addition to the swamp and overflowed lands granted to the States in which they are situated, the lauds taken under the Agricultural College acts for internal improvement purposes, under the act of September, 1841, and the acts supplemental thereto, there had been conveyed, up to the clove of the fis cal year, by patent or other equivalent evidence of title, to States and corporations, 27,839,257 18-100 acres, for railways, canals, and wagon-roads; autit is estimated that an additional quantity of 174,735,523 acres is still due under grants lor like uses. The policy of thus aiding the States in building works of internal improvement was inaugurated more than forty years since in the grants to Indiana and Illinois to aid those States in opening canals to connect the w aters of the Wabash with those of Lake Michigan. It was followed, with some modifications, in the grant to l.'linoia of alternate sections of public land within certain limits, to aid in the construction of the Illinois Central Railway. Fourteen States and sundry corporations have received similar subsidies in connection with railways completed or in process of construction. As the reserved sections are rated at double the minimum, the sale of them at the en hanced price has thus in many instances indemnified the Treasury for the granted lands. The construc tion of some of these thoroughfares has nndoubte !!y given a vigorous impetus to thg development of our resources and the settlement of the more distant por tions of the country. It may however, be well insist ed that much of our legislation in this regard bus been characterized by indiscriminate and profuse lib erality. The United States should not loan their credit in aid of any enterprise undertaken by Stales or corporations, nor grant lands in any instace, un less the projected work is of acknowledged national importance, lam strongly inclined to the opinion that it is inexpedient and unnecessary to bestow sub sidies vf either description; but should Congress de termine otherwise, I earnestly recommend that the rights of settlers and ofthe puidic be more effectually secured and protected by appropiate legislation. THF PANENT OFFICE, During the year ending September 30,1870, there were filed in the Patent Office 1 0,411 applications for patents, 3,074 caveats, and 100 applications for the ex tension of patents; 1 5,622 patent, including re-issues and deMgnes, were issued, 110 extended ; and 1,089 al lowed, hut not issued by reason of the non-payment of the final fees. The receipts of the office during the fiscal year were $136.304,29 iu excess of its ex penditures. THE CENSUS. The work of the Census Bureau has been energot icallj’ prosecuted. The preliminary report containing mnch information of special value and interest will be ready for delivery during the present session. The remaining volumes will be completed with all the dispatch consistent with perfect accuracy in arrang ing and classifying the returns. We shall thus at no distant day be furnished with an authentic record of our condition and resources. It will, I doubt not, at test the growing prosperity ofthe country ; although during the decade which has just closed it was so severely tried by the great war waged to maintain its integrity and to secure and perpetuteour free institu tions.
