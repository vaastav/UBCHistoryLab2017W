ARMY OFFICERS , BE RESTORED TO AUTHORITY |J0LSHEVIK > will recognize 0LD < lass of Russian | aristocrat after YEARS OF DELAY. i , Associated Press RIGA, Latvia, Dee. 7. — The Rus sian army officer stripped of most of his authority by Premier Kerensky at the very start of his 1917, and regime in persecuted in the early days of the Bolshevik rule as the per sonification of all that was to be de spised in a "bourgeois" or aristocrat, is about to be restored to practically the same position he held before the revolution. The authority of an army officer in the field has been recognized by the Bolsheviki during the past three years, and nowhere has discipline, at least on paper, been stricter than in the Red Army, but, as a rule, officers did not find their work attractive. Their pay was not very much higher than that of the men, nor was there any great difference in their rations, while the responsibility was heavy. If they came 1 from the old officer class, they were constantly under picion and surveillance by the Com munist commisars, one of whom was attached to each separate military unit. sus Now the Soviet government has come out with an admission that of ficers and men cannot be treated alike and that in order to secure suf ficient officers, they must be provid ed lor on a. much higher scale than the soldiers, and "it should be realiz ed that the principle of equality is not acceptable." From the very beginning of the Bolshevik regime, many officers of the army of the late Emperor Nich olas have served the Reds. Some were compelled to do so, others were attracted by the promise of food at the time civilians were starving, while others, liberal-minded political ly, volunteered, considering the Red army, after all, Russian to the core. Their numbers have been constantly increasing during the past year, due to Trotzky's insistence that the Rus sian army be as efficient as any oth er in the world, and also to the grad ual progress made toward bettering their lot. To supply the Red army with well trained, junior officers, the Bolshe viki have opened scor o of training schools. The "Kursants' as these young officer aspirants are termed, are spick and span and as well set up as American West Point cadets. In addition to school training, they are given actual battle practice at every opportunity, being sent into the field as "shoik troops" against counter-revolutionary or "bandit" bands in the Ukraine. They great ly distinguished themselves in the re volt at Kronstadt last March. PACKERS STRIKE IS MORE SERIOUS Strike Leaders Insist That The Strike Is One Hundred Per Cent Effective. CHICAGO, Dec. 7. — The strike of the packing house employees in the large centers outside of Chicago took a more serious aspect today and has grown to much greater propor tions. The strike leaders are insis ting that the strike is one hundred per cent effective, but the packers insist that though work is hampered in some quarters, production is but slightly affected. National Guards men are patrolling the St. Paul pack ing district because interference with employees entering the plant is said to have occurred. At Kansas City all pickets have been ordered off the streets, and at Fort Worth two alleg ed strikers have been shot by a ne gro who was beafen by a crowd.

London, says Great joy and thankfulness over the Irish ngree ment which is called the greatest in history and the signing of the treaty j the supreme event. Treaty has to be ratified by Ulster but no greater difficulty seems feared. The action by Liverpool this morn ing in showing 16 to 17 down against 6 to 10 down due is no reflection of any change in political security but — rather a similarity of result with that ; n our markets where first expression flattened out into former waiting ac- dullness. Moreover, the sharp rise to- j n sterling exchange entitled Liver are p 00 i some shaving in parity. On tp e whole, however, the markets merely give to understand that they j appreciate the change between antic j jpation and actuality. All that has j h ee n gained so far is political under | standing which has to precede trade i reconstruction, bud the actual broad cning out of trade depends now on financial understanding and therefore the recommendation contained in the president's message in the refunding of the allies debt and its immediate taking up in congress, is the leading item of the time.

German dyes and paints, needles, metals, drugs and sundries are be ginning to appear on the Shanghai market, the report goes on, and it is (stated that several important orders for machinery and electric plants have been recently booked by German firms. There is no doubt the report says, that the Germans assisted by the com parative cheapness of their products will gradually recover the share they held in China's foreign trade before the war, but the process will be slow, as they have lost valuable connect ions; the business organisations they had so laboriously built up have been shattered, and they have suffered a serious loss of prestige in the eyes of the Chinese. * The Germans! ~0— Real Estate Transfers Recorded Yesterday The following transfers of real es tate were filed for record yesterday in the Chancery Clerk's office.
