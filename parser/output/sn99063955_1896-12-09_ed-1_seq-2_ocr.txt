BY HOFBR IBROTHBRS, WEDNESDAY, DEO. 9, 1800. CUBA. Our wookly review of the Spanish Cuban war closed with a mere report of the battle of Rubi Hills, which is said to have been a desperate in counter in which General Weyler and the Spanish officers fought without food and the Spanish soldiers were without provisions for 30 hours. Colonel Reyes arrived in New York on the 28th ult., and confirms the re port of the battle fought in the Finar del Rio district in October, in which engagement the Spanish lost 3000 men and the Cubans only 30 men. Dr. Taylor, a passenger from Ha vana, says General Weyler has 30,000 sick soldiers on his hands, and that the cause of Spain is lost in Cuba. The news comes from Spain that General Weyler has made requisition for a regiment of cavalry and they are to sail from Spain in December. The Spanish government has bought a great quantity of war material in Italy. On November 27 news reached Jack sonville of two bloody battles in Plnar Del Rio between Maceo'a forces and the royal troops under Weyler. The victory was with the insurgents and caused great rejoicing among the Cubans. November 28. later accounts of the battle in the Rubi mountains, about thirty miles from Havana -show that while marching Weylcr's army was attacked by Mnceo's army. Tho charge was so sudden and played such havoc with tho Spain troops that the Cubans were ablo to pour several vol eys into their ranks boforo tho latter could rally and return tho flro. It is reported that General Woyler lost 1000 men and retreated taking his wounded with him. Tho war is a very bloody one and cannot b9 said to bo carried on according to tho rules of civilized warfare, us thero 1b no record of the wounded on either sido being cared for. O. B. Pendleton, a newspaper writer from Key West, Florida, who has been In Cuba more or less for 15 years, has been arrested by tho Spanish gov-, eminent. It is thought thore was some J thing wrong about hls passport. Lieutenant RIos report that In tho wX 1 province of Camaquay the Cuban gov- j eminent is in healthy operation. In the mountains, under the roofs of the old farm houses, the new government of Cuba Libre is conducting .schools for the education of children of the patriots. The pupils range in age from seven to thirteen, all the boys of a greater age being engaged in the fight for the Island's liberty. Dec. 7. The effect of President Cleveland's message Is to suggest to Spain a reasonable course toward Cuba. He suggests that they are capable of maintaining the revolution and that they are entitled to self government, and of course he consid ers that they are capable of maintain ing a government. He suggests that any reasonable plan or noine rule would be accepted and acted up to in good faith by the Cubans. The presi dent, in his message to congress em ploys the word autonomy. This means the right of self-government with a suggestion of the power to en force the demand of that right. The effect of the president's mes sage will be to strengthen the feeling of tho American people in favor of Cuban liberty. In tho senate a reso lution is already introduced declaring our government should recognize the indopendence of Cuba. p While President Cleveland employs kind and considerate language toward Spain, it is easy to read between the lines a certain tone of firmness aud determination that says "we expect for you to do your duty toward Cuba. and do it soon." It would bo well for school teachers to read the mes sage relating to Cuba to the children and explain its meanings The Fence Law. Editok Journal: Some days since you published a petition to the com ing legislature to amend the present fence laws so that the owners of stock should be made to care for them in stead of the neighbors. Several states have such laws now, and it seems like a statement of the present laws and the improvement proposed would be sufficient to secure the change. As the present patchwork law, is, the owner of any fanning or garden land must fence against all kinds and de scriptions of stcck, whether he has any himself or not- The new way is to put the cost of supporting the farm stock on the man who is bene fited by their use. Is there anything wrong in that? Another thing. The fence must be just so high and strong enough to turn an elephant almost, or it is not a "lawful" fence and there fore the "law" won't protect your property. Again, you must not use barbed wire because it would "hurt" roguish stock If this provision must stand, we want an amendment to one other "law" so as to provide that no householder shall be allowed to use glass in his lower windows, on penalty of paying all damages and expenses incurred by any burglar who may get cut or in jured in breaking into said house. This little amendment to our penal code will bring it to a par with that one compelling men to fence against everybody's stock and yet punishes him if the said stock gets hurt on the fence.

D. W. Smith, of Clackamas county Populist, writes of his party which are in power in that county: After the entire people's party ticket was elected, and the officers elect had qualified and were sure they would have the offices, they voluntar ily held a caucus with the leading peo ple's party men of the county to see if it were not possible to inaugurate a reform right from the start, and not wait for the legislature to enact a law reducing salaries. The result of that caucus was that every conuty officer pledged himself that he would con duct his office for the salary provided by law, and pay all deputies and other expenses of doing the business of his office out of his salary, and not ask the county to bear any portion of it. Theso reforms the Clackamas county officers instituted on taking their offices and are today carrying out; making a saving to .the county for the first month (July) over the same month of tho previous year, in the matter of salaries to deputies alone amounting to $258.05. Previous to the advent of the peo ples party officers In the county, the deputies of their Republican predeces sors were paid by the county, instead of tho officers out of their salaries. Permit mo to add that tho prompt ef forts or the people's party officers to reduco taxes and expenses, has cem ented the party together as nothing else could havo done, and Insures them an easy victory In 1898. It dealt a fatal blow to Republican con trol hereafter. Republicans stand amazed at the sincerity of Populists in carrying out reforms, but they have to admire, Tho Populists or Clacka mas say that "tho way to reform is to reform." old "graniii" N being given space in the editorial columns of the Oregon 1 'ii to epreis her fears that tl'p re- pahlirnn party will pe seduced by the wicked silver men intnpa.lnga tariff bilhproviding too high prelection du-i ties.

The man who com mences now to throw cold water upon fie demands of Oregon people for am ple protection is a traitor to the in terests of the state. He would rob them of the 'best fruits of their vic t)ry. He is at heart and in fact a free-trader. There Is going to be an extra session of congress, and every man In Oregon should now be exert ing his best efforts in trying to get protection for our resources. This is the paramount duty of the hour. EVERY REPUBLICAN, ESPECI ALLY, SHOULD DO HIS DUTY IN THIS RESPECT. It is the sure method of general prosperity, and therefore It is the salvation of his party, which has promised this.
