iected and which but give an insignificant re turn for the coot of collection, might be remit ted and to the direct advantage of consumers at home. I would ideation those articles which eater into manufactures of all sorts. All duty paid Upon such articles goes into the cost of the articles when manufactured here,' and must be paid for by the consumers. The duties not only come from the consumers at home, but aci as a protection to foreign man ufactures of the same completed article in our own and distant markets. I will suggest or mention another subject bearing upon the problem of how to enable the Secretary of the treasury to accumulate balances; It is to devise some better method of verifying claims against the government than at present exists thioughout the Couit of Claims, especially through claims growing out of the late war. Nothing is more certain than that a large percentage of the amounts passed and paid are part, or wholly fraudu lent, and are far in excess of the real losses sustained. The large amount of losses proven, on good testimony, according to existing laws, by affidavits of fictitious or unscrupulous per sons, to have been sustained on small farms and plantations, are not only far beyond the possible yield of those places for any one year, but, as every on© knows who has experi ence in tilling the soil and who has visited the scenes of those spoliations, are in many in stances more than the individuals claim or were ever worth including their personal and real estate. The report of the Attorney Gen eral, which will be submitted to Congees at an early day, will contain a detailed history of awards made and of claims pertaining tc the class here referred to. THE WAK 

DEPARTMENT. The report of the Secretary of War, ac companying this message, gives a detailed accountof the army operations for the year jnsf passed, the expenses for the maintenance, etc,, with recommendations for legislatio , to which I respectfully mvit e your attention. To some of these suggestions 1 invite special consideration, first, the necessity of making s3of*,ooo of appropriation for the subsistence department, available before the beginning of the next fiscal year. Without this pro vision the troops at points distant from sup ply production must either go without food, or existing laws must be violated. It is not attended with cost to the Treasury. 2d. His recommendation tor the enactment of a sys tem of annuities for the families of decased officers, by voluntary deduction from the monthly pay of officers This again is not attend?d with burden upan the Tr aeury, and would for the future relieve much distress which every old army officer has witnessed in Che past, of uiflocrs*dyiug suddenly, or being killed, leaving tamilies without even the means of reaching their friends, if for tunate enough to have friends to aid them. 3d The repeal of the law abol ishing mileage, aud the return to the old system. 4th. The trial with torpedoes, under the corps of engineers, and appropriations for the same, Should war occur between the United States and aay maritime power, torpe does will be among, it not the most (.ffactive and cheapest auxiliary for the deton <e of har bors, an 1 also in aggressive operations that we can have. Hence it is advisable to learn by experiment, their best construction and applicate n. as well as effect. sth. A perma nent organization for the Signal Service Corps. This service hae n.*w become a necessity of peace as vrett as war under advancement .made by the present able management. 6th. A renewal ot up, ropnation for compiling the official records of the war. THE 

WAVY. The condition ot our navy at this time is a subject of satisfaction. It does not contain, it is true, any powerful cruising iron clads, which mako ranch of the maritime strength of some other nations, but neither our conti nental situation uor our foreign policy require that we snouid have a large number of ships of this character while this situation and the nature of our porta continue to make those of other nations little dangerous to us under any circumstances. Our navy does contain, how ever, a oonsioerable number of iron-dads of the monitor c ass, which, though not properly cruisers, are powerful and effective, for harbor defense, and tor operations near our own shores. Ot these, ail ate of the single-tuiret style. Our diips for lighting purpo es are also in hand, undergoing complete repairs, and conld be ready for sea in periods varying from four to six. mouths. With these com pleted, according: to the present design, and our two iron torpedo boats now ready, our iron-clad fl et will be, for the purposes of de fense at least* equal to any force that can be readily brought against it Onr wooden navy, also crnisers of various sizes, to the number of about forty, including those now in commission, are in the Atlantic, and conld be ready tor uuty as fast as men could be enlisted for those not already in commission. Of thee three are in effect new ships., and though amef>f the remainderjneed considerable repairs to their boilers and ma chinery, they are or can readily bfc effective. This constitutes a fleet off more than flttv war ships, of which fifteen are iron-dads now on hand on the Atlantic coast. The navy has been brought to this condition by a judicious and practical application of what could be spared trom the current appropria tions of the last few years and from that made to meet the posa.Ue emergency ot two years ago. It has been done quietly, with out proclamation or display. It has necessari ly straitened ibe department in extraordinary expenditure, and, as far as iron-claaa are con cerned, has added nothing to the cruising force of the navy; yet the result is none the less satisfactory because it ’s to be found in a great inc?ease ot real rather than apparent force. The expenses incurred in the mainten ance of an effective naval force, in all its branches, are necessarily large.but such force is essential to onr position, relations and char acters, and affects seriously the weight of our principles and policy, throughout the whole sphere cf naval icsponsibiluies. The estimates for tin* regular support of this branch ot the serwee for the next year amount to a little less in '.he aggregate than those made for the current year, but some addition al appropriations are asked for the objects not included in the ordinary maintenance of th * navy, but believed to be of pressing imoort ance*at this time. It would, in my opinion, be wise at once to afford sufficient means for the immediate completion of the’five doubie turreted monitors now undergoing repairs, which must otherwise advance slowly and only as moaey can be (-pared from current ex penses. Supplemented by these our navy, armed with the destructive weapons of mod ern warfare, manned by onr seaman, and in charge ot our instructed officers, will present a force powerful for the home purposes of a responsible though peaceful nation. THE POsTo/FICE 

DEPARTMENT. The report of the Postmaster-General, here with transmittal, gives a full history of the of the department for the year jn?t past. It will be observed that the deficiency to be supplied from the General Treasure has increased over the amount refunded lor the precedi g year. In a country so vast in area as the Baited Btatds, with large portions sparsely settled, it must be expected that this important service will be more or less a bur den npoo the treae oy for many years to come, ant there is no branch of the public service wbi’h interests a whole people more than t-bat ot a cheap transmission of the mails t>. verv inhabited part of our territory. Next to f e achoo s thepostoffice is the great est ©d scat or ot the people, and it maj well re ceive -support of the general government. The subsidy rf *-t per annum given to vessels of the United Mates for carrying nails between Kew York and Rio de Janeiro, hav ing ceased . >n the 3 th day of September last, we are wuhout direct mol facilities with the South American States. This J 6 greatly to bo regret tw, an t I do not hesitate to recommend the author g ition of a renewal of that con tract, Hud also that ’ho service may bp in creased from monthly to semi mouth y trips. The com mere. a. advantages to be gained by a direm lue ot American steamers to S<<uib Am ri a sta es would far outweigh the ex pen-o if -he mtv ice. * By act of congress approved March 3d, 1875 almost ail matter, whether properly mail mat> ter or b* t may be sent any distance through out mads, in packages not exceeding five pounds on weight, for the eum of 16 cents per pound. So iar as the transmission of e*l mail matter goe*, this would seem entirely proper, but I suggest that the law be so amended as to exclude from the mails mer chandise of all descriptions, and limit this transportation to all articles enumerated, and which may be classed as mail matter proper. THE BLACK HILLS. The discovery of gold on the Black Hills, a poi tion of the Kioux reservation, has had the effect co induce a large emigration of miners to that point. Thus far the effort to protect, the treaty rights of the Indians of that section has been successful, but the next year will certainly witness a large in creastvhv such emigration. The negotiations for tHe relinquishment of the gold fields having failed, it will be necessary for Congress to adopt some measures to relieve "the embanasment growing out of the cause named. The Secretary of the Interior suggests that the supplies uow appropriated for the sustenance of that people, being no longer obliga tory under the treaty of 1868, but simply a gratuity, may be issued or withe’d at his dircretion. THE INMAN TERRI FOB*. The condition of the Indian territory to which 1 have referred in several of my former annual mes sages, remains practicably unchanged. The Sec retary of the Interior has taken measures to ob tain a full report of the condition of that territory,, and will mane it the subject of a special report at an early day. It may then be necessary to make some further recommendation in regard to legis lation for the government of that territory. THE PATENT OFFICE. The steady growth and increase of the business of the Patent Office indicates, in some measure, the prosperity of the country. The receipts of the office are in excess of its expenditures, and the office generally is in a prosperous and satisfactory condition. GENERAL LAND OFFICE. The report of the General Land Office phows that there were 2,469,601 acres less disposed of during this year than last year. More than one-half of this decrease was in land disposed of under the homestead aud a number of culture laws, the causes of which are supposed to be found in the grasshopper scourge and the droaght which pre vailed so extensively in some of the frontier states and territories during the past year, the cash re ceipts were less by $6,900,322.28 than during the last preceding year. Tue entire surveyed area of the public domain is 680,266,694 acres, of which 26,977,531 acres were surveyed during the past year, leaving 15,447,171 acres still uusurveyed. The report of the Commissioner presents many interesting suggestions in regard tc the manage ment and disposition of the public domain, j.nd the modification of existing laws, the apparent im portance of which should insure the consideration of Congress. PENSIONS. The number of pensioners still continues to de crease, the highest number having been reached during the-year endin June 80, 1872. During last year 11,557 names were added to the rolls, and 12,977 were dropped therefrom, showing a net de crease of 1,420. But while the number of pension ers has decreased, the annual amount on the pen sion rolls has increased $4,413,318. This is caused by the greatly increased average rate of pensions, which, by the liberal legislation of Congress, has incjessed from $9,026 in 1872 to $10,391 in 1875. To each invalid pensioner an increase in the average rate of IDO per cent, in the three years. During the year ending June 3", 1*75, there was paid on account of pensions including expen ses of disbursements' $29,683,116. being $910,632 less than was paid me preceding year. This re daction in i-mount of expenditures was produced by the d* crease In the amount of arrearages due cn allow* and claims and ou petitions, the rate of which increased by legislation of the preceding ses sion of Congress. At the close of tbe fised year there were on pension rolls 234,821 persons, of whom 210,363 were army pensioners, 10&,478 being invalids aud 104,885 widows aud dependent rela tions, 3,420 were navy pensioners, of whom 1,636 were invalids and 174 widows and dependent rela tions. 21,0*8 were pensiomrs cf the war ef 1812, 15,875 of whom were survivors and 5,163 were widows. It is estimated that $29 636,060 will be re quired for the payment of pensions for the next fiscal year, $.<65,000 leas than the estimate for the present year. 

GEOLOGICAL SURVEYS, The geological explorations have been prgpecuted with energy during the year, covering an area of of 4,O‘K) square miles, in the territories of Colora do, Utah and New Mexico, developing agricultural and mineral resources and furnishing interest from scientific aud topographical details of that re gion. INDIAN AFFAIRS. The method for the treatment of t e Indians, adopted at the beginning of my first term, has been steadily pursued, and with satisfactory aud en couraging results. It has been productive of evi dent improvement in the condition of that race, and will be continued with only such modifications as further experience may indicate to be necessary. THE CENTENNIAL. The Board heretofore appointed to take charge of tbe articles and materials pertaining to the War, the Navy, the Treasury, the Interior, and the Post office Departments, and the Department of Agri culture, the Smithsonian Institute, and the com mission ot food fishes, to be contributed, under the legislation of last session to the international exhibition to oe held at Philadelphia during tbe centennial of 1876 has the discharge of the duties which have devolved upon it and the proportions so far made, with tbe means at command, give us hope that the government contribution will be made one of the marked characteristics of the country. The Board has ob erved tbe commenda ble economy In the matter of the erection of a building for the governmental exhibition, the ex pense of which it is estimated will not exceed the sum of SBQ,U)O. This amount has been withdrawn from the appropriations of the principal depart ment, which leaves some of those departments with ut sufficient means to enter their respective exhibits complete and satisfactory. The exhibi tion being an international one, and the govern ment being a voluntary contributor, it is my opin ion that its contribution should be of a character in quality and extent -o sustain the dignity aud credit ot so distinguished a contributor or advan tageous to the country. All uncreditable partici pation by the government would be humiliating to the patriotism of our people themselves. 1 com mend the estimates of the Board for the necessary additional appropriation to the favorable consider ation of Congress. The powers of Europe, almost without excep tion, many of the South American states, and even the more distant eastern powers have manifested their friendly sentiments tow aid the Un ted States and the interest of tbe world in our progress by taking steps to join with us in celebrating the cen tennial of the nation, and I strongly recommend tbac more national importance be given to this ex hibition by sui.b legislation and by such appropria tions as will insure success. Its value in bringing to our shores innumerable useful works of art and skill, the communing of citizens of for ign coun tries and our own, and the Intercharge of ioeas and manufactures, will far exceed any pecuniary outlay we may make. DEPARTMENT REPORTS. I transmit herewith, the report of the Commis sioner of Agriculture, tog* ther with the report of the Commissioner of the Board of Audit, and the Board of Health of the district of Columbia, to all of which I invite your attention. The Bureau of Agriculture has accomplished much ip disseminating knowledge to the agricu - turist, and in introducing new-and useful products adapted to our climate, and is worthy of the con tinued encouragement of the government. The report of the Commissioner uf Education, which accompanies the report of the Secretary of the Interior, shows a gratifying progress in edu cational matters. POLYGAMY. In nearly every annual message that I have had the honor of transmitting to Congress I have called attention to the anomalous, not to say scandalous, condition of affairs existing in the Territory of Utah, and have asked for definite legislation to correct it. That polygamy should exist in a free, enlighten ed and Christian country wi hont power to punish so flagrant a crime against decency and morality, seems preposterous. r J rue there i- no law to sus tain this unnatural vice, but what is needed is a law to puni -h it as a crime, and at the same time to fix the status of th innocent children, the off spring of this system, and of the possibility ot in nocent ulural wives, but, as an institution,* polyg amy should be banished f:om the laud. While this Is being done, i invite the attention of Congress to a other, though perhaps no less an evil, the importation of Chinese wt men, but few of whom are brought to our shores for the purpose of honor -hie and useful occupations, PUBLIC LANDS. Observations while visiting the territories of Wyoming, Utah and Colorada, during last an umn, convinced me that the existing laws regulating tho disposition of public lands, timbe , etc. Probably the mining laws themselves are very defective and should be careful y amended at an early and iv. In the territories where cultivation of the soil can only ne following when irrigation is practicable, the lands can oa : v be use for pas turage, and this only where Btoca can reach water to qutmh the thirst, be governed by the same las as to entries of lands every acre of wh-Ch is an ind pendent state by itself Lands mast be held ia larger quantities to justify the ex pense of conducting w-)ter upon .t to make it fruit ful or to justify utilizing it us pasta age. The timber in most of the territories is principally confined to the mountain regions, which are held for entry in small quantities only and as mineral lands. The timber is the proper y of the United States, tor disp sal of which there is now no adequate law I'he settler must become a consumer or tula timber whether he lives upon plains or engages in working mines, hence every man becomes eith r a trespasser him self or In owingly a patron-f a trespasser. My op portunities lor observing we.e net suffl lent to justify me in rtoomme iding specific I.glbiatim on these subjects, but 1 do recommend th t a joint cornudtiee ot the two housß of Congress, s. ffl cieidly large to be ulvidtd ito s-üb-* ommlttees, l>e organized to v sit all the mining <■ bates an i ter 'it uies during the coming su x mer, and that the committee sin* 1 report te Congress at t e next ses sion such la<*B or iintudmenis to laws as it may de< m necessary t<* secure ih best I te>ests of ihe government and the people of these ter itoriea who are doing so much for their development. 1 am sure ihe citizens occupying the ternltories do not wish to be trespassers nor will they be if legal ways are providt and for them to become owners of these actual necessities of their position. BKOOMMKNTMTION. As this will be the last annual message which I shall have the honor of transmitting to Congress before my successor 1 chosen I will repeat or re capitulate the questions which I deem of vital im portance which are to be legislated upon and set tled at this session. , First—That the sta’es shall be required to afford opportunity of good common school education to every child within their limits. Second—No scctar .an tenets shall ever be taught in any school, supported in whole or in part by the state, nation or by the proceeds of any tax levied upon any oemmunby. Make education compul sory, so far as to depr;ve all persons who cannot read or write from becoming voters after the year 1890, disfranchising none, however, on grounds of illiteracy who may be voters at the time this amendment takes effect. Third—Declare church and state forever separate and distinct, but each free within their proper spheres, and that all church property shall bear its own proportion of taxation. Fourth. Drive out licensed immorality, such as polygamy, and (he importation of women for illegitimate purposes. To recur again to the cen tennial year, it would seem as though now, as W'e are about to begin the second century of our na tional f xistence, it would be a most fitting time for these reforms. Fifth. Enact such laws as will insure a speedy return to a sound currency, such as will command the respect of the world. Believing that these views will commend themselves to the great ma jority of the right thinking aud patriotic citizens of the Upited States, I tubmit the rest to Con gress. (Signed) IT. S. Grant. Executive Mansion, December 7, 1875. XLIVtkCONGRESS. Summary of Proceedings of Both Houses. Senate. Monday, December 6, 1875. The Senate was called to order at 12 o’clcx k, by T. W.

Those of the member from the 33d district of New YorS were sc peculiar iu form that the question was submitted to the House. From the sth district of Louisiana two sets of credentials had been received—one signed by William Pitt Kellogg, showing the election of Mr. Morey, and the other signed by John McEnery, showing the election of Mr. Spencer, and that as Kellogg was the defacio governor the clerk had ac ted on nis certificates and had enrolled Morey, as to the 6th district, he had only received one certifi cate, signed by Kellogg, aud he had actey on that .... It was moved and agreed that the election of Sin aker be proceeded with. Mr. Lamar nominated Michael C. Kerr, of Indiana; Mr. Wheeler non ma ted James G. Blaine, of Maine. Mr. Kerr was elected on the third ballot. Mr. Kerr was conducted to his seat oy Messrs.

Tretcott and others, of South Carolina, with reference to the right of representation of the Third Congressional District of fcorith Carol! a. Referred to the com mittee on elections.... The House then adjourned till Friday. The Late Tice-President. Anecdotes of the late Vice-President are multiplying on every hand. One illustrative of his well-known kindness to soldiers comes from Michigan. A correspondent of the Detroit News writes that in the winter of 1862-3 there was great suffering in a camp of 13,000 convalescents near Alexandria, Virginia. In response to a peti tion to President Lincoln, a “ quiet faced ” man visited the camp and examined its condition, bring ing with him two ambulances loaded with blankets and provisions. The writ er adds: “The quiet-faced man had been making a memorandum of some of the worst cases, and was just depart ing, when a weak voice inquired for postage stamps. ‘God bless you, yes,’ said our quiet gentleman, ‘here’s a few and money to buy more. 1 A thought seemed to strike him. Producing his wallet, he placed in the hand of the ser geant in charge of each division a crisp new SSO bill, ‘for postage stamps, remember,’ and turning to his gratified audience, he added, in his cheery way, ‘ Will be here again, boys, Monday, and will have a different state of things. ’ Monday came, and with it the quiet-faced man and a board of surgeons with orders to discharge on furlough every man who was not ready for immediate active duty. New bar racks were built, and camp * Misery Hill ’ ceased to exist. The quiet-faced man was-Henry Wilson.” Ida Lewis, the marine heroine, is poor, and plays every Monday morning on a seven and a quarter octave wash board. With her bare elbows even with the keyboard and a red flannel Beetho ven befogs her, she renders that famous music with delicate expression and wool en poetry. Yet people send her poems, silk hosiery, three-button gloves and tine jewelry. If any one wishes to send anything to Ida Lewis, he heroine of Lime Bock, let him end something substantial She says so herself.— Ez.. change. 

CASTING UP ACCOUNTS. A Few Facts and Figures Taken From the Ledgers of Uncle Sam’s Book-Keepers. A Synopsis of the Reports of tyie Dif ferent Departments of the Government. Showing What Has Bean and is To Be Done. Internal Revenue. The report ot the Internal Revenue Com missioner for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1875, is a rather voluminous document, and we can find room for only a brief synopsis ot it. Commissioner Pratt says it may be some consolation to know chat grievous as are our burdens, laid upoi such of our population, forty-two millions or more, as consume the articles taxed by our Internal Revenue laws, the British public, numbering less by one lourth t tan our people, paid under their excise laws during the year ending March 31, 1875, taxes measured in gold to the amount Of $183,- 962,756, against *110,545.154 paid in currency by the people ot this country during .he fiscal year ended June 30, 1875. The report shows that the actual amount of receipts in the treasury from ail sources from and after June 30, 1861, to June 30, 1874, ex clusive of loans and treasury notes, was asfol ows: Customs $1,973,749,367 Internal revenue 1,956,328,723 Direct tax 14.810,189 Public lands 22,151.958 Miscellaneous 236,084,982 Premiums on loans and sales of gold coin . 192,557,117 Total. $4,396,638,341 The ret amount received from all sources of internal revenue, during the last fiscal year, in the several states, is as follows : Alabama...* 111,816 Missouri . .$ 4,591,856 Arizona 10,263 Montana.— 23,666 Arkansas... 71,823 Nebraska .. 292,472 California. 2,983,595iNevada 53.147 Colorado... 70,351 |N.

Virginia 508.684 Michigan... 1,930 506 Wisconsin.. 2,72,863 Minnesota.. 228,362 Wyoming .. 11,942 Mississippi. 96,085 t The Commissioner says public attention has been often called within the *pet tew months to the extensile frauds committed in certain localities npco the revenue by distillers aud lectifiers of distilled spirits. He gives an ac count, first, of the checks, guards and protec tions against frauds established by law; frauds, so called, lately exposed, were perpe trated upon the government; third, the extent of these frauds; fourth, the checks recently established to prevent a recurrence of the same, and, fifth, sup; es s legislation, which, in his opinion, is necessary to insure a fuller collection in future of the taxes upon distilled spirits. Mr. Pratt is of the opinion that, with addi tional legislation to enforce the honest collec tion of the tax on distilled spirits, the revenue can be collected with little loss. The Public Lands. The report of the Comanesionerof the Gen eral Land Office gives acme interesting data m regard to the business ot tbo Bureau during the iast fiscal year. The Sailing oflin ‘•dispos als’- has been equal to over twenty-live per cent, and is chiefly due to the grasshopper plague, to unusual drought in certain localities aim to the decreased volume of immigration. The Commissioner gives special prominence to the necessity of the government taking some measures to arrest the indiscriminate sacritl c of mountain timber on its own do main, whereby the continuous feeding ol streams Irom the gradual melting of the snow is so disastrously interfered with. The Com missioner strongly recommem s that all tim ber lands owned by the government be ap praised and thrown opea to purchase, at not less than their appraised value. He is of the opinion that unless they are thus placed under private guardianship the fine forests of the country will soon no wastefnlly exhausted by lumber companies and speculators, who are now stripping the land ot its timber under cover of ‘dummy” pre-emption, or with out any pretense of the observance ot the Jaw, while "the Government derives no revenue from its property, and the country sustains al most irreparable damage from the sweeping denuding ot large areas of its water shfids. He also condemns the practice of extending subdivision surveys over immense bodies of worthless laud west of the hundredth meridi an, and suggests that only such tracts be minutely surveyed as have any attractions for settlers.* He also recommends that provision be made for connecting the laud office surveys with important pout established by geological surveys ot territories,’and that monuments at section corners, etc., be constructed in a much more lasting manner. The recommendation of his predecessor tba;) pre-emption laws should be abolished and the homestead system made the only raetnod of acquiring title to agricultural lands, is repeated by Commission er Burdett, and earnestly urged übon the at tention of Congress. The Indians. The report of Indian Commissioner Smith is a very important document, and a review of the proceedings of the council with the Sioux delegation in Washington last May. He la ments the failure of me Commission ot which Senator Allison was Chairman, to ob tain from the Sioux a relinquishment of their title to the Biack Hills, as he is aw re that one thousand or more miners have made heir way into the Sioux country in the face of the most stringent prohibitory orders by the military authorities. A large number of miners have organized into an association for mutual protection, and have adopted laws and regulations; have staked out and reserved their claims in tne right of which they txpect hereafter to be protected. In this complica tion of affairs Commissioner Smith consid ers that there is but one alternative tor the Government—either to increase the military force so as to compel a strict oo servance of the treaty rights of the Sioux, by preventing all intrusion, or to put such re strictions upon the exercise of the large bounty now granted to the Sioux as to form an argument that will be likeiy to procure their assent to the cession of this country. He admits that the occupation and possession of the Biack Hills by white men is inevitable, but no reason exists for the making of this inevitably an occasion dt wrong or ininry to the Sioux. The commissioner recommends strongly the expulsion of ail those persons known as squaw men,” or the white husbands of squaws, from the Indian reservation; the re moval < f Spotted Tail and Red Cloud agencies to the Mis oui i river, and will also recommend compelling the Indians to labor in return for rations. The Marine Hospital Service. Dr. J. M. Woodworth, Supervising Surgeon ot the Marine Hospital Service, in his annual t takes strong grounds in favor of the adoption of more stringent methods for the prevention ot the introduction of cholera into tois country, and makes important recom mendauons. Dr Woodworth thinks cholera can be entirely prevented by prompi and author tative infotmation to thieatened ports of the shipment ot passengers and goods from the cholera-infected district, anti a rigid quarantine. If Health Officers at the different ports of the United States were made awie by telegraph ot the lact that emigrants or goods supposed to be infecto and were en route to this country, measures coala be taken to prevent, without d.fficu their admission. Dr. Wood worth thinks that it is most needed chat the National Government, through its Consular officers, should acquire the necessary informa- tion, and then promptly and intelligently far* ninh it to the parts and localities proposed Thus advised, threatened communities would have ample time for preparation and the pub licity given to the warning would bo the moat efficieut means of insuring proper precaution ary measures. The President has promited to give Dr. Woodworth’s recommendations the due attention they deserve, and will, no donbt, carry out the plan before another cholera season, The Engineer Service. Gin. Humphreys, Chief Engineer of the U. 8. Army, has completed bis annual report, de tailing the work of fortifications, ami giving estimates of additioir.il proposed imcr*ve ments. Experiments Hith torpedoes ih the many harbors along the coast have enabled the Engineer Department to determine the size and buoyancy ot these destructive* agents ap plicable to the diflerent channels, and so com plete are the details in this connection, that, in case of emergency, the ship-channel of any harbor threatened by a foreign foe could be so obstructed with these explosive machines within a very few hours that a fleet of war vessels venturing to enter would bo blown to atoms. The importance of torpedoes was well illustrated in the Fran co-Prussian war,wherein France, with her immense navy, was rendered entirely powerless as against the thorough subaqaous system of batteries adopted by the German Government. Gen. Humphreys says it is requisite that a batallion of engi neers be increased to a minimum peace or ganization of 520 men, that number being requisite for the efficient condition of the tor pedo defenses of the United States, stretching as they do along the sea-c ast frontier gf 12,000 miles. For continuing the purchases ot such parts of the torpedo apnaiatue and materials as cannot be t-uddenlv ot*fcaine m time of war, the amount of $150,000 is askf and. Gen. Humphreys devotes a large port.on of his report to a description of the j. tty system, and a survey o* water-.’ines to the seaboard. He corrects an erroneous impression that seems to prevail concerning the use of jetties in this country, and shows how more than forty harbors on the great lakes have been improved for the benefit of commerce, without which that commarce could not exist. The Census Bureau. General F. A. Walker, Superintendent of the Ninth Census, has submitted ITs annual report to the Secretary of the Interior. He states that the work of the office, which consists of correspondence arising out of the publication of tie United Slates census of 1870, or having reference to the projected state census in 1875, or to tbo International Statistical Congress, has been done by himself, without expense to the Government, except that of postage. He regrets I ho paucity of results in the state cen sus of 1875, and says that in a country as young as the United States, statistical infor mation is of special importance in guiding its social and industrial developments, and taat the indifference of our people to the advan tages of such information is certainly not proof of a wisdom superior to the need. After naming a few states in which the census has been taken the present vtar. General Walker closes by taying that * uough n already known of the result to indicate quite clearly that the progress ot our population has icceived a temporary check. The Postefflce Department* The following interesting figures are taken from the annual report.of Fostnaster-General Jewell: During the year there were issued 107,616,* 000 postal cards, ot the value of 11,076,160, In the month of October last there were issued of the new cards 20,138,000, which is one-fifth of the entire amount sold during the fiscal year. The estimate of the number necessary for the next fiscal year is 154,967,0t0. The number of publio or ordinary postal stamps issued to postmasters during the fiscal vear was 682.342,770. of a value ot $18,271,479. The value of postage and periodical stamps was $815,902. The statistics of the Dead Let ter Service are of a quite romantic interest. The number of dead letters handled during the year was about 4,560,000. Of these 31,799 contained money aggregating $61,000; 14,225 contained drads, notes, and bills ot exchange of a value of $2,987,847; 135,027 letters eon tained samples of merchandise, postage stamps and miscellaneous articles; 3,740,000 contained nothing of value. There were mailed to foreign countries from the United States 12,500,000 letters. Of these 1u6,280 wore returned undelivered. The number ot letters received from foreign countries was 11,800,000, of which 219,100 were returned un delivered. Daring the fiscal year ending Jane 30, 1875, the cosc ot the iniand mail transportation was as follows: On 871 railroad routes, aggregat ing 70,083 miles in length. $9,216,518; on 89 steamboat routes, aggregating 15,783 miles in length, 1684,130; on 7,323 other routes, desig nated ‘‘star routes,’’ aggregating 192,002 miles in length, $5,453,721. Total cost during the last fiscal year $15,354,869, which was an in crease ot 8,876 miles in length of routes over the preceding year, and a decrease of $48,683 in the cost thereof. The appropriation to cover the expenditure of inland u a. si-ort&ticn during the present fiscal year is $i7.518.01’0 t and the same sum is estimated f r the next year. The cost of mail notes .in op-iatu>n July 1, 1875, the commencement ot the pres ent fiscal year, was $14,949,069.18, to which has been added an increase tor July, August, and September, of $189,793.61. which being considered an average increase for tue several quarters of the year, would make the increase during the entire year $759,174.44. Add to this th e recognized service of the railways, estimated at $702,489.78, making the probable cost of railroad transportation for the present year 116,471,383 36. The Bure u of Education. Commissioner Eaton, of the Bureau of Edu cation, in his fifth annual rrport, presents some interesting statistics. The following is a summary ot a number of tables that are presented, showing the most important school statistics: Territor- States. ies. Total.

The Pension Office. Pension Commissioner Atkiuson, in his an imal report, sates that the immbi-r ot pen sioners added to the roils during the last fiscal year was 11,557, and the i mubtr dropped by reason of death, re-eniictment, re marriage, expiration ot miners’ pensions, failing to apply within three yeirs, or the discovery of fraud, waa 12,977, mskiftK a net* decrease of 1,420. Th.e number of pensions Iricretsed was 15,561. TWtdtd number of pensioners borne upon the rolls June 30, 1875, was 234,821, by classes as follows: Army invalids 105,478 Army widows and dependent relatives. .104,885 Survivors of the War of 1812 15,875 Widows of soldiers of the War of 1812.. 5,163 Navy invalids 1,636 Navy widows and dependant relatives.. 1,784 Total 234,821 The invalid roll continues to increase, and, notwithstanding the losses, numbered} 3,021 more on the 30th of June, 1875, than at the close oi the preceding voar, and for the first time since 1863 exceeded the roll of widows anch dependent relatives, its increase largely counterbalances the losses on the other rolls, and makes the decrease of the aggregate roll comparatively small. Its annual rates are also steadily increasing. In 1871, thd average rate of pension pa:d to the army invalid pensioners annually was $89.18; in 1872, $90.26: in 1873, $96.46; in 1874, $98.14, and in 1875, $103.91, or $8.65 per month. The rates vary Irom $1 to SSO oer month. The total disbursements of the Pension Bu reau during the last fiscal year were $29,683,- 116 63, leaving a balance from tbe appropria tions of $371,683.31, which has been covered into the Treasury. Tbe appropriations for tbe current fiscal year were: For army pensions, $29,500,000; lor navy pensions, $500,000; total, $30,000,000. During the past fiscal year 12,236 original applications for army and navv invalid pen sions and 17,111 claims lor increase of tbe same class were received, and 933 claim- have been withdrawn irom the rejected files and reopened upon addtional evidence. At the close of the year there remained upon the pending files 32,228 original and 6,722 increase claims of this class. Sunlight at Lust. [Detroit Free Press.] Why did this woman live? Had life one charm for her? Perhaps phe asked herself these questions, as she sat with her face in her hands and looked out upon the cold, cheerless day. There were no tears in her great black eyes— only such a look of woe and despair that the world should have been there to see it and to have it painted on their hearts. “Mother I” A little, wasted form on the wretched bed—a bony hand on the ragged quilt —a voice which told of hunger, pain, and weary waiting. She bent over him, and for a moment a mother’s love shone in her eyes, and her wrinkled hand rested on his pale face with such tenderness as only a mother has. “Lift mo up and let me see the sun shine,” he whispered, trying to put his arms around her neck. “There is no sunshine.” she whis pered in reply, a sob in her throat. “Kiss me, mother, and call me when the sunlight comes again,” he said. She knew that he had been dying for a week —sinking slowly and surely into eternity, but she had no friends to call in—she could only weep over him and pray God that she might soon follow. With a gasp and a sob she pressed her lips to his forehead, then turned away tq struggle .with her despair and her great sorrow. The cloudy, cheerless day faded into dusk. She roused herself for a mo ment and peered through the gloom to see if her boy still slept, and then she whispered with her thoughts again. And such thoughts! When darkness covered the hare floor as with a mantle, and when she could no longer see her own poverty, the boy suddenly cried out; “Mother! mother! The sunlight has come!” “ Not yet, dear Ned—not yet! It is night now.” “ But I see the sun—it lights all the room—it blazes into ray face!” he called. “There is no sun—it is cold and dark!” she sobbed. “ it grows brighter I and I hear such sweet music! and I see little Tom my ! ” he whispered, while through the darkness she saw his white face grow radiant. “ You are dreaming ! ” she sobbed. “It was such a bright sunt The music is so sweet!” ho whispered, clasping her hand. “ It is dark—it is night I ” she gasped, but he did not hear. The snnlight had truly come, but it was the sunlight—the golden rays re flected from the gates of Heaven—and not the snnlight of earth. The myste rious curtain hiding the valley of death had lifted for his spirit to pass under, and woe had been left behind. And of her? Ask the shadows of night—ask the river. When they found his little dead body she was not there. They cannot find her. If she is dead, God did not judge her harshly. Some tyieer Railroad Builders. There were workmen on the Pacific Railway even more curious than the Irish or Chinese navvies. During the summer of 1868, the Laramie river be came very low, much to the distress of a contractor who had cut a great many thousands of cross ties—the timbers on which the rails are laid—and which he expected to float down to the point where the railroad was to cross. He was at first at a loss to know what to do, but resolved, finally, to build dams across the river at various points, and when the stream was thus made high enough, set his rafts afloat. Large parties of men, therefore, went to work building the dams. No sooner would the men leave off work at night than thousands'of beavers would begin and work hard at the dam during the whole night. Water is always as necessary to the comfort of beavers as on this occasion it was to the welfare of the contractor; and it was probably fcr this reason, and not be cause they wished to see the railroad finished that the beaver community joined in the labor of building the dams. — &t. Nicholas. A citizen of Lexingten has in his possession a quill of a condor which has a history. It was given to Henry Clay in 1842, with an injunction never to cut it until he was elected President, when he was to write his first message with it. la case he ware not elected, it was not to be cut until a ‘ ‘ constitutional President wrote a constitutional mes sage for all the states.” After Mr. Clay’s death it was given to Millard Fillmore, but he was likewise unable to use it. During the last campaign the owner determined to give it to Mr. Greeley should he be elected. The quill, which is still uncut, is over three feet long and is as large around as a man’s thumb. One and God make a good majority. —Frederick Douglass.
