wtCMMBuammmm THE S H E P H E R D S T 0 W N REGISTER A N D J E F F E R S 0 N C 0 U N T Y A 1) V E R T I S E K. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. This document was promptly sent in to Congress on Tuesday, the first day ! of the tkird session of the Forty-second Congress. It was transmitted to the distaut press over the wires, commen cing to be received in Baltimore about 1 half-past one o'clock and ending about tluee P. M. It was given to the public by the press in "Extras. The Sun, however, stereotyping it and putting it forth in good form, w.th satisfactory promptness. It apyears in our Supple ment to-day, with abstracts oi othei ot the official documents. Not only has the past year, according to the President's message, been without any startling event, and with the excep tion of the * Boston tire, without any marked 'calamity to cloud the general ; record of peace'and prosperity at home aud abroad, but the President has abso- j lutelv no special recommendations or suggestions to make boyond what have been forcsqadowed in previous messages for the immediate future. It is an ocho in effect for the wish recently expressed bv Prince B ism arch for the German Emperor and |?eople, that history with them might tor a while stand still. The tone of the message itself is dignified and official, offering no contrast in this respect to other similar State papers of late vears. Nothing of a personal char acter is obtruded, no allusion even being made to the fact that a presidential elec tion has taken place within the past year. After the usual expressions of gratitude to the Divine Author of all our bliss ings, national as well as individual, the message proceeds directly to a review, ? jually gratifying and succinct, of the state of our foreign affairs. Appropriate congratulations are ad dressed to the national legislature upon the results of the Washington treaty ? the award in favor of the United States pronounced by the Geneva tribunal and that of the Emperor of Germany in the matter of fhe San Juan boundary. Here again there is not a syllable to show that the award of #15,500,000 in satisfaction of the Alabama claims is not up to the full measure of the demands and pre tensions of our government, but, equally with the decision of the German Empe ror, it is accepted as entirely satisfactory. Thanks are awarded to the several powers and their representatives con cerned in these acts of arbitration, and also to the counsel and agents of the United States, for the spirit and manner in which they have discharged the sev eral trusts and duties confided to them. Immediate provision by law for the prompt distribution of' t lie proceeds ot the Geneva award among tin; parties entitled thereto is urged. The hearts of two great nations will re-echo the hope expressed by the President that the governments of Great Britain and the United States may remain as at pre sent, without a shadow to cloud their friendly relations. Congress is urged to the passage of the supplementary legislation required to give effect to other provisions oi the treaty relating to the fisheries *fce., the parliaments of Great Britain and Cana da having already passed laws to carry those provisions into effect. 1 he ap pointment of a joint commission to de termine the boundary between Alaska a id the c >terminous possessions of Great Britain, as also an increased appropria tion in aid of the similar commission now engaged in ruuuiug the boundary between the United States ami the British possessions, from t lie Lake o'. the Woods to the Rocky Mountains are also recommended. The suggestion is made that the in ternational S'atistieal Congress should be invited to hold its next session, three years hence, in this country, and that the centennial celebration in 187ft would furnish an appropriate oeeasmn for such meeting. The subject of the centennial itself comes in for appropriate mention jr. another portion of the message. An appropriation in aid of American exhib itors at the Vienna Exposition to he held next year, is recommended, also that two vessels of w:u* be commissioned to transport to Trieste and l?ack, arti cles sent from this? country for exhibi tion. Sympathy is expressed with Mexico in its efforts t<> maintain a stable repub lican government, and the revival of the commission heretofore appointed to in quire into depredations along the Mexi can frontier is deemed desirable, with a view of removing existing causes of com plaint. Allusion is made to the disturbed conditiou of Cuba, and the belief confi dently expressed that the abolition of slavery and the introduction of needful reforms into tl* local administration would not fail to advance the restora tion of peace and order. The promul gation within the past few weeks by the home government of regulations design ed to carry into effect the emancipation law ot 1870 is hailed as an earnest of the good intentions of the present liberal government of Spain in this respect. 'Hie owning of slaves in Cuba by Amer ican citizens is again adverted to as an evil requiring repression by law. The failure of Venezuela to make provision for the satisfaction of what are known as the "Venezuela claims" is again brought to the attention of Con gress, "for such action as may be deem ed proper." In view of the growing importance of our relations, commercial and diplomat ic, with China and Japan, it is recom mended that provision he made for the support and education of at least four American youths in each of those coun tries, to serve as part of the official fam ily of our ministers there, and to act in the capacity of interpreters and transla tors. More adequate provision than at present exists by law for the relief of shipwrecked and distressed American seamen in foreign countries is urged. At present persons in this situation must either throw themselves upon the chari ty of foreigners or be relieved at the private charge of our consular or other representatives abroad. Passing from subjects connected with ; our foreign relations, the recommenda tions of the message will be found to conform to the opinion already express ed by us, that the present Congress, in its closing session, will not be called upon to perfect or adopt any important I scheme of legislation. The more im- ' portant topics of domestic interest al- ; luded to in the message are brought for- ' ward more with a. view to their consid ; eration and discussion at the present ses sion than with any expectation or desire, apparently, than anything immediate ' should be done. With respect to the i all-important subject of the revenues uini ot taxation, the President plainly says : "I would recommend that no more : legislation be had on this subject, unless it be to correct errors of omission or commission in the j resent laws, until sufficient time h:is elapsed to prove that J it can be done and still leave sufficient revenue to meet the current expenses of the government, pay interest on the public debt, and provide for its sinking tund, established by law. | he piescrvatiou of our national ci edit is ot the highest importance. Next in importance to this corned a sol emn duty to provide a national curren rencj, of fixed, unvarying value, ascom pared with gold, and us soon as practi cable, having due regard for the inter ests ot the debtor class and the vicissi tudes ol trade and commerce, converti ble into gold at par." In these two sentences the whole financial policy ot the administration for the present appears to be summed up. It is one of ''masterly inactivity." A long list ot special recommenda tions ma Je by tho Secretary ot War, is , lecited, and "the favorable attention of Congress invited;" the report of the Secretary of the Navy is more briefly referred to, as showing, however, the important fact that "unless early steps are taken to preserve our navy, the Uni ted States will be the weakest nation upon the ocean of all the great powers." Suggestions are made tor the encour ment both ot inter-State and foreign commerce. In reference to the former, attention is suggested to the extension ; ot the James Riverand Kanawha and Chesapeake and Ohio canals, and the * connection of the Mississippi Valley i with the seaboard at Charleston and Savannah, by the way of the Ohio and Tennessee rivers and canals, and slack water navigation, to the Savannah and Ogeechee rivers. The project of a ship canal around Xiagra falls, on the United States side, is also referred to, and grat ification expressed at the results which have already attended various works of river and harbor improvement. In reference to our foreign commerce and shipping interests generally, the the confession is made "that the report of the Secretary of the Treasury will show an falling off in our carrying trade for the last ten or twelve years, and even , for the past year. He does not believe lhat public treasure can be better ex pended in the interest of the whole peo ple than in trjing to recover this trade in the expenditure of 

$5,OIK),()OU per ' annum for the next five years, lint in our judgment the evil is one which re quires a more radical remedy. The modification, if not abolition ol the franking privilege, with a view to the correction of some of its more glar ; ing abuses, is again urged upon Con gress. The scheme of a government 1 postal telegraph monopoly, which occu pies so large a spaee in the report of the Postmaster Ceneral, and which is des tined to excite a good deal of attention and discussion on the part of the press, i* presented as a suitable matter for con sideration and investigation by a com mittee or commission to be appointed by Congress. The President justifies his action un der the recent acts of Congress to en force the rights of citizens to vote, and to enforce the provisions of the four teenth amendment, (the bayonet-elec tion and Ku-Klux laws,) and the necess ity and salutary effect of those enact ments. Kefei ring to the numerous ap plications for pardon addressed to him j in behalf of persons convicted under those acts, he state that his action there on is not to be construed as indicating any change in his "determination to en force with rigor such acts, so long as the conspiracies and combinations therein named disturb the peace of the country." ! Satisfaction is expressed with the re sults of the Indian policy inaugurated by the present administration, and a tie termination to adhere to it without any I change, except such as experience may show to be necessary to make it more efficient. The ultimate removal of all the Indians into the territory south of Kansas, and the erection of a territorial government there for their protection, is suggested as the proper complement of the existing Indian policy. The practical workings of the land , oflice, the pension bureau and the pat ent office are illustrated by statistics collected from the reports of the heads of those departments. The near ap proach of the ninth census completion is to be taken in l.S7">. The condition of affairs in Utah is spoken of as unsatisfactory, and the atti ' tude of the Legislature of that Territory as hostile to the government. A care ful revision by Congress ot the laws ot the Territory, with a view to the ultimate extinguishment of polygamy, is reeom I mended. Satisfaction is expressed with the workings of the territorial govern ment recently established in the District ' of Columbia, which may not be alto gether shared by taxpayers and property holders in that District, although the further suggestion that the country at large should bear part ot the burden ol expenses incurred by the present board of public works will doubtless command their heartiest approval. The message finally concludes with a reference to the popular desire for civil service reform, and the need of further legislation on the part of Congrcss to render such reform permanent and effee j tive. I pon the whole, as an exhibit of the material condition of the country and its relations with foreign powers, the message conveys a gratifying im pression of rugged prosperity. In its recommendations it is singularly guard ed and non-committal, studiously avoid ing all excit:ng topics, an. I attempting the solution of none of the* more diffi cult problems connected with the finan cial and business interests which are at present engaging the attention of thoughful minds, and which are des tined to enter so largely into thepolitics ami statesmanship ot the future. ? Bait. Sun. Thursday morning last near "Rat I tail," Engine, No. 218, B. & O. Railroad, ran over two men, who were trying to get out of the way of another train af> proaehingfiom an opposite direction. One had both of his logs crushed and the other escaped with slight injuries. The man so severely injured, Cummings byname, was on his way to the funeral of a brother. Miss Sarah W. Lander, a sisterof tho late Gen. F. W. Lander, and a sculptor 1 of some note, died in Salem, Mass., re cently.
