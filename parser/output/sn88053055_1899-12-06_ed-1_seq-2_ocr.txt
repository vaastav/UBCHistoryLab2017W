The State Sentinel says: "The very driest political joke is that gotten off by one ot our county pa pers, Which claims that Colonel H. A. DuPont is a political leader. In the name of all that is true, who does he lead, what does he lead? A leader is supposed to know and be known of the people. As a fact there is not a public man—-if Colonel DuPont can rightfully be called a public man—who is as little known as he.

Bo hadn't died under the circumstances of whieb you and I know, he would certainly have died in a week or two from natural causes." The first speaker wrapped up the ey in the handkerchief, arose and, reach ing up, put the huudle in a hole iu the wall near the ceiling. "There," he said.

The officer said that ho and his companion had lodged both of thu prisoners in the jell at Brienne and would take them to Laiunrche the next day. It was a wonderful thing to Charles that bo had had such an escape, and he >lved to leave Brienun earl? in the morning aud take the railroad to Paris. Thu nearest station was six miles away, and Charles set out to walk. When he had been on the road tlemau came out of a villa, carrying a valise. Charles got ahead ot him and hurrying on when the gentleman called to him: "Boy, aro you going to tbe railroad station?'' he asked. "Yes, sir," the hoy tfsid politely, rais ing his cap. "Carry my valise for me and I'll pay you," said the gentleman. Charles willingly consented, and the gentleman questioned him as to hie busi ness, and so forth. Charles Mid he was going to Paris to look for work. When they reached the station, he was prised to find that the stranger had bought a ticket for him and expected him to sit beside him In the car. Having found that Charles knew a good deal about horses and driving, the gentleman wrote on a card which be gave to the boy, saying: "Take this card to the address I have written on it when you reach Paris. General F., who is a relative, told last week that he wanted a boy like you to act as groom to his daughter, who is an invalid." The day he reached Paris Charles call ed at Gcueral P.'s address and delivered the card. After questioning him as to what he knew about horses the general sent him to his country residence at Dreux, with a letter explaining the mat ter. Mile. F. was a lady of 32 or 83. suffering from nervous prostration. Charles answered ail the requirements and things went on very pleasantly for five years, by which time he was about 20 and a well favored youth. For dnys Charles was relieved from his heav iest duties, as his mistress was confined to the house with a severe cold. One morning he was walking along the road, rending u book, when a man in clerical garb approuched him, walking with his head down und his hands behind him. As they drew near Charles looked up and the man did the same. "My God!" Charles exclaimed. "My father!" The man started and gazed at Charles with wonder and amazement. "Charles," he said in suppressed tone. "Is it possible?" "Yes, sir; 1 nin Charles Guerin,' hour, a gen tile you hither? How strange !" Guerin said. for five years in the "I low It all se "1 have 1 ploy of General F. at his villa, attending her groom," was the Mile. F. upr answer. "It is wonderful," Guerin said, scarcely believe my senses. But let me tell you my story. My real name is Noiraigne and you are not my son. I and my wife were in General F.'s employ for years. Mademoiselle was at school in England and eloped with an officer in the British army, named Uamsay. General F. and myself went to Eugland and dis covered their whereabouts. General F. carried off his daughter and brought her to France. She was taken to Fresnay, and there a child is yourself. My wife and I take you away and provide for you. 1 became dissipated, as you know, and de manded more money from General F. It refused, and I used threats. I was escaped convict. "I born.

As a result of the disclosure, she received shock and died within a week. General F. denounced Guerin and Charles ns imposters, but a trial fully established the right of the young to his mother'* estate and to the name of Ramsay. Not the least important inci dent of the trail was the production of j the men who arrested Guerin and r cd (lie box containing his jewelry, the purpose being to secure letters in Guerin's which fully disclosed the re latioDship between Mile.

A correctly-shaped and well-fitt ing- sleeve adds greatly to the style of any garment. In fact, at the present time much attention is giv en to the close-fitting sleeves, the desire being to present a perfectly smooth effect With having the sleeve uncomfortably tight. The accompanying illustration shows a fashionable two-piece coat sleeve in pebble cheviot There is a slight fullness at the elbow, and gathers at the shoulder. The lower part of the sleeve is shaped in prettily rounded scallops. The dress sleeve is moulded on the same perfect lines, fitting the arm well, but not too tight. The under is narrow, the upper being slightly full at the shoulder and elbow. The pattern provides a line of peroration, which may be out lined by a band of cloth, braid passementerie, or a plain cap of velvet or silk may be applied in this shaping. The rounded scallops at the hand are finished with a band of stitched cloth. These sleeves may be fashioned in any seasonable material, and a fall of lace can be used around the lower edge of the dress sleeve, if so desired. To make these sleeves in either style will require seven-eights of a yard of material forty-four inches wide. The pattern, No. 7835, is cut in sizes for a 32, 36 and 40-inch bust measure.

CHRISTMAS. Toys sad Other Gifts Are to be Seen in Store Windows. Christmas is coming, surely enough. Take a stroll up and down Mar ket street and look in the store windows. You will find a hand some collection of gifts. Toys are everywhere and it is remarkable that most of the toys shown are of an ingenious mechanical pattern which but a year ago would have placed them in the list of dollar playthings. For instance a me chanical donkey, pulling a cart and driven by an old donkey, can be bought for twenty-five cents. When woundup the donkey will start off at a gallop, kicking his heels in hilarious fashion, until suddenly he halts, and then backs with the same sort of vigor that character izes all the obstinate long-ear family. Twenty-five cents will also pur chase a sort of "perpetual motion" toy, the ligure of a mason which climbs a chimney, lifts a weight in a receiver on hia head, and by force of gravity returns to the ground again. Little "gravity" wagons, trains and engines are sold for ten cents each, and athousand-and-one modifications of and improvements on the old jumping-jack idea are offered. Merchants are doing more Christ mas business than they have ever done this early in December, and all are looking forward to a busy season. In a few weeks the Christ mas tree, holly and other evergreen will appear and the season will then be properly started. $6 a Week to Start.
