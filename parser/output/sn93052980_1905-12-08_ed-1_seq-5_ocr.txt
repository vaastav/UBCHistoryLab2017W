THE TREATMENT WHICH INDIAN PAPOOSES RECEIVE FROM SQUAW MOTHERS. Indian Redskin Very Seldom Cries-Is Strapped to a Plank, Washed in the Creek and Hung on a Tree to Dry Out. In the Indian papoose child nature is essentially the same as in the Cau casion babe, though there is a strik ing contrast in their manners, due to maternal treatment, or as a student of child nature might say, to environ ment. The chief differences, really, between the little Indian and the little white is that the former is less a cry baby than the latter. The reason for this is that the white baby usually gets what he cries for if it be within moth ers' power to procure it Learning this from experience, for every mother knows how wise and shrewd the baby is, whenever he feels that a certain ar ticle would conduce to his content ment, he forthwith howls. Now, the papoose, so far from being encouraged in this vocal exercise, is repressed. His mother is unresponsive and the baby not achieving what he weeps for, soon learns that tears and wails profit not. Perhaps if the white mother dwelt in the deserts or the mountains so that baby's crying would not disturb the neighbors even she might let him cry till weariness brought sleep, and per haps if the redskin mother lived among sensitive neighbors she might seek to pacify the crying- babe with XAVAHOE PAPOOSES IXi THEIR LITTLE CRIBS, The kittle Redskin Not Achieving What He Weeps For Soon Learns That Tears - . and Wails Profit Not. bribes that the neighbors might not charge her with neglect of maternal duty, or her baby with an evil disposi tion. Yet another reason for the calm and placid habit and orderliness of the papoose as compared with his fair brother is that the darker little sav age has no cradle, crib or go-cart to sport and gambol in, but is either packed tightly in a basket or strapped to a board. In this position he finds kicking and squirming uncomfortable exercise and his enforced repose de velops into habit. So, the stoicism and the taciturnity of the Indian are nurtured in early youth, though of course one reason for the Indian's lack of fluency in speech is that in his life and thought he has not the need of many words. The primitive white man was not voluble. Bath Day of Papoose. The papoose has no nursery luxu ries as little pale-face babes under stand that phrase. He has no soft and tepid water prepared for him by a faithful maid or a fond mamma. He is never lathered o'er with perfumed soap nor dusted with sweet-scented powders. At intervals, usually two or three times a week, the mothers of the tribe or band take their babies to the nearest creek, pool or spring, un strap the little ones and tumble them into shallow water, where they have " a splashing time while the mothers swap the gossip of the tribe, for squaws are very feminine in their love of personal news and chit-chat involv ing other squaws, bucks and braves. The Amador Ledger. When the bath is ended a cloth is tied round the baby and he is hung up on the branch of a tree or a sapling till sun and wind have dried him. Then he is packed in his basket and trundled on his mother's back home ward to the family tepee. . Death for Weakling Babies. Nearly all Indian children that one sees are hardy and well formed. .This is because only those of robust consti tution survive the trials and exposure of their babyhood. It is desired that only the naturally strong should sur vive, for it is a custom in most of the tribes to wilfully expose, suffoca-e or drown born weaklings or deformed babies. Death is the lot of the un happy little baby whose health and physique are below the tribal standard. The Albino child, and these are more common among the Indians than might be supposed, is certain to perish soon after birth, because the coming of such a child is regarded as evidence of dis pleasure of the Great Spirit. The redskin babe is released from his lacings and swaddlings as soon as he is old enough to walk, and then his real child life begins. He has great freedom. When it is warm enough to go without clothes, and the Indian child is inured to cold, he tum bles and romps naked. His pets are dogs and ponies and is as fond of these as are his blond cousins. As he grows old enough to run he takes an interest in the athletic sports of the tribe and the usual young Indian games are deer and hounds, hide and seek, foot racing, pony racing, bow and arrow shooting,- spear throwing, wrestling, and follow the leader. Developing the Brave. The child is given every possible en couragement to play and is never whipped by his parents, because it is the Indian's philosophy that whipping breaks the spirit of the child and the Indian ambition is to be brave and self-reliant. It is a fact that though the Indian child is not subject to cor poral punishment and the ruder forms of discipline which white children are often made to endure, they are rever ent, obedient, docile and extraordina rily respectful toward their parents and seniors. It is the Spartan quality which the mother and father strive to develop in their boys. School of the Indian. The Indian lad of the wilds is not oppressed with book studies. He is taught hia nature lessons in the for est, among the rocks or on the plains. He learns by hunting, and camping with his elders, and every Indian lad tiies to win the prize of commendation by proficiency in those nature studies which the Indian holds is the highest form of knowledge. It is around the camp fire, or the fire in the lodge, that the youth learns the traditions of his race. His mental food is composed of stories of warfare, and the chase. The education of the Indian maiden is conducted by her mother, who teach es all the domestic arts which the Indian maid should know. A New Planet Discovered.

JAPANESE YELLOW PERIL HIOKI CALLS IT A MYTH. ISLAND NATION'S BYES NOT ON PHILIPPINES Japan Stands for Open Door and a Square Deal to All-American Aid Welcomed. Japan is inclined to resent the re currence of allegations in the news papers of this country that she has designs upon the Philippines. In an 'address before the members of the Cleveland Chamber of "Commerce, Hon. Kki Hioki, First Secretary of the Japanese Legation, expressed in no uncertain terms what is believed to be a definite statement of the policy of the Mikado with reference to the HON. EKI HIOKI Secretary of the Japanese Embassy. attitude of that nation in her future industrial and commercial life. Mr. llioki lays special emphasis upon the frank and authoritative disavowals of the frequently-reported ambition of Japan to absorb the Philippine Islands for her own people. \ ' "For the sake of argument,", said Mr. Hioki, "laying aside entirely lor the moment consideration of the mo tive of Japan regarding the present subject, let me ask you a question. Can you believe that this great Amer ican people who glory In their national spirit in their gigantic strength, in their boundless wealth, in their mar velous development, and look forward with proud and confident anticipation to the time when they shall be the first in the race civilization has set for man to run, would allow her flag to be lowered, be it in the Philippines or anywhere else which legitimately belongs to her, by any hands but hers? Xo, most emphatically no. That is the spirit with which you cling to your new possessions in the Pacific and that ought to be the spirit of the people who respect honor and justice. Would Mean Gigantic War. "And who can better understand that spirit of the Americans than the Japanese? Therefore, if Japan har bori'il such a sinister design as is at tributed to her, she must be prepared to' plunge in a war far more gigantic than the one just ended against a na tion to which she owes much that she is to-day and to whose people she owes that moral and financial support so unreservedly given at the most critical period in her history. No, the Philippines are not woriu the sac rifice of such a valuable friendship as that of America 'and the enormous losses in men and money which such a war would necessarily entail. Nor is Japan in a position to carry on an other costly war, but for self-defense. For Open Door in China. "The increased prestige of Japan turned the eyes of the. world toward the problem of what influence Japan will wield over China. Some people go so far as to assert that Japan will control China, proclaim the Mon roe doctrine for Asia, and drive out from the East all the white devils and exterminate the Western' influ ences within its borders. "Without questioning either the value of the principles contained in the so-called Monroe doctrine or it 3 applicability to the Eastern situation at. present, I can simply say that such an idea has not entered into the Japa nese mind and such a policy has not seen even the symptoms of formation. For the maintenance of the integrity and independence of China, Japan joined hands with Great Britain. For securing equal opportunities in China, Japan lent her eager efforts to the United States to make the open door policy effectively operative. Competition with America. "It is absurd," continued Mr. Hioki, "to say that in the course of a few years American goods will be crowded out of the Chinese market by Japa nese competition. The main ground upon which rests this apprehension is that Japan has cheap labor at com •iiand. But labor in Japan does not remain cheap. The effect of the Chi na-Japan war i. was to double the price of labor, and the war with Rus sia must raise it much higher. In spite of these disadvantages Japan must develop her commerce and indus try, and she will have to compete with all the world, . friend or foe. Her commercial war will be fought just as fairly and squarely as the real war She asks no favor from China that is not granted to the entire world. She stands for the open door and, in the words of your great President, 'a square deal." American Capital Welcomed. ! "Japan welcomes capital and mater ial from any country. VThe United States is supplying materials for im portant Japanese industries; why can not she supply the capital? Why can there not be a commercial alliance be tween Japan and the United States? We are willing to divide a fair share of the profits wherever gained with any people. The United States has been, is, and will be Japan's best cus tomer. „'.".'".( ' Future of the Orient. "The future of the Orient is great, and the greater it is the better for the world. With peace guaranteed by the Anglo-Japanese alliance, anu equal op portunities in Korea and China se cured by that treaty, as well as by the agreement of the policies of the three great Pacific powers— Japan, the United States and Great Britain— an important era has dawned upon the Orient During the last quarter of a century all the great events of the world have transpired in the East. For years to come the East will still be the center of the world's great happenings." 

BLACK WALNUT NUTMEGS. I Bishop Potter Was Sure That He Was Tasting the Real Article. The power of suggestion is- not merely a phrase; 'it really is a power. It has the strength to deceive men in the matter of cigars, wines, whiskeys and what not It is a force in medicine as every doctor knows. It is an agent in therapeutics. The power of sug gestion and the force of example are intimately related. But to illustrate the pranks which suggestion may play with one's palate the following story is told on Bishop Potter, a reverend gen tleman of ecclesiastic note and recent Subway Tavern fame: "-. In the course of his diocesan ram bles he called on an old friend from the South. It was evening, and the bishop was invited to supper, not din ner, for as people, of the South know, the appropriate time for dinner is mid day and the meal after candle-light is supper. One of the dishes served was cottage-cheese or as it is more often called in the language of the oldea time "smear-case." This is often eaten under a plentiful dressing of cream and sugar. The bishop elected to have a "mess" of "smear-case" but his ap petite craved a little grated nutmeg as a flavor. This was embarrassing to the host's wife at the foot of the sup per table, but she said to Aunt Dinah, who waited on table, "Aunt Dinah, bring the bishop some nutmeg." "Dar ain't no nutmegs in de pantry," whispered Aunt Dinah. I "Well, ask Mrs. Tomlinson, next door, to lend me one." ":".'. "She ain't got none. She done use de las' she hayde in makin* egg-nog," reported Aunt Dinah. i "Well, then, run down to Miss Bet- 1 sy's and see if she's got a nutmeg," said the troubled hostess, who talked with augmented vivacity and anima tion to make the time pass quickly till that nutmeg should be brought. Soon Aunt Dinah came in, her black face wreathed with triumphant smiles, and placed before the bishop the mess of "smear-case" generously sprinkled with grated nutmeg. '",-. "Ah," said the bishop, speaking with that tone of complacent assurance, coming from a consciousness of a per fect familiarity with his subject, smacking his lips and beaming with Flood Damage to Railroad Bridge on Nolichucky River, East Tennessee. A Fallen Appalachian • '. : >~'- Giant. FOREST DESTRUCTION ON THE APPALACHIAN MOUNTAIN RIDGES. a most beatific expression, "what a grateful flavor nutmeg does, add to smear-case. This is the paragon of the season." The supper dishes cleared up and the bishop gone, the hostess said to Aunt Dinah, "Be sure and get Miss Betsy another nutmeg at the store in the morning." "Lor", Miss, Miss Betsy didn't had no nutmeg, I jes' took a piece of black wal nut from de ole window sill what dat Yankee carpenter was repairin' to-day, and done grated it over de cheese. PRESERVING THE FORESTS FROM DESTRUCTION. CRUSADE HEADED BY PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT TO PREVENT FOREST FAMINE AND FLOOD RAVAGE. RICHARD HAMILTON BYRD. ■ Reserving forests in the: west from monopolization for private gain is a government policy with which the peo ple have become somewhat familiar, I our national forest reserves amounting now to nearly sixty million acres; but the idea of applying this principle to the older forests in the eastern states may be new to some people and yet is becoming a prominent one. Noth ing is giving it popularity and import ance so much as the great interest manifested by the President in the subject. There are proposed great national reservations in the Southern Appala chian forests, in the White Mountains, in Minnesota, and in other eastern states, entirely separate and apart from the great reservations in the west President Roosevelt is. an arch disci ple of forestry and the great promi nence into which the subject has jumped may be indicated by the growth of the Bureau of Forestry from a small office, a few years ago, employing half a dozen people, to an institution with annual appropriations of half a miillion dollars, employing hundreds of trained foresters in the field, and having the supervision, ac tual and tentative of nearly a hundred million acres of forest. If there ever was a national ques tion it Is forestry/ and 'the people of the country are wise in waking up, or fortunate in being wakened up, to its overshadowing importance before ir revocable damage shall have been done. The largest of the proposed eastern forest reserves is that in the Southern Appalachian Mountains and that its establishment is a matter of national concern was dwelt upon with empha sis by President Roosevelt in his ad dress at Raleigh, N. C, on October 20. He pointed out how vitally southern forests affect southern indus tries and thus the entire coun try. The entire south- -the territory east of the Mississippi and south of the Ohio rivers— is affected by this proposed reservation of some four million mountain acres in which rise all the rivers which water this area. The President said: ' "I want to say a word to you on a special subject in which all the coun try is concerned, but in which North Carolina has a special concern. The preservation of the forests is vital to the welfare of every country. China and the Mediterranean countries offer examples of the terrible effect of de forestation upon the physical geogra phy, and therefore ultimately upon the national well-being of the nations. One of the most obvious duties which our generation owes to the generations that are to come after us is to pre serve the existing forests. The prime difference between civilized and un civilized peoples » is that in civilized peoples each generation works not on ly for its own well-being, but for the well-being of the generations yet un born, and if we permit the natural re sources of this land to be destroyed so that we hand over to our children a _J|^

"One of the greatest of these heri tages is our forest wealth. It is tbe upper altitudes of the forested moun tains that are most valuable to the nation as a whole, especially because; of their effects upon the water supply. Neither state or nation can afford to turn these mountains over to the un restrained greed of those who would exploit them at the expense of the future. ' We cannot afford to wait lon ger before assuming control, in the interest of the public, of these forests; for if we do wait, th» vested interests of private parties in them may become so strongly intrenched that it may be a most expensive task to oust them.

CHARACTERISTIC ATTTTLDE OF THE PRESIDENT IN NORTH CARO LINA ADDRESS. set on foot similar to that so fortu nately carried out in the high Sierras of the west by the national govern ment. All the higher Applachians should be reserved, either" by the states or by the nation. I much pre fer that they should be put under na tional control, but it is a mere truism to say that they will, not be,reserved either by the states or by the nation unless you people of the South show" a strong interest therein. Woulu Prevent Floods at d Create Water Power. "Such reserves would be a paying investment, not only in protection to many interests, but in dollars and cents to the government. The im portance to the Boutnern people of protecting the southern mountain for ests is obvious. These forests are the best defense against the floods which, in the recent past, have, during a single twelfth-month, destroyed property officially valued at nearly twice what it would cost to buy the Southern Appalachian reserve. "The maintenance of your southern water powers is not less important than the prevention of floods, because if they are injured your manufactur ing interests will suffer with them. Tue perpetuation jof your forests, which have done so much for the South, should be one of the first ob jects of your public men. The two senators from North Carolina have taken an honorable part in this move ment. But 1 do not think that the people of North Carolina, or of any other southern state, have quite grasp ed the importance of this movement to the commercial development and prosperity of the south." The President's Message to Congress. The special message sent to Con gress by the President on the South ern Appalachian Reserve reads like a story. It touches upon the interest in the subject of the scientists and the lumberman, of the geologist and the farmer, i the meteorologist and the fruit grower, the business man and the eng'neer, and the steamship pilot and the homeseeker. The President transmits with his message a report of the Secretary of Agriculture, pre pared in .collaboration with the De partment of the Interior, upon the forests, rivers and mountains of the Southern Appalachian region, and up on its agricultural situation as affect ed by them, and says in part: The report of the Secretary pre sents the final results of an investiga tion authorized by the last Congress. Its conclusl>ns point unmistakably, in the judgment of the Secretary and in my own, to the creation of a national forest reserve in certain parts of the Southern States. The facts set forth an economic need of prime importance to the welfare of the South, and hence to that of the nation as a whole, and
