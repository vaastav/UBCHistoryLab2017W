MESSAGE DAY LOSES INTEREST advance Oistribution Robs Oc casion of Old Signplicance. PURELY ACADEMIC THIS YEAR impossible to Take Up Taft's Recom n.endations-Besides, the Democrats Will Postpone Important Matters Until They Are In Full Control of Congress at the Extra Session. By ARTHUR W. DUNN. Washington, Dec. 3.-[Special.1 President Taft's last annual message to congress was not of such interest as to hold the attention of all the members in either house. While it was listened to with respect and at tention by those who took that meth od of absorbing it, the fact that print ed copies of messages are now dis tributed gives members an opportuui ty to take them to their rooms and reas them at their leisure. Message day has not the signiflcanc4 that used to attach to it on the day: when the first intimation of what i contained came when it was read ii congress. Now there is such a wide spread circulation of the message be fore It is delivered that many person are pretty well acquainted with it main features. 

PUIU It LUI . Academic Discussion. This year it is realised that the mes sage. so far as it relates to general legislation, is an academic discussion. because it will be impossible to take up the recommendations and put them into law even ft there was a congress inclined to do so. At present, bow ever, it is known,Ahat the Democrats intend to postpone all important mat ters until they are in full control in the extra session. Who Are Radicals? por a time after Woodrow Wilson was elected there was talk about such conservatives as Speaker Clark and Leader Underwood blocking the pro gressiveness of the new president Then friends of Wilson began point ing out some of his utterances, which *aowed that, while he was a tariff rei former, he was no radical even on thn t subject. Later along come Champ Olark and Oscar Underwood with state ments that the pledges of the part3 most be carried out £k151s4as*jh*tff monsatbe reduced to a revenue basis. Then those who were beginning to believe that there was not going to be much tariff legis lation, after all, realised there was go ing to be real and effective action. Canal Jan. 1, 1914. One of the engineers who have been working on the canal zone for many years says that the canal will be open for ships JanE. , 1914. Various dates have been suggested by Colone: Goethals. and the congressmen who have visited the canal say that it will be opened in about a year. That will be much sooner than many Americans anticipated. Quintet of Eighteen-yuar-eld. When the extra session assembles five senators who have been eighteen years in continuous service will be among those who will take the oath of offimce for another six years. They are Bacon of Georgia, Martin of Virginia. Tillman of South Carolina, Nelson of Minnesota and Warren of Wyoming. These five are in a class by themselves Warren was a senator for three years once before, but he failed of re-elee tlon. He had also been governor of the territory. Ndison served six years in the house and was governor. Till man apd Bacon were governors. John Sharp Leotures. A congressional (eputation seems to be good for' a- lecture ,engagement John Sharp Williams is in demand as a lecturer at different times. It has been thought that when a man gives his time to lecturing he it apt to neg lect his congreusional wohk Williames will have time emoug to lecture for a few months, however, for it will take some time for the DI.D a rats of the house to get a tarif bill ready, and it is not expected that the senate will have very much to do unat the extra sassion.

Eve-up-to-date in Times-Demo crat: A smaller number of gifts and more love and care in their selec tion would aid in keeping the chil dren, and their elders as well, in accord with the true Christmas spirit. For the heart of Christmas happiness is kindliness and consid eration and concern for others. And this is very hard to keep in the midst of the holiday confusion. The thoughtful purchaser who buys few gifts, but buys them with love and care, lifts.a bit of the heavy burden which falls at this time on the shoulders of the shop girls. It is a season of noise and discords, of pushing and pulling, of long hours and bad manners. This is largely be cause so many people try to buy too many presents which necessitates the completion of their Christmas shopping a few days before Christ mas. To begin early and to buy less and with greater care is a way to extend the Christmas blessings of good will and peace so that they in clude buyers and sellers. So, suppose we simplify our Christmas, introducing a little more reason and restraint into our buy ing, and in this way have a little more time to remember those who in pain, poverty or loneliness will not have a very happy Christmas unless we help them? It is hard for those who are rich ly lbessed to think of Christmas in any other way than as a season of gladness and merriment. But therE are thousands of hearts filled with a peculiarly heavy sadness that day Attempt to Escape. At about noon today an iron bar in the window of the hold-over ad joining the District Court room war sawed in half by some prisoner. A timely discovery frustrated an at tempt at escape. Several prisoners were in the hold-over when the bai was being sawed. Red Light District. The health officer, Dr. G. C.'Chan dler, has given notice of his inten tion to have cleaned the red light district, which is in need of better sanitation. This is no less precau tionary as it is imperative. As this district may become a menace to the general health of the community, Dr. Chandler has directed the atten tion of the owners of property in that district that he will enforce rigidly every requirement of sani tation which is conducive to good health. glids Wanted.
