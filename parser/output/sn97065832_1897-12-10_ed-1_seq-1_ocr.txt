Crowds Tlirong the Galleries. 

"WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—The attend ance upon the opening session of the senate, both on the floor and in the gal leries, was notably large, despite of the •well understood fact that little business beyond the presentation of the presi dent's message and the proceedings in cident thereto would be transacted Prior to the convening of the senate the members passed half an hour in ex changing greetings. Mr. Hanna of Ohio, who has been ill for a week, was given a cordial reception by his Repub lican colleagues. Mr. Wolcott of Colo rado, one of the members of the inter national monetary commission, was also given a warm greeting. Dr. W. Godfrey Hunter of Kentucky, the re cently appointed minister to Guate mala, was an interested spectator of the proceedings from a seat besi.de his friend, Senator Deboe. Charles Page Bryan, the new United States minister to China, was a notable figure in the reserved gallery, and in the diplomatic gallery were several members of the Chinese legation and several other members of other lega tions. Senator Money, the new senator from Mississippi, entered the senate soon after the recess, but the oath was not administered to him during the session. The reception and reading of the president's message was the only feat ure of the day. The opening day of the regular ses sion in the house passed without un usual incident of any character. The formalities attending the inauguration of the session are dry and except as a spectacle hardly repaid the crowds which thronged the public and private galleries. Yet with a few exceptions the visitors staid through the whole proceedings. Mr. Dingley, the floor leader of the majority Mr. Bailey, the recognized leader of the minority, and Grosvenor (O.) enjoyed the distinguished honor of being appointed to wait npon the presi dent, whose message was, of course, the event of the day. Its reading was long and tedions, but it was followed with close attention by the members and the spectators in the galleries. There was no demonstration nntil the reading was concluded, when the Republicans joined in a hearty expression of ap proval. Immediately after the read ing of the message the house adjourned out of respect to the memories of Sena tor George of Mississippi and Represen tative Wright of Massachusetts, who had died during the recess.

CANTON, O., Dec. 8.—Once more the children of Mrs. Nancy McKinley have gathered around her couch, made sacred by her tenacious struggle agamst death. The reunion is complete. The presi dent arrived before the death angel had made his visit and took with him the spirit of the aged mother. The scene was a pathetic one that beggars de scription. In the midst of it all, there was a joy unspeakable in the breast of the president. He had again been per mitted to see his mother alive He had answered all the obligations of his country. He had fulfilled his vows to his people He had witnessed the as semblage of congress and had been cheered with the news at the same time that his mother was better. In the little upper room at the McKinley homestead this morning there was a scene almost too sacred for pen to write. The eyes of all present were filled with tears as they witnessed the remarkable and almost miraculous rally of the president's mother from the uncon scious state into which she had fallen early in the morning. As her son en tered the room accompanied by his wife and Miss Mabel McKinley, the sister of the president, Miss Helen said: "Mother, here are William and Ida." The president kneeled by her bedside, kissed his mother tenderly, reverently, and as he did so she put her arms around his neck and signified that she knew him. She also recognized the pres ident's wife and reached her hand to ward her. She recognized Mabel Mc Kinley and Jack Duncan. It seemed to friends that she had been awaiting the arrival of her son. Soon after she lapsed into an unconscious state,, and the strength that had been husbanded for the last meeting of mother and son seemed to leave her. An hour after his arrival, the president sat by the bed side, holding the hand of his mother. The attending physician was surprised at the remarkable rally. 

HOLECHECK MURDERS HIS WIFE! Nebraska Farmer Then Tries to Drown Himself, But Is Rescued. FALLS CITY, Neb., Dec. 7.—Last night at 9 o'clock Joseph Holechek, a pros perous farmer, living four and one-half miles southwest of Humboldt in this county, shot and killed his wife. After shooting his wife, Mr. Holechek at tempted to kill his hired man, and fail ing this, attempted to suicide by trying to drown himself. He is now confined in the city jail at Humboldt awaiting his preliminary hearing, which will come off today. The feeling is very in tense against him, and some fear of lynching is felt. Holechek had been drinking during the day. He returned home from town at 4 o'clock and had a quarrel with his wife, who started to leave the house for her brother's. Holechek followed and shot at her from the door, but missed. He then ran after her and, grabbing her by the hair, threw her down, holding her with his left hand, and shot her in the left side. After shooting his wife Holechek turned his gun on the hired man, who had witnessed the deed and had come to the rescue. The gun snapped and the latter took it away from the crazed man. The murderer jumped into the stock tank to drown himself, but was pulled out and bound by relatives of the dead woman, being bruised considera bly in his capture. CIFCLSTRR^picn. of Rapid City [Black Hills], South Dakota, Friday, Dec. 10, 1897. COMMISSION GRANTS EXTENSION. Railroads Will Be Given .More Time to Comply With Couplet- Law. WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.—The .hearing given by the interstate commerce com mission on the questiou of extending the time within which the railroads of the country may comply with the pro visions of the car coupler and train brak8 act is concluded at noon. The commission intends to take some sup plemental testimony under oath before coming to a decision. There seems to be no doubt whatever that an extension will be granted and that the extension will be general in character, the hear ing having demonstrated tuat any dis crimination would fall as heavily on roads which have complied with the law as on those which have thus far disregarded it. The impression among both railroad men and labor leaders who were pres ent at the hearing is that the extension granted by the commission will be a compromise. The railroad representa tives asked for five years, with the con dition that one-fifth of the unequipped rolling stock of each company should be equipped eash year, and the representa tives of the railroad organizations pro tested against an extension in excess of one year. Three years is generally be lieved to be the maximum extension which the commission will grant. The commission is evidently in great doubt as to their ability to impose conditions on an extension, and it may be that they will grant but a year's extension at a time, with the understanding that against those roads who do not com plete their equipment during that pe riod the law shall become operative. $200,000 BLAZE AT LA CROSSE. "Brick" Pomeroy Block and McMillan Opera House Destroyed. LACROSSE, Wis., Dec. 4.—The worst fire that has visited this city for years occurred about midnight.

CHICAGO, Dec. 7.—Outside of a sensational spurt in December wheat, which took place shortly after the opening, grain and provision markets were dull and uninteresting today.
