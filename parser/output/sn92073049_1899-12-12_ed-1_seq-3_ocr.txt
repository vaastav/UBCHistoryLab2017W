The granite business is enlarging very rapidly. Two corps of engineers have recently gone over the proposed new line of railroad from Winston to Monroe, pasging through Salisbury. From all reports it seems that the Seaboard A;.r Line people are desirous of getting into Western North Carolina, and are mov ing in this matter. Tho Supreme ZCourt l?s!; week re versed the decision of the lower court in the case of tho State vs. tho South ern Riilway, from Burke county, which waa an action to make the Southern Railway pay the penalty of II 000 imposed by the Riilway Com mission act for issuing free passes. The lower court quashed the indici ment against tho Southern on the ground that tho Rulway Commission act of 1S91, under which the present ment was made, was repealed to take tflLct April 4, 1899, and thft act creat ing the Corporation Commission be came operative on April 5, 1899, and, therefore, that the defendant could not be convicted on the charge. Scatesville Landmark: Col. H. C. Cowle3 yesterday received a telegram from Marshal Millikin, statiog that William Honeycutt, the Mitchell coun ty desperado, who killed Deputy Mar shal Gier id Mitchell county recently, had been arrested in Tennessee. Col Cowles has sent a certified copy of the bill of indictment to Tennessee so that a bench warrant can be issued for Honeycutt to hold him. Speaking of the big turnips, there ara others. Mr. C. M. John3ton, who cultivates the Ky farm, near the cemotery, had a load up town yesterday that attracted attention. All of them wero large. Three of the best weighed thirty pounds, an average of ten pounds each. This is big turnip year. The plan of Mr. J. F. Jordan, forJ fighting the tobacco trust presented at the Tobacco Growers' Convention here last week is as follows: 'Call county conventions of tobacco grovere of North Carolina, Virginia, 8outh Caro linaandEist Tennessee and perfect a thorough organization through a c:n vention made up of delegates selected by these county conventions. Eater into an iron-clad contract, which must ba rigidly adhered to, or else we cannot succeed in our purpose. This contract must call for the stipulation that not a pound of leaf tobacco shall be sold to the American Tobacco Company, and I will guarantee to raise tho six or seven million dollars necessary to han dle the crop and agree, to pay an ad vance of fifteen (15) per cent on the prices now paid by the trust." Mr. Jordan's plan was .discussed but no action taken. United S:ates Circuit Judge Simon ton has granted the petition cf the cor poration commission for a rehearing of tho railroad tax case. Tne date fixed for the rehearing is December 19 :h, at Charleston, S. O. The rehearing was asked on the ground that the recent decision of the State Supreme Court in the case of Abbott vs. Bddingfield holds that the corporation commission has the power to fix tho tax value of railroad property in the State. Judge Simonton, in his dacision shortly ba fore this, held exactly the opposite. A Federal judge ia bound by a State's construction of its own laws. Coun eel for tha corporation commission aay chat in view of the Abbott decision, Judge Simonton cannot now do other wise than reverse hi3 opinion on the question of the taxing power. The railroads, on the other hand, will con tend that the deliverance of the Su preme Court on the taxation q leetion was purely a collateral matter, not directly before the court, and that therefore a United S;ate3 judgo is not bound by it. Too corporation commis sion fixod the value of railroad prop erty in the State at $42,000,000 and Judge Simonton by his decision cut it down to $32,000,000. Mascott: Dr. Lewi3, Secretary of the State Board of Health, has issued to the State press an exhaustive and elaborate report upon the recent out break of fever at the State Normal, treating of tho epidemic , from fch? t. A defective BP er-pipe contaminating two of tho we ails used for drinking n' g purposes, he states to havo b: en tha cauee of tho terrible calamity. Tno water waa given a bacteriological analysis and devel oped numbers of colonies cf typhoid germs. Di Lwi3 justly exonerates from all blame the ble president and his faculty, who in this trial have proven themselves worthy of the trust and confidoDcaof al2. Ho eays that they have not in even the slightest de gree been negligent and that the mis fortune could not bo foreseen but waa such as might have happened any where. Such measures have been taken that there ia no danger of a re currence of the fever. Dr. Lewis sug gests that all towns and cities have a sanitary inspector and that all cover ed plumbing be carefully inspected especially that of public institutions. The State mourns with those who have been so deeply 6 fil-cted by thi3 sad oc currence. No douDt the president and officers of the Normal will have, as they deserve, the sympathy and sup port cf all.

R?garding growth the Raleigh Christian Ad vocatesaye: "Now there is hardly a section, from Oracoke to Oitolay, which is not regularly visited by a Methodias preacher. From the coass to the crags tho smoke 13 ever ascend ing from Methodist altars.

Over 800 per cent, increase in sixty years ! ' The Conference appointments show 155 traveling preachers, exclusive of presiding elders. 

BAPTIST STATE CONVENTION. The Baptist State Convention met in its sixty -ninth annual session Decern ber 6, in Asheville, N. 0., with the First Baptist Church of that city. Dr. R H Marsh waa elected president, and the convention adjourned for the Young People's Conference. It was decided to organizo a perma nent Young People's convention. Of this J. W.

Mr. Cleveland's report on woman's work showed that $8 746 was raised by women the past year. The Baptists in the S:ate number 175 000 white communicants and 140, 000 colored communicants, against 15,000 in all at the first session of the Convention in 1830. They have in all over 3. 100 churches and nearly 2,000 ordained preachers. In 1830 there were but 272 churches. Tney own and operate 5 chartered colleges and more than 50 high Fchools. The Convention, having named Ral eigh as next year's place of meeting, adjourned Sunday. The year juat endiog shos large in creases in the amounti raised for mis sions.

SPARKS FROM THE WIRES. The Latest Reliable News From the Earth's Four Corners Selected and Condecsed for Pro gressive Farmer Readers In the Georgia Senate, Friday, by a vote of 26 to 14, tho Willingham bill was killed and State prohibition de feated. The total casualty list on the British siie of the Transvaal war is now mounting to serious figures. It is sta ted at 4 189, of whom 4C8 were killed, 1,806 wounded and 1.966 missing. The London censorship over Trans vaal war news continues to be cf the strictest character. Virtually do news is allowed to pass except diaries of events within the beleagured garrisons and positions. Near Maysville, Ky., Wednesday, R chard Coleman, colored, who con fessed that he had murdered Mrs Jas Lashbrook, the wife of his em ployer, was burned at the stake by a mob of 1,000 citizens. Member Patterson, of the Virginia House of Delegates, has intrduced a bill to amend tho constitution in ref erence to the qualification of voters. The object of the bill is to get rid of the ignorant negro voterr Senator Kyle, of South Dakota, eays: Practically there is no Dimccratic party in the Middle West. The Reform party, consisting cf Free Silver Repub licans, Populists and Democrats has taken its place. These make the Ex pansion policy and the mistakes of the war the points of their attack on the administration. In Congress, Representative Hep burn, as Iowa, has re introduced in the House his bill of the last Congress to appropriate $140,000,000 for the construction of the Nicarauga Canal. Senator Harris has introduced a j iint resolutiun providing for the limitation of the time a President shall be elected to odo term of six years and making tho term of members of tho House four years. 

WHVT CONGRESS IS DOING. Cocgreas convened Monday. Eaor mcu3 crowds witnessed the opening ecenes in the House. The principal interest centered in the disposition of the case of Roberts, the Mormon Rep tentative from Utah. The objection to administration of oath to Roberta was entered by Mr. Taylor, of Ohio, as predicted, and Roberts stepped aaide without protest except to ask if by doing so he waived any of bis rights. To this the Speaker responded in the negative. The only feature out of tho ordinary was the afi option of the Reed rules for the present Congress. The Democrats knev it was futile to more than protest against the adoption cf these rulea after the Republicans had decided upon thia course in caucus. Very early in the day the monster pe tition, said to consist of seven million names protesting against the seating of Mr. R berts, was brought into the hall. It had been collected by a New York newspaper. It consisted of 28 rolls of names, each two feet in diam eter, encased in the American flag. These rolls were stacked up in the area in front of the clerk'a desk and were witnessed with great curiosity. Nominations for speaker being in order, Mr. Grosvenor, of Ohio, as Chairman of the Republican caucus, presented the name of David B. Hen derson, of Iowa. Mr. Hay, of Virginia, chairman of the Democratic caucus nominated James D. Richardson, of Tennessee. Mr. Ridgely, of Kansas, nominated John C Bell, of Colorado, aa the Populist candidate, and Mr. Wil son, of Idaho, placed Francis G. New lands, of Nevada, in nomination as the candidate for the Silver party. The roll call resulted: Henderson, 177; Richaruson, 153; Bell, 4, and New land?, 2. Henderson was declared speaker. Congress nan Atwater, hav ing joined the Democratic caucus, vo ted for Ricbardson. On Tuesday, the House by a vote of 302 to 30, adopted a resolution for the appointment of a special committee to investigate the charges against Rob ers the Mormon Representative elect. By the terms of the resolution Mr. Rob erts is not only excluded from all par ticipation ia the proceedings cf the House until the committee reports, and the House paeses upon hia case but he is denied a eeat in the ball. Kitchen and Small were the only North Caro linians who opposed the resolution. Oa Friday the House adopted a epo cial order for tho consideration of the Currency Bill beginning the 11th. By the terms of the order general debate will continue until Friday. On Satur day amendments may be offered under the five minutes rule, and on next Monday, the 18 th, the vote will be taken. The Democrats, Populists and Silverites presented a solid front against the adoption of the resolutions and every Republican voted for it. PBESIDENnHSSSAGE. THR 

PRESIDENT DENOUNCES TRUSTS, DISCUSSES 20NF. TARY PROBLEMS, OUR FOR EIM RELATIONS, VHE NIC AH A GUA CANAL AMD RESPONSI BILITIES OF OUR DEPENDEN CIES. Washington, Dec. 5. President Mc Kinley to-dey transmitted his message to Congress. It was read in both houses and referred to the proper com mitteea, The summary of the message is as follows : The Senate and House upon the threshold of their deliberations are called upon to mourn with their coun trymen the death of Vice President Hobart. His great soul rests in eternal peace. His private life was pure and elevating and his public career distin guished by stainless integrity and ex alted motives. Country Prosperous. The condition of the country is that of unusual prosperity ; good will exists among the people of all relations and we have the friendship of every gov ernment of the word. Foreign com merce has greatly increased in volume. The value of imports and exports is the largest ever known in a single year. The Secretary of the Treasury estimates the surplus of the present year at forty million. The conditions of confidecc3 " have brought gold into more general use The custom receipts are now almost entirely gold. Redeem Greenbacks, President McKinley recommends ad ditional power to the Secretary of the Treasury to sell United State3 bends and employ other means necessary to maintain the parity between gold and silver. This authority should iccludo power to sell long and short bonds. He also renews his former recommenda tion, that a portion of tho gold hold ings be placed in a trust fund, from which greenbacks may be redeemed upon presentation. When redeemed they are not thereafter to bo paid out except for gold. Trusts Denounced, Combinations and trusts which are justly provoking public discussion, should claim the early attention of Congress. It ia universally conceded that combinations, controlling the com modities neceesary to the general community by suppressing competi tion, whereby prices are enhanced to the general consumer, are obnoxious to common law and also to public wel fare. There must be a remedy for such evil ; if the present law can be extended to control and check such trusts it should be done without delay. What ever power the Congress possesses over this most important subject should be promptly ascertained and asserted The State legislation which President Cleveland looked to as a relief for the evils of trusts has failed to accomplish its objects, whica is due to divergent views in various States. Uniformity of legislation in the S:ates is desired. Nicarauga Canal. The President extendedly reviews our relatione with foreign govern ments. The contract with the Marl time Canal Company at Nicarauga is declared forfeited to the Nicaraugan government on the ground of the non fulfilment of the ten years term etipu lated in the contract. The company has lodged a protest against the action. This appears worthy of consideration. Nicarauga can aff ord a fair hearing on the merits of the case. The great im portance of the Nicarauga Canal can not be too stronrly impressed on Con gress. Reasons for early action are stronger than ever. Relations With England There 's a marked discussion of the intercoursa between the United S;ates and Great Britain. This government maintained the attitude of neutrality between Great Britain and the Boers. Had circumstances warranted our good offi je3 would gladly have been ten dered. Cable to Manila. He renews his recommendation of a cable to Manila and recommends, in casa Congress should not take meas ures to effect this direct action that the government Pcstm&s'er General be authorized to invite competitive bids for the establishment of the cable. Cuba and Porto Rico The joint resolution adopted by Congress on April 19, 1898, by which the United States disclaim any dispo sition or intention to exercise sover eignty, jurisdiction or control over Cuba, except for the pacification there of,' and the determination 'when that was accomplished to leave tho govern ment and control of the islands to its people,' is of the highes!; honorable ob ligation and must be sacredly kept. Our mis lien, to accomplish which we took up the wager of battle, ia not to be fulfilled by turning adrift any loosely framed commonwealth to face the vicissitudes which too often at tend weaker states whose natural weel ;h and abundant resources are cfl eet by the incongruities ol their politi cal organization and tho recurring oc casions for internal rivalries to sap their strength and dissipate their ener gies. It is desirable that the government of Porto Rico under the laws o! belig erent rights, now maintained through the executive department, should be superseded by an administration en tirely civil in its nature. For present purposes I recommend that Congress pass a law for the organization of a temporary government, which shall provide for the appointment by the President, subject to confirmation by the Senate, of a government and such other officers aa the general adminis tration of the island may require; and that for legislative purposes upon sub jects of a local nature not partaking: of a federal character a legislative council, composed partly of Porto Ricana ani partly of citizens of the United States, shall be nominated and appointed by the President, subject to confirmation by the Senate, their acta to bo sub j act to the approval of the Congress or the President prior to go ing into effect. In the municipalities and other local subdivisions I recommend that the principal of local self government be applied at once. Hawaii' The President recommends the erec tion of tha Hawaiian Islands into a Ju dicial District; also that a government be provided forit, and recommends a more complete form of territory or ganization for Alaska ani also for Porto Rico. Philippines I beleive that tho tracs'er o? sover eignty of tho Philippines accorded with the wishes of the mass of the Fdtpinos from the earliest moment they were assured of our desire for their welfare. A most unhappy condition of affairs confronted our commission ers upon their arrival at Manila. They hoped with Admiral Dawey and Gen eral Oiia to establish peace. The coureo recommended by tho commissioner? has been pursued. The rebellion must be put down. A notable beginning haa been made by the establishment of government on the island of Ne gros, which is deserving of special con sideration. This was the first island to accept American sovereignty. The United States flag must be used in the Archipelago. Piracy must be sur pressed. The Sultan o Sulu will co operate. Th3 United States will not oc cupy any island of the Sulu group without the consent of tho Sultan. The future government of tho Philip pines will rest with Congres3. Graver responsibilities have never been con fided to the United States. The is lands are ours by title of law and equity and cannot be abandoned. Such a course would involve a cruel breach of faith and would placo the peaceable majority of Filipinos at the mercy of armed insurgents. It does not eeem desirable that I should recommend &. form of government for the islands, but until Congress expresses its will, I will use the authority vested me by the constitution. (3igned) William McKinley. On Saturday, 9;h, the Kentucky Board of Election Commissioners de cided in favor of Taylor, handing down a written decision to the effect that it has not the power to go behind tho re turns from counties. Blackburn and Goebel held a long conference and de -cided that the Democrats shall make a contest of all State officers, from Gov ernor down. More than one hundred armed men were in Frankfort Friday, apparently ready to hang the commie ioners had they brought in a decision that Goebel and the Democratic candi dates should ba seated. The capital was in a condition of anarchy, as the men were ready at a minute's t otice to begin shooting. The State Guard at Lexington and other points was held ready to move on Frankfort at an hour's notice.
