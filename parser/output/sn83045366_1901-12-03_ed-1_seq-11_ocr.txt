10 President Roosevelt's First Message to Congress the regular forces. The obligations and duties of the guard in time of war should be carefully defined, and a system estab lished by law under which the method of procedure of raising volunteer forces should be prescribed in advance. It Is utterly impossible in 'the- eacitement and liaste of impending war to do this satis factorily if the arrangements have not ibeen made long beforehand. Provision ■should bo made for utilizing in the first .voluntee/ organizations called out the training vf those citizens who have al ready had experience under arms, and es pecially for the selection in advance of the officers of any force which may bo raised; for careful selection of the kind necessary is impossible after the outbreak ot war. That the army is not at all a mere Instrument of destruction has been shown during the last three years. In the Philippines, Cuba, and Porto Rico it has proved itself a great constructive force, a luost potent implement for the upbuilding of a peaceful civilization. Veterans Eulogised. Xo other citizens deserve so well of the republic as the veterans, the survivors of Ihose who saved the I'uion. They did the one deed which if left undone would immense Gain From the Merit System. The merit aystem of making appoint ments la in Ita essence as democratic and American as the common school system itself. li simply means that la clerical »u>l other positions where the duties are entirely non-political, all applicants should ha\e a fair held and uo favor, each j standing on his merits as lu> is able to j show slieiii by practical test. Written j competitive examinations offer the only available means In many cases for apply ing this system. In other cases, as where laborers are employed, a system of registration undoubtedly can be widely extended. There are, of course, places where the wriiten competitive examina tion cannot be applied, and others where It offers by no means an ideal solution, | I)at where under existing political con-j ditions it Is, 'hough an imperfect means,! yet the besl present means of getting! satisfactory results. Wherever the conditions have perniit ted the application of the merit system in its fullest and widest sense, the gain to the government has been immense. The navy-yards and postal service illustrate, probably, better than any other branches I of the government, the great gain in economy, efficiency, and honesty due to the j enforcement of this principle. 1 recommend the passage of a law which will extend the classified service to the IMb trie of Columbia, or will at least en able the president thus 10 extend it. In improvement of the Consular Service. The consular service is now organized Under the provisions of a law passed in 1856, which is entirely inadequate to existing conditions. The interest shown by so many commercial bodies throughout the country iv the reorganization of the service is heartily commended to your at tention. Several bills providing for a new consular service have in recent years been fcubmitted to the congress. They are based upon the just principle that appointments to the service should be made oaly after c. practical test of the applicant's fitness, that promotions should be governed by trustworthiness, adaptability, and zeal in the performance of duty, and that the ten- New Mode of Dealing With Indians. In my judgment the time has arrived when we should definitely make up our minds to recognize the Indian as an indi vidual and not as a member of a tribe. The general allotment act is a mighty pulverizing engine to break up the tribal mass. It acts directly upon the fanlily and the individual. Under its provisions some sixty thousand Indians have already become citizens of the United States. We should now break up the tribal funds, doing for them what allotment does for the tribal lands; that is, they should be divided into individual holdings. There will be a transition period during which the funds will in many case have to be held in trust. This is the case also with

But for their steadfast prowess in the greatest crisis of our his tory, all our annals ■would be meaningless, and our great experiment in popular free dom and selfgovernment a gloomy failure. Moreover, they not only left us a united nation, but they left us also as a heritage the memory of the mighty deeds by which the nation was kept united. We are now indeed one nation, one in fact as well as in name; we are united in our devotion to the flag which Is the symbol of national greatr.ess and unity; and the very com pleteness of our union enables us all, in every part of the country, to glory in the valor shown alike toy the sons of the north end the sons of the south in the times that tried men's souls. The men who in the last three years have done so well in the East and the West Indies and on the mainland of Asia have shown that this remembrance is not lost. In any serious crisis' the United States must rely for the great mass of its fighting men upon the volunteer soldiery who do not make a permanent profession of the military career; and whenever such a crisis arises the deathless memories of the Civil War will give to Americans the lift of lofty purpose which comes to those whose fathers have stood valiantly in the forefront of the 'battle. I my Judgment all laws providing for the temporary employment of clerks should hereafter contain a provision that they be selected under the civil service law. Merit Alone Should Govern. It is important to have this system ob i tain at home, but it Is even more im i portant to have it applied rigidly in our insular possessions. Not an office should be filled in the Philippines or Porto Rico with any regard to the man's partizan affiliations or services, with any regard to the political, social, or personal influence which he may have at Tiis command; in short, heed should be paid to absolutely I nothing save the man's own character and i capacity and the needs of the service. The administration of these islands i should be as wholly free from the sus j picion of partizan politics as the adminis tration of the army and navy. All that we ask from the public servant in the Philip pines or Porto Rico is that he reflect honor on his country by the way in which he makes that country's rule a benefit to the peoples who have come under it. This ! is all that we should ask, and we cannot | afford to be content with less. The merit system is simply one method of securing honesi and efficient adminis tration of the government; and in the long run the sole justification of any type of government lies in its proving itself both honest and efficient. ure of office should be unaffected by par tizan considerations. The guardianship and fostering of our rapidly expanding foreign commerce, the protection of American citizens resorting to foreign countries in lawful pursuit of their affairs, and the maintenance of the dignity of the nation abroad, combine to make it essential that our consuls should be men of character, knowledge and en terprise. It is true that the service is now, in the main, efficient, but a standard of excellence cannot be permanently maintained until the principles set forth in the bills heretofore submitted to the congress on this subject are enacted into law. the lands. A stop should be put upon the indiscriminate permission to Indians to lease their allotments. The effort should be steadily to make the Indian work like any other man on his own ground. The marriage laws of the Indians should be made the same as those of the whites. In the schools the education should be elementary and largely industrial. The need of higher education among the In dians is very, very limited. On the res ervations care should be taken to try to suit the teaching to the needs of the par ticular Indian. There is no use in at tempting to induce agriculture in a coun try suited only for cattle-raising, where the Indian should be made a stock-grower. crews of the boats swam to shore, a dis tance of over half a mile, in a blinding snowstorm. The Wetmore struck a rock and the buckets of her wheel were stripped off, disabling her and throwing her and the two tow iDarges to the mercy of the waves.

MINNEAPOLIS JOUKNAL. The ration system, which is merely the corral and the reservation system, Is highly detrimental 10 the Indians. It promotes beggary, perpetuates pauperism and stifles industry. It is an effectual barrier to progress. It must continue to a greater or less degree as long as tribes are herded on reservations and have everything in common. The Indians should be treated as an individual —like the white man. During the change of treatment inevitable hardships will occur; every effort should he made to minimize these hardships; but we should not, be Expositions, Future and Past. I bespeak the most oordial support from the congress and the people for the St. lA>uis exposition to commemorate the one hundredth anniversary of the Louisiana purchase. This purchase was the greatest instance of expansion in our history. It definitely decided that we were to become a great continental republic, by far the foremost power in the western hemisphere. jit is one of three or four great land- I marks in our history—the great turning I I points in our development. It is cmi- j nently fitting that all our people should j join with heartiest good will in commem- | orating it, and the citizens of St. Louis, ! of Missouri, of all the adjacent region, are j entitled to every aid in making the cele- | brat ion a noteworthy event in our annals. We earnestly hope^ thai foreign nations will appreciate the 'deep interest our country takes in this exposition, and our view of its importance from every stand point, and that they will participate in se curing its success. The national govern- i i ment should be represented by a full and | j complete set of exhibits. The people of Charleston, with great en ; ergy and civic spirit, are carrying on an ! exposition which will continue throughout i moat of the present session of the con Science, Art and Public Libraries. The advancement of the highest Inter- i ests of national science and learning and the custody of objects of art and of the valuable results cf scientific expeditions conducted by the United States have been committed to the Smithsonian institution. In furtherance of itt> declared purpose— ! tor the "increase and diffusion of knowl edge among men" —the congress has from time to time given it other important functions. Such trusts have been executed by the institution with notable fidelity. I There should be no halt in the work of the institution, in accordance with the plans which its secretary has presented, for the preservation of the vanishing races of great North American, animals in the I National Zoological park. The urgent j needs of the National museum are recotn- ' mended to the favorable consideration of the congress. Perhaps the most characteristic educa tional movement of the past five years Is that which has created the modern public library and developed it into broad and active service. There are new over f>,ooo public libraries in the United States, the product of this period. In addition to accumulating material, they are also striv- I ing by organization, by improvement in ' Census Office a Permanent Bureau. For the Bake of good administration, sound economy, and the advancement of science, the census office ac now consti tuted should be made a permanent gov Wondrous Growth of the Postal Service. The remarkable growth of the postal service is shown in the fact that its revenues have doubled and its expendi tures have nearly doubled within twelve years. Its progressive development com pels constantly increasing outlay, but in this period of business energy and pros perity its receipts grow so much faster than its expenses that the annual deficit hag been steadily reduced from' $11 411 - 779 in 1897 to $3,923,727 in 1901. Among recent postal advances the success of rural free delivery wherever established has been so marked, and actual experience has made its benefits so plain, that the demand for its extension is general and urgent.

TAXING OLEO Farther Llgrht Upon the Bil} Intro duced by McCleary. Special to Tho Journal. Washington, Dec. 3.—Following is the text of the oleomargarine bill introduced in the house by Mr. McCleary o f Minne sota: Be it enacted, etc.. That all articles known as oleomargarine, butterine, imitation but ter, or imitation cheese, or any substance in the semblance of butter or cheese not the usual product of the dairy and not made exclusively of pure and unadulterated milk or cream, transported into any state or ter-' ritory, or the District of Columbia, and re maining therein for use, consumption, sale or storage therein, shall, upon the arrival within the Umite of auch state or territory, or the District of Columbia, he subject to tha operation and effect of the laws of such state or territory, or the District of Columbia, en acted in the exercise of its police powers, to the same extent and in the same manner as though such articles or substances nad been produced in such state of territory, or the District of Columbia, and shall not be ex empt therefrom by reason of being introduced therein in original packages or otherwise: Provided, That nothing in this act shall be construed to permit any state to forbid the manufacture or sale of oleomargarine in sep arate and distinct form and in suoh manner as -will advise the consumer of its real char acter, free from coloration or ingredient that cauees it to look like butter. Section 2. That on and after July 1, 1902, the tax upon oleomargarine, aa prescribed in section S of the act approved August 2, 1886, and entitled "An act denning butter, al«o imposing a tax upon and regulating the man ufacture, sale, importation and exportation of oleomargarine," shall be 10 cents per pound when the oleomargarine is colored in imitation of butter, the tax to be paid by the manufacturer and to be levied and col lected in accordance with the provisions of said act: Provided, That on oleomargarine not colored in imitation of butter there shall cause of them, hesitate to make the change. There should be a continuous reduction in the number of agencies. In dealing with the aboriginal races, few things are more important than to preserve them from the terrible physical and moral degradation resulting from the liquor traffic. We are doing all we can to save our own Indian tribes from this evil. Wherever, by international agree ment, this same end can be attained as regards races where we do not possess exclusive control, every effort should be made to bring it about. gress. I heartily commend this exposition to the good will of the people. It deserves all the encouragement that can be given it. The managers of the Charleston expo sition have requested the cabinet officers to place thereat the government exhibits' which have' been at Buffalo, promising to pay the necessary expenses. I have taken the responsibility of directing that this be done, for I feel that it is due to Charleston to help her in her praiseworthy effort. !n my opinion the management should not be required to pay all these expenses. I earnestly recommend that the congress ap propriate at once the small sum necessary for this purpose. The Pan-American exposition at Buffalo has just closed. Both from the industrial ai^d the artistic standpoint this exposition hay been in a high degree creditable and useful, not merely to Buffalo, but to the United States. The terrible tragedy of the president's assassination Interfered ma terially with its being a financial success. The exposition was peculiarly in harmony with the trend of our public policy, be cause it represented an effort, to bring into clot'JT touch all the peoples of the western hemisphere, and give them an increasing sense of unity. Such an effort was a genu ine service to the entire American public. method, aud by co-operation, to give greater efficiency to the material they hold, to make it more widely useful, and by avoidance of unnecessary duplication in process to reduce the cost of its adminis tration. In these efforts they naturally look for assistance to tbe federal library, which, though still tho library of coc.gress, and ?» entitled, is the one national library of the United States. Already the largest single collection of books on the western hemisphere, and certain to increase more rapidly than any other through purchase, exchange, and the operation of the copy right law, this library has a unique oppor tunity to render to the libraries of this country—to American scholarship—service or" the highest importance. It is housed in a building which is ithe largest aud most magnificent yet erected for library uses. Resources are now being provided which will develop the collection properly, equip it with the apparatus and service neces sary to its effective use, render its biblio graphic work widely available, and enable it to become, not merely a center of re search, but the chief factor in great co operative efforts for the diffusion of knowledge and the advancement of learn ing. ernment bureau. This would insure bet ter, cheaper, and more satisfactory work, in the interest not only of our business but of statistic, economic and social science. It is Just that ihe great agricultural population should share in the improve ment of the service. The number of rural routes now in operation is 6,009, practical ly all established within three years, and there are 6,000 applications awaiting ac tion. It is expected that the number in operation at the close of the current fiscal year will reach 8,600. The mail will then be daily carried to the doors of 5,700,000 of our people who have hereto fore been dependent upon distant offices, and one-third of all that portion of the country which is adapted to it will be covered by this kind of service. The full measure of postal progress which might be realized has long been . ■ \v(£) "ou mus* uny **' Malta-Vita Food. jr f LV^yj ■ This wonderful new cereal preparation requires no Ilcy^CNrH .^dr 1 v^li^ cooking, it is nourishing and easily digested.

The extent of this burden appears when it is stated that while the second-class matter makes nearly three-fifths of the weight of all the mail, it paid for the last fiscal year only $4,294,446 of the aggregate postal revenue of $111,631,193.

Owing to the rapid growth of our power anAour interests on the Pacific, whatever happens in China must be of the keenest national concern to us. The general terms of the settlement of the questions growing out of the anti foreign uprisings in China of 1900, having been formulated in a joint note addressed to China by the representatives of the injured powers in December last, were promptly accepted by the Chinese govern ment. After protracted conferences the plenipotentiaries of the several powers weie able to sign a final protocol with the Chinese plenipotentiaries on the 7th of last September, setting forth the meas ures taken toy China in compliance with the demands of the joint note, and ex pressing their satisfaction therewith. It ■will be laid toefore the congress, with a report of the plenipotentiary on behalf of the United States, Mr. William Woodville ■Roekhill, to whom high praise is due for the tact, good judgment, and energy he has dislpayed in performing an exception ally difficult'and delicate task. The agreement reached disposes in a manner satisfactory to the powers of the various grounds? of complaint, and will •contribute materially to better future re lations between China and the powers. Reparation has been made by China for the murder of foreigners during the up rising and punishment has been inflicted on the officials, however high in rank, recognized as responsible for or having participated in the outbreak. Official examinations have ibeen forbidden for a period of five years in all cities in which foreigners have been murdered or cruelly treated, and edfets have been issued mak ing all officials directly responsible for the future safety of foreigners and for the suppression of violence aganist them. Provisions have been made for insuring the future safety of the foreign repre sentatives in Peking by setting aside for their exclusive use a quarter of the city which the powers can make defensible and in which they can if necessary main tain permanent military guards; 'by dis mantling the military works between the capital and the sea; and by allowing the temporary maintenance of foreign mili tary posts along this line. An edict has been issued by the emperor of China pro hibiting for two years the importation of arms and ammunition into China. China rhas agreed to pay adequate indemnities to the states, societies and individuals for the losses sustained 'by them and for the expenses of the military expeditions sent by the various powers to protect life and restore order. Pan-American Congress —Mexico Repaid. We view with lively interest and keen hopes of beneficial results the proceedings of the Pan-American congress, convoked at the invitation of Mexico, and now sit ting at the Mexican capital. The dele gates of the United States are under the most liberal instructions to co-operate with their colleagues in all matters prom ising advantage to the great family of American commonwealths, as well in their relations among themselves as in their domestic advancement and in their inter course with the world at large.

But much of the matter.which enjoys the privileged rate is wholly outside of the intent of the law, and has secured ad mission only through an evasion of its re quirements or through lax construction. The proportion of such wrongly Included matter is estimated by postal experts to be one-half of the whole volume of sec ond-class mail. If it be only one-third or one-quarter, the magnitude of the bur den is apparent/ The postofflce depart ment has now undertaken to remove the abuses so far as is possible by a stricter application of the law; and it should be sustained in its effort. Facilitating; Chinene Vorelgn Trade. Under the provisions of the joint note of December, 1900, China has agreed to revise the treaties of commerce and nav igation and to take such other steps for the purpose of facilitating foreign trade as the foreign powers may decide to be needed. The Chinese government has agreed to participate financially in the work of bettering the water approaches to Shang hai and to Tientsin, the centers of for eign trade in central and northern China, and an international conservancy board in which the Chinese government Is largely represented, has been provided for the improvement of the Shanghai liver and the control of its navigation. In ttie same line of commercial advan tages a revision of the present tariff on imports has been assented to for the purpose of substituting specific for ad valorem duties, aud an expert has been sent abroad on the part of the United States to assist in this work. A list of articles to remain free of duty, including flour, cereals and rice, gold and silver coin and bullion, has also been agreed upon in the settlement. During these troubles our government has unswervingly advocated moderation, and has materially aided in bringing about an adjustment which tends to enhance the welfare of China and to lead to a more beneficial intercourse between the empire and the modern world; while in the critical period of revolt and massa cre we did our full share in safeguarding life and property, restoring order, and vindicating the national interest and honor. It behooves us to continue in these paths, doing whe-t lies in our power to foster feelings of good will, and leaving no effort untried to work out the great policy of full and fair intercourse be tween China and the nations, on a foot ing of equal rights and advantages to all. We advocate the "open door," with all that it implies; not merely the procure ment of enlarged commercial opportunities on the coasts, but access to the interior by the waterways with which China has been so extraordinarily favored. Only by bringing the people of. China into peace ful and friendly community of trade with all the peoples of the earth can the work now auspiciously begun be carried to fru ition. In the attainment of this purpose we necessarily claim parity of treatment, under the conventions,, throughout the empire for our trade and our citizens with those of all other powers. Abra awards against Mexico have been adjudged by the highest courts of our country to have been obtained through fraud and perjury on the part of the claimants, and that in accordance with the acts of the congress the money re maining in the hands of the secretary of state on these awards has been returned to Mexico. A considerable portion of the money received from Mexico on these j awards had been paid by this government I to the claimants before the decision of the courts was rendered. My judgment is that the congress should return to Mexico an amount equal to the sums thus already paid to the claimants. ley died, our nation in turn received from every quarter of the British empire ex pressions of grief and sympathy no less sincere. The death of the Empress Dow- ager Frederick of Germany also aroused the genuine sympathy of I the American people; and this sympathy was cordially reciprocated by Germany when the presi- .. dent was assassinated. ! Indeed, from . every quarter fo the civilized world we received, at the time of he president's death, assurances of such grief and re- I gard as to touch the heart? of our people. I In the midst of our affliction we rever ently thank the Almighty that we are at peace with the nations of j mankind; and we firmly intend that our policy shall be such as to continue unbroken these In ternational relations of mutual respect and good will. —Theodore Roosevelt.
