The State Journal Is a memW ot the Associated Press and receives tne full day teiejsraDh report at that great news or. ranization for exclusive evening publi cs Hon in Topeka. The State Journal receives for exclusive publication the leased wire report Gf tne Publishers' Press tor the edition for Ban cs v morning:. The news is received In the Ptats Jour nal building over wires for this sole pur pose. Moscow is evidently a good place not to hold a peace conference. Another strong point in favor of the president's message is that the New fork American was disappointed in it. Senator Depew has been credited with Wearing a smile that won't come off, tout there is a suspicion abroad that it ia evaporating. Xow the price of Mr. J. Pierpont Mor gan's gold brick has advanced to ten minion dollars but we still find it very easy to conceal our sorrow. Very likely I. K. Lambert can think "f a precedent which ought to satisfy IHstrict Attorney Dean that he was rot necessarily entitled to a reappointment. The worst thing about the federal regulation of life insurance companies ihat the president recommends is that pome of the insurance companies favor it also. Anyway Mabelje Gilman is acquiring a choice line of theatrical advertising notwithstanding the damage it may be doing to the family and feelings of Mil lionaire Corey. It is announced that Kansas will gret 130,000 packages of congressional seeds in the annual free seed distribution that is about to begin. But will congress guarantee that they will grow? The Lawrence Journal seems to have been badly scooped in finding out that J. Leeford Brady was to be its new editor. All the other papers made the discovery a week ahead of the esteemed Journal. The president discusses corporations otherwise known as trusts in such an off-hand way in his message that one is constrained to believe he could t-ay still more on the subject should the occasion demand it. Mr. John A. McCall had an idea it was only a little breeze, but as he sees the havoc it has brought, to the house of McCurdy he is convinced it must be a regular hurricane. And what bothers him most is that it is still blowing. A dispatch from Washington says Sresident Roosevelt thinks football ought to be a kicking game. If the 14-esldent should hear the way some teams abuse the referee he wouldn't want any more kicking in it than there Is now. Notwithstanding all the fun that has Tree it poked at Harvard because of its poor showing in football, it is noticed that the all-eastern team contains four Harvard players, the same number as Tale, while Dartmouth, Princeton and Pennsylvania have only one each. "Czar Nicholas," says the Chicago News, "has surrounded himself with 53,000 troops and now feels sure that iiis loving subjects won't do anything 9o harm him." Yes, he would feel cuite comfortable if he were also sure Ifcat his 16,000 troops won't either. Nevada seems to be attractive to per sons near the top of the steel trust. Mr. Schwab, the former head of the trust, has gone to Nevada to get himseif elect ed to the United States senate, and the w;? of the present head of the trust has gone there to get a divorce. Mrs. W. E. Stanley and Mrs. Cora Or. Lewis will assist the state board of control in purchasing the supplies for the state's charitable institutions. This isn't a bad idea. The average woman is a far better buyer than the average man when it comes to purchasing household supplies. "Governor Hanly of Indiana," says the Kansas City Star, "has ousted his adjutant general as peremptorily as he did the state auditor. Hanly has a way of ousting dishonest officials first and having his prolonged 'controversy' with th"m afterward. Which is better than the Kansas plan." The farmers down in the Second dis trict really ought to get a few more congressional candidates like Henry Alien into the field. The congressiona! candidate fieid is here referred to. It is related that Mr. Alien carries an expert oorn-husker with him in the canvassing tour he is making in the district this fall. When he runs across a farmer husking corn he stops the farmer and puts his own man to work in the corn field, so that trie farmer shall not lose valuable time in listen ing to Mr. Alien's observations about ,-n(, v pother and other matters inei tten'.Hlh'. Now if tic-re wei-r- enough etiliUt fflfowii.fr Mr. Alton's plan ; ,s tanners couii put la- conslderuble time saving the country, and their corn-husking would not be neglected in the meantime. The plan certainly has its good features. A 

RECORD TO BE PROUD OP. How proud of their record must be the gentlemen who compose the state school fund commission of Kansas! As they glance back over the deals they have made and the bonds they have bought, can they not proudly exclaim, "Couid we have done better for ourselves and our friends?" To be sure the school fund may have suffered. The children of the state may have been defrauded out of some of their education in order that these "success ful" deals might be made, but that is evidently not what the Kansas school fund commissioners are looking out lor. This proud record begins just a f.--w days after the present commission got possession of the school fund, when Mr. J. R. Burrow as chairman of the school fund commission purchased from Mr. J. R. Burrow as president of the Home Investment company $14,000 of Smith Center bonds. The bond3 are, of course, good, but Mr, Burrow as president of the school fund commission was so care ful of the interests of Mr. Burrow as principal owner of the bonds that he allowed the latter Mr. Burrow to clip enough coupons from the bonds they were bearing five per cent interest to bring them down to four per cent, there by netting Mr. Burrow as chief owner of the bonds something over $2,000 profit on the deal, to the detriment of the school children's trust fund of which Mr. Burrow was a trustee. How many such deals the commis sion has to its credit the State Journal does not know. It does know, however, of the Dodge City deal, which Superin tendent Dayhoff seemed anxious to get through for his bond broker friend, D. E. Dunn, but which was stopped, after Messrs. Burrow and Coleinun had signed the warrant to pay for the bonds, by the refusal of the auditor's office to register them, and the subsequent discovery that the valuation figures of Dodge City had been juggled to get thein. high enough to allow the bonds to be legally pur chased. The State Journal also knows of the Comanche county bond deal, whereby either the state school fund stands to lose $123,000, or the people of Coman che county have had fastened upon them by the state an unjust and dis honest debt a debt that they never contracted, from which they never secured one cent'8 worth of benefit, and which no moral obligation binds them to pay, although a court decree does so. The devious and secret manipulations by which this deal was carried out, including the embezzle ment of $123,000 of the state's money to finance it, are too familiar to the people of Kansas to need repeating here; and it was all done to aid an other bond broker friend of the com mission to make a profit of something over $11,000 on the deal: It was, per haps, the school fund commission's proudest achievement, The carefulness with which the school children's money has been in vested is shown by the fact that after the First National bank failure the commission could not buy a large number of gilt-edged bonds on account of "no funds," although the books showed something like $300,000 on hands. And at the same time T. T. Kelly, as state treasurer, was securing funds from some mysterious source with which to meet warrants, to refuse to pay which might have been ex tremely serious for him. Then there is the latest exhibition of carefulness on the part of the school fund commission as brought out this week in the Wichita bond case care fulness to buy of certain friendly brokers. The city of Wichita offered, through its mayor, $45,000 of 4 per cent bonds, but the rate was too low to suit the school fund commissioners. They have become very particular at times since the Smith Center deal. But Mayor Ross discovered that other 4 per cent offers, not as good as his, had been taken when offered by brokers or friends of the commission instead of by a municipality direct. Whe.i he presented these facts to the commission, Messrs. Burrow, Dayhoff and Coleman concluded that the Wich ita bonds might be a good investment after all. Really, these gentlemen ought to have been in charge of a New York life insurance company. 

MITCHELL. The end that has come to John H. Mitchell, convicted United States sena tor from Oregon, is indeed pitiable. A man who for forty years has held a high and honorable place in the af- j fairs of men most of that time in the United States senate; comes to the close of his career dishonored and dis graced, because he yielded to perhaps a single temptation late in his career. Senator Mitchell was not regarded as simply an ordinary grafter. While he may have made mistakes, until within recent months he has been re garded as a highly honorable gentle man. At the age of seventy years the reputation of a lifetime was swept from him by the discovery of his con nection with the Oregon land frauds, a charge that his colleagues could not credit and his friends refused to be lieve when first made. With disgrace fastened upon him in his old age and imprisonment in a common jail staring him in the face, it is little wonder that his health was undermined; and when seized with a slight affliction his physical nature could not resist it. The sad part of it is that Senator Mitchell should have sacrificed a life long honorable reputation by giving way as he did to dishonor, and should then be cut off with no opportunity to retrieve himself. Senator Mitchell's case is conspicu ous because of his prominence and the height from which he fell; yet similar cases are by no means rare in the an nals of everyday life. Why can not men learn the terrible lesson of giving way to dishonor from example instead of experience? Every Kansas editor who knows John E. Junkin. and most of thm do. will j vote aye three or four times on the proposition to make . him president cf the National Editorial association. Junkin is somewhat peculiar. Although he finds time to "gad" a good deal to all the editorial associations, he man ages to get out a number one country paper in a number three town number three as to size but not quality, how ever. In some ways the Sterling Bulle tin is a model country newspaper, and its editor is deserving of high honors for what he has accomplished in the coun try newspaper field, particularly as he is an all-around good man besides. 

SUCCESS. A Boston firm recently offered sev eral prizes for the best essay on the subject, "What Constitutes Success ?" It was stipulated that the essay must be under one hundred words in length. A Kansas woman, Mrs. A. J. Stanley of Lincoln, submitted a definition of success in the contest. It was consid ered In competition tvith several hun dred others from all parts of the coun try, and a few days ago Mrs. Stanley received a draft for two hundred and fifty dollars, with the information that she had won the first prize. Her defi nition was as follows: "He has achieved success who has lived well, laughed often and loved much; who has gained the respect of intelligent men and the lovo of little children; who has filled his niche and accomplished his task; who has left the world better than he found it, whether by an improved poppy, a per fect poem, or a rescued soul; who has never lacked appreciation of earth's beauty or failed to express it; who has always looked for the best in others and given the best he had; whose life was an inspiration; whose memory a benediction." Mrs. Stanley i3 the wife of the county superintendent of schools iu Lincoln county. Her husband also represented that county in the legislature of 1899. JOURNAL ENTRIES A tlispateh from Washington says Louisville wants a mint. It has been the almost universal supposition that the region around Louisville was the home of mint, and that it is used most extensively there with a julep eombi l.ation. m m m It has now been several days since the central Kansas correspondent an nounced that the 1906 wheat crop has been saved. , . , Witte wants to quit being the czar's proxy. Well, you can't blame him. There are chauffeurs in New York who receive $6,000 a year, notwithstand ing the fact that others would be will ing to take the jobs and give their em ployers a rebate of $3,400 at least. The Edison company has spelled it "Xmas" in letters two feet high. This means that Tom cordry will have the jimjams about it if he should happen to come to Topeka in the near future. Someway the world doesn't look half as rosy to the railroad magnates as it did before they read the president's message. - Governor LaFollettes decision to go to the senate instead of remaining as governor of Wisconsin reminds one of the Irishman, who, seeing a crowd col lecting on the street, sent his little girl to inquire "if there is going to be a right, 'cause if there is pa wants to be iu it."

VKER JOTS Coffeyville has. a Thirteen club, which is also rash enough to meet on Fridays. The Republican-Register boasts that Washington has such good restaurants that not one of them used a phonograph to discourage trade. Observation by Albert T. Reid: Tope ka was fifty-one years old yesterday. By the way, a city is the only thing classed in the feminine gender that likes to boast of ita age. A bill providing for a federal building at Iola to cost $100,000 has been intro duced in congress by Charles Scott. Otta wa hopes to have a bill of that kind in troduced at the next session. Noticing that in a touching little poem in a current magazine the author pas sionately inquires, "Oh, Where Can Rest Be Found?" Editor Ingalls of Wash ington suggests looking in the dictionary among the R's. The conversion of five chorus girls in Wichita goes a long ways towards con vincing Henry Allen that the old ques tion. "Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?" should be answered affirm atively. The Kansas City Star kindly calls at tention to the tact that L. A. Bone, the Wichita man who recently pointed out the beneficent nature of the Standard Oil company, is an altogether different Bone from the new United States district attorney. A farm down in the Walnut valley was sold last week for $7.50. an acre. And there are men living in the Walnut valley who remember when that region was scheduled in the geographies as the Great American Desert. Up at Concordia the county attorney is holding an inquisition to find out a few things about joints, and Gomer Da vies rises to observe that a lot of Concordia men are just now like John D. Rockefeller both are making a su preme effort to dodge the officer with a subpoena. ,-Not very long ago the Webster oil re finery at Humboldt was so deeply in volved that it went into the hands of receivers. Now it is announced that it is out of debt. That looks as though the oil refining business is a near relative to a gold mine, when it is permitted to do business. POINTED PARAGRAPHS. From the Chicago News. Some girls can do anything-except acquire husbands. A newly married man looks like a new pair of shoes feels. A man has to use a magnifying glass to see his own faults. Even the baby in the cradle finds this is a pretty rocky sort of a world. Every new invention is expected to revolutionize things but it doesn't. Many a man goes broke because of the winning ways of women and gam biers. When a woman acquires a stunning gown tne dux is apt to snock her hus band. About the time a man thinks he knows a woman he discovers that he doesn t. All the world s a circus ring, and each cf us at times enacts the role of clown. ... hen a woman hasn t anything else to do she rips up nomothing useful ajJd maiics something ornamental.

RESPONSIBLE. In the congress now in session at Washington there is a Republican majority of 140 in the house and a ma jority of 25 in the senate. Besides there's a Republican president in the White House. It behooves them to play ball, as the party will be held re sponsible for the record made. Con cordia Kansan. - n

Russia is face to face with a revolu tion again, but Russia has stared that revolution in the face so long that even the revolution is growing ashamed of itself. Salina Journal. LA FOLLETTE. The announcement that "Bob" La Follette has finally decided to leave the governorship of Wisconsin and enter the United States senate is an agreeable one, for the reason that that part of the public which does not look upon LaFollete as a tired and true re former is anxious to see him tested. LaFollette has stood the test in its ev ery application in Wisconsin; the ques tion is. is he big enough to "make good" In the United States senate.' The answer to that question will be one of the most interesting spectacles the country has witnessed Among LaFollette's ac quaintances none questions his honesty or hifi sincerity. But the qualities he has demonstrated in winning his long fight in Wisconsin will get him into trouble with the senate. They will tan gle up with senatorial courtesy, and raise bumps on senatorial conservatism at every turn. LaFollette goes out of Wisconsin with the record of a great job, well done. He enters the senate as the western bull, sent with no little enthusiasm to mix things up a bit for the china shop of obstructionist govern ment. Ottawa Herald. ALBERT REID'S OPINION.
