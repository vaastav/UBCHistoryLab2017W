Lord Bvroii. The President's Message The message of President Wilson to congress is a good American document. Xo good American will take issue with it generally. Yet, it will not meet the same response that it would have evoked if it had been offered a year ago. Of course, the same menage could not have been presented a year ago. The occasion for many of the president's recommendations had not then arisen. We mean, though, that if there had then been occasion and the same pronouncement had been made that was made yesterday, the country would have been set on fire with enthusiasm and approbation. The ap probation is given now. The enthusiasm is lacking. The president has written or dictated too many documents within the year. They rang true and clear, as the message does, but the ringing has died away in faint and fainter reverberations. It has come to be impressed upon the people that high sounding ideals merely pronounced, procure us nothing. On high moral grounds the president occupied within the year two positions with respect to Mex ico. They were directly opposed to each other. Either was defensible but, manifestly,- both could not be. It is apparent now that whatever may be the present state of Mexican affairs, improved or not, the course of the United States ' government has not contributed in any degree to their im provement. Messages of our presidents, dealing with foreign affairs have always been awaited abroad with deep interest. In thie case, we imagine that the only emotion that stirred the European nations with respect to the message was curiosity. The warring nations of Europe within the last few months have been surfeited with American pronouncements couched in as vigorous language as could possibly clothe a message to congress. In the state of af fairs at home and abroad, a mere literary produc tion, however excellent, is not likely to ' divert popular attention from stern realities. If one part of the message more than another had been awaited with interest it was the section relating to the national defense. That had been largely discounted by the president's earlier utter ances and the published report of Secretary Garri son's recommendations. In few quarters has the defence program encountered complete approval. It did not go far enough to meet the views of a ma jority of those who favor preparedness. Any length, however slight to which it might have gone would have invited the antagonism of the uncompromis ing, pacific theorists. The feature of the message dealing with fiscal affairs will probably come in for criticism. Facing a great national deficit, due in part to unwise legis lation and in part to events over which the ad ministration had no control, the president urges that it be met by new forms of taxation so that we may "pay as we go." Some of the forms of taxation that have already been imposed upon the country in a time of peace are hateful because of their inconvenience. The president, we believe for purely political reasons shies at the more natural and easy way of avoiding a deficit, by means of a bond issue. Of the rest of the message there is little to be said. The recommendations are sound and are likely to be approved, if not by congress, by the country, though it must be regretted that while the president urges, in some measure, preparation for war, the message contains no recommendation of means to meet an industrial and commercial invasion. An American Minister n There is such a thing as being too uncon ventional in our dealings with people of the old world who have not become inured to our free and easy American democracy. While we do not think that Ambassador Page went too far when on the eve of his departure for the Court of St. James, he announced that he would not wear short pants at court receptions, there are some diplomatic con ventions that ought to be observed by" our servants abroad. They should act as much like gentlemen as they ought to do at home. The Republican has come into possession of some first hand information from a gentleman, recently arrived from Persia, concerning the activi ties at Teheran of our minister to Persia, John L. Caldwell. Mr. Caldwell was one of Mr. Bryan's selections. His chief and only qualification was that he was a "deserving democrat." He had per formed more or less valuable service for the party or Mr. Bryan in south eastern Kansas. He was a banker at Fort" Scott, he was reckoned a good business man in a small way, was a wholesouled individual and was generally voted a "good scout." With this equipment, Mr. Caldwell was sent to up hold the dignity of this country at a rather out-of-the-way but a very punctilious post, where, though he has not upheld the dignity of the United States to a vast extent, he has succeeded in attracting more attention than any other diplomat east of the Tigris. It is related that on one occasion the Spanish minister made a. formal call at the American lega tion. When he was ushered in the American min ister was discovered, in his shirt sleeves, his feet resting comfortably on a table. The Spaniard in the gorgeous regalia of his office stopped at the door to catch his breath. "Come in, old pal," heart ily urged the American minister without changing his position, "have a chair and make yourself at home Well, how's things?" There was a court reception at Teheran not long ago in honor of the regent at which all heads and attaches of legations were expected to be present. All ambassadors and ministers everywhere except American representatives appear at such functions in uniform. Xo uniform having been designated for American ministers, ambassadors and attaches, they are expected to appear in evening dress, no matter what time of the day or night the function takes place. All the other diplomats in carriages with out riders and escorts had arrived at the palace early. They were standing in the reception hall awaiting the arrival of the regent before etiquette permitted them to be seated. At length, the breezy American minister, clad in an ordinary and not a very well fitting business suit, entered and seeing tho audience in an attitude he exclaimed jovially, as he done in his own home at Fort fellers, what's the use of standin' down and take things easy." As he was about to leave the reception. Minister Caldwell approached the regent and slapping him on the shoulder, said, "Well, old man, drop around and see me whenever you feel like it." Foreigners at Teheran are almost daily enter tained by the sight of the minister pacing back and forth in front of the legation in his shirt sleeves to the humiliation of the American residents who at first tried to condone his short comings. It is well that American interests in Persia are not extensive, since the minister neglects them as well as the advice of consuls in the different parts of the country. A few months ago after the first of the more recent Armenian massacres occurred, the American consul at Tabriz forwarded to the minister an elaborate account of the atrocities. The minister having read it, threw it aside, saying, "O pshaw, this must be greatly exaggerated. They wouldn't do anything like that." This is literally "shirt-sleeve diplomacy," a name given some years ago by Europeans to the direct American diplomatic methods, cutting through red tape and ' arriving at the desired end by th shortest route. That sort of "shirt-sleeve diplo macy" however was effective and was carried on by gentlemen who observed polite conventions and customs and wore coats. of waiting might have Scott, "Hello, around? Set Patriotism, Pork and Pacifism The wolves are gathering outside the halls of congress, howling for increased appropriations for nearly all purposes. The rivers and harbors people are meeting in Washington now arranging their campaign for the millions, saved from them in the last congress. Every one is there with a purpose to get the most possible for some pet scheme, such as deepening, widening and rendering navigable the waters of Squaw Creek. Nowhere is there a disposition toward retrenchment in the face of a deficit which can apparently be avoided only by another bond issue. The treasury department wants more, the de partment of commerce wants more. All this looks bad for the defense program, for the first thing the pork barrel plunderers must do if they are to get what they desire is to put u quietus on the demand for more liberal ap propriations for the army and the navy. .Between the plunderers and the pacifists, preparedness is in danger of being crushed. They are working shoulder to shoulder, impelled by different motives, to make an end of the national defense program. We shall soon see whether patriotism on one side, or pork and pacifism on the other shall prefail. We notice in the sporting columns of our neigh bor the El Paso Times, that the Republican, a classy colt, easily won the sixth race last Thursday. Who says there is nothing in a name? 

WHEN BABY PLAYED. When Baby played, The very household tasks were stayed To listen to her voice: Secrete, We heard her lisping, low and sweet. Among her many dolls and pets; Or, at hei window's mignonettes. Making some butterfly arrayed In tremulous gold all unafraid When Baby played. When Baby played Amidst the reapers why, they laid Their work aside, and with loud glee Tossed her among them tenderly; And they did single, from the blur Of tousled grasses, blooms for her To wreathe about her throat and wrist. While for the service each was kissed. And on till evensong was made So happier When Baby played. When Baby phiycd. The lilies down the everglade Crew purer where the waters leapt. The willows laughed instead of wept; And the glad winds went merrying To sway the empty grapevine-swing Sne needs must leave, in answer to Our call from home at fall of dew And mimicking the call we made When Baby played when Baby played.

Where the People May Have Hearing u WORD TO THE POLICE To the Police Commission PTmpniv Gentlemen: Being one of the prin cipal dealers in a general variety of second hand goods. I take the libertv to present a few potent suggestions. and explain certain noints relating- to this business. The present law requires a record kept (and goods also kept seven davs before selling) of all articles pur chased. This is wholly impracticable and wrong, as it is not. and ennnnt be obeyed. First, a dealer would have to raise a double amount of capital; he would have to hold for storage purpose more than double re quired room, he would have to employ double the number of employes, and therefore, a living business would have to be doubled, for him to exist. I strongly advocate, and believe in safeguarding property, but if you make it impossible for a large dealer to carry on business you encourage petty transactions, and vice. You suggest requiring of a dealer to take the name of any one selling, and the name of the party buying If I were to demand of some lady here, selling from her home some use less article, her name, age, size and other requirements, and then when selling make a like demand from purchaser, believe me there .would be few transactions. Fictitious names of course could be given, and right there trouble would follow. You suggest that dealers give a bond a bond for what? All second hand competing dealers pay cash; but presuming that the seller gave credit and failed to be paid, where does the bond avail? Do not all businesn houses purchase on credit, from 30 days up? Is the second hand busi ness system any different? Would giving the city a bond put any lucre in the pocket of a creditor, even if the city canceled the buyer's license? Is not the stock he carries of any assurance? Really I don't know the system of others in business here, but with me, and I have followed many lines, my system is precisely what it was when I was a first in stead of a second hand dealer. Al low me to give the information, that were I dependent on profits from the petty sales of razors, old pants, worn out guns, etc., etc., I would die of starvation within ten days. Our prof it is derived principally, and almost wholly from repairing old furniture, stoves, etc.. placing them on the mar ket, and disposing of them to people of moderate or small means with this, it is expected that a junk dealer keep toothpicks and cogwheels, and everything intermediate. Let me here present to you another side of this question. On the out skirts, (over the line) of this city, is a dealer who, unmolested can buy. sell, exchange or take on commission. any article scheduled or unscheduled in the city lists. With no rents, no y tax. etc.. etc.. he should be able to flourish and grow fat. Do you wish by untenanting these junk stores. to drive auav trade? Now the autcioneer Another un restricted dealer. I am on the very- best of terms and friendliness with them all, but allude to the inconsist ency of conditions. If 1 purchase a bicycle, a long record must be filled in. and the bicycle held seven days. The same wheel can be taken while the acution progreses. (if not sold me) put up, and disposed of for cash, to me, who places it on sale, sells to a stranger, and is at no risk, trouble or annoyance whatever. The wheel was stolen. What recourse under these conditions has the owner when not finding his wheel? Xone whatever. Again, an autcioneer buys, sells, and hawks all goods that I keep. He is not required to rent buildings or em ploy clerks and deliveries to dispose of these goods, but by making glitter ing promises of returning double re sults to owners, he takes from the second hand dealer, and sells imme diately, that which ynu demand we hold seven days to safeguard the pub lic. How about that? These things are alluded to for rea son of some commission members classing second hand, and auction dealers, on the same basis, and intend ing treating them similar. It is a great mistake. "What is sauce for the goose is gall for the gander." I offer no suggestions as to treat ment of autcioneers; but I see no rea son for asking second hand dealers to store his purchases. That a record of such articles as bicycles, guns, pis tols, jewelry, musical instruments, saddles, etc., should be kept, is undis putable; provided not purchased with household goods direct; but to list everything, both when buying and selling, is simply impossible, unneces sary, and a clamp which when tight ened would force any dealer of moder ate means out of business.

FORD. Beatrice Fales read the "Humor esque" by Henry Van Dyke with music by Dvorak. This was Miss Fales' first appearance and her suc cess as a public reader is assured. Ivar Skougaard of the vocal de partment sang "The Watch" by Lowe and the "Toreador's Song" from Car men by Bizet. In the "Watch" his voice displayed smoothness and ease which was coupled with an insight into the character of his 'Toreador's Song.' " Franz Darvas played a "Gavotte" of Gluck-.Brahms and the "Nocturne in F sharp" by Chopin in a most pleasing manner. He is possessed of much ability having smooth even technic, and facile execution. Mrs. Cromwell Stacey closed the progiam with "Nymphs and Fauns" by Uimberg with interpretive dance by Miss Fales. Mrs. Stacey was in very good voice. Miss Fales is a most charming dancer and her inter pretation was full of delightful ef fects. Mrs. Chas. T. Weir, Daisy Nolly and Celestine Phillips proved them selves very sympathetic accompan ists being at all times in accord with the soloists. -o- Best Family Hour, large sack $1.35 Best Creamery Butter 31c Kansas Corn Meal 27c McKCES' bs o FINANCES and MARKETS !

Much of the liquidation which fol lowed the more careful reading of the president's recommendations were ascribed to those features dealing with a proosed tax on various crude and refined products.
