DEC. 9. 183i TWELVE PAGES MB. CLEVELAND'S CONSERVATISM. As The Dispatch stated on the mora ine following the election, the result was a personal victory for Mr. Cleveland rather than a direct triumph for the Democratic party. Since then the probability has been continually pointed out that the most dif ficult task of the President-elect will be the control of the extreme wing of the party that dictated the tariff plank of the Chicago platform. Current events all indicate that the struggle will be a hard one. And every conservatively pa triotic American aside from party affilia tions will hope and pray that Mr. Cleve land maybe steadfast in upholding his own expressed political beliefs and strong enough to- keep bis fretful party well in hand. In our special Washington dispatches this morning the assertion is made that a delineation of Mr. Cleveland's intentions included in a trenchant editorial on the President's message in the Philadelphia Ledger was directly inspired by the President-elect Whether that be so or not, the tribute paid Mr. Cleveland is well deserved by his past record, and the course outlined for him is.such as he must follow to prove his consistency. There is every reason to be lieve that Mr. Cleveland intends to move in the direction indicated. And his in clination and efforts to do so demand the support and encouragement of every man who places devotion to country above and before love of party. A 

NEGLECTED INDUSTRY. ' It is-rathera unique sort of - advertise ment for- Pittsburg that in order to in crease the list of candidates for the May oralty, with its $7,000 salary, the party ad visors have almost to take a lantern with them to discover prominent business or professional men willing to quit, their private callings for the public functions of Chief Magistrate. It looks as though business were good, and further as if -the people engaged conspicuously in business and in the learned professions have no ap prehensions that the material Interests of Pittsburg are going to decline. Even the landslide to the Democracy, with the tem porary eclipse of tbe high protective pol icy, has not resulted in a depression ade quate to add so far a single new name to the four original candidates for the May oralty one Republican, two Democrats and one Independent The salary of $7,000, which some years ago would have proved a rosy .attraction, now seems no inducement Two conclusions may Arise. First, that the demands for business absorb and handsomely-pay-all the no ted ability .there is in Pittsburg at more remunerative rates than public office; and second, that the ambition of office-holding is anything but strong in. this. part of the world. Of course there is a .third iuference, not so flatter ing, that public- .spirit is weak in a com munity since it fails to produce a more numerous- list ot men willing to leave their private callings for a term and place their abilities at the public service. Outsiders may well conclude that Pitts burg is a rare place for business, when business so exclusively absorbs tbe people, that in this special instance office-hunting presents tbe aspect of a decaying and neglected industry. The honors and emoluments of city offices seemingly have lost their charm, save for such as have been continuously engaged In politics In a semi-professional way. A CONSISTENT DOCUMENT. It is now generally understood, that the abstract of Jay Gould's will, as given to the public, contains the. whole gist of the matter and is only deficient in its omission of detailed valuations and legal techni calities. There is really no reason for .sur prise that absolutely nothing is left to public charities or to individuals outside tbe testator's family. Such bequests would have been far more conspicuous in their presence than they are by their ab sence. Throughout his career Jay Gould was without scruples, but.he was also de void of hypocrisy and ostentation. Such moneys asjwere dispensed during his life time were directly traceable to his wife's influence, were administered through her and ceased at her death, with one excep tion. The' exception was the gift to a church and may be explained by the millionaire's willingness to accede to a re quest therefor since he felt able to give so long as the recipients stooped to accept The criticisms that the transaction evoked, too, were little likely to encourage further efforts in tbe same direction. The controlling passion of Jay Gould's life was his craving for moneyed wealth for the power It would bring, and to attain the desired end he cared nothing for any distress that others might more or less in cidentally 'be involved in. Tbe -same desire for concentration of financial power which actuated his whole life is the most marked characteristic of the instrument which' he leaves as'a suitable epitaph for the reading of posterity. ' The 'goltfen rule ha'd no attractions for the champion gambler of the world, but neither did-he affect a sentiment that was foreign tohis nature. Any bequest to a public institu tion or a pnvate charity would have been a marked inconsistency in the testament of one who, while he lived, scorned alike the public and tbe individual where either stood in his way. - All his affection, all his thought of others were devoted to is money and his family, while he had'' power to think or act His family and money are finally united in his death. Any public profit from the distribution of Jay Gould's millions could have been only a spoiling of the Egyptian. And the Egyptian re fused to be spoiled. The accumulations made by Jay Gould are practically left in the control of his son George. His busi ness ability is well known, and the only marked difference between his character and that of his father is found .in the greater close-fistedness of the former. ( To what extent the wealth will continue 'toT accumulate the future alone can decide', but every precaution has been taken to keep it intact so far as may be. ,A CAMPAIGN OF EDUCATION. It is fashionablo in some quarters to refer to canals as behind the age, but the tiuth is that Americans are behind the age in canals. This point is clearly demon strated in a valuable paper from the pen of Colonel Roberts, read at the recent inland navigation conference at Pans. As will -be seen by the extract on another page, the well-known Pittsburg engineer exhibits the great possibilities of such navigation in the United States, and how they have not been developed. The adnntages of railways over the mule-power canal boats of past genera tions cannot be questioned, Dut there is fully as great a difference -between the modern railway and that of sixty years ago. The canal of the present and future must be a deep ' water-wav, and steam or seme similar motive power must make it in keeping with the other features of the times. The special benefits which would accrue to this section from the Lake Erie and Ohio river project have been re peatedly pointed out The United States needs nothing o badly as an inland canal system, unless it be good roads, and cite una. It is com paratively difficult to interest the general public in these subjects. They are not as exciting as a political contest or a pugil istic exhibition, and fortunes .cannot be won and lost in their development with the rapidity which characterizes some varieties of speculation. But The Dis patch feels that it has ground for encour agement Years ago it commenced the struggle for improved roadsalmost single handed. The roads have not mate rialized to any great extent, bat a senti ment has been thoroughly aroused .that can hardly fail to eventually produce important results. The campaign for the ship canal and good roads is one of education, and The Dispatch intends to fight' it out" through all the summers and winters that may be necessary to insure ultimate success. THE 

LAST STRAW. Any suspicjon of usefulness that, was left to the Inter-State pommerce Commis sion is destroyed by Judge Gresham's latest ruling. The decision that "So much of the Inter-State Commerce Law as authorizes or requires the courts to use their powers in aid of Inquiries before the Inter-b"ate Commerce Commission is un constitutional nd void" carries peculiar force as coming from an avowed opponent of railroad transgressions. The history of the Commission has been but a revelation of its incapacity to cope with the evils it was professedly appointed to suppress. And this last blow goes further than ever in demonstrating its inefficiency. Unless the railroads are to be permitted to continue in their open disregard of public policy and successful defiance of the spirit of the law, a new enactment must be passed by Congress that shall hold water better than the leaky arrange ments extant The power of. the trans portation magnates must be curbed at all costs. And Congress cannot long delay the enactment of measures that shall carry with them the power of and neces sity for rigorous enforcement The coun try has had more than evidence enough of the railroad lobbyists' power, and the duplicity or stupidity ot its own Repre sentatives. And the time has come to make a fresh and vigorous start to demon strate that public privileges are not granted without public duties, and that those duties must be performed or the penalties paid for their evasion. WHICH IS RIDICULOUS? The esteemed Washington P?st, apropos of the question of an extra session, turns its attention to the usual denunciation 'of tbe idea of letting a year elapse between the election and the meeting of Congress. It quotes the Democratic organs consumed with hunger for the extra session, and pro ceeds to characterize the present rule as "objectionable" and "ridiculous." It may be objectionable and ridiculous to take time for consideration, but the framers of our present system of govern ment 'did not think so.Their provision for tne meeting on the second Monday in December was based 6n ihe deliberate opinion that it would be best for the 'heat of partisan prejudice engendered by cam paigns to settle down before the work of actual legislation is commenced. Now it may be ridiculous to the partisans to have consideration before legislation, and ob jectionable to prevent Congress from rail roading the partisan idea within a month after it is elected. The disposition of these elements evidently is that of Jedwood jus ticeto legislate first and consider after ward, 'with repentance as an- accompani ment But tbe impartial mind may retain its own views as to which side exhibits the ridiculous and objectionable qualities most positively. There fnay be an attempt to change the date of meeting of Congress. But it is not to be done by. applying opprobrious adjec tives to the practice whictf especially pro vides the legislators time to give a little thought to public measures after the cam paign lunacy has passed away. 

PITTSBURG'S NATAL TJOMPANT. Pennsylvania has a National Guard" that leads the country for practical capa bility, and there is no reason whatever why its Naval Battalion should not attain an equally high standing. Adjutant Gen eral Greenland's opinion that the Key stone State is backward in the matter should be an inspiration to bring this branch of the. service to a standard of efficiency corresponding to that of the military arm. The demand for an appro priation of $1,500 .for each. of. four com panies to be made of the Legislature at the next session should be granted with out hesitation. Two companies have been organized already at Philadelphia, though their work has been hampered by lack of money, and Pittsburg and Erie are' to supply one -compapy each so- soon as funds are available for their enlistment and.organization. - ' Tbe Hew departure- should -prove popular,- and Pittsburg must be prepared to play its part with credit Incidentally the increased attention which will be attracted to Pittsburg and Erie as ports of entry should add to the recognition of their im portance as strategic points. Public in terest in the military value of a canal to connect the two ought to help out the f abundant evidence ot such a work's value from a commercial point of view. Mean while, a thing that is worth doing at all is worth doing well, and Pittsburg must help Pennsylvania to prove that It will be sec ond to none In the efficiency of its Naval Battalion. Some of those official election returns fere striking examples ot official dllatori ness. Tlio waste of time In counting the ballots is inexcusable and inexplicaDle, ex "cept by the supposition that some ot the officers are enjoying their Jobs. There has been a good deal of talk lately about an organization ot citizens Avho hare subscribed a considerable amount of mono y to cover the coatof a searching audit of the city's accounts for the past ten years. So far no individual Plttsbarger has been found to vouch for the undertaking. But in any case such a movement could have no direct influence upon the February election. One of the best features of such tin lorgant zation would bo In its indication that a tody of Pittsburgers has at last been fouad to take a sei-ipus interest in municipal government for the sake of the community. Meanwhile there is ample scope for an Increase in gen eral Interest in municipal affairs, and the voters who do not generally vote will have one more chance between now and Febru ary to do something for the city's good. Na tional politics should have nothing what ever to do with municipal elections, and the candidates for city officers shonld be so lected purely according to their fitness for office and the strength of the municipal platform on which they stand. Pistols at the polls are ,popularly sup posed to be a peculiarly Southern institu tion. But it is from an octogenarian Sena tor of the Indianapolis Legislature that the threat comes to cboose.hls chair and defend It by force of arms. The bill now on file in the Senate for the admission of New Mexico to the rights of Statehood provides that tbe English lan guage shall be tbe only one taught in the public schools. It Is stated that the terri tory would refuse to become a State nnder such conditions. That being sotbere should be no lurther discussion as to its eligibility. .Nothing Ib more productive of 'sectionalism than the perpetuation of foreign tongues. And nothing is desired to encourage sec tionalism among tbe States of this Union. Estimates of the size of things depend largely upon the point of view from which they are made. A world that appears won drous small to a man evading a creditor seems unpleasantly large to one seeking a debtor. As to Demooratio.intentiens with regard to taritt legislation and administrate eoonomy tbero nro' still about a many re ports as there aro Domoorats. But tbe na tlon will at lewst bo thankful to learn that the intention or tho -victorious party's lead ers is to make the handling of tho immigra tion question strictly non-partisan. Tbe need for restrictive discrimination in per mltting the influx of aliens is so sell-evi-dont that a measure framed to provide it must be enacted as soon as possible. Blizzards are to the fore once more as obstructors of railroad traffic and destroy ers of telegraphlp communications. They are as much or a nuisance as monopolists, and about as uncontrollable. As an American humorist the Pittsburg street car conductor -distances all competi tors. Ills "Step -forward to the front, please," when every square lnoh of standing room is already, occupied by a square inch of sple.is really, too excruciatingly tunny for anything. Asphyxiation and laughter com bined will surely caUBe a sudden death If tho witticism continues to be perpetrated. Hamlet's remarks about the "insolence of offloo" and "the law's delays" would have been made more emphatic if be had been possessed of a personal knowledge of this great country's institutions. The main obstacle to the inception of the Ohio River and Lake Erie Canal is found in the apathetic Indifference of those to whom It could not fail to bring enormous benefits. When Pittsburg has -been aronsed to a proper pitch of municipal enthusiasm, the vigorous pushing of that project should be among the earliest results. Professional etiquette is t"fie short definition of antiquated customs contrary to convenience 'and calculated to cause strife and confusion among members of the "learned" professions. Last night's prize fight was simply a beastly exhibition of brute force. Its only brilliant feature was the shortness or its duration. The bigger brute survived, and a "3port" that encourages the evolution of the fittest survivors of that kind is simply a relic of the dark ages of batbarity. Meteorology, like politics, makes strange bedfellows. Blizzards and thunder storms in,, the same December night are companions too ill-assorted for anything but the weather office "With apologies to the memory of 'Walter Savage Sandoe, his famous auto-epitaph may be reversed to flt the case or Jay Gould: He strove with all none were too small for strife. Money he loved, and after money power. The lore of train was his throughout his life. And hoards be left to mark Its little hour. Unless there is some forcing of the 'new," SO year-old and pace, Philadelphia's ' unfinished city ball will be an accomplished fact before tho site is selected for Alle gheny's postofflce. Mabdi-geas organizers and prize-fight promoters are at loggerheads at New Orleans, The Crescent City would lose little if the rival attraction Is ts metaphorically killed one another off and allowed it to get down to a legitimate business basis.

The youngest woman who ever came out of the West and won fame in tho East is probably,Mrs. Eva .Wilder McGlasson, who Is still nearer 20 than 25, and who has writ ten a remarkable story called "An Earthly Paragon.' ' A LOOK AROUND. It was gossiped about yesterday that the Pennsylvania Riilroad Company is con sidering tbe novlsabllity of extending its local passenger service Into tho bear? of the city. This does not mean any addition to its lines, but merely the usage of sncb,traclcs as it alreadypossesses. The story which I refer to is to tbe effect that, recognizing the great pressure on Its own lines and on the eleotrio ana cable cars at certain hours of the morning and evening, the railroad com pany will run passenger trains from Walls to Sixth street, utilizing its Liberty street tracks for that purpose. The trains would be loaded and unloaded from and to the street, there being'no Intention to arrange for any waiting rooms or d epot, It is under stood that tho company has the right to use these tracks for the purpose Indicated, and will not require any further grants from Councils. , There was some discussion among the gosstpers on this point and as to whether the railroad company was not restricted to freight traffic on Liberty street, but the drift of opinion was tiiat there was nothing in the way or the proposed departure. This wonld certainly bo a very popular innova tion for many people as it is preferable to ride or walk to the Union station in order to avail themselves of the greater comfort to bo had in a half hour's rido on a train as against any sort of street car. Superintend ent Pitcairn was non-committal about the matter when I asked him if such a plan was nnder consideration, bnt it seemed as though it was no new idea to hi in. It certainly looks as though there was some sort of truce between Drexel, Morgan A Co. and the Pennsylvania Railroad Com pany. I hear that the firm have Invested several millions in property in tho vicinity of Bryn Mawr. and intend to spend more millions in erecting buildings of various kinds tbeieon chiefly residences ami such business stands as a fashionable and wealthy suburb will support. It is said that at least $11,000,000 ate to be put Into this investment, which cannot tail to benefit the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, as the houses will be strung along its main line, and all this travel will come to it. Yesterday afternoon a big, brutal look ing man', evidently a foreigner, walked along Liberty street followed by a sturdy little girl who was," weeping bitterly. The man wore a sullen ugly look, and from time to time he threw some lemark over his shoulder at the girl as if ho tossed a brick at a stray dog. As he passed the Academy of Muslo some of tho boys, who were hanging about the doorway, took in the situation, and lt.wns comical to see bow quickly they acted in concert. One by one they followed tho man, and piosently he had "a tail" like a Highland ohler. "Hit him with a clinker, Patsy." "You big coward!" "Why donchor lilt oner us?" and Blmllar endearing remarks were thrown at the scowling, heavy browed brnte. On down 'Liberty street! to Sixth went the little processing, and it was hard to tell which the girl feared most, her juvenile pro tectors or- her father. At length the man grew infuriated, chased the boys and swore in choicest Magyar or some other kind of "yar," but caught neither Doys nor fish. Seizing her by tho arm he hanlrd her quickly up to a passing street car, and looked back npon his tormentors with a taunt and a few extra left over curses'as the car sped away toward Allegheny. A taradox in green came under my notice esterday morning. A small, slender girl hurried up Fifth avenue wearing a lough terra cotta skirt, with fnzzy.wuzzy threads or gold running through it, a ,nlle green cloth waist, a brown cloak, with half a dozen little capes lined witb green silk, and a brown and gold turban. And in spite of it all the men admired the tout ensemble, thoneh the, women stopped, smiled and ejaculated. "I don't know why it is," said the repre sentative ot a big tobacco importing firm in the -East yosterday, as he cut tho end off of a huge cigar, "but It is a fact that for two years it has been next to impossible to get good Havana tobacco. There must be something out or the way with the soil, the climate or something else that flavors the leaf. The best brands of clears, made by the most noted firms have' not the flavor, the bouquet, they had three years ago. I have heard this 'from dozens of men n lth fine taste who have changed fromono brand to another in search of something to suit them and without finding what they sought."

DANGEROUS THOUGH CHAINED. A Manacled Burglar at Butler KnocKs Senseless an Incautious Witness. Butler. Deo. 8. rSTpfrioJ, John Mininger, the notoilous Jail breaker and all aronnd bad man, who for two months past has been shackled to the floor ot his cell in the But ler county jail, has two more criminal charges added to the long list already recot ded against him. Another prisoner in formed tbe sheriff that Mininger had con fessed to him the commission of a burglary at the residence of George Grimm, in Jef ferson township, two years ago. A warrant, issued 'on the charge of committing this burglary, whs read to Mininger in his cell. He promptly demanded an Immediate hear ing, which it was decided to give him in the jail, as to remove him to a justice's office would require the services of a blacksmith to release him from Ills anchorage in the floor. Grimm and the witncs who had Informed on Minlnzer wore summoned As the wit ness incautiously. got within range of Min inger. the latter, leaping to the lencrth of his chain, strnck the man a terrific blow in the fnco with both his heavv manacled hanJs. fclllmr him to tho floor, senseless and bleed ing. Two prisoners who were at liberty in the corridor also jumped upon the fallen witness and kicked him savagely before they were beaton off by the surprlied offi cers. As soon as he was able, the informer made the additional information against Mininger of aggravated assault and battery. THE CTJ2TIS TEIAL STOPPED.

Curtis, the actor, for tbe murder of Policeman Grant, were brought to a sudden stop this morning by tbe announcement or the death of Porter A. Libby, ono of the jnrors in the case, who had been 111 for the, past few days. Judge Murphy, who bad himself risen from a sick bod to open this morning, granted the mo tion or District Attorney Barnes to dismiss the jury and have a new one impaneled, and the case was 'put on tho -calendar for Tues day. Curtis seemed despondent for a time over the Court's decision, but his attornev"! ac- 3uiesced in the decision without complaint, udge Murphy declined to reduce the bail or allow the defendant to go on the old bond, and new bonds will have to be secured.

Senator Cullom, Chairman of the Senate Committee on In terstate Commerce, has very little to say relative to the decision of Judge Groshnm affecting the vnlidity of the inter-State commerce law, but his manner indicates that he is not at all pleased with it. "I have not read it, and I do not care to say much until I have," said Mr. Cullom. "According to the newspaper reports so, ue persons are inclined to hold that the decision affectinit the validity of one section applies to all. and that If one Is unconstitutional the law in its entirety must be. There is nothing in such an argument. Thereitone thingabout which thore can beno doubt, and that is that it the law can be amended so as to withstand the decisions of the courts, it will be: whether suoh a resnlt can be reached it Is hard to determine. After I have read the decision in full I may have something to say pertaining to the subject on the floor of the Senate." Representative Culberson, Chairman of the Judiciary Committee of the House, was askod what ho thought or the decision, but he replied that he had not yet read It. He refused to express off-hand his opinion on the salient points of tbe decision, when out lined to him by a reporter. Judge Orcshum's opinion, however, was a topic that was talked ol more or less in the House during the day. The friends of the Inter-Stato law feel that if the opinion is upheld by the .su preme Comt it will render the commission nelDless. It will then, they say, bo placed in the position or a voluntary court, with no power to compel tne attendance of wit nesses. Later In the day Mr. Culberson-read tho opinion of Judge Gresham, and taid be thought the Judge n as correct in his state ment of tho law as to the section of the act referred to. Further than this Mr. Culber son declined to talk, on the ground that the question In some form mucht come before the committee of which he is Chairman, and he did not wish to commit himself beforehand. THE GOULD WILL. How It Surprised tho Public George Gould bald to Ho Very Economical. New York, Deo. 8. Tho financial g03Sips had plenty to talk about to-day when Jay Gould's will was given to tho public through the newjpapors. The principal feature dis cussed'was the fact that not one dollar has been sive.i to charity, nor to anybody not of Mr. Jav Gould's blood. No educational in stltutlon gets anything, nor any religious body or institution. Jay Gould's money Is left to Jay Gould's ohlldren, ana puissant effort is made that it shall stay In the Gould family. The whole thing Is distinctly a family affair, and to Georse J.

At first many sup posed that Bnoh bequests were for some reason withheld from the pnblished sum mary, and would be announced later.

UNCLE 8AMS LEGAL W0EK. Attorney General Miller Slakes a State ment of His Department's Work. Washington, Dec. 8. Attorney General Miller has made a report to Congress in re gard to the business ot the Department or Jnstice during the last fiscal year, showing mat tne business or the department is con tinually and largely increasing. This in crease, he says, is most noticeable in the business before tbe Court or Claims. The reference to that court for investigation and finding of claims for the tnc'ing and injury to property of persons assuming to have been loyal during the war, such claims be ing already between 9,000 and 10,000 In num ber and in amount aggregating nearly $100, 000.000, and still more recently the duty Im posed upon tbat court or trying claims for Indian depredations, such claims already filed beinic over 8,000 in number and aggre gating over $33 000,000, are very suggestive or the crowing work of the department. Mr. Miller reviews briefly the work of the United States Supreme Court, and says he is glad to be able to report that, as the result of the organization of the Circuit Court of Appeals, the number ot cases in the Supreme Court is being reduced. He also refers to the business before these Cir cuit Courts, and suggests that some provis ion be enacted by Congress lor tho payment of district attorneys lor services in these conrts, so tbat it will not be left to the dis cretion of tbe Attorney General. The nec essity for such discretionary action, he says, ought to be by legislation reduced to tho minimum. This whole snbject of the man agement ot tho -Government's business in the Clrcnit Courts of Appeals ought to have the careful attention of Congress. In regard to the business of the Court of Private Land Claims he savs that there have been filed In that court since its organiza tion a total of 13 cases, in 42 of which tbe Government is defendant, and in one it is the plaintiff.
