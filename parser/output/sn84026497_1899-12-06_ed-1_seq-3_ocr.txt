THF FOREST REPOBUCSTT i. C. WINK. Editor Paopmrron. WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 6, IS1. New Jersey's Republican pluiality 1b 23,918, against 8to5 in 1S9S, an example or the expansive influence of expansion. Our first duly a d plodgo'.in Cuba Is to give the island a stable government. And Uncle Sam a. ways lives up to his agi ce ments. Tub question in Kentucky is whethar tho state is to be run by a majority cf voters or by a conspirator armed with a trick election law contrived by himself. Great activity in gold production con tinues. Official reports indicate that the 1899 production of the yellow metal in Australasia will be at least fl7,000,0J0 greater than that of last year. The year 1SP9 will go down as a record one In industrial history, especially as re lates to substantial and widespread ad vances in wages, and a general increase and activity in employment. Tha i the beef trust is not getting tho whole thing is Bbown by the statement appearing in Bradstreet's iast weok, that "Three-year-old Texas shorthorn cattle sold for fti.75 at Chicago stock-yaads Monday, which is tho highest price paid for Texas cattle since 1ST.2." Of the nineteen Vice Presidents of the Anti-Imperialist League elected in Bos ton fifteen are prominent Democrats or Mugwumps and almost the entire num ber opposed the war with Spain. They have a chronic habit of turning up against the government on every public question. The gavel with which Speaker llen dersou called the Fifty-sixth Congress to order is made ot wood from the Spanish cruiser Koitia Christina, captured by Admiral Dewey at Manila. It is artis tically carved, heavily niouuted in gold and was presented to Speaker Henderson by the Governor of Iowa. J. I. V. Gridley, of Erie, Fa., son of the late Captain Charles Gridley, who commanded Admiral Dewey's flagship, Olympia, in the battle of Manila has been designated for appointment as a lieutenant in the Marine corps. His ex amination expenses have been borne jointly by President McKinlev and Ad miral George Dewey. Every American citizen who has read anythi ng on the subject of the Alaskau boundry dispute believes that the United States should hold onto every foot of ground to which she is entitled. There is not a dissenting voice to this propo sition. And yet some years ago there were a lot of people in the country who opposed and (ought the Alaska purchase and necused tho Government of Idiocy, if not criminality, on account of it. The caso has a strong parallel at the present time. Another ten per cent, advance in wages of tue New Etigland mill ope'a tives is announced. Notices of an advance of ten per cent, in the wages of the Bor den Iron Mills, to take effect December wore posted on Thanksgiving morning, and those lauiiliar with the s.tuation in manufacturing circles of New Eng and say that this advance by the Borden mills, in which nearly 3,000 persons are employed, will result in a similar ad vanio in establishments employing fully 100,010 persons. The President's message was delayed one day in its transmission to Congress, on account of the adjournment of the S'-nate immediately after its organization out or resect to the memory of the late Vice President Hobart, hence we are un able to lay this importaut and highly in teresting document before our readers to day. Wo hope to be ablo t do so next week, however. Everybody is anxious to see what the President has to say on the momentous questions now before the American people. A.N evidence of tho increasing interest which the United States has a right to feel in the Pacific is found in the fact that practically one-half of our enormous su gar imports oi the present year came from the Pacific, including Hawaii, the Fhilippnus, and tho East Indies, whil nearly one-half of the remainder cam from Cuba and Porto Rico. From the Philippine Islunds the amount for the ten months ending with October is over 50, 000,000 pounds; from the Hawaiian Islands, 531,000,000 pounds; from the East Indies, over 1,000,000,000 pounds and from Cuba 683,000,000 pounds. "The time has passed for tho people of tho United States to discuss tho ques tion of what is to be done with the Philp pines. We droye out the Spaniards who had been the governing power nearly 400 years. For us to withdraw would leave a condition of anarchy, and foreigners wu own property in the country would have certainly a strong moral claim against the United States for their losses. Americans will findthisan excellent field for their energies and the wealth-produc ing powers of these islands under Ameri can iniluen"e will be great." Letter from General Joe Wheeler in thj Philippines, Two Committees of Pennsylvania Re publicans have been appointed to foster the project of holding the next National convention in Philadelphia, at which city in 18."6 the first National Convention ol the Republican party was held, and at which, in 1872, was held tho last convention at which a Republi can President was renominated who was reelected to that office. It has been brought to the notice of the members of the Republican National Committee which meets In Washington two weeks hence to fix the timo and place for the 1!HK) convention, that Philadelphia has in the buildincs of the Export Exhibition a place suitable for the convention. If nec essary, an auditorium accommodating 20,000 peopla could lie constructed under the roof of the Exhibition main building. It is pointed out that New York, Boston, Baltimore and Pittsbnrg have not asked fer the convention ; that Cincinnati and Cleveland are politically unavailable, and that Philadelphia will be the only large Eastern city in the field". -. nieuts. Major Powell's Report Thereon. The Wat D-partinert has made public ttie results of the survey by Major Chas, Q. Powell of the Allegheny river for the extension of the slaokwator navigation. Summed up his report shows that the river is well worth the improvement that it would make the entire valley one chain of manufacturing towns from Oil City to Pittsburg, and be the source of fabulous wealth to Pennsylvania. Tho annual haul is placed at 024,000 tons, and the project contemplates 54 dims and locks, to cost 113,705,000. The following are exti acts of the report from a special to the Pittsburg Dispatch : The river was surveyed from Oil City, Pa,, 134.7 miles above tho river mouth, to Tarontura, under tne direction of Major R. E. Hoxie, corps of engineers, or Ma jor Charles F. Powell during the late falls, when low water generally obtains, in 1896 and 1S07. The present navigation of tho river is confined to favorable stages, which iu tho aggregate do not occur moro than four or live months in a year. Years ago pack ets ran to Warren, !2 miles above Pitts burg. Iu later yoars steamboats have not attempted to go above Oil City and In tho lost year a single beat only in ado a lew trips from Pittsburg as far up as Kittanning. Portions of the Allegheny valley, not ably on the CUrion river, below French creek, and on the Tiouesta river aud Hickory creeks, above Oil City, still abound in timber. Parts of the cut and barges aud coal bottoms built for the Pittsburg river coal trade and loaded with lumber, mine timbers, or tan bark are rafted dowu tho river on raises. This tralllo foots up aoout 200,000 tons yearly, and comprises about all there remains to-day of river business above the reach of Pittsburg harbor business. As.to the practicability of extending the slack -water improvement on the Al legheny river in Pennsylvania It is found that the river is of ample width and volume for the purpose. The Allegheny forms the Ohio river, and is a larger stream than the tributary Mouongahola and Kanawha rivers, where slack-water improvements are successfully operated. iheba ks and the bed of the rtycr are reasonably firm, making its course stable, especially below Oil City, and a (lording foundation for structures, although not rock. A filling of pools is not to be ex pe ted from the very moderate amount of sedimeat carried by the river. An oh juotiou to fixed dams is the destructive action of frequent heavy ice gorges. The very cold winters, rapid current and shoal bars combine for forming the ice gorges, but it is probable that the in oreased depth produced by dams would reduce the extent of the gorges. A drawback which has been urged against fixed dams is their interference with rafting. Tho dams would give some compensation for the disadvantage to that interest by affording a mote reliable depth of water than during the short lived freshets, the opportunity of moving rafts at any time during opon river, and cheaper tying-up places in the pools while awaiting sale than at Pittsburg harbor. The useful natural products along the river, except coal, lies upstream from Kittanning In answer to circular letters Major Pow. ell learned the following annual amounts of named coinodities, exclusive of pres ent rafting, would be accommodated uy a slack-water improvement: Tons. Fire clay and silica rock 70,000 Coal 275,000 Limestone 1)0,000 Iron ore 2,000 Glass sand 15,0i0 Building sand and gravel 40,000 Plate aud other glass lO.OoO Flour, feed etc 10,000 Lumber 78,000 Wagons, agricultuial implements and hardware 10.000 Live stock .. 10,000 Aides 2,000 Marulo and granite l.OO.i Beer 30.00n Brick 100,0OJ Iron, steel, boilers, cuglnes, etc 00,000 Building stone 7o,000 General merchandise 1,000 Miscellaneous 30,000 pllio tv..iui..-u.uUl aiiiiuwuit-a Uiul lie U .1 only originally opposed expansion, but that he said to President McKinley.when tendered the chairmanship of the Com mission, that he was opposed to the ac quisition of the islands.

The further extension from Oil City to the Pennsyl vania State line, requiring 35 locks and dams at an estimated cost of $7,980,115, is also deemed unworthy and not justified by the interests of commerce. It is understood that persons who in stigated the requirement for the survey bad in view a canal connection from the improved river to Lake Erie. To see what this proposition amounted to three possiblo canal routes were considered and the route via French Cieek and Con neaut Lake selected as tho most feasible ono. This route is wholly in Pennsylva nia. The canal would ascend French creek uy dams for 19 miles from its mouth, then parallel Conneaut Lakecreek for six miles to the summit level, with lockage of 111 feet; thence along the sum mit lor 17 miles, including 2.5 nines through Conn- aut Lake, and thence de scend 503 feet for 10 miles to the mouth of Elkcreek ; if the canal were extended to Eriel3 miles would be added to its longth the elevation of the summit level would bo 1,07C feet above mean tide. A sufficient water supply for a canal giving eight feet depth in the locks, the same as the projected enlargement of the Erie canal, appears to be available by means of a dam above Meadville on French creek, and a nine mile feeder from there to the canal. The total dis tance ol such water route from Pittsburg to Elk creek would be 186.5 miles, and and the total lockage 870 feet ; these ele ments aHd some commercial features the canal route do not compare favorably with the saino pertaining to the well known route for a Lake Erie (anal from the Ohio river, niar Pittsburg, via the Beaver and Mahoning rivers. So that -it may be remarked, only if the State Pennsylvania build the French creek ca nal, would the extension by the United States of Allegheny river slack-water from Monterey to French creek, 44 miles, and preferable in that caso to Oil City, eight miles further be justified.
