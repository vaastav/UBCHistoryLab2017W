BUSINESS DULL AT OPENING Market Improves, However, in the Early Afternoon?Call Money at 5 Per Cent. Special Dispatch to The Star. NEW 

YORK, December 7.?Apparently Wall street was not waiting for ihe an nual message of the President of tha T'nited State?, whim was submitted to day to Congress. Perhans it in or has been waiting for the special message or messages to which Mr. Taft has prepared his discussion of most ?f the subjects of apprehensive controversy, such as the amendment of the interstate commerce and anti-trust laws. Perhaps Wail street nas not been wailing r,r is not going to wait for any o? these things, but for some impulse expressing itsc-lf within the stock market. What Wall street waits for .it times when it imagines itself to be waiting for something, the stock market being re garded as the expression of the waiting mood, is always a matter of curious skepticism. At any rate, nothing stock marketwise happened in Wall street this morning before the message came out, and when the document was published it imparted no initiative to the prices of - ? ? ' s n?>r stimulus to stock market ac tivity. Awaiting Future Utterances. Of course, insufficient opportunity has been afforded to the financial community to consider Mr. Taft's communication to Congress and to form definite conclusions about it. It may be said, though, that having the regard to the more or less radical pro gram to which Mr. Taft has committed himself in his public utterances and which will doubtless be elaborated in special messages the first feeling pro duced in the financial district by the state paper published today was one of relief for the change which it denoted in the character of the federal adminis tration. Mr. Taft, as the financial community views the message, has uttered himself in a manner suited to the dignity of his nigh office and his language fitly recog nizes the responsibility which goes with the enormous power of suggestion wield ed by the federal executive. So far as the concrete contents of the message go, one fact was obvious to those who studied it from a standpoint ?>r corporate and financial endeavor. This was the way in which the President nad evidently been iirpressed l.v the venture <?f Ame; ican cajiiral abroad, the efforts to pr :-s the ;a!e of \<ji-ritnn products m foreign markets, the prosperous state of activity which had been a liicved Ht heme - industry a.vl Jcis'ness. and the bright prospect for remarkabla expansion in rnaifjial dire.*-v, &. Gradual Improvement Noted. T- p to the time of the publication of the message in Wall street, which was shortly after noon, the stock market had been \ery dull. The opening was irregular and rather heavy, and for a while irreg ularity continued and business fell away. Business became very dull, but as dull ness developed prices hardened and the market gradually Improved In tone. This slow hardening or appreciation of quoted values persisted up to and after the re lease of the message for Wall street pe rusal. and in the early part of the after noon the list, with few exceptions, was characterized by a considerable degree of strength. Professionalism was the domi nant aspect of the dealings. Call money was rather firm at 5 per cent. The time money market was dull and featureless.

The early shopping movement is re ceiving the support of the buying public, and the admonitions are "shop early," and "do it now." It is explained that the modern tendency is to lighten the labors of the helpers In the large department stores throughout the country. At no time is this given more thought than at the busy holiday season, realizing that the best service can be given by employes when the greatest amount of time can be allowed for rest and recuperation for the following day's hustle and bustle, j Woodward & Lothrop, Inc., announce that Its establishment will be open only five evenings this holiday season. In thus reducing the hours of labor for their em ployes. It is pointed out, the mental and physical strain of the busy season can be lessened, and It is believed by them the Interests of Its patrons will be better conserved. FOREIGN BANKS.

LOCAL FINANCIAL NEWS The situation in the American National Bank, caused by the death of its presi dent, R. H. Lynn, continues to be a sub ject of discussion in local financial cir cles. In addition to the sense of per sonal loss and the sympathy caused by tho unexpected death, the questions in re gard to the future of the interests with which Air. Lynn was connected and the tilling of the vacancies caused by his death are of interest. In regard to the presidency of the bank, it is commonly thought that Senator El kins, who is a large stockholder, and who has much experience as head of several bai.ks in West Virginia, will take the presidency of this institution, at least un til the plans which Mr. Lynn was engaged in working out are disposed of. It is said that a large scheme has been proposed to enlarge the resources as well as the scope of business of the American National Bank. This is to be brought about by affiliations with banking con cerns in this city and with larger New York interests, so that the capital and the deposits of the greater bank, which is to be formed would run up into mil lions. This plan has not been abandoned, al though it naturally received a check by the death of Mr. Lynn. Thus far there is no intimation as to the connections that are to be formed either in this city or in New York. The names of a bank or hanks in this city that are to be in cluded in this expansion have been men tioned, but not with sufficient definiteness to warrant their publications John R. McLean was asked casually this morning how his steamboat line was getting along. "What steamboat line?" he asked in a surprised tone. "Why, the new one, of course, that is to be established between this city and New York?" "I don't know anything about it," was the reply. "I am not interested in any such line and haven't a cent in such an enterprise.'* The meeting today of the stock ex change did not result in much trading. There was but little change in the fig ures of yesterday. Washington Stock Exchange. Sales.?Regular rail, 12 o'clock noon?Capital Traction ">s, $1,000 at 114%.

GRAIN AND PROVISIONS CHICAGO, December 7.?Grain?Open ing: Wheat, May, 1.07% to 1.07%; July, 98% to 98%; December, 1.07% to 1.07%. Official confirmation of damage to the Argentine wheat crop by frost created considerable bullish , sentiment in the wheat market here during early trading today. The volume of trading, however, was rather small. An advance of 2% to 2%c in the price of wheat at Buenos Aires, which further emphasized the frost scare here, was a prominent factor at the start. Prices at the start were % lower to % higher, with May at 1.07%al.07% to 1.07%. On buying by leading bulls the price ad vanced to 1.07%al.07%. A heavy snowfall over the greater por tion of the corn belt, which will neces sitate increased feeding of grain to live stock, had a strengthening effect on the corn market. Local receipts were smaller than the estimated amount, and this also prompted some buying. At the opening prices were unchanged to %a% higher. May being at 61% to 61%. Later the price sold up to 61%. Trading in oats was active, and the market was firm ear!y in the session. Shorts and commercial houses led in the buying. The brisk demand for the cash grain #as an important factoi. Opening quotations were unchanged to %a% high er, with May at 42% to 42%a43. Later May advanced to 43a43%. Provisions were rather weak at the start, owing to general selling, but be came Sieadiei early in the day oecause ot support bv packe.? Prices at the opening were uno'inngeJ to 30c lower.
