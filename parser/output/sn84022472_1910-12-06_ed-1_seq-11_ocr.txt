DR. TIFT TARIFF Supports Payne Bill In Message. "FORTIFY THE CANAL" favors Parcels Post and Mm Laior Laws. President Writes to Congress on Vari ous Phases of Conservation. Opposes Water Power Site Monopoly, In dorses Ship Subsidy Plan In Unquali fied Language, Suggests Ways of Managing Panama Canal In Future, Rates of Toll, Etc Washington. Dec. 6. President Taft Bent his annual message to congress today. It Is as follows: To the Senate and House of Repre sentatives: During the past year the foreign re lations of the, United States have con tiuued upon a basis of friendship and good understanding. The year has been notable as wit nessing the pari Be settlement of two Important International controversies before the permanent court of The Hague, The arbitration of the fisheries dis pute betweeu the United States and Great Britain, which has been the source of nearly continuous diplomatic correspondence since the fisheries con Tentiou of IMS. has given an award whlcii is satisfactory to both parties This arbitration Is particularly note worthy not only because of the emi nently Just results secured, but also be cause It Is the first arbitration held on--der the general arbitration treaty of April 4. lWia. between - the United States and 5 rest Britain and disKsea of a controversy the settlement of which for nearly ninety years has been the cause of friction between two countries whose common Interest lies in maintaining the most friendly and cordial relations with each other. The United States was ably repre sented before the tribunal. The com plicated history of the questions aris ing made the Issue depend more than ordinarily In such cases upon the care and skill with which our case was; presented, and I should be wanting In proper recognition of a great patriotic service If I did not refer to the lucid historical analysis oMbe facts and the signal ability and force of argument- Biz uays id iengT a present eq to me court In support of our case by Mr. EHbu Root As secretary of state Mr Root had given, close study to the In tricate facts bearing on the contro versy and by diplomatic correspond ence had helped to frame the Issues. At the solicitation of the secretary of state and myself Mr. Root, though bur dened by his duties as senator from JCew Turk, undertook the preparation of the case as leading counsel, 'with the condition Imposed by himself that In view of bis position as senator be should not receive any compensation The tribunal constituted at The Hague by the governments of the Unit-1 ed States and Venezuela has completed Its deliberations and has rendered an I award hi the case of the Orinoco; Steamship company against Venezuela j The award may be regarded as satisfac tory since It has. pursuant to the con tentions of the United States, recog nized a number of important principles i making for a Judicial attitude In the determining of international disputes. In view of grave doubts which bad been raised as to the constitutionality of The Hague convention for the es tablishment of an International prize court, now before the senate for rat id eation, because of that provision of the convention which provides that there niay be an apial to the proposed court from the decisions of national courts, this government proposed in an Identic circular note addressed to those powers which bad taken part In the London maritime conference that the .powers signatory to the convention, if con fronted with such difficulty, might in Bert a reservation to the effect that ap peals to the International prize court In respect to decisions of its national tribunals ehould take the form of a dl sect claim for compensation,' that the jiro-eedings thereupon to be taken should be in the form of a trial de novo and that Judgment of the court should consist of compensation for the Illegal capture IrresprM-tive of the decision of the national tttirt whose Judgment bad thus been internationally Involved. As the result of an Informal discus sion It was decided to provide such pro cedure by means of a separate protocol which should be ratified at the same time as tin. prize court convention It self. Accordingly the government of the Net het lands at the request of this gov ernment proposed under date of May 24. 1910. to the powers signatory to The Hague convention the negotiation of a supplemental protocol embodying stipulations providing for this alterna tive procedure It is gratifying to ob serve that this additional protocol Is being signed without objection by the powers signatory to the original con veutloD and that there is every reason to believe that the international prize court will be soon established. The identic circular note also pro posed that the international prize court when established should be endowed with the functions of an arbitral court of Justice under and pursuant to the recommendation adopted by the last Hague conference The replies receiv- ; ed from the various powers to this pro posal iuapire the hope that this also feay be accomplished within the rov sonabty near future. It Is believed that the establishment of thpse two tribunals will go n Ions way towar"d securing the arbitration of many questions wblcb have heretofore threatened and at times destroyed the peace of nations. TO 

APPOINT PEACE COMMIS SIONERS. President Is Waiting For Expres sions From Foreign Powers. Appreciating these enlightened tend encies of modern times, the congress at its last session passed a law provid ing for the appointment of a commis sion of five members "to be appointed by the president of the United States to consider the expediency of utilizing existing international agencies for the purpose of limiting the armaments of the nations of the world by interna tional agreement and of constituting the combined navies of the world an International force - for the preserva tion of universal peace and to consider and report upon any other means to diminish the expenditures of govern ment for military purjioses and to lessen the probabilities of war." I have not as yet made appointments to this commission because I have in vited and am awaiting the expressions of foreign governments as to their will ingness to co-operate with us In the appointment of similar commissions or representatives who would meet with our commissioners and by Joint action 6eek to make their work effective. Europe, Canada. Etc Several important treaties have been negotiated with Great Britain In the past twelve months.- A preliminary diplomatic, agreement has been reach ed regarding the arbitration of pecu niary claims which eac-hk government has against the other. . This agree ment, with the schedules of claims annexed, will, as soon as the schedules are arranged, be submitted to the sen ate for approval 1 An agreement between the ' United States and Great Britain with regard to the location ot the international boundary line between the United States and Canada In Passamaquoddy bay and to the middle of Grand Ma ban channel was reached In a treaty concluded May 21. 1910. which has been ratified by both governments and proclaimed, thus making unnecessary the arbitration provided for In , the previous treaty of April It, 1908. The convention concluded Jan. 11. 1909. between the United States and Great Britain providing for the settle ment of international differences be tween the United States and Canada, including the apiortionment between the two countries of certain of the boundary waters and the appointment of commissioners to adjust certain oth-' er questions, has been ratified by both governments and proclaimed. - The work of the International fish eries commission appointed in 1908. under the treaty of April 1L 1903.. be tween Great Britain and the United States has resulted In the formulation and recommendation of uniform regu lations governing the fisheries of the boundary waters of Canada and- the United States for the puriose of pro tecting and increasing the supply of food 'flfib In such waters In comple tion of this work the regulations agreed upon require congressional leg islation to make them effective and for their enforcement in fulfillment of the treaty stipulations. 

OVERTHROW OF KING OKUEL United States .Recognized Portugal Provisional Republic. In October last the monarchy in Portugal was overthrown, a provision al republic was proclaimed, and there was set up , a de facto government which was promptly recognized by the government of the United States for purposes of ordinary intercourse pend ing formal recognition by this and oth er powers of the governmental entity to be duly established by the natioual sovereignty. Liberia. A disturbance among the native tribes of Listeria In a portion of the re public during the earlyvpart of this year resulted in the sending under the treaty of 12 of an American vessel : of war to the disaffected district, and the " Liberia n authorities, assisted by the good oIHces of the American naval officers, "were able to restore order. The negotiations Which have been un dertaken for-the amelioration of the renditions found In ' Liberia by the American commission.' whose report I transmitted to congress on March 25 last, are being brought to conclusion, and it is thought that within a short time practical measures of relief may te put into effect through the good of Bces of this government and the cor dial co-operation of other governments Interested in Liberia's welfare. The Near East Turkey. To return the visit or the special em bassy seni to announce the accessiou of his majesty Mebemet V.. emperor of the Ottomans. sent to Constanti nople a special ambassador, who. in ad'Ution to this mission ot ceremony, was charged with the duty ot express ing to the Ottoman government the Talue attached by the government of the .United States to increased and more important relations between the countries and the desire of the United States to contribute to the larger eco nomic and commercial development due to the new regime in Turkey. The rapid development now begin ning In thut ancient empire and the marked progress and Increased com mercial lmiH)rtance of Bulgaria. Rou manla and Servlu make it particularly opportune that the possibilities of American commerce in the near east should receive due attention. . Montenegro. - The national skoujx htina having ex pressed Its will that the principality of Monteuegro be raised to the rank of kingdom, the Prince of Montenegro on Aug 15 last assumed the title of king of Montenegro. It gave me pleasure to accord to the new kingdom the rec ognition of thee United States. The Far East. Tfje center of interest in far eastern affairs during the past year has again been China. It is gratifying to note that the ne gotiations for a loan to the Chinese govfrnment for the construction of the trunk railway lines from Hankow southward to Canton and westward through the Yangtse valley, known as the Huktiang loan, were concluded by the representatives of the various financial groups in May last and the results approved by their resjMvtive governments. The agreement, already initialed by the Chinese government, is now awaiting formal ratification. The basis of the settlement of the terms of this loan was one of exact equality be tween America.. Great Britain. France and Germany in respect to financing the loan acd supplying materials for the proposed railways and their future branches. The application. of the principle un derlying the policy of the United States in "regard to the Hukuang loan viz. that of the internationalization of the foreign Interest in such of the railways of China as may be financed by for elgu countries- was suggested on a broader scale by the secretary of state in a proposal for internationalization and commercial neutralization of all the railways of Manchuria. .While the principle which led. to the proiwsal of this government was generally admit ted by the powers to whom it was ad dressed, the governments of Russia and Japan apprehended practical difficul ties in the execution of the larger plan which prevented their ready adher ence The question of constructing the Chinebow-Aigun railway by means of an International loan to China is; bow ever, still the subject of friendly dis cussion by the interested parties. The policy of this government to these matters has been directed by a desire-to make the use of American capital in the development of China an instrument lit the promotion of China's welfare fnd material prosperity with out prejudice to her legitimate rights as an independent political power. This policy has recently found fur ther exemplification in the assistance given by this government to the nego tiations between China and a group of American bankers for a loan of $50. 01)0,000 to be employed chiefly in cur rency reform. The confusion which has ' from ancient times existed In the monetary usages of the Chinese has beeu one of the principal obstacles to commercial Intercourse with that peo ple. The United States in its treaty of 1903 with China obtained a pledge from the latter to Introduce a uniform national .coinage, and the following year, at the request of China, this gov ernment sent to Peking a member of the international exchange commission to discuss with the Chinese govern ment the best .methods of introducing the reform. In 190H China sent a com missioner to the United States to con-' suit witb'American financiers as to the possibility of securing a large loan with which to Inaugurate the new cur rency ,'system. but the death of their majesties the empress dowager and the emperor of China interrupted the ne gotiations, which were not resumed un-, til a few months ago, 'when this gov ernment was asked to communicate to the bankers ..concerned the request of China for a joan of $50,000,000 for the purpose, under review. A preliminary agreement between the American group and China has. been made covering the loan, 4 - ' . Fdr the success of this loan and the contemplated reforms which are of the greatest Importance to the commercial Interests of the United States and the civilized world at large It is realized that an expert will be necessary, and this government fcas received assur ances from China that such an advis er, who shall be an American, will be engaged. . ' It is a matter of interest to Ameri cans to note the success which is at- tending the efforts of China to estab lish gradually a system of representa tive government. The provincial as semblies were ' opened ' in ; October. 1909. and in October of the present year a consultative body, the nucleus of the future national parliament, held Its first session at Peking. The fear has further been marked by two important International agree ments delating to far eastern affairs. In the Russo-Japanese agreement re lating to Manchuria, signed July 4, 1910, this government was gratified to note an assurance of continued peaceful eonditionsjn that region and the reaffirmation of the policies with respect. to China to which the United States together with all other Inter ested powers are alike solemnly com mitted. The treaty annexing Korea to the empire of Japan, promulgated Aug, 29. 1910. maiks the una I step in a process of,coutroi of the aneient em pire by her powerful neighbor that ha. been in progress for several years past. In communicating the fact of auuexa tion the Japanese government gave to the government of the United States assurances of the full protection of the rights of American citizens in Ko rea under the changed conditions. ( Frieudiy visits of many distinguish ed persous from the far east have been made. during the year. Chief among these were their imperial highnesses Princes Tsai-tao and Tsai-Hsun of China and bis imperial highness Prince Higashi Pusbiml and Prince Tokugawa, president of the house of peers of Japan. The secretary of war has recently visited Japan and China In connection with his tour to the Philippines, and a large delegation of American business men are at present travpling in China. This exchange of friendly visits has had the happy ef feet of even further strengthening our friendly international relations. 

TROUBLES OF LATHI AMERICA. We Are at Peace, but War Bothers Southern Republics. During the past year several of our southern sister republics celebrated the one hundredth anniversary of their independence. In honor of these events special embassies were sent Vrom this country to Argentina. Chile and Mexico, where the. gracious re ception and splendid hospitality ex tended them manifested the cordial relations and friendship existing be tween those countries and the United States, relations which i am happy to THE FARMER: DECEMBER believe have never beore been upon so high a plane and so solid a basis as at present. ' The congressional commission ap pointed under a concurrent resolution to attend the festivities celebrating the centennial anniversary of Mexican ' Indeeudence. together with a special ambassador, were received with the highest honors and critb the greatest cordiality and returned with the report of the bounteous hospitality and warm reception pf President Diaz and the Mexican people, which left no doubt of the desire of the immediately neigh boring republic to continue the mutual ly beneficial and intimate relations which 1 feel sure the two governments will ever cherish. At the fourth pan-American confer ence, which met in Buenos Aires dur ing July and August last after seven weeks of harmonious deliberation three conventions were signed provid ing for the regulation of trademarks, patents and copyrights, which, when ratified by the different governments, will go far toward furnishing to Amer ican authors, patentees and owners of trademarks the protection needed In localities where heretofore it has been either lacking or inadequate. ; Furtber.i a convention for the arbitration of pecuniary claims was signed and a number of important resolutions pass ed. The conventions will in due course be transmitted to the senate, and the report of the delegation of the United States will be communicated to the congress for its information. The special cordiality between representa tive men from all parts of America which was shown at this conference cannot fall to react upon -and draw still closer the relations between the countries which took part In It The international bureau of Ameri can republics is doing a broad and use ful work for pan-American commerce and comity. Its duties were much en larged by the international conference of American states at Bueuos Aires, and its name was shortened to the more practical and expressive term of pan-American union . Located now in Its new building, which was specially dedicated April 26 of this year to the development of friendship, trade and peace among the American nations. It bas improved instrumentalities to serve the twenty-two republics of this hem lsphere. 1 am; glad to say that the action of the United States In Its desire to re move imminent danger of war between Peru and Ecuador growing out of a boundary dispute, with the co-operation of Brazil and the Argentine Re public as joint mediators with this gov eminent, has already resulted success fully in preventing war. The govern ment of Chile, while not one of the mediators, lent effective aid in further-, ance of a preliminary agreement likely to lead on to an amicable settlement and it is not doubled that the good offices of the mediating powers, and the conciliatory co-operation of the govern ments directly interested will finally lead v to a removal of this perennial cause of friction between Ecuador and Teru. The inestimable value of cordial co-operation between the sister repub lics of America for the maintenance of peace In this hemisphere has never been more clearly shown than in this mediation, by which three American governments have given to this hemis phere the honor of first Invoking the most farre:irhing" provisions of The Hague convention for the pacific set tlement of international disputes. There has been signed by the repre sentatives of the United States and Mexico a protocol submitting to the United Stares-Mexican boundary com mission (whose membership fur the purpose of this case Is to be Increased by the addition of a citizen of Can-ada-i the question of sovereignty over the Chamizal tract, which lies within the present physical boundaries 'of the fity of El Paso. Tex. The determina tion of this question will remove a vuurce of no little annoyance to the two governments. The republic of Honduras has for many years been burdened ' with 1 a heavy bonded debj held In Europe, the Interest on which' long ago fell in ar- : rears. Finally conditions were such that it became imperative to refund the debt and place the finances of the republic uiion a sound basis. Last ; year a group of American bankers un- : dertook to do this and to advance funds "for railway and other improve- tnents contributing directly to the fouutry's prosperity and commerce an arrangement which has long been de- j sired by this government Negotiations to this end have been under way for more than a year, and it is uowconfl 5eutly believed that a short time will suffice to conclude an arrangement which-will" be satisfactory to the for eign creditors, eminently advantageous j to Honduras and highly creditable to j the Judgment and foresight of the ' Honduranean government This is much to be desired since, as recognized by the Washington conventions, a . strong Honduras would tend immense- f ly to the progress and prosperity of Central America. ; During the past year the republic of , Nicaragua has been the scene of in- ternecine struggle. General Zelaya, for seventeen years the absolute ruler of Nicaragua, was throughout his ca reer the disturber of Central America and opposed every plan for the pro motion of pe'ace and friendly relations between the five republics. When the people of Nicaragua were finally driven into rebellion by his law less exactions be violated the laws of. war by the unwarranted execution of two American citizens who bad regu larly enlisted in the ranks of the rev olutionists. This and other offenses made it the duty of the American gov ernment to take measures with a view to ultimate reparation and for, the safeguarding of its interests. This involved the breaking off of all diplomatic relations with the 'Zelaya government for the reasons laid down In a communication from the secretary ot state, which also notified the con tending factions In Nicaragua that this povernment would hold each to strict accountability for outrages on the rights of American citizens. American forces were sent to both coasts of Ni caragua to be in readiness should oc casion arise to protect Americans and their tnterests and remained there un til the war was over and peace had returned to that unfortunate country. These events, together with Zelaya's continued exactions, brought him so clearly to the bar of public opinion 6, 1910 that Tie was Torce3 to "resign ari3 to take refuge abroad. in the above mentioned communica tion of the secretary of state to the charge d'affaires of the Zelaya govern ment the opinion was expressed that the revolution represented the wishes of the majority of the Nicaraguan peo ple. This bas now been proved beyond doubt by the fact that since the com plete overthrow of the Madriz govern ment and the occupation of the capital by the forces of the revolution all fac tions ha X united to maintain public or Jor. and as a result of discussion with an agent of this government sent to Ma nagua at the request of the provisional government comprehensive plans are beln made for the future welfare of Nicaragua, including the rehabilitation of public credit The moderation and conciliatory spirit shown by the vari ous factions give ground for the con fident hope that Nicaragua will soon take its rightful place among the law abiding and progressive countries of the world,, It gratifies me exceedingly to an nounce that the Argentine Republic some months ago placed with American manufacturers a contract for the con struction of two battleships and certain additional naval equipment The ex tent of this work and Its Importance to the Argentine Republic make the pl.y ing of the bid an earnest of friendly feeling toward the United States. Tariff Negotiations. The new tariff law in section 2 re spectingvthe maximum and minimum tariffs of the United States, which pro visions came into effect on April L 1910? Imposed upon the president the responsibility of determining prior to that date whether or not any undue discrimination existed against the Unit ed States and its products In any coun try of the world with which we sus tained commercial relations. In the case, of several countries in stances of apparent undue discrimina tion against American commerce were found to exist These discriminations were removed by negotiation. Irior to April 1. 1910. when the maximum tariff was to come Into operation with respect to Importations from all those countries In whose favor no proclama tion applying the minimum tariff rbould be Issued by the president, 134 Such proclamations were issued. This series of proclamations embraced the entire commercial world, and hence the minimum tariff of the United States has been given universal appli cation, thus testifying to the satisfac tory character of our trade relations with foreign countries. Marked advantages to the commerce of the United States were obtained through these tariff settlement. For eign nations are fully cognizant of the fact that under section 2 of the tariff act the president is required, when ever 'he Is satisfied that fhe treat ment accorded by them to th prod ucts of the United States is nft such as to entitle them to the benefit of the mbiimum tariff of the United States, to vlttulraw those benefits by procla mation, giving ninety days' notice, after which the maximum tariff will apply to their dutiable products enter ing the United States. In Its general opt ration this section of the tariff law bas thus far proved a guaranty of continued commercial , peace, although there are. however, unrorrunately in stances where foreign governments deal arbitrarily with American inter ests within their Jurisdiction in a man oer injurious and inequitable. The policy of broader and closer trtde relations with the Dominion of CV nada which was initiated In the ad justment ol the maximum and mini mum provisions of the tariff act of August, 1909, bas proved mutually benefit iai. ' It justifies further efforts for the readjustment of the commer cial relations of the two countries so that their commerce may follow the channels natural to contiguous coun tries and be commensurate with the steady expansion of trade and indus try on both sides of the boundary line. The reciprocation on the part of the Dominion government of the sentiment which was expressed by this govern ment was followed in October by fhe suggestioa that It would be glad to bave the negotiations which had been temporarily suspended during the sum merresumed in accordance with this EUggestion the secretary of state by my direction dispatched two represent atives of the department of state as special commissioners to Ottawa to tonfer with representatives of the Do minion government They were au thorized to take such steps for formu lating a reciprocal trade agreement a might be necessary and to receive anc consider any propositions which the Dominion government might care to submit . Pursuant to the Instructions Issued conferences were held by these com missioners with officials of the Domin ion government at Ottawa in the early part of November. ' The negotiations were conducted on both sides in a spirit of mutual accom modation. The discussion of the com mon commercial Interests of the two countries bad for its object a satisfac tory basis for a trade arrangement which offers the prospect of a freer In terchange for the products of the Unit ed States and of Canada. The confer ences were adjourned to be resumed in Washington in January, when it Is hoped that the aspiration of both gov ernments for a mutually advantageous measure of reciprocity will be realized. THE 

DEPARTMENT OF STATE Foreign Trade Is Improving Mer chant Marine Development. All these tariff negotiations, so vital to our commerce and Industry., and the duty of jealousy guarding the equi table and Just treatment of our prod ucts, capita! and industry abroad de volve upon the department of state. The Argentine battleship coutracts. like the subsequent lniortant one for Argentine railway equipment and those for Cuban government vessels, were secured for our manufacturers largely through the good offices of the depart ment of state. The efforts of that department to se cure for citizens of the United States equal opportunities in the markets of the world and to expaud American commerce bave been most successful. The volume of business obtained in new fields of competition and, upon. new lines Is already very great and congress Is urged to continue to sup port the department of state In its en deavors for further trade expansion. Our foreign trade merits the best supixirt of the government and the most earnest endeavor of our manu facturers and merchants, who. If they do not already in all cases need a for eign market, are certain soon to be come dependent on It Therefore, now is the time to secure a strong position in this field. I cannot leave this subject without emphasizing the necessity of such leg islation as will make possible and con venient the establishment of American banks and branches of American banks in foreign countries. Only by such means can our foreign trade be favor ably financed, necessary credits be ar ranged and proper avail be made of commercial opportunities In foreign countries, and most especially In Latin America. ' Another Instrumentality Indispensa ble to the unhampered and natural de velopment of American commerce is merchant marine. All maritime and commercial nations recognize the Im portance of this factor. The greatest commercial nations, our competitors, jealously foster their merchant ma rine. Perhaps nowhere Is the need for rapid and direct mail, passenger and freight communication qYilte so urgent as between the United States and Latin America. We can secure In no other quarter of the world such imme diate benefits in friendship and com merce as would flow from the estab lishment of direct lines of communica? tion with the countries of Latin Amer ica adequate to meet the requirements of a rapidly Increasing appreciation of the reciprocal dependence of the coun tries of the western hemisphere upon each other's products, sympathies and assistance. I alluded to this most Important sub ject In my last annual message. It has often been before you. and I need not recapitulate the reasons for Its recom mendation. .Unless prompt action be taken the completion of the Panama canal will find this the only great commercial nation unable to avail In international maritime business of this great contribution to the means of the world's commercial Intercourse. Quite aside from the commercial as pect unless we create a merchant ma rine where can we find the seafaring population necessary as a natural na val reserve and where could we find. In case of war, the transports and sub sidiary vessels without which a naval fleet Is arms without a body? For many reasons I cannot too strongly urge upon the congress the passage of a measure by mail subsidy or other subvention adequate to guarantee tha establishment and rapid development of an American merchant marine, the restoration of the American flag to Its ancient place upon the seas. With our Increasing international in tercourse it becomes incumbent upon me to repeat more emphatically than 2ver the recommendation which I made In my Inaugural address that congress shall at once give to the courts of the "United States Jurisdic tion to punish as a crime the violation of the rights of aliens secured by trea ty with the United States in order that I the general government of the United States shall be able when called upon by a friendly nation to redeem its solemn promise by treaty to secure to the citizens or subjects of that nation resident in the United States freedom from violence and due process of law In respect to their life, liberty and property. I Also and for the same general rea sons strongly commend to the favora ble, action of the congress the enact ment of a law applying to the diplo matic and consular service the princi ples embodied in section 1753 of the Revised Statutes of the United States, In the civil service act of Jan. 16, 1883, and the executive orders of June 17, 1900, and of Nov, 26, 1909. The excellent results which have at tended the partial application of civil service principles to the diplomatic and consular services are an earnest of the benefit to be wrought to both branches of the foreign service. The marked improvement in the consular service during the four years since the prin ciples of the civil service act were ap plied to that service In a limited way and the good results already notice able from a similar application of civil service principles to the diplomatic service a year ago convince me that the enactment Into law of the general principles of the existing executive reg ulations could not fail to effect further improvement of both branches of the foreign service, offering as it would by its assurance of permanency of tenure and promotion on merit an In ducement for the entry of capable young men 'into the service and an in centive to those already In to put forth their best efforts to attain and main tain that degree of efficiency -which the interests of our International relations and commerce demand. During many years past appeals have been made from time to time to con- j gress in favor of government owner- ship of embassy and legation premises ; abroad. The arguments in favor of such ownership have been many and oft repeated and are well known to the congress. The acquisition by the government of suitable residences and offices for its diplomatic officers, espe cially in the capitals of the Latin Amer ican states and of Europe, is so impor tant and necessary to an improved diplomatic service that I have no hesi tation in urging upon the congress the passage of some measure similar to that favorably reported by the house committee on foreien affairs on Feb. 14, 1910 (report No. 438), that would authorize the gradual and annual ac quisition of premises for diplomatic use. The work of the diplomatic service Is devoid of partisanship. Its importance should appeal to every American citi zen and should receive the generous consideration of the congress. 

TREASURY DEPARTMENT. Estimates For Next Year's Expenses. Where Savings Have Been Made. Every effort has been made by each department chief to reduce the esti mated cost of his department for the ensuing fiscal year ending June 30, 1912." I say this In order that congreBff racy , understand that these estimates thus made present the smallest sum which will maintain the departments, bureaus and offices of the government and meet its other obligations under existing law and that a cut of these the executive branch of the govern ment in the performance of its dntlea This remark does not apply to the river and harbor estimates, except to those for expenses of maintenance and the meeting of obligations under' au thorized contracts, nor does it apply to the public building bill nor to the navy building program. Of course as to these congress could withhold any part or all of the estimates for thens Ivlthout interfering with the discbarge or me ordinary oougauons or tne gov ernment or' the, performance of the functions of Its departments, bureaus ' and offices. The final estimates for the year end ing June 30, 1912, as they have been sent to the treasury on Nov. 29 of, this year for the ordinary expenses of the government,, including those for public buildings, rivers and harbors and the navy building program, amount to $630, 494,013.12. This is $52,964,887.36 less than the appropriations for the fiscal . .year ending June 30, 1911. It la $16, 883,153.44 less than the total estimates. mitted to congress by the treasury for ' the year 191L and is $5,574,659.39 less than the original estimates submitted by the treasury for 191L , These figures do not Include the ap-j propriations for the Panama canal, the I policy In respect to which ought to bt and is to spend at much each year as can be economically and effectively:) expended in order to complete tne ca-' ; nal as promptly as possible, and there- fore the ordinary v motive for cutting ' down the expense of the government . does not afJply to appropriations forj this purpose. It will be noted that tbs estimates for the Panama canal for : the ensuing year are more than $56,-; 000,000, an increase of $20,000,000 over the amount appropriated for this yeari o 4(ffAiAtiA 7iia tA tha fatf 4-ft f estimates for 1912 Include something: -! over $19,000,000; for the fortification of iue canui. Against the estimates of . expendl tures, $C30, 494,013.12, we have esti mated receipts for next year $680,000, 000, making a probable surplus of or dinary receipts over ordinary expendi tures of about $30,000,000, or, taking into account the estimates for the Pan ama canal, which are $56,920,847.69 and which will Ultimately be paid la bonds, it tfill leave a deficit for th ', ' next year of about $7,000,000 .if con- gress shall conclude to fortify the ca- 1 nal. The cost of the fortifications if ; about $19,000,000. Should there be no ! appropriations' this year for fortifica tions, then there would be, even in cluding the Panama canal appropria tion, a surplus of about $12,000,000. The treasury department is ono of the original departments of the goy ernmeft. Wib the changes x in tho monetary system l made , from time to time and with the creation Jjf nation al banks, it was thought necessary to organize new bureaus and ' divisions, which were added in a somewhat hap hazard way and resulted In 'a' appli cation of duties which might well now ' be ended. , This lack of system and economic" co-ordination has attracted, the atten tion of the head of that department; who has been giving his time for the last two years, with the aid of ex perts and by consulting bis bureau chiefs, to Its reformation, and at the risk of being tedious, but merely to illustrate the character of the reforms that are possible, I shall comment on a number of changes that are being , made or ought to be made by legls lative aid. ; ' ; The auditing system In vogue Is as old as the government, and the meth ods used are antiquated. ' There are six auditors and seven assistant au ditors for the nine departments, and under the present system the only function which the auditor of a de partment exercises Is to determine, oi accounts presented by disbursing of . fleers, that thec object of the expendl-y ture was within the law and the ap-V propria tion madefy congress for th. purpose on Its face and that the calcn laftions in the accounts are correct H does not examine the merits of tfcsi' transaction or determine the reason-', ableness of the price paid for the to tides purchased, nor does he furnisbr any substantial check upon disburs ing officers and the heads of depart' , ments or bureaus with sufficient promptness to enable the government to recoup itself in full measure for unlawful expenditure. A careful plan is being devised and! will be presented to congress with th recommendation that the force of audi tors and employees under them ba : greatly reduced, thereby effecting sub stantial economy. But this economy, will be small compared with the larger economy that can be effected by con solidation and change of methods. The possibilities In this regard have been shown in the reduction of expenses and the importance . of methods and! efficiency in the office of the auditor for the postofflce department, who, without in the slightest degree Impair ing the comprehensiveness and effi ciency of his work, has cut down th expenses of his office $120,000 a year. Again, in the collection of the reve nues, especially the customs revenues, a very great Improvement has been ef fected, and further Improvements are contemplated. By the detection of frauds in weighing sugar upward of $3,400,000 have been recovered from the beneficiaries of the fraud, and an entirely new system free from the pos sibilties of such abuse bas been de vised. The department has perfected the method of collecting duties at the .. port of New York so as to save the government upward of ten or eleven million dollars, and the same spirit of change and reform has been infused into the other customs offices of tho country. . The methods used at many places ; are archaic. T'fsre would seem to bo no reason at all why the surveyor of the port, who really acts for the col lector, should not be a subordinate of the collector at a less salary and dl- , reetly under his control, and there I but little reason for the existence of the naval officer, who Is a kind of local auditorl His work Is mainly an ex amination of accounts which is con-
