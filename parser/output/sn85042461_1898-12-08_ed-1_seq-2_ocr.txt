In over sea navigation to fore \ _ pons more than 1500 miles distant.AraeA can shipping amounted to only 2,008,0 M tons, compared with 27,418,028 tons lor-\ Olily three practical courses, nt the pros en: time, are open to the United States.: First—Wo may retain our law.- unchanged, ignore national navigation and continue to rely on vessels under foreign llags lor the transportation of our exports and imports. Second—We may permit foreign-bum yes- j sels to register under the American flag, ship crews abroad and increase national navigation. Third—We may extend direct govern ment aid to vessels built in the lulled States and thus increase both national nay- , igation and national ship building. The last named of these three courses is suggested to a very great extent by our new relations to the rest ot the world, which aspects the United States to become a man- ! time power. For the first time we now hold ' and shall, doubtless, permanently bold in habited territory beyond the limit of the North American continent. i If till that such possession involved were' . the physical force to keep these domains . •gainst all comers, the vote of some extra j tens of millions every year to the army and navy would be sufficient. The Dag of the ' United States should be more than the ; token of conquest by superior strength, tint maritime position mu-t correspond to our pr< tensions, and to attain this result Amcr- I ican shipyards and American ships must be increased, and reasonable contributions from the treasury toward tiiis result should not be begrudged. Nations and individuals that dissent from the general theory of gov ernment aid to private enterprise concede on political grounds an exception in favor of siiip building and navigation. Largely through indifference we have lost the -hare in transatlantic navigation which was once ours. The growing trade of the Pacific is rapidly slipping away from 11-. Excluding Hawaii, cutties and clearances from Asia and Ocesnica at ports of the United s-tates in 1890 amounted to 238,960 tons American shipping, and in lsiiT to only 221,438 tons, while foreign shipping increased from 431,242 tons to 1)24,720 tons. Foreign nations arc now skillfully following the policy of government aid to develop their navigation in the Pacific Toward steamship lines to the east coa-t of Asia alone Great Britain last year con tributed $1,250,000* Prance, 81,217,000; Ger many. $480,000; Spain (1896), $416,000; Rus sia, $405,000; Au.-tria. $306,000, and Italy, $277,000. The United "States paid only $40. --000 to American lines to Asia at regular mail rates. We have deluded ourselves into • the belief that the Pacific trade will become ours without taking ordinary pn caution* to meet competition. Liberal extracts are published from the report on which the Reichstag last year increased to 5,500,000 marks subsidies lo German vessels in the Pacific, showing that Germany is already en deavoring to forestall the United States in securing commt rcial control of the Pacific. The act of 1891 was designed to secure the largest and quickest steamship! in the world for the American service on the Atlantic. Marine construction, however, has already advanced beyond the size and speed con tempi, ited whin that act was passed. It has proved inadequate for the Pacific. Its maximum rates for (bat trade are $2.30 per nautical mile outward for a sixteen-knot steamship. The British government pays $2.82 to the Peninsular and Oriental and fc0.40 to the Canadian Pacific lines, the Her man government pays #2.54 to fourteen-knot vessels of the North German Lloyd and tlie French government $2.98 to the Uessageries Maritime*, the equivalent for an inferior service to Asia. Spain imposed annual charges cf A 580,000 on Cuba. $125,000 on Porto lino and $170,000 on the Philippine! for steam communica tion and herself contributed $1,000,000 more for that purpi sc. This Spanish total l about double the entire rapport ihe l'nited States- gave American sic niship-: in IXO7. The obligation! we have assumed by taking Porto Rico and the Philippines, annexing Hawaii and governing Cuba thus require Us to make larger appropriations for the mer chant marine or to cor.;,ss our weakness by abandoning navigation to (ireal Britain, Germany, France and Japan. We must also take steps for the qualified admission of foreign ships to American registry in order to enter immediately into active competition for Asiatic trade. The act of 1891 calls for 5000-ton steam-hips of 10 knots. We have only ten tea-going Steamship! ot over 400(1 tons. Ail of these are American transatlantic liner- and two New York-Cuba mail liners already under postal contract, The Arizona. 5300 tons, 10 knots, is the only vessel ci mplying with the requirement! of the act of ISM, and she was admitted by Congri 1 i-t June to American registry ami |„ tight by the War Department, The China, admitted by Congress at the same time, is 4940 tons, 17 knots. The two remaining vc-seU .ire the City of Pekin, 0080 tons, bul only 14 knots, built : n 1874, und the El llio, owned by the navy under the name Dixie, it will r« quite v ici-t eighteen months to build vessels oi over 5000 tons and sixteen kids, needed to meet new conditions in the Pacific. Meanwhile a combination of four large German lines, aided by the Reichstag, is hastening to completion steamships to carry out German imperial policy in Asia. A relaxation of the registry law was nec essary to establish our transatlantic line ..ml a similar relay h ion is now- necessary to meet conditions on the Pacific. It is proposed that foreign built vessels I, P admitted to American registry on condition that equiv alent tonnage be built in the l'nited Sta'os, os w.ls done in the rase of the Paris, New York, St. Paul and St. Louis. By a similar policy Germany has built up within four teen years its gr Ba | ship cards. From ISSS to ism to Nortti German Lloyd spent *7, --000,000 iv Germany, ami $2,000,000 in lltit ish yards, while from 1891 to 1897 it spent $10. ,ooii 1,, German yards and only $1 - 500.U110 Oi British yards. ' ' ' The report considers diffi retires in cost of construct i, n ,-,nd operstion under (he Amer ican and British flags and conclude! that on the ay, rag-, for cargo steamship, now in use by foreign nut.on-, this difference amounts to about one cent per ton for each 100 nautical miles. On the basis considered *" •'"•"." >1 expenditure of about $5, --000,000 tor twelve or fourteen years, aided hy industrial development, will give th- Waited Male a becoming maritime rank. ih:s sum « substantially the expenditure lot-ougar bounty in der the tariff of 1890 By investing the necessary capital the 1 Tilted State- cm become a ship-htiiMinn power superior to the German and a clo=c. competitor with Great Britain. This au tumn we exported plates for the largest ships now on the ways in Great Britain. Five years ago we imported the plates from Great Britain for our lirst large steel square rigged ship. The trade between the United States and Porto Rico now, by executive order, restricted to American ports, should be so confined by statutes. Of the trade between America and Hawaii thirty per cent is carried on by American vessels, and over ten per cent of thel re' mainqer by Hawaiian vessels, which will douhtVess be admitted to American registry by Cottgress. American vessels now leaving in bslwSt will be sufficient to supply the transportation requirements of the island if foreign vessels are withdrawn. Almost the entire value of the annexation of Hawaii to the development of American navigation in the Pacific is involved in treating the island* as an extension of our boundaries, bringing us from 1500 to 2000 miles neuter the markets of Asia and Aus tralia. Thy* opposition of British and Ger mans in t.liis proposition! is anticipated in the line of their consistent policy, by sub sidies to develop their shipping on the Pa cific. The restrtotione proposed, however, arc in strict accord with our national policy and with our trestles and does not interfere with the exii-ting trade relations. A revision of the tonnage tax laws is proposed. ..... The report also .considers legislation for the impi avensent of American seamen, pilot age charges, seaworthiness of vessels, allot' ment of wages and other matters.

ABOUT THE STATE An earthquake shock was felt at Oakland about 8 o'clock last evening. It was severe enough to cause brick ami stone buildings to sway, and break cv.mc glassware. No real damage was reported. Frederick Schroeder, a well-known litho grapher of Alameda, attempted suicide by cutting his throat with, a racor last even ing, but was overpowered by an officer be fore be had inflicted a fatal wound. A jury trial has been, demanded in the Adolph Sutro will contest, and both side* 'o the controversy have expressed a desire for a speedy trial. Judge Coffey has agreed I i grant the contestantsileave to amend their pleadings. Louie Kammer, a butcher of Alameda, has disappeared. Thereiis evidence that he committed suicide by jumping trom the Flay Arm island bridge into the bay. His friends, however, refuse to believe that be has made away with himself.

ANGELES HERALD t THURSDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 8, 1898 MORE GLORY THAN FUN EN TAKING A MONITOR ACROSS THE PACIFIC THE CREW OF THE MONADNOCK Given Due Praise for Persistent At tention to Duty Under the Most Trying Circumstances Associated Press Special Wire WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—The navy de partment has just made public a report from Capt. Whiting, who commanded the Mo nadnock on the voyage from San Francisco to Manila, in which the latter, after telling of some of the hardships endured during the trip, pays a well deserved compliment to tiie energy and ability of the officers and crew which Btads possible what was with out doubt the most remarkable voyage ever made by an ironclad vessel iivan emergency. Capt, Whiting's report, which reached the navy department through Admiral Dew ey, contains details of his trip. He espe cially commends the alertne-s* of the M-onad nock's executive officer, Lieutenant Com mander C. P. Perkins; Chief Engineer T. F. Burgdorff, who "stubbornly fought the inherent weakness- of engines deeigntd for harbor use antl successfully forced them en such a prolonged voyage at sea," and Sur geon J. M. Steele, who carried the ship's company through the trying ordeal without a -ingle fatality, though men were continu ally failing from heat and exhaustion. Speaking of the zealous responses of the officers and men to unusual calls for duty, Capt. Whiting says: "They volunteered by delegation to coal ship day and night at Guam, although near ly prostrated by the heat and confinement to which they were subjected, both there and while en route. Too much praise cannot be given the engineer force below, who have been incessantly occupied, at times day and night, under the moss arduous circumstance! that can be imagined on board .-hip in the tropics, doing their utmost to ktep the ma chinery in running order. "Tli.it I have succeeded in safely bring ing this monitor so far from her intended field of action in such a comparatively short time, with the Nero for a consort, is wholly „i.d entirely due to the most patriotic and energetic supiort of this ship's company of officers and men. There is no better ship's i mpany afloat, and all who can show upon their records that they took part in the cruise of the Monadnock from San Fran cisco to Manila during the war with Spain deserve all the favors that the navy de partment and a grateful country can bestow upon them either now- or in the future."

A Santiago Celebration SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Dec. 7.—Today ts '.he anniversary of the death of General An tonio tdaceo, audi has been celebrated among the Cubans iv Santiago. A memorial ser vice was held this morning iv the cathedral, winch was crowded. Considerable annoyance was occasioned to the United States authorities by the tact that some seventy-five men, Cubans, marched the entire length of St. Thomas street, armed with rifles and machetes, al though all Cubans are well aware that such conduct is strictly against the regulations, armed bodies, other than l'nited States troops, not being allowed. The armed squad fired three volleys, many of them using ball cartridges, whose bullets striking the upper portions of the cathedral, caused the bell ringers to llee from their post. An officer of the Fifth immune regiment soon arrived at headquarters with a mes sage from Colonel Sargent, stating that sev eral bullets had struck his tent at different points and asking information as to the cause. Colonel Garcia said he was under the impression that the men used blank cart ridges and that the United States authori ties had been notified of the intention of a number of men to march in connection with the eelebrntion. Colonel Bacon ordered Colonel Garcia not to allow- his men to attend the evening pro cession armed, and said he would permit tiie continuance ct" the morning celebration only on the distinct unelerstanding that there was to be no firing. The sole reason why the offenders were not arrested was that they were within the cathedral limits at the time. Affairs at Havana NEW YORK, Dec. 7.—A dispatch to the Herald from Havana says: A severe test has been given the new pier at Marianao Beach, by a strong norther that has been blowing fur four days and its builders art pleased that it has weathered the attacks of the waves. The storm has demonstrated, however, the impossibility of landing troops or supplies there during the heavy seas. The result is that a new landing place has been selected at the oil company's pier be tween Chorrero and Vedado, near the mouth oi the Chorrero River. Work upon the new docks at this point is being hurried by the engineers, and by Sunday, when the troops ire expected, any transport drawing twenty live feet of water or less, may be accommo date.], thu- obviating the necessity of light erage. line volunteer engineers are comfortably encamped. They have the tent floor's boarded and are busily pressing forward the work for the reception of the troops. On the -ite of the camp for the First Brigade the ground lias been cleared, streets have been marked out and everything baa been put in readiness for their arrival. Plans for the sewerage and water system have been completed and the ground has been plowed out with necessary pipes. Their sidings are being constructed connect ing the camp with the railroad system and as soon as the necessary mint-rial arrives, these various works will be pushed. It is probable that much of the work will be given out by contract in order to expedite matters. President MeKinley's message has given the greatest satisfaction to the Cubans, who li k upon it as c definite declaration of the policy of the United States toward Cuba. .Rafael Portuondo, the president of the l üb.in As.-emb'.y, said: "The message is most satisfactory to Cu ban aspiration aril will have an excellent effect l i re, it provei beyond further cavil ipd dispute the honest intention of the I Dlted M ites toward Cuba, it will quiet many of our more violent associates who b ive talked loudly about America and been suspicion! of her intentions, and it will en able tho-e. like myself, who have believed and trusted in her, to co-operate more fullj with her official! in their work. It is v good message and fully satisfies us." In carrying out his work of sanitation for the city Major Davis, with a sanitary In sp et. r, made the rounds of the principal cues and hotels, examining the internal ar rangements with a view to issuing orders for their compulsory cleaning. Of the nine j hospitals inspected by him, Major Davis re- I - that the Rein a Mercedes is the only one in tit condition to receive patients. General Humphrey! has ordered that no Cuban physician! attend the quartermaster's .!. hut nn tit, and in the future physicians of the marine hospital service will give pro fessional attention to any of his men who may fall ill.

PAY OF THE SOLDIERS WAS WITHHELD AT BEQUEST OF COMMANDERS THE WAR INQUIRY WITNESSES Answer Routine Questions as to the Conduct of Affairs During the Lato War Associated Press Special Wire WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—The war in vestigating commission examined several' witnesses toelav, including Paymaster Gen eral Stanton and Col. Hecker, quartermas ter in charge of the transportation ot the troops. Paymaster General Stanton tcsti lied that orders and requests were given him from those m command of the for,.- , asking that the pay of the volunteers be deferred until they should return to the l'nited States, that being believed to be the wisest and most judicious course. Pay was withheld iv Cuba on the order of Maj. Gen. Miles, he thought, and from the trixips in Porlo Rico on the orders or requests of several commanders. Col. Hecker, who has just returned from Cuba. WSJ examined in detail as to the charters and purchases of vessels by the war department, lie said that, between June ill and duly i"> he purchased seventeen vessels on the authority of the secretary of war. He found BO per cent of the vessels offered wholly unsuited. Col. Hecker said in his negotiations he dealt directly with the owners of the vessels wherever possible. He knew of no instance where more than the actual cost price was paid for vessels. He always, he said, got lower than the ask ing price. Queried as to railway contracts he inter jected that it was not he, but the railways, that "controlled the rates." as they charged mere than they ought to have received. He referred to the transportation rates' be tween Chiekamauga and Newport News, and said that better rates had been ob tained by letting these contracts in this city, the tariff having been reduced from v l3 to $S per man lor the same service. Col. Hecker made an emphatic denial that there was any "influence" in "routing" the troops on the several lines. Col. Alden. assistant surgeon general, said he did ne.t know why it was that only offic ers who "hustled" were able to get medical supplies for their men. Col. A Men was askeel why it was that a volunteer organiz ation like the Red Cross could get supplies on the ground abend of the medical depart ment where the medical department hail certainly prior information of the coming movement. He y saitl that it was because the medical department mas dependent upon the quartermaster's department, the trans portation department and commissary de partment and it was not supplied with men enough to carry out the plans it knew were necessary.
