THK year 1899 will go down as a record one in indus trial history, especially as relates to substantial and widespread advances in wages, and a general in crease and activity in employment. THF, time has passed for the people of the United States to discuss the question of what is to lie done with the Philippines. We drove out the Spaniards who had been the governing power nearly four hundred years. For us to withdraw would leave a condition of anarachy, and foreigners who own property in the country would have certainly a strong moral claim against the United States for their losses. Americans will find this an excellent field for their energies and the wealth-producing powers of these islands under American influence will be great.”—Let ter from General Joe Wheeler in the Philippines. WHERE SHOULD THE YOUNG MAN CO? EVER since Horace Greely gazed upon the virgin plains and beheld the star of empire and called upon the young men of the East to give up home lies and positions and take themselves toward the selling sun, his famous phrase has been sadly overworked. Hundreds of thousands did go Weet, and civilization has no parallel for the miracles they wrought. But in a third of a century the changes have been vast, and in many oi its sections the West is more crowded than was the East when Greely shouted at the top of his rhetoric, “Go West, young man, go West!” So it has happened that we have many echoes of this cry, and although the West is scarcely a half century from Indians and wild animals to sky-scrapers and Populists, litre we find the Secretary ol Agriculture—a new Cabinet position, by die way, which the West established—saying, “Go East, young man, go East;’’ Leave the crowded thoroughfares of the Western land and take up the abandoned farms ol New England and the Middle States, and do for the eliete portions of the coun try what your ancestors did for the wilderness. Hut so far the farmers are not preparing wagon trios to that section where they cultivate the mind along with the land, and where, ac cording to tilt latest circulated libel, they even import their beans. Articles are being published telling young men to go to Siberia, and wonderful are the attractions offered. Our young men are told to go to the colonies, to Japan and China, to the different parts of the earth; and some of them have gone, and many of them with accommodating relatives have returned. Thousands went to Alaska, and most of them have beautiful stories to tell about the gold which they did not bring home. This idea ol going somewhere in order to amount to anything belongs to the restless spirit ol the race, and nothing can be more erratic in its contrasts and contradictions. A great busi ness firm in Chicago moved to New York and took its West ern men with it; at the same time a rival imported New York men to man its Chicago establishment. A San Francisco mil lionaire who bought a newspaper engaged editors all the way from New York to run it; then when lie bought a New York paper betook his San Francisco editors to run that. The very day a great Eastern railroad took for its general manager a man from Oregon, a great corporation in the Northwest sent to the Atlantic seaboard for a president. When big werk is to be done, when the big position is to be filled, it is the man that is wanted, and not the fact that he lives at home or has moved away because he did not amount to anything in his own town. The great successes are not made by change of location, although it often lias something to do with the case. As a rule, the best thing that happens to the average young man who has to move in order to be worth his bread and butter, is that it throws him upon his own resources. All over the world young men to-day have greater opportunities than were ever known before. But they will not realize them by dreaming that they can be come rich 011 the oilier side of the world when they fail to do their ordinary duties wherever they may be placed.—Lynn Roby Meekitis in Saturday Evening Post. Yes —Flktun and Cecil county give the thrifty young man plenty of opportunities. It is exertion and stick-at-itness that count. —[Kd.] 

CECIL WHIG, ELKTON. SATURDAY. DECEMBER 9, 1899. EVERY American’citizen who has read anything on the subject of the Alaskan boundary dispute believes that the United States should hold onto every foot of ground to which she is entitled. There is not a dis senting voice to this proposition. And yet some years ago there were a lot of people in the country who opposed and fought the Alaska purchase and accused the Government of idiocy, if not criminality, on account of it. The case has a strong parallel at the'present time. ORGANIZATION of trusts goes merrily on in free trade England, quite to the confusion of those who asserted a few months ago that the protective sys tem was the only soil in which trusts could flourish. The British newspapers bristle with announcements of the formation of new trusts and great corporations of this char acter, while reports from other European countries, show that the trust is not in any sense peculiar to the United States, but that its development comes with business activity and production on a great scale wherever these conditions exist. PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE. ON Tuesday, President McKinley sent his annual mes sage to Congress, and which was a document of strength and unusual interest. It reviews thor oughly the very important questions now before the country and makes certain recommendations. The President steers clear of any utterances that can be taken by his oppo nenls as savoring of politics. He confines himself to a clear and succinct presentation > f matters that need the attention of Congress and w here his recommendations are made they are found to be in perfect harmony with the needs of the country. The future of Cuba, Porto Rico, Hiwaii and the Phillipine Islands, consume considerable space. In treating of the Phil lipines, the President expresses the hope that the insurrection w ill soon end, and truthfully says that “few graver respon sibilities have been ever confided tons,” and that ‘‘if we ac I cept them in a spirit worthy of our race and traditions, a great opportunity comes with them'’ in the solution of the Phillipine question. He also makes the strong point that to renounce our allegiance over the islands “would involve at the outset a cruel breath of faith.” There can be no mistaking what the President has to say concerning the question of trusts, and nothing more could either be said or done by the President. He is merely an executive and in setting lorlh his views on this subject he has done his lull duty in the premises. The President recommends that additional power be given the Secretary of the Treasury to support the existing gold standard, his suggestions being in line, as a matter of course with those made by the Secretary a few days ago and set forth in the bill prepared for the consideration of Congress. On that point even the most carping critics can find no fault. THE enormous gold productions of recent years are con vincing thinking men who a few years ago favored a return to silver that this is no longer necessary, at least at present. President A. J. Warner, of the Bi metallic League, during a recent visit to Washington, said frankly to his friends that the very great increase of gold pro duction of late was causing, in his opinion, a great deprecia tion rather than an appreciation of gold, which, of course, would obviate the necessity of still greater additions to the metallic currency of the world by an increased use of silver. 

CONGRESS. SPEAKER HENDERSON will probably never enjoy a prouder moment than when he was escorted to the Speaker’s chair, having been elected to the highest political honor that a foreign born American can at tain, by the unanimous vote of his republican colleagues of the House, amid the applause of members and of the crowded galleries—the American who would not be proud of such an honor doesn’t live. The other officers of the House elected were Alexander McDowell, of Pennsylvania, Clerk ; Henry Casson, of Wisconsin, Sergeant-at-Arms ; W. J. Glenn, of New York, Door-keeper; Joseph C. McElruy, of Ohio, Postmaster; and Rev. Henry M. Couden, of Michigan, Chaplain. With the exception of Mr. Casson, who succeeded B. F. Russell, of Missouri, these are the officers of the last House. Immediately after the swearing in of the members, near the close of which, the democrats created a little Hurry by opposing the carrying out of the republican plan for dealing with the Roberts case, the death of Vice-President Hobart was announced, and the House adjourned, it having been previously understood that the President would withhold his annual message until Tuesday The first session of the Senate of the Fifty-Sixth Congress was much briefer than that of the House, and from a specta tor’s point of view, much less interesting. Senator Frye, President pro tempore, called the Senate to order, and after p rayer by the Chaplain, and the swearing in of new Senators, t he death of the late Vice-President was announced, and a motion to adjourn was adopted. But if the opening day of C ongress was comparatively tame, there are plenty of indica tions that lively days in both House and Senate will be numer ous during the session. 

PRESIDENT SCHURMAN, of the Philippine Commis sion, announces that he not only originally opposed expansion, but that he said to President McKinley, when tendered the chairmanship of the Commission, that he was opposed to the acquisition of the islands. The President, however, insisted that he wanted only facts, what ever they might be. As a result Mr. Schurman obtained them, and in doing so became convinced that the islands should be retained, and that the United States could give them a vastly better government than they would obtain under any other circumstances.
