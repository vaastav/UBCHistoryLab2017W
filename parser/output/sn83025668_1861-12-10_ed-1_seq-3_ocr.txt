A small amount of Sea Island cotton is raised upon Tybee Island, and its inhabitant are but few. It haa a beautiful creek to the west of it, where a ship of any burden may lie in safety at anchor. Fort Puhoki is situated on the north eastern comer of Co kpur Inland, w hich is separated from Tybee Island try the creek or arm of the sea above mentioned. It defends the Savannah Kiver and the approaches to the cit t. The fort, Me so many other, being left to tale care of it self, the Georgians at seresnion limcs,quicl ly look possession. They immediately com menced work, completing the defences, mounting additional gun, etc, till at the lime of Mr Uuhm U's visit in May last, be thought it capable of stopping a fleet very effectually.
