The message of President Harrison, ■which appeared in full in yesterday's i Rboobd-Uhiov, despite its length, ought to be read by every citizen. If such state documents were more iead, tho broad ened public intelligence would insure us 11 more rational and conservative thought j concerning public affairs, and inspire the 11 people more generally with greater conti- i dence in the strength and the enduring quality of the American Republic. 11 We can pass over the warm defense the President makes of the protective policy, and the thrusts he gives the oncoming j administration concerning the obligation tt has assumed to test the merits of a tariff system that it is expected will be radi cally different from the present. For tbat much was the privilege of the President ; as a candidate who suffered defeat upon ' the lines ofa high protective tariff. Aside, then, from that matter, the ! President's message is an optomistic doc- j ument. It glows with fervid recital of : the prosperous condition of the country, ! and revels in figures cited in proof not i only that we havo greatly increased our ! coastwise trade, butour export commerce : also, and that this has reached all lines of , production and all kinds of industries. I He holds, too, that the benefits of increased industry, augmented I trade, enlarged exports and new markata and the benefits of commercial reciprocity, good wages, augmented pro duction and remarkable prosperity havo not been confined to the few, but havo been widely distributed and have related to betterment in all dlr.ectlons. He ex cepts only agriculture, but while it has not been, he says, wholly excluded from the general advance, yet the causes of its limitation in profits have been overpro duction, and the fact that the farmer can not produce to order. Nevertheless, be believes that the English agriculturist i ■would gladly exchange the returns of his ' labor for those of the American farmer, j and adds that while the market prices of ' wheat and cotton have been low, tbe gen eral average of prices has been such as to give agriculture a fair participation in general prosperity. This argument of general comfort, prosperous conditions and highly benefi cial commercial, productive and indus trial results to be thankful for is used to supplement the President's regret that the people have not indorsed the pro- ; tective policy. Nevertheless, the statistics recited by the President, with partisan intent, have nn importance worthy of distinct consid eration and closer analysis than can be given in a general review of the message. His statement that the public bus iness has been transacted with fidelity and procision under his administration will be agreed to by all the country, which will also tako pride, as does Presi dent Harrison, in the fact that in the lour years of his administration there has not been misappropriation of a cent or the loss of a dollar by defalcation on the part of any Federal official. He but briefly refers to the Behring Sea controversy, for the reason that it is now j before a Board of Arbitration, but he I i suggests wisely that the taking of seals in North Pacifio watorsby American vessels as the schools pass to thoir favorite waters beyond the Aleutian Islands be forbid den. When arbitration as to the right of tho United States over the sea, and the needs for a closed season Is ended, the re striction, so far as it can be done under the verdict, should be extended to the vessels of all nations. His treatment of Canadian questions is vigorous and American. He protests that the Canadian Pacific Railroad should not be permitted to snatch from us com merce legitimately ours, because tbat line is exeuipt from the operation of laws that bear stringently upon our own lines of transportation. Nor is tho message to be mistaken in its tone concerning Canadian arrogance and interference with our con cerns, nor as to Canadian activity In dis turbing negotiations between the United States and Great Britain. He justifies his retaliatory action re garding the imposition of canal tolls at Kault Ste. Marie, and suggests that if Canadian intolerance and injustice do not cease we will be warranted in tbe con struction ol American-side canals that •will free us from the necessity of using the Welland or any Canadian route. As suredly the whole American people are in cordial accord with the President's ex pressions on this head. His pride in the new navy is warmly I l |,il l■anil and reflects the general senti ment ot the Nation. His urgent appeal for full restoration of American shipping ia fortified by istatements and statistics concerning American service done by foreign bottoms that are all prepared, in case of war, to be converted into the cruisers of an enemy. He declares, with entirely justifiable indignation, that it is •shameful that out of American payments foreign ship-building should be so pro moted as to enable it to become a weapon of offensive warfare against us. In short, the message makes a strong plea, and a j sound one, for an augmented naval re- j Serve, and such subsidy aid by the Gov- i eminent to that end as is justified by the j importance of the interests at stake, and I by the fact that we may by this policy j make trade follow our flag. He puts in a warning word concerning ! our threatened Pacific Coast trade be cause of ihe seductive policy of foreign shipping lines, that are enabled to accom plish their ends by enormous subven- ; tions granted by the British Government* I SACHA^yTO 

DA-XT RECORD-FyiOy, THURSDAY, DECEMT.ET. 8, 1502.-SIX PAGES President Harrison puts in, for the sec ond time, a protest against the conditions in the Court of Claims, where nearly $10, --000,(k.j of claims are now pending against the United States without adequate pro vision to enable the Government to properly defend against them. Unques tionably the Department of Justice ought to be given means sufficient to enable it to hunt out the facts where there is rea son to believe that proof of the dis loyalty of the claimant can be had. Presi dent Cleveland was tho eleventh Presi dent and President Harrison the twelfth who has reterred to the fact—that ougbt to cause American cheeks to blush with shame—that the French spoliation claims are still unsettled. The President gives us in more concise form than does the Postmaster-General the facts concerning the gratifying in crease and betterment of the postal serv loa. That tho public debt has been re duced in his term some £_09,0._J,000, and the annual interest charges eleven and a half millions, is a fact cited by Presi dent Harrison with pride. He points out also that 1114,460,906 more has bean paid out for pensions during his term to November Ist, than between March 1, lSN'i, and March 1,189 a He defends tho pension polie-y warmly, and enters an earnest plea for the veteran soldier. A telegraphic cable to Hawaii, the im mediate utilization of our privilege io es tablish a naval station in Pearl Harbor, and encouragement of the construction of the Nicaragua Canal, are urged, and with reasons that meet the common ju Iginent of the peOple of tiie I nii.d States. The President approvea the new poll adopted concerning the Indians, the set ting asiele to them lennis In severalty, tin; support of tho Indian schools, and the c.inversion of our Indian wards into citi zens, lt is to bo regretU d thai he did not advise the complete abandonment of the contract school system, that the priest and the church teacher shall not from any funds of the Government tinii support while proselyting among the red men. • tur relations with the South American States he reports as peaceful, and our commerce with them steadily improving, but to be more extended if the policy is continued, as it should be, of paying iib eral sums for the carriage of United States mails in swift American vessels, so eou structed as to constitute a nasal reserve. The extirpation of the cattle disease, he says, has been due to governmental ac tivity and department faithfulness; as a result a value has been aided to the cattle industry that the President thinks can i hardly be estimated, and that promises to be enormous in the export of live cattle to English ports, without the require ment tbat the animals shall be killed at the docks. The President strikes a chord that will lind responsive vibrations in the vast ma jority of American hearts when, referring to the quarantine imposition he ordered against the cholera, he warns the country tbat not only sanitary conditions, but those all'ecting tbe moral, political and industrial interests of the Nation, demand that there shall be new and more rigor- j ous restrictions imposed upon admission | to the country aud to tbo high privileges ! of citizenship. Ho refers again to the wisdom and the bounden duty of Congress to give atten tion to tho evils of our election methods, and to the threat to tbe Republic that lies in the assault upon the freedom of electors and their right to cast their bal lots tor Federal officers unimpeded, and to have their votes honestly counted. He urges Congressional investigation and legislation concerning practices that as sail the elective franchise as it relates to the choice of officers of tho National Gov ernment. This strong, patriotic and per fectly sound advice will bo ridiculed by the radical Democracy as a plea for tho "force bill." Nevertheless it will re main that tho advice of the President is wisdom. Several other subjects are treated in the message; not a few of them are so han dled as to defend the protective tarilf pol icy, of which President Harrison is a sin- j cere advocate, since ho omits no oppor- ! tunity to make figures aud statements of ! prosperous couditions testify with his firm i belief in the benelicence of that policy, j But ths is not the time to discuss the ! issue; the President is privileged to urge i it and make his message defensive of it; I it_ proper debate will come on when the wisdom of the tariff the vote ofthe couu- \ try demands shall be inaugurated. outside of the defensive character re ferred to, the President's message is a patriotic and statesmanlike paper, breathes a spirit of high hope for the ad vance of tbe Nation, is thoroughly Amer ican, and does not lack the qualities that always inspire respect—vigor aud cour age.
