FROM NEARP TOWNS CHRONICLE OF HAPPENINGS AMONGST OCR NEIGHBORS. WAKEFIELD. A very handsome wedding reception was given by Mr. and Mrs. Dennis A. Smith, of near this place, .on Friday evening of last week in honor of their oldest daughter Grace, who was re cently married in Baltimore to Elmer G. Pittinger, of near Union Bridge. The bride and groom returned from a short wedding trip to Philadelphia, Atlantic City and other places to the home of the groom and were heartily received by his mother and a few friends. Notwithstanding the inclem ent weather there were fully 200 peo ple present. A crowd of young people gathered and gave them a genuine old belling, or serenade. A table was set with all the delica cies of the season and a sumptuous repast was served from 8 o’clock till 12, consisting of turkey and chicken salads, cakes, pickles, oranges, ba nanas, malaga grapes, salted peanuts, four kinds of ice cream, mints and coffee. The house was beautifully and hand somely decorated by Chester and Ro land Baile, of Medford. The dining room was especially attractive and decorated with smilax and white car nations. This was carried out to har monize with the bride’s dress. The entire house was trimmed with laurel. The ladies who presided at the lunch tables were Mrs. N. H. Baile, of New Windsor, and Mrs. Frank Miller, of this place. At the coffee table Mrs. Joseph W. Smith, of Westminster, presided. The chief waiters of the dining room were the bride’s three cousins, Misses Marie Baile, of New Windsor; Caroline and Sue Billing slea, of Westminster, assisted by Misses Nettie Whitmore and Larue Herr, of Westminster, and Margaret Beachman.of Avondale;Clarence Wel lington, of W. M. College; Chester and Royland Baile, of Medford; James Beachman, Avondale, and John Smith, brother of the bride; Mrs. E. E. Roop was general manager of the dining room. The guests were received at the door i by Miss Bertha Waters, colored, of Westminster. The presents were re ceived by Carrie Belle Miller, of this place, and Catherine Beachman, of j Avondale. The presents were hand- j some and numerous, consisting of cut | glass, hand painted China, solid sil- j ver table and tea spoons, knives and j forks, butter knife, chamber sets, handsome linen, clocks, rugs, blank ets, 3 big lamps, chafing dish, choco late sets, center pieces, 3 sets of carv ing knives, kitchen sets, Japanese ware, a full set of dishes, 136 pieces, and an old-time grandfather’s clock, also check by a near friend and neigh- i bor of the bride, Mrs. J. F. Babylon, |. for $5, and a five dollar gold piece | from a friend, Charles W. King, of j 1 Westminster; also a diamond ring to i' the bride from the groom, and a pack- j. age of pepsin chewing gum from dad | to the groom. The above articles were i' viewed by your correspondent of | ’ Wakefield, through the kindness of Mr. and Mrs. Smith, and it was cer- | tainly a beautiful sight to see. This j happy gathering dispersed about 12.30, i' each one going their way with a happy i* heart. !! Mrs. E. Vile visited her sister in 1 "Winfield this week. Samuel Rbbertson is on the sick list j 1 at present. Preaching at the Brick M. P. Church j on Sunday morning at 10.30 by Rev. i 1 G. J.

Staub has had a concrete walk laid. Noah Rinedollar did the work. 1 

MOUNT OLIVE. ] The third quarterly conference of ’ West Falls Circuit was held at Mt. ; Olive M. E. Church on Monday, De- \ cember 7. It was a very interesting ‘ meeting. Different subjects of interest \ were discussed and the day was well j' spent for the advancement of God’s j ’ Kingdom here on earth. Our churches * are progressing rapidly, adding scores 1 J of members to help promote the noble j■ cause. All Christian people should j and I believe are getting to be more i ’ wide awake along the lines of chris-1 tian work. It matters little what I church we are members of, whether i it be M. E. or M. P. or any of the j others. We are all striving to re- i 1 ceive the same reward. I think it i very beneficial to send this religious writing to the Advocate for publica- j 1 tion, because it reaches the homes of i many more non-christians than the j Baltimore Methodist or some other religious paper. Our district superintendent preach ed to us on Sunday afternoon last, also on Monday morning. There was a fairly large turnout at both ser vices. There will be Epworth League ser vices at Mt. Olive tomorrow evening at 7.30 o’clock. The topic will be “The Joys of Overcomers.” We would like to see a large crowd pres ent. Emory Harrison, a farmer living near Mt. Airy, is improving his prem ises very much by building a large hoghouse. When it is completed, it will add greatly to the value of his farm. Joseph Gosnell and son are doing the work. Christmas is dwaing near, and we ! should remember the reason why we call it so, and keep it holy. Those present at our quarterly meeting from other appointments are in part as follows: Ebenezer, Mrs. H. M. Zile and son Arthur and Co lumbus Conaway; Morgan Chapel, William H. Reynolds and C. A. Mulli nix, and others that I cannot call to memory. Many were compelled to stay home on account of the inclement weather. Quite a number were there from this community. Most of the people around here are through butchering, and are getting fat on buckwheat cakes and sausage. L. S. Buckingham slaughtered four .porkers a few days ago, which were about a year old, which weighed as follows, 400, 396, 393, and 388. Can they be surpassed. Sunday school tomorrow at 1 o’clock: preaching at 2.30.

Mr. and Mrs. Edward Strevig, son Joseph and daughters Annie, Kate and Belle, spent last Saturday and Sunday with friends and relatives at Gettysburg. On Tuesday evening Hollie Helwig discovered that he had caught a skunk, better known as a polecat, in a rabbit trap.

Our school house makes a fine ap pearance since the U. S. flag waves from its top. Thanks to the P. O. S. of A. Noah T. Geiman butchered five hogs of his own last week, which were good weights, as follows, 290, 300, 322, ana two spring pigs, 242 and 256 lbs. Geo. Stonesifer, wdio was injured several weeks ago by a tree falling : upon him and dislocating his ankle, is improving slowly. Mr. Stonesifer is a butcher and says that an hour ' seems as long as a day to him, as he cannot follow his trade. Our community had looked forward ever since November 3 for our ore mines to open again, but at present there is no sign of such. Let the railroad pass through here. Then we can say, all is well. Please send all news for items to your correspondent not later than Wednesday morning of each "week, and same will receive best attention. ALE SI A. Mrs. Harry Warehime and sons, j of Baltimore, visited former’s parents, Mr. and Mrs. S. H. Hoffacker, of this place, the past w r eek. Our neighbors seem to be doing all possible to prepare for winter since, while enjoying the heat of the stove in our store, one night last week, we were given a tale of years ago, when one of our residents awoke to find 8 inches of snow on his bed, 12 inches on the floor, and was compell ed to tunnel his way to the barn. It must have been a blizzard. | William Shearer, head clerk with I the firm of Spicer & Hamilton, this ! place, was confined to the house the : past two weeks on account of sick j ness. Vernon Hoffacker was filling I the bill instead. We are informed J. Brennen, of Bal- I timore, son-in-law of J. A. Frederick, lof Manchester, last week purchased I the farm now occupied by W. A. Knel j ler. Mr. Brennen also owns the prop erty formerly owned by Mr. Broder json. Both properties are near here. It is hardly possible that the cheese lost by a Melrosean, near Manchester, [last week, could have crawled to “Dug [Hill,’’ although some claim the strong er the better, and this no doubt was | the best. John Graff spent Monday in Han dover on business. E. F. Hoffacker visited his daugh , ter, Mrs. Boger, and family in Han iover this week. George Folk lost one of his best horses last week by breaking its neck in falling. O. H. Richard, superintendent of the Rockdale Powder Mills, has resigned |his position and returned to York, Pa. Mrs. Joseph Zeigler and daughter, jof near here, narrowly escaped with | their lives on Tuesday evening. As they were driving a spirited horse along side the railroad tracks, near this station, as engine 728, used as a pusher, was returning to Hanover, the animal became unmanageable, and Mrs. Zeigler and daughter jumped from the buggy, the former receiving some ugly bruises and cuts. Had they remained in the vehicle both ; would no doubt have been seriously i injured, as the horse ran into the ice house of L. H. Lauer and demolished the buggy. George A. Landes, of Baltimore, vis ited his father, W. Landes, near here the past week. The area covered by the Capitol is i 158,112 square feet ■ a President Roosevelt's Message. \ Congress assembled on Monday,and ] the President's message was read to • both houses on Tuesday. It is a very I lengthy document, and we can give • only a brief synopsis of its leading! \ features, as follows: . It is worse than folly to attempt to • ■ prohibit all combinations, as is done \ \ by the Sherman anti-trust law. .. I strongly advocate, instead, a law • • which shall permit combinations \ \ which are in the interest of the pub- . • lie but shall give to the national gov- • • ernment full power of control and ‘ | supervision. •• The railroads of the country should • • jbe put completely under the super- iJ J vision-of the Interstate Commerce .• Commission. • • Postal savings banks will make it * * ; easy for the poorest to keep their 1 . savings in absolute safety. • * The majority of wageworkers must * I have their rights secured for them . • by state action, but the national gov- ; * ernment should legislate for all per- J J sons engaged in interstate commerce. 11 The principle of the eight-hour day ! < > should, as rapidly as practicable, be ] [ extended to the entire work being car- ;I ried on by the government. • • I most earnestly urge upon Con- ‘ ‘ gress the duty of increasing the totally ! I, inadequate salaries now given ourj' judges. j ]' j If there is any one duty which more !,, than another we owe to our children I • it is to save the forests of this country. IJ Action should be begun forthwith i I which will result in giving us not * only navigable but navigated rivers, i J The establishment of parcels posts in !, the rural routes would be to the mu- i • tual benefit of the farmer and country j J storekeeper. i We cannot give the Filipinos self-:’ government save in the sense of gov- | * i erning them so that gradually they ■. i may, if they are able, learn to govern !' j themselves. I again recommend that American j. citizenship be conferred upon the peo- • I pie of Porto Rico. j I I approve the recommendation of | | the General Board for the increase of ! ’ ; the Navy, calling especial attention 1 [ to the need of additional destroyers : and above all for the four battleships. I • There should be legislation to pro- i vide a complete plsn for organizing ; • the great body of volunteers behind ] the regular army and the national I guard when war has come. | We should encourage rifle practice J among school boys and indeed among I all classes. < One thing to be remembered with | all our fortifications is that it is al- | i most useless to make them impregn- • able from the sea if they are left open * to land attack. ! I The federal statutes regulating in- i * terstate traffic in game should be ex- J tended to include fish. I advocate the immediate admission of New Mexico and Arizona as states. ; All Soldier’s Homes should be , placed under the complete jurisdic- < tion and control of the War Depart- j | ment. < - . ;< Chicken Coop as Ballot Box. ‘ Chicago. Dec. I.—One of the char- • ges of political misconduct on which ] the Democratic Central Committee of . Illinois intends to ask the Legislature • for a recount of the ballots in the ] Daneen-Stevenson election for Gov- . ernor is that the judges and clerks < in a precinct in Perry county used a , ] small chicken coop for a ballot box. . Into this repository for the expres- j sion of a free and independent elec- j ] torate in Southern Illinois were . thrown ballots cast by men as well as ; j ballots cast by women. : { The law require)* separate ballot < boxes and does not specifically sane- j i tion the use of chicken coops for , either. • Mll I ***** I
