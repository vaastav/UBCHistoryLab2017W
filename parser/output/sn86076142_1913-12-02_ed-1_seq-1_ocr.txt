President Woodrow Wilson read his message to the Joint session of the two houses of congress today at noon, at the beginning of the sixty-third con gress, as follows: "Gentlemen of the Congress: The country, I am thankful to say, la at peace with all the world, and many happy manifestations multiply about us of a growing cordiality and sense of community of Interest among the nations, foreshadowing an age of set tled peace and good will. More and more readily each decade do the na tions manifest their willingness to bind themselves by solemn treaty to the processes of peace, the processes of frankness and fair concession. So far he United States has stood at the front of such negotiations. She will, i earnestly and confidently be lieve, give fresh proof of her sincere adherence to the cause of Interna tional friendship by ratifying the sev eral treaties of arbitration awaiting renewal by the senate. In addition to these, it has been the privilege of the department of state to gain the assent, in principle, of no less than 31 nations, representing four-fifths of the population of the world, to the ntgotlatlon of treaties by which It shall be agreed that whenever differ ences of interest or of policy arise which cannot be resolved by the ordinary processes of diplomacy, they shall be publicly analyzed, discussed and reported upon by a tribunal chosen by the parties before either nation determines its course of ac tion "There is only one possible stand ard by which to determine contro versies between the United States and other nations, and that is com pounded of theBe two elements: Our own honor and our obligations to he peace of the world. 

MEXICAN 9ITUATION. "There Is but one cloud upon our horizon. That has shown Itself to the south of us, and hangs over Mexico. There can be no certain prospect of peace In America until General Huerta has surrendered his usurped authority In Mexico; until it Is understood on all hands, indeed, that such pretended governments will not be countenanced or dealt with by the government of the United States. We are the friends of con stitutional government in America; we are more than Its friends, we are Its champions; because in no other way can our neighbors, to whom we would wish In every way to make proof of our friendship, work out their own development in peace and liberty. Mexico has no government. The attempt to maintain one at the City of Mexico has broken down, and a mere military despotism has been set up which has hardly more than the semblance of national authority. It originated in the usurpation of Vlctoriano Huerta, who, after a brief attempt to play the part of constitu tional president, has at last cast aside even the pretense of legal right and declared himself dictator.

The fate of Ralph Lopez is unknown. More poisonous fumes were poured Into the mine tunnels, but the expected dash for liberty was not made. Leaders of the man-hunters believe the bandit perhaps has escaped through an unknown passage. The sheriffs are convinced that Mike Cranovlch, who Killed his wife and was believed to have taken ref uge in the mine, is not there or he would have surrendered. Heavy gun powder fumes were poured into the mine to seek levels lower than the previous fumes touched.

In addition, the urgent necessity that special pro vision be made also for facilitating the credits needed by the farmers of ; the country. The pending currency bill does the farmers a great service It puts them upon an equal footing with other business men and masters of enterprise, as it should; and upon its passage they will find themselves quit of many of the difficulties which now hamper them in, the field of credit. The farmers, of course, ask and should be given no special privi lege, such as extending to them the credit of the government Itself. What they need and should obtain is legis lation which will make their own abundant and substantial credit re sources available aB a foundation for joint, concerted local action In their own behalf in getting the capital they must use.

I think it will be easily agreed that we should let the Sherman anti-trust law stand, unal tered, as It is, with Its debatable ground about It, but that we should as much as possible reduce the area of that debatable ground by further and more explicit legislation; and should also supplement that great act by legislation which will not only clarify It but also facilitate its ad ministration and make It fairer to all concerned. I shall take the liberty of addressing you upon it In a special message at a later date than this. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES.
