Minister Van Alen has decided to 1 resign his position because Of the un reasonable prejudice in the minds of the public against a man being given ari office as a direct reward for his polit ical contributions. It took him some time to reach this conclusion, BO long in fact that his act of self denial will fail of its intended effect.

Burleigh will run the Washington end of the boom, and while he is doing- that Capt. Lucas will have the time and opportunity to work his way back into public confidence. President Cleveland's message to con gress is characteristic of the man, standing up stubbornly for his own views, regardless of public opinion, change of popular sentiment or any thing else. Only in the Hawaiian mat ter does he show any disposition to hedge, and on this subject he promises to speak more definitely later on. There is every indication that our old friend. Mayor C.

LITERAKY NOTES. The multiplicity and excellence of other magazines, far from lessening the usefulness of the Review of Re views, makes this unique periodical more and more a necessity. Its indexes, condensations of leading articles, class ified lists of new books, and general sur vey of things written, things said and things done during the month preced ing, its issue, would suffice to keep the busy reader in touch with the current of life and thought, even if he were able to read nothing else. The December number is as full of variety and fresh ness as its predecessors have regularly been and to those who know the Re view of Reviews this is a sufficient com mendation. The largely increased size of Ro mance, since the beginning of its twelfth volume, allows scope for a greater variety than ever in its con-, 'tents. This opportunity has been intel ligently utilized by its successful editor, I Mrs. Kate Upson Clark, in the compos ition of a Christmas number of extra ordinary brilliancy. Out of its score of charming tales ten are especially de signed for the Christmas season. They are of all sorts—grave and say, long and short, and in almost equal measure for both old and youDg. Among the authors of Christmas stories are Octave Thanet, Martha McCulloch Williams. Francois Coppee, Mary C. Hungerford and Madge Robertsou while the other contributors include Arthur Beardsley Mitchell, Theodore Bartlett, Arthur Quiller Couch.

The vice president laid before the sen ate a communication from Governor Altgeld of Illinois, advising the senate that the State Of Illinois, in view of the invitation extended to the states by con gress, had caused to be made and placed in Statuary Hall of the National Capitol a statue in bronze of General James Shields, one of Illinois' most distin guished warriors and statesmen. The communication stated that the statue would be unveiled at 2 p. in. Dec. 6, 1893, and invited the friendly co-opera tion of the senate. Mr. Cullom gave notice he would in troduce an appropriate resolution in ref erence to the statue for the considera tion of the senate. Among the petitions presented was one by Mr. Dolph of the Oregon Horti cultural society, favoring the mainten ance of the present duties on prunes. The senate passed with slight amend ments the house joint resolution appro priating $50,000 for the employmeilt of additional deputy collectors of internal revenue to aid in the execution of the Chinese exclusion acts.

CHICAGO, Dec. 6.—At the instance of the defense, Juror Taylor was dismissed by Judge Tuthill at the opening of the Coughliu-trial. The court in dismissing the juror said that there was nothing against Taylor's character, but that he had made mistakes in his examination as venireman which necessitated the dismassal.

Gathering- of Members Afford an Opportunity to (iet at the Real Sentiment,. Of the Congressmen on the Measure Prepared by the Ways and Menus Committee. Said That It Will Pass the House ... Without Any Very Material Chang-os. WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.—The gathering of the members of congress offered an opportunity to arrive at the real senti ment of the Democratic members on th« new tariff bill which has been presented by the majority of t'ae committee on ways and means. There are, of coursa, members of the house who are not latti ced with the bill, and who will no doubt vote for some changes, yet from the way they talk there is no doubt if the bill would come to a vote in its present form it would pass with few dissenting votis among the Democratic members. If the Republican members hav® any hope that there is sufficient dis satisfaction in the house to defeat th* bill, they have mada a mistake, for th» Democratic members seem to be only anxious to have the bill through as soon as it can be passed. It seems to be not so much the question of•rates a3 the settlement of tiie whole question that the majority of the Democratic members are most interested in. A member of the Democratic majority of the commit tee voiced the sentiment of a number of Democrats when he aaid the bill would not need much discussion in the house, but what was wanted was to get the bill over to the senate at an early a day as possible. He indicated that even if it should be necessary to apply the cloture rule, that it was very likely that the Democrats would put tho bill through Without Very Much Debate. It would, of course, be necessary for the Democrats to have behind them a good working majority, or at least a quorum of the house in favor of the bill. It now looks as if there wquld not be much difficulty in securing sucb. a quorum if the talk indulged in by the Democrats is any indication of the sen timent of those who have said nothing. In all the number who may be heard talking on the subject none go so far, even in private conversation, as to say that unless some modifications are made that they will oppose the bill. Of course, all is not sentiment among the Democrats. There are plenty of them who say they will make an effort to get something for their own particular district, but failing in that they will support the bill as a party measure. The president in his message points out a method which they may adopt when he says that it is not to be expected that all can be satisfied, bnt that hi the great issue, aud upon a great question Some Sacrifice Must Do Made for the benefit of the great principle in volved. Tiie president's approval of the Wilson tariif bill will go a long way towards uniting the party, if there have been any differences of opinion of any re markable degree. What is most often heard in connection with the tariff bill is the statement that the members of the ways and means committee were charged with the work of preparing a bill, and that they made a study of it, ought to know what was best lor tho party. Those who did not pretend to know so much about it, must ba content with what the party has done through its committee, for it is probable that the committee has mads a most thor ough and careful investigation, and that it is able to better judge what is wanted than .liose who have not given the mat ter any consideration. Wisconsin*# Uuildiug. 

CHICAGO, Dec. 6.—Wisconsin's hand some state building at the world's fair, which cost the state board $33,000, and also received as a donation §15,000 worth of material, will go under the hammer.

BAY HOPE Sllvcrttei Can See to Cause Them Satisfaction. WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.—The free coin age men of the house do not see any sil ver lining in the message of President Cleveland. They exhibited some disap pointment, not for publication, but as expressing their belief that the president Aid not care to see any legislation look ing to the remonetization of silver. They said that the suggestion about an inter national conference was vague and in dicated that there was not much apparent desire on the part of the administration to have the question con sidered at an early day. In talking to such members of congress as claimed to be free silver men, but who voted to re peal the Sherman law, the free coinage men said that it was the fulfillment of what they predicted at the time—that the unconditional repeal of the Sherman law meant that there would be no more silver legislation during this congress, and that it was not-intended that there should be any during the present ad ministration. -y- SS Stocks of Wheat.
