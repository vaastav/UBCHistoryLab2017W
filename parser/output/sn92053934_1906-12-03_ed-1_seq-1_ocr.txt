The fact that congress met today for the short ses sion had the effect early in the day of giving the capital the appearance of activity. The first day's session never develops much interest to those used to attending sessions of congress, but no other day of the session seems to possess greater charm for the average citizen.

Many C'ordlnl Greeting. Senators and members of the house began arriving early in the clay and there were many cordial greetings in the corridors and on the floors.

To Permit of Clear Judgment. The purpose of asking for data is to permit of clear judgment whether an injustice has been done any of the members of the disgraced organization. The question has been raised whether the dismissal without honor does not deprive them illegally of military rights. Claon Over Spelling, Too. The question of spelling undoubtedly will receive attention at the hands of congress this week. Subcommittees of the house commit tee on appropriations, which prepared the legislative, executive and judicial appropriation bill, will report that measure to the full committee today with the old form of spelling retained, and it will be for the committee to de cide whether the simplified spelling shall be used.
