Some fifteen cars were loaded with stock and they vara killed, drowned and terribly muti lated. The Citizen has got into a strait, with the American after it on one side and the Banner on the other. We do not care to discuss with the Bannner the rela tive merits of democracy and republi canism. Tbe Banner has tieciacu tnac question by deserting the democratic ranks at a time when it stands in great est need of the undivided efforts of its adherents. The Mahonc wave that threatens to overwhelm the south looked too formidable for tho Banner and it has turned its prow and set its sails to catch the first breeze that cross es tho Virginia line, and hopes to go sailing into place and power with those wba are cultivating administration fa vor. The Banner has been a good dem ocratic paper and if the World had not headed itoffon the "compromise" pol icy, we opine that it would have been sailing "Sncedward" with all sails spread and crying out against those who would break up the grand old par ty which it now aflects to think so in- effectice and small. It wishes tbe Citizen to tell it what the democratic nartv has done for the country, etc. It i - - has had no opportunity to do anything. not havinsr been in power. What it may do for the south may be guessed fn.m what th republican party has done for the north. Its greatest draw back has been in the foolishness of its ln.li?rs. and it ia 6afe to say it never will accomplish anything for the coun try if desertion is to be the rule. Wc sympathize with the Banner. See the counttj laughing at the great, lubberly, straddling David Davis! The Banner will be ridiculed and humbled and sor rowful. The Mahonc idea will run and be glorified for a season, and the Ban ner will be elated and think itself fortu nate in having anticipated a movement that is to wash it into a harbor of pros perity, but the waves will recede and leave it stranded and it will tear its hair ind curse its own folly. Fourth of J uly orations may not suit its fancy now, but a funeral dirge is not half so pleasant to hear, and it had better endorse the ills that aru but for a season than flee to those that will last fcr all and aye. 

SHOT IN THE BACK Senator Smith Shot ly i.a"j- "Vertrees in the Maxwell- In the State Senate at Nashville tast - ..l 'oil Friday morning Speaker .morgan The American misinterprets the Cit izen upon ono point. The Citizen has never advocated a rc-openlnfr of the 100-3 ouestion. We can readily see what a dcnlorable catastrophe mat would be. Wo have earnestly and ur gently called for a council of the party to adopt some other basis, but not to leave the question open for one moment, and never to leave this mooring until the drag rope is safely fastened about a better one. The failure of tho party to adopt thia course before the question was taken uo by the courts 'renders it perpetually impossible. As far as the Citizen was able to judge of what was best in principle and for the party, it has done its duty. The state is now in tho hands of the republicans and we are not alone in the opinion that it is like ly to remain so. We deeply deplore it, but we believe we will bo sustained by all who have cared to read our utter ances upon this question that the Citi zen is blameless. We see no phase ol the question now that is worth discus sing. M.,M.;-a tn the chair and au dressed the Senate upon a question of nrivtwe. He said that he hau been f . ... elected to the senate as a state crtuii, democrat and all his acts had been in furtherance of such views, and when it came to the vote upon 100-3, in the absence of anything better, he had vo ted for it. A Iterwards, in the cuancery nn.irt at Xah villa, he had been ac cused of having accepted a bribe. He ti.nn c0n r,n in a torrent of invective and denounced the charge as slander ous and malicious and the author as liar and a son of the devil, ami demand ed a full investigation by the senate lie was followed by Senator Smith of Fentress, the man who changed his vote and carried the 100-3 bill. Ha gave a history of his politics, showing that he i,,r.to.l us n stare credit man. in a district that voted 18,000 and gave ouly 2,700 to Vilon, and his vote was in keeping with hi3 pledges, with the views of his constituents and was right. Notwithstanding this, he had been charged with bribery. He understood that tho man who made the charges was in tl. linmc. nnil lie was not going to dodge his name as Morgan had done (Morgan interjected the remark that he had omitted the name only out of self respect.) John J. Vertrees had come before the court and uttered lies against him as foul as thedevil himself. Turn ing and pointing a long, bony finger di rect! r into Vertrees' face, as he sat about ten feet behind him, he denounced him as a liar and a scoundrel in going outside of the record to accuse a man of an infamous act when the bill upon which he was speaking had not dared to do so. He wanted a thorough invest! gatiou and ho wanted to say as hard things against Vertrees as had been said arains him. Vertrees knew he was sale from a challenge, as ho could not do it, and if he did not like w hat he said he could j:ot help it. Senator Barrett then arose and joined in the request for a committee of inves tigation, giving fl. history of himself that proved him (if correct) to be a state credit man, and denouncing the charges against him as baseless and malicious. He called no nanus, and although he de nounced the charges as slanderous and malicious, he fell so far PelyW mith in inyecliyo that it seeded tame. He said he had been pursued as no other man in the history of Tennessee had been twice in jeopardy yet if tho senate thought it necessary to go further into the rrntter, he was willing to be tried again. It soon became known in the house that a scene that promised to wind up in a tragedy wa- being enacted in tho senate, and the members crowded into the senate lobby.

It was evident, however, that Bar kis was barely willin'. The newspapers loye to talk about Senator Smith's wound. They learned the language while the president was sick and they can trace a ball from the deltoid muscle through the scapula, up and down the whole anatomy, into the iliac fossa, or through thetrapczins and rhomboidcl into the epineons process and then have no idea whether tho man was hit or not We heard Smith of Fentress "an nounco Vertrees as a liar" and saw his bony finger leveled at the tall lawyer with a bulging brow and a pearl-han died pistol.

It will probably PC thought best to stretch it. It is said that Marks kept down a difficulty between Vertrees and Speaker Morgan thing mean A tenement house in Pittsburgh caught lire from a lamp explosion last Friday night and sixteen persons were rots ted alive. a sacrifice. Smith, w hen he got through, retired to the very furthest part of the chamber where walls shielded him from behind, and he appeared restless and watchful. Vertrees sauntered around near him but seemed calm and only in terested in tho discussion going on over the resolution to investigate, but we im agine he went around to measure the man he intended to lay out. Trouble was apprehended and policemen were summoned and placed around the lobby, but the senate adjourned and no difli- culty occurred. Smith left the capitol with Speaker Morgan and it is said he eemcd ill at ease and looked carefully about him as if fearing an attack. He went to the Maxwell and eat down up on the furthest single divan from the entrance on tho left and was reading a newspaper. Only a few people were in tho rotunda. Directly Vertrees and a younger brother entered at tho front and passed through towaids tho closets and had passed tho chair where Smith was sitting, when tho younger one said, "There ho is now." Vertrees at once turned and went up to Smith, snatched the paper down and spit in his face. Smith jumped up and Vertrees says ran his hand behind him, when Vertrees drew a long and glittering Smith & Wesson revolver and opened fire. Smith ran around by the baggage elevator, dodging by tho columns and into the barber shop and thence into the cellar, drawing his pistol after he got into the barber shop. Vertices' first shot evi dently missed Smith and knocked a hole in the plastering, but two more shots followed in rapid succession, one of which entered the barber shop door fac ing and mo other striking Miuiu near the left shoulder blade and penetrating among the bones, lodging near the spine, bmitn was carried to a doctors office and cared fur and Vertrees at once surrendered to a policeman, went to po- lico headquarters and was lined, ami then drove to a justice's office aud gave a $10,000 bond for his appearance beiore criminal court. Smith was severely hurt and the ball was extracted later in the day. The affair created enormous excitement for some time. A turbulent friend of Vertrees flourished his pistol and kept the crowd bpek in a dramatic anil threatening way for some time. We heard the deed universally con demned. It makes no difference w hether Smith is guilty or not, so far as the shooting is concerned. It is said "Ver trees made the charges on his own re sponsibility, outside of the record, in a placo and nt a time when the accused could not reply, and w hen tho tables were reversed and he got no worse than he sent, he should have been content to lot tho investigation establish tlio truth fulness of his charges. The second thought criticisms upon the president's message all agree in praising ifas a creditable, statesman like document. The absence of refer ence to the south as a distinct part of tho union is commented upon favor ably. It i3 the first time since the war that the southern question did not enter into a message as a distinct issue. In deed, the abuse of the south was for years the foundation stone of republi canism and by it they were enabled to hoodwink the north into an almost 60lid opposition. The abandonment of that idea is followed by the taking up ol an other scheme upon which they hope to thrive that is, the political dismember ment ol the south by the Mahone pro cess. The message does not refer to this directly, of course, but the president and the party have given themselves to it. The message starts Mr. Arthur out fairly, but we doubt very much, from his former associations, whether he will keep iu with tte pleasing policies indi P!.td onl v so lone as they serve his party pui poses, ' The Harmony Question, The American.! We have devoted ourselves to some ex tent to the arguments preseated by those who would reach harmony at any price from the standpoint of a desire for such political combinations as may se cure loaves and fishes at. any price. Our conservative contemporary, ibe trv laski Citizen, has recently furnished us with the opportunity to view the same subject from tho standpoint of a patri otic desire to accomplish the best thing for .he state and lor the democratic party as au agency for good in the stato and the nation. A warn of its earnest devotion to principle and desire to d vocate the best policy, we always differ with our contemporary only alter aue care and r flection. Wo have failed to reach the same con cision fro.n its premises. It declares that it ha accepted the recent settle ment and is able to see no reason why it should not stand, beyond the division it appears about to create in the party. It declares its desire to preserve the oartv intact even if it cost the re-open ing of this questlop, thp setting aside the settlement, aud leaving tho subject for what the future may bring out of un.'li Imrmrtiiv ns starts out with diS-( carding what wo must regard an esen tial principle. Examining the subject first from tho standpoint of the present and future intciests of thestate, it being admitted by the Citizen that Its accept ance destroys no right and involves no sacrifice of principle, what will the s'ate gain by abandoning th? settlement? It will havo a question on its hands, pro lific in direct corruption, fertile in pro ducing speculation on both sides of It, sure to lurtlier lower the tone of public and p'ivata morals, leading to angry passions and violence, vitiating the principle Of private faith snd vegard for obligations. What will we gain in exchange? Party harmony antidemocratic success? Let us see. xnat state democracy wuicu takes repudiation for its principle will add no strength to national democracy It will hang about the neck of the party like the dead albatross upon the ancient mariner. It wm corrupt and corrode, and prevent that hold on' the conserva tive intelligence pf the worth which can only be won by pursuing the right to defeat, if necessary, aud through defeat to resurrection and final victory. But of what kind will bo the harmony pro duced? The party which broadens its foundations to Jet i'u& worst etiind upon them, mar (rain the worst, all of the worst, if you will; it surely loses the best. It surely gives the worst control and installs the leaders ofthe worst as its leaders. Which is the greatest pow er, numbers or morals? How many men who are wrong and standing ones sentially false ideas, does oue man who is right and based on the right, out weigh? A party neglects this consid eration at its peril. If democracy determines to g in for numbers, without regard to truth and principles, we shal phcerfully and without a moment's hesitation go with what we regard as truth and principles, and around that standard will gather, as surely as there is truth and right, the deserting numbers. We shall advo cate such democracy as sacrifices a tem porary and delusive harmony to truth and right, and on that lir.3 win a future triumph the tuoro thorough and lasting that it has been so won. We know ourcontemporary's patriot ism too well to suspect its motives aud we do" not doubt its courage, but we think it has placed party above the in terests of the state, and that it is a fatal error. If democracy do not coincide with the interests of the people, and hence with the line of right, it will fail if it start out with overwhelming num bers. That such a compromise, such a yielding, such a sacrifice, as will reopen this question to serve as a shuttlelock for aspiring lime servers, win not givo numbers to such lemocracy as may pur sue this line, we know already, n e un derstand fully this tempest ia a teapot raised by a few politicians here and there. They have it almost entirely to themselves. Thero is but one way to deal with this matter. Democracy must treat it as settled; every interest demands it Our contemporary admits that party harmony alone demands another course If that is true then surely party cannot demand it. In any proper view of party it must stand up only for what is best for the state. Let it dare do other wise and true democracy will not fail, or die. Whether through defeat thus fool islily forced by false measures of har mony, or througli victory won before a reasoning and intelligent people, it will irrow the stronger lor standing and combattinir 6uch democracy as dares to yield essential principles for harmo ny s and expediency's sane. Journalists Passing Aray. New Yerk Letter. The death of Colonel Forney brings home the fact that nearly all the prominent journalists, who oc cupied a leading position during the civil war, are rapidly passing away. There are Jew journals in this city, numerous as they sre, that are controlled by the same intellects that were dominant then. Greeley, Bryant, Brooks, liaymond and the elder Bennett hare long since de parted from the scene, and, though their places are filled with younger men of recognized ability, it is a question whether they have that commanding influence in the forma tion or dire-tion of public opinion which was wielded by their prede cessors. Thurlow Weed and James Watson Webb remain, but even they anparenlly arc near their jour ney's end. Mr. Forney frequently was the zealous antagonist of more than one of the old time journalists above mentioned, and the conflicts in which be has frequently engaged with them, just after the breaking out of the rebellion, were qf np ordi nary bitterness, butat all times, and under all circumstances, it is not too much to say he was "a foemaji worthy of their steel." Outside of journalistic, literary and political circles he had hosts Qt friends in New York, and probably nowhere will hie death be more widely or more sincereiy regretted than here.

As stated in list night's dispatches, it Is the inten tion of tho administration to try and break democratic rule in the southern states, following up the success of the movement in Virginia. As a confirma tion of that statement, it may bo men tioncd as a political fact that arrange ments are now being made to wrest Tennessee aud West Virginia from the Democracy. The whole bent of tho stalwart element of the republican party and of the administration will be in that direction. The cry has gone forth that Tennesseo must be captured by the re publicans, and every effort is being made to Induce tho fulfillment of that demand. The stalwart wing of the re-r publican party is rallying to it; all that the stalwarts and administration can do to secure the overthrow of the democ racv in Tennessee will be accomplished .. . 1 1. - . 1 1 ..

But it is to be placed to fie credit of the political sagacity 01 the stalwarts and the administration that they do not expect any immediate Iruits from Georgia: theyoniy want Mr. Spcer to inaugurate the endeavor. Their tirst ob'eelive point is Tennessee, and after that they propose to pounce upon Arkansas; and then, if successful, thev will devote themselves to other states, being guided in their action by the consideration as to where the chan ces, carefully weighed, seem best.

Lorillard's winnings for the last season amounted to $r,41o. Dwyer Bros, have named the colt they paid $7,500 for, Joe Blackburn. The pacing gelding, Ben Hamil ton, record 2:16-1, ha3 been sold to Pennsylvania parties for $3,500. Colman's Rural World last week published a cut of the Norman stal lion, Baj-ard, that was purchased last spring by Maj. btacy ana brought to this place. It looks as natural as life. Dr. McFarland, Lebanon, Tenn., lost recently the black stallion Hen ry Mambrjno, by Mambriao Chief, J T.'i- 1 T ti.: UUU1 lilbt, uv luui uunuci. xuia stallion was owned for mauy years by Maj. Allman, ol Corn ersville, and was a stallion of considerable merit. Competent iudsres say that the most promising trotting colt in the state is Elackthorjie, a three year- old colt bv Blackwood, ir. out of the dam of Largesse. Two of the colts of this dam have sold for $11,500, and Black thorne will doubtless bell for a. large price some day. The great crack colts that Mr. Swigert has bred have nearly al ways been the victims of an unfor tunate chain of circumstances. Yor instance, to tak. the pases of Baden Badeq, spendthrift and Hindoo. Ba den Baden was beaten when it was least expected by McWhirter; Spendthrift bj' Falsetto and Hindoo by Crickmore. It will also be re membered that Mr. Swigert also bred, Ivlngflaher, and sold him for on immense price. Enquirer, how ever, beat him badly at Saratoga Baden Baden' was next beaten by McWhirter, son of Enquirer, at Louisville, for the Clark Stake3, and Spendthrift vaa twice beaten by Falsetto at Saratoga in 1879. Taken all in all Enquirer is to day the greatest sire Qf raoers. la the United. States. For the last few j'ears, it is true, that his colts have not shown to much advantage. But how was it in 1879? At Louisville his sou Falsetto ran second to Lord Murphy for the Kentucky Derby, and won the Clark stakes in the fastest time tLfc race was ever run, we belieye. "Enquirer' daughter, Fortuna, won the Louisville cup at the samo meeting, aqd. BlwO Eyes, his fcon, won the merchants' stakes at the same place in 1 :551, as fast time as this race has ever been run in. Goodnight, another son, won mile heats, at the same place in fast time beating a CeM p,f goo4 aged horses, while he was himself but three years old. At St. Louis Goodnight ran second to Lord Mur phy for the January Btakes. At Saratoga in the summer Falsetto won the Travers and Kenner stakes, beating the best colts in the east. A match was arranged between the owner of Eortuua - aud the owners of Bramble for a. race at 2 miles, and it ronulted in the easiest of vic tories for Fortuna. In 1880 at Chicago, Blue Eyes won the Gar den City Cup at that place in 2:58 J, bGating one of the btst fields that ever started in America. The time made in that : race has only been beaten on one occasion by Spring bok and Preakness, in a Jdead heat, and only equalled I17 GJerhiore this year, Iri l&Sl but few of his colts have started In fact, but one of them, Getaway, has been able to win scarcely any money at all. This colt, however, now has the best mile and a quarter to. his credit ever run. The reason why Enquirer's colts have not appeared to move to ad vantaga this year is due more to the death of Col. Reynolds, the bank ruptcy of Gen. Buford, and the lim ited opportunities ot this stallion in the stud for the past three j-eai s. With the opportunities that will be his at the Belle Meade farm Irom this time on, it will be nothin more than proper on the part of his friends to expect to see liini stand at the head of stallions as regards tha amount of money won by their colts, bfore many years. m m 1 Members of Royal Arcanum Are notified to meet at their hall the 4th Thursday riiaht in this month at o'clock p. m.
