PRESIDENTS ITTKSSAGi Washington Dec 1 1884 President Arthurs annual message wuti transmitted to Congress to day At tho ouV ret tho President refers to the recent politic d contest which resulted in the election Jf Cleveland as President He remarks that it Is a subject of general congratulation that after tho controversy despite the closenos of the vote the public peace has suffered no dis turbance and the people awaited the result patiently and quietly Nothing could mow strikingly illustrate tho temper of citizens and their loyalty to law signally demonstrate the strength American nor more and wis dom of our political Institutions FOItEION 

BKLATION8 Our relations with all foreign Powers ron tinuo amicable The Congo question is com mented upon as one of great international importance Tho rich prospective trade of tho Congo ValloyMeads to the conviction that it should be open to all nations on equal terms The necessary legislation to make ef fective our Mexican commercial treaty Is rec ommended as one of the first measures to claim attention from Congress The Nica rauguan Treaty recently concluded which authorizes the construction of a canal and railway by the San Juan and Lake Nlca raugua Route tjie President believes will command universal approval at home and abroad to the United States and the ooinmer cial and political advantages of the treaty cannot bo overestimated Tho approval of the new Spanish Commercial Treaty which is soon to be submitted to the Senate id urged The question of an International copyright law Is brought to tho attention of Congress He recommends the enlargement of tho scope of neutrality laws to cover acts of hos tility committed within our territory and aimed at the peace of friendly nations He sees no reason why overt perpetrations in this country for tho commission of buch criminal acts should not be alike punishable whether intended to bo committed in our own or lua foreign country with which we are at peace A reorganization of tho diplomatic and consular servko is recommended ON THE 

SUIUECT OF F1NANCB The President concurs with the Secretary of tho Treasury recommending an immediate fcuspeiifdon of tho coin ago of silver dollars and tho issuance of silver certificates Tho fact that of tho 1850000UG coined during tho past six years but little more than 40 000000 is in actual circulation seems to fur nish n cogent argument for the repeal of the statute 

TAXES Ho reuows his recommendations of 1S33 favoring tho abolition of all taxes except thoso relating to distilled spirits If thewj taxes are abolished the rovenua remaining to tho government will not sufllco to meet all reasonable expenditures but will afford a surphu largo enough to penult such a tariff reduction as may seem advisable when tho results of tno recent revenue laws and com mercial treaties shall have dhown in what quarters these reductions can bo most Judi ciously effected FOHEION CARRYING TRAPK Tho President says that although fully sen sible objections aro made to the appointment of a commiss on to ascertain the most effective mVarnof Increasing our foreign trade still be believes this Will be tho most speedy anil efficacious method He endorses the recom mendation of the Secretary of the Treasury favoring liberal subeldles to mall steamship Jines as an Incentive to the Investment of American capital in American steamships and declares that unless that courso be pur sued the foreign carrying trade will remain as It Is to day almost exclusively In the hands of foreigners 

NATIONAL BANK CIRCULATION On tho subject if a basis for national bank circulation he says tho three per cent bonds of the Government to the amount of more than 10000000 havol since his last message boen redeemed by the Treasury Uonds of that Issue still outstanding amount to a little over 00000000t about one fourth of which will bo retired through tho operations of the Sinking Fund during the coiiilijc year A these bonds still continue the chief basis fpf the circulation of the Rational banica the question how to avert a con traction of tho currency caused by their retirement is one of constantly increasing Importance It teoms to bo gen erally coiiAHlod that tho law governing tills matter exacts from tho banks nu excessivu security that upon their present bond de 08it8 a larger circulation than is now allowed may bo granted with safety It hopes tho bill which poised tho Senate at tho last session of Cofigre permitting the Issue of notes equal on their face valuo to deposited bonds will commend itsolf to tho approval of tho House of Representatives 

CONCERNING SEA HOARD DEFENSES For our cities recommended by the Secre tory of War ho says Tho time has now come when such defenses can be prepared with confidence that they will not prove abortive when a possible result of delay in making such preparation is seriously consid ered the delay seems inexcusable For tha most important cities those whose destruc tion or capture would bo a national humilia tionan adequate defense inclusive of guns may be made by the gradual expenditure of sixty million of dollars a sum much less than the victorious enemy could lovy as contribu tions An appropriation of about one tenth of that amount is asked to begin the work I concur with the Secretary of War in urging that it be granted MANUFACTURE OF CANNON Ho renews his recommendation contained in his spocial message to the lost Congress favoring the establishment of two Govern ment factories ono for tho army and one for the navy fcV the manufacture of heavy-cannon and urges Congress to act so as to enable the Government to construct its own ordi nance upon its own territory and provide armaments demanded by the considerations of our national safety and honor Concern ing tho reconstruction of THE NAVY He says In this tho last of my State mes sages I shall havo tho honor to trauBmit to Congress I cannot too strongly urge upon its attention the duty of restorlug the navy as rapidly as possible to tho high state of ef ficiency which formerly characterized it As a long peaco that has lulled us Into a sonso of fancied security may at any time be dis turbed it Is plain policy that strengthening this arm of the service is dictated by consld eiatfons of wise economy a just regard and a true appreciation of the dignity and honor of a republic THE POSTAL SERVICE The report of the Postmaster General says It discloses tho gratifying fact that the loss tc the postal revenues during the last year froiri a reduction of letter postage to two cents has been less than was expected only 22750001 This he considers a trustworthy indication that the revenue will soon bo restored to if former volume by the natural increase o Eealed correspondence He approves the recommendation of th unit weight with first class mall matter an 1 It should be an ounco instead of a half ounj as it now Is He recommends a reduction of postage on drop letters to ono cent and re commends an extension of the free deli Tory system rRE EMPTION LAWS lie concurs with tho Secretary of tho Inte rior In adyising the repeal of the pre emption laws and enactment of the Rtntutos resolving tho present legal complications touching lapsed grants to railroad companies and the funding of tho debt of several pf tho Pacific railways undr such a guaranty as shall ef fectually socure 1U untlinato payment 

POLYGAMY Ho believes that if polygamy can be sup pressed in Utah by law it can only be dona by the most radical legislation consistent with tho restraints of the constitution and recom mends Congress to assume absolute political control of the Territory of Utah and provide for the appointment of Commissioners with mch governmental powers as In its judge ment may justly and wisely be put Into their hands OUR FOREIGN TRADE The President devotes much Bpace to a con sideration of the olicy of the Government regarding the extension of our foreign trade Tho mafn conditions of tho problem aro thus stated We aro f peoplo apt In mechanical pursuits and fertile in invention we cover a vast extent of territoiy aro rich in agricul tural products and nearly nil tho raw ma terials needed for successful manufac ture Wo have a system of productive ehtablhhments more than sufficient to supply our own demands The wages of labor aro nowhere else so groat tho scale of living by our artisan eJaases Is such as tends to secure their iwronal comfort and development and these higher moral and Intellectual qualities that go to making good citizens Our system of tax und tariff legislation is yielding a revenue In excess of tho present needs of tho Government Theo are elements from which Is sought to dovlso a scheme by which without unfavorably changing the condition of tho workmgman our merchant marine may bo raised from its enfeebled condition to now markets provided for the sale beyond our own borders of tho manifold fruits of industrial enterprise Tho problemn is complex It can bo solved by no single juea suro or Innovation or reform Tho countries of tho American continent and ad jucent islands are for tho United States the natural marts of supply and demand It is from thorn we should obtain what wo do not produce or do not prod tico In sufficient quantity and It Is to them that the surplus productions of our tIttt ir iRini1 Ir filis mills ami workshops should flow Un d conditions thai will equalize or favor ttom In comparison with foreign competition four paths policy tho President says soems to point to this oud First A series of reciprocal commercial treaties with countries which shall foster be tween us and thorn tho unhampered move ment of trade The conditions of theso treaties should be tho free admission of such merchandise as this country does not produce In return for the admission free or under a favored scheme of duties of our own pro ducts The benefits of such an oxchange to apply only to goods carried under the flag of parties to the contract of removal on both sides from vessels so privileged ot all tonnage dues aud national imports so that thoso vessels may ply unhindered between our ports and thoso of other contracting par ties though without infringing upon tho re served homo coasting trade the removal or reduction of burdens on exported products of thoso countries coming within tho benefits of treaties and tho nvoldancj of technical re strictions und penalties by which our inter course with those countries is ut present ham pered Secondly Tho establishment of a consular servjea of tho United States on a salaried foot Ingthu3 permitting tho relinquishment of con sular fees nut only as respects vessels under the national flag but tils the vessels of treaty nations carrying goods entitled to tho benefits of thoso treaties Thirdly The enactment of measures to favor the construction and maintenance of u steam carrying marine under tho flag of tho United States Fourthly The establishment of a uniform currency on a basis for countries of America so coined from the products of our own mines that It may circulate on equal terms throughout tho whole system of com monwealths This would require a monetary anion of rAmerica whereby the output or dui Hon producing countries and circulation in those which yield neither gold nor rilver could be adjusted in con formity with the population wealth tnd commercial noeds of each As many of the countries furnish no bullion to tho common stock tho surplus produc tion of our mines and mints initrht thus be JtilJzed and a stop bo takon toward a general remonetization of silver to accomplish these 1 mds As for as can bo attained by the sep irate treaties the negotiations already con cluded and now in progress have been di rected in fvor of which this enlarged policy iias thus fur received warrants the belief its i jorations will ere long embrace all or aeorly all tho countries of this hemisphere it Is by no means desirable however that he policy under consideration shon bo ap plied to those countries alone A healthful mlargement of our trade with Europe Asia ind Africa should bo sought by reducing the j ariff burdens on such of their wares as wither we nor other American States ire fitted to produce thus enabling urselves to obtain in return a better narket for our supplies food raw materials ind manufacturers in which we excel It teems tho embarrassing elements in tho great latlonal conflict production and free trade nay thus be turned to good account that ha revenue may be reduced so as to no longer vertax people Protective duties may bo retained without becoming burdaisome Our ihlpping Interest may bo judicially encour iged and the currency fled on a 3rm basis and above all such a anity of interests established among tho States of the American system as to be to the rreat and ever Increasing advantage to them ill All treaties in the line of this policy tvhlch havo been negotiated or are in pro cess of negotiation contain a provision leemed to bo requisite under a clauso of tho Constitution limiting to the House of Ropro icntatives authority to originate bills for raising a revenuo
