NATftitfAL REPUBLICAN. Saturday, December 8, 1860. t& If any of our subscribers fail to receive their papers regularly, we hope they will notify us of the fact without delay, that we may call thestttentlon cf the carrier to the neglect IS THERE TREASON IN HIGH PLACES? The Charleston Mercury of December 6tb, contain) an account of what it calls an " inter state celebration" of the fire-caters of Ham burg, (S. C.,) and Augusta, (Ga.,) on the 1st or December. la the course of this celebration, Senator Hammond, or rather, ex-Senator Hammond, of South Carolina, said : " The public property within the boundary of the seceding States must be seized upon ana claimed by them. This might cause some bloodshed, but he doubled it." Another speaker, Col. William Gregg, was more explicit, in this wise: "He ridiculed the idea that a war would arise from the secession of South Carolina. He felt confident that Government would not dare to place her hand upon her ( fur Mr. Buchanan is well aware thai the first drop of blood spilt would create a blaze that will light up the whole South, and carry every slave State out of the Union, never to return. We have proof -r .LI. !- .1 i-- V-i .1 1 . !- ui tuia iu iuo ibci, tuai uie raenai, containing a vast amount of United States arms and munitions of war, is in our possession. The Government, finding that recruits could not safely be sent there to protect that vastly valu able property, very graciously placed the estab lishment under the charge of the Governor of South Carolina, where it will ever remain. He also spoke of the fortifications in Charleston harbor Castle Pinckney, Fort Moultrie, and Fort Sumter stations that required 5,000 sol diers to man, now having collectively only 200 men. The president well knows, that Buy at tempt to reinforce those points will lead to bloodshed and a general rupture, and he has had the good sense to let things remain as they are, and those establishments will, doubtless, fall peaceably into the hands of South Caro lina.'' It is unquestionable that men in high au thority have connived at the abandonment of vast amounts of Government property to the mercy of the mob which now has possession of Charleston, and has exposed even the forts, which assure our national sovereignty over that port, to the hazard of being seized by the same mob. Nobody doubts that this nullifying con spiracy has support in the Cabinet of the Presi dent, and future treason trials may designate the men. Ihe country is betrayed by its own Government. 

FORT MOULTRIE ABANDONED TO ITS FATE. The country will learn with indignation, but without surprise, that it was yesterday deter mined, in Cabinet council, to send no reinforce ments to Fort Moultrie, now held by only a handful of troops. It is denied that the officer in command has called for succor. We believe this denial to be without foundation. But whether the offi cer in command has called for more troops, or not, It is the duty of the Government to assure the safety of the fort beyond the possibilty of a doubt That is really the way to avert blood shed, because it is weakness, always, which in vites attack. DRIVE THEM IN. In the Charleston Mercury, of December I, we find a letter from Washington, containing the following : " Give it to them. ' Lay on, Macduff; ' drive them in with South Carolina, or drive them out Make them take their position. If the people of Virginia, Maryland, and those of this District, prefer to submit to the Abolitionists rather than to stand up by the side of South Carolina and other Southern States, I want to know it at once the sooner the better. Hit them a hard blow, "If Virginia has any sensibility left, I hope you will be able to reach her feelings. Ob, that she could be waked up I" , It is this operation or " driving in " Virginia, which just now attracts a good deal of atten tion. Mr. Senator Huntor maintains that Virginia has no option but to follow South Carolina, even in a career which he faintly professes to condemn. A popular instinct, not easily de cieved, has settled the point, that his wish is father to that thought, and Virginia relucts at the humiliation proposed to her by her Senator. " Drive them in," or " drive them out." This is the language addressed by a handful of madcaps in South Carolina, to such powerful Commonwealths as Maryland and Virginia. The indecency of the language, equals the folly of the thought. A PURE GENEALOGY. In a card of Robert N. Gourdin in the Charleston Mercury, we find the following: "In 1832,1 was a nullifier; in 1851, a seces sionist, and time has only strengthened my then convictions. Since it became apparent that Mr. Lincoln would be elected, I have, as a member of ' The 1860 Association,' endeavored to bring about secession." It is the rump of South Carolina nullification which is the real basis of the present troubles. In the philosophy of human nature, nothing is more enduring than the passions of defeated parties. They do not always terminate with life, but survive by transmission from father to son. The men who were snubbed and humili ated by Gen. Jackson in 1832, have nursed their rankling malignity to this day. The sla very question is with them, not an existing cause, but a pretext for disunion. They were disunionists before the slavery question was ever heard of, and would remain so, if that question was buried in the ocean beyond the reach of the plummet I In a letter to the Richmond Ennuirer. the Secretary of War recognises the right of States to secede at pleasure, and snys that if the Gulf States secede, Virginia will join them. ,He, however, deprecates disunion, and warns the South that their expectations of aid from England are delusive. He argues that the anti-slavery sentiment of the British pebple is 'too deep-seated to be yielded to any ideas of commercial advantage. 

OPINION OF THK-ATTORNEY GENERAL. Tho opinion of Attorney General Black, on the assumed right of secession, and the powers and duties of the Federal Executive towards a State assuming to secede from, the Union, sub mitted to the President, at his request, on the 20th of Noverabeirjlasj appears in the Consti tution and InJelltgertcirot this'momlog. We think tho arguments are, in the main, sound and judicious, Jut do not justify all the positions assumed by the President in his message. The Attorney General denies, by implication, at least, the constitutional right of a State to secede from tho Union, and " absolve her peo- pie from the duty of obeying the just and con stitutional requirements of the' Central Govern ment" He holds that the President has power to enforce the collection ofthe revenue in the ports of any State assuming to secede, and that this power " may be exercised anywhere at or within the port," there being " no law which confines the collector to the custom house, or to any other particular spot." That "if the custom-bouse wcro burnt down, he might remove to another building ; or if he were driven from the shore, ho might go on board a vessel in the harbor." He holds that the President's right to take such measures as he may deem necessary for the protection of the public property, such as "the forts, arsenals, magazines, dock yards, custom houses, public ships, and other proper ty which the United States have bought, built, and paid for," is " very clear." That the Pres ident has the right of " keeping exclusive pos session" of such property, and " repelling in trusion ; " and that this right " includes also the right of recapture after it has been unlaw fully taken by another." Under the express power granted to the President, by act of 1807, " to employ such parts of the land and naval forces as he may judge necessary, for the purpose of causing the laws to be duly executed, where it is lawful to uie the militia for the same purpose," he holds that the President can only call these forces into requisition in aid of the ministerial officers of the Federal courts, in executing the mandates of said courts, in cases coming within their ju risdiction ; and then, only " in cases of extreme necessity, arising out of great and unusual combinations against them." He suggests, that the contingency may arise, in which the public feeling in a State may be such, that no citizens can be found to accept the offices of judges, district attorneys, or marshals, of the Fed eral courts. In such case, as the President can use the land and naval forces only to aid the courts in the performance of their duty, he holds that " troops would be out of place, and their use wholly illegal." He says, in reference to the assumed right of secession, "If one of the States should de clare her independence, your action cannot de pend upon the rightfulness of the cause upon which such declaration is based. Whether the retirement of a State from the Union be the exercise of a right reserved in the Constitution, or a revolutionary movement, it is certain that you (the President) have not in either case the authority to recognise her independence, or to absolve her from her Federal obligations." In conclusion, the Attorney General argues that Congress has constitutional power to de clare war against one or more States, and re quire the Executive of the Federal Government to carry it on by means of forces drawn from the other States. Qualified as this assumption is, by a full admission of the power of the Fed eral Government to put down, by force, all re sistance to the Federal laws, and to repel all aggressions upon its property, we do not object to it. It is nevertheless true, that actual war between the Federal Government and a rebel lious State would necessarily result from the exercise of these admitted powers, in any State which might undertake to resist the execution of the Federal laws or take forcible possession of the Federal property. If the President will faithfully use the pow ers which the Attorney General advises him that he possesses under the Constitution and laws, in order to maintain the authority of the Federal Government in the present crisis, tho country will demand nothing more at his hands. 

IMPLACABLE MALICE. In a speech at Hamburg, S. C, on the 1st of December, Senator Hammond said : " The North and the South can never agree. Thef hate us and our institutions, with malice most implacable, and we hate them equally back again. No hate between the Israelites and the Canaanites was more excessive. We can't live with them, and wo must separate." This is, in substance, the language made use of the other day in the Senate, by Judge Iver son of Georgia. Men may mistake the feelings of others to wards themselves, and frequently do so, but thoy may be supposed to know their own feelings in respect to others. Thus, Messrs. Hammond and Iverson are not good witnesses as to the sentiments of the North, which they ev'dently misunderstand, but they are first class authority as to the sen timents of the South, and especially as to their own. " Implacable malice," then, is the avowed tem per of South Carolina and Georgia, or rather, of the men who, for the moment, have usurped the prerogative of speaking for those States. SWEPT IN BY THE CURRENT. In tho Charleston Mereuiy of December 1, we find an appeal from " Vox l'opuli" to the voters of Charleston against a certain ticket for delegates to the State Convention. " Vox Pupuli " says : " I tell you, this ticket is composed of men who were not in favor of secession but a short time ago, and would not be now, were it not that they see it it the popular side, their decla rations to the contrary notwithstanding." The apparent unanimity of South Carolina is deceptivo, and will bo short-lived. It will be followed by a war of factions, whose quarrels will only be settled by the sword. Governor H. S. Foote, of Mississippi, has written a decided letter against secession. LATEST FROM THE SOUTH. THE SECESSION ITEMNO IN fLORIDA. Charleston, Dec. 6. Senator Ynlee, of Flori da, has written a letter from Washington to the Legislature of that State, announcing that upon learning at any time of the determination of Florida to dissolve connection with the North ern Statu, he will promptly and joyously re turn home 'to support the banner of the'Stato to which he owes allegiance. Colonel Blackburn, Federal marshal for the northern district of Florida, is closing up tho bustnesspreparatory to resigning. The seces sion feeling in Florida is quite as universal as in South Carolina. THE GEORGIA AND 8. CAROLINA CONVENTIONS. Charleston, Dec. G. Tho Georgia Senate has rejected the bill calling a Convention of Southern States. This is viewed as an indica tion of the intention of Georgia to secede sepa rately. The election for delegates to the South Caro lina Convention was a quiet one."" A very full vote was polled. The result will not be known till to morrow. It is generally conceded that Judge Magrath will lead tho ticket W. Porchcr Miles, it is also conceded, is elected. THE rnESIDEXT DETERMINED TO AVOID A COL LISION THE TREASURY THE COMPROMISE COMMITTEE. Washington, Dec. 7. The President to day explicitly expressed his determination to send no more troops to the forts near Charleston, and said that everything would be done on his part to avoid a collision. Major Alexander has made no request for reinforcements, and it is represented that the best feeling exists between the garrison at Fort Moultrie and the citizens of Charleston. As an expedient for raising funds to meet the present wants of the Treasury, a member of the Committee of Ways and Means has sug gested that immediate payment of the duties on merchandise now in the public warehouses bo enforced. It is not probable that the select committee of the House will meet before next week. The opinion is well founded, that Messrs. Hawkins and Boyce are the only two who will ask to be excused from serving thereon. The indications are that their request will not be granted. mr. Lincoln's opinion of the president's 

MLSSAGE. Springfield, III., Dec. 5. A synopsis of the President's message reached Mr. Lincoln this morning. He comments very severely on its accusatory tone towards the North, and says his own views are misrepresented. GEORGIA LEGISLATURE REMAINS OF OENERAL WALKER. Milledaeville. Dec. 7. Mr. Fulton, of Colum- bia, offered a series of resolutions in the State i Legislature to-aay, requesting me representa tives of Georgia in Congress to propose that Congress appoint " commissioners on the part of the North and jSoutb, to provide for the peaceable dissolution of the Union, and an equitable distribution of the public property between both sections." Tho Mobile Ilegisler of the 4th announces the return of Cnpt. West, who went to Trux illo to obtain the remains of General Walker, having been unsuccessful, in consequence of the Honduras laws prohibiting exhumation. Col. Rudler was honorably treated, and his re lease was expected. 

FROM UTAH THE GOVERNMENT TREASURY ACTION OF MARTLANDERS ON THE CRISIS. Washington, Dec. 7. Col. Stambaugh, Sur veyor General of Utah, reports to the Land Office, verifying the accuracy of the surveys of his predecessor in that Territory. Charges had been made by the Mormons and others, that the original surveys were incorrect More than $200,000 in Treasury notes were sent in to-day for redemption. The Treasury has refused to honor a requisition of the Secre tary of the Senate for $60,000 for Senate pur poses. It is understood that the action of prominent citizens of Maryland at this point yesterday met with the approval of some of Mr. Breckin ridge's Kentucky friends. THREE DAYS LATER FROM EUROPE. New York, Dec. 1. Tho steamer Asia, from Liverpool on the 24th ult, has arrived. The steamer Bohemian arrived at London derry on the 23d. The China mail of the 1st of October bad been telegraphed. Hostilities had recommen ced in the North, and two skirmishes had been fought with the Tartan cavalry, who were re pulsed. The allied army was waiting in a hostile position before Pekin. Negotiations had been opened by the Chinese, but not in a supplicating manner. No new movement has taken place in Italy. A change had been made in the Neapolitan Ministry. Count Boano had joined the Cabinet without a portfolio. It is reported from Italy that a State Council will soon be convened on important matters. Victor Emanuel was expected to go to Pa lermo on the 26lh. A deputation had waited upon His Majesty, and presented him with the result of the voting in the Umbrian Marches. The Piedmontese Parliament would soon be convened, and forthwith dissolved, in order to be replaced by the Italian Parliament. Vague reports are in circulation that nego tiations nave commeucea ai irans lor me ces sion of Venetia.

The Last Card. Each of the Republican electors of the State of New Jersey received, on the day of their meeting in Trenton, a t tinted circular, dated Washington City, D. C, lecember'l, signed " Mercury," setting forth, first, the power each had of voting for whom he pleased, without regard to the candidates who had been placed in nomination by National Conventions; secondly, the terrible dangers with which the country was threatened because of the anticipated administration of Mr. Lin coln ; and thirdly, inviting and urging them to vote for some other than Abraham Lincoln. The language and arguments of the circular showed that it had beenwritten by no ordinary mind, though, whoever it was, did not think it best to add his own proper signature. The same circular has doubtless been sent to the Republican electors of the whole country, with the vague hope that some one or more might possibly be induced to decline voting for Lin coln, in view of the "awful" responsibility therein set forth. Gazette and Republican, Trenton, N. J. The Pecedino Cadets. A letter was pub lished a few days ago, purporting to emanate from seven West Point cadets, in which they declared that in the event of South Carolina's seceding from the Union, they would be found " under the folds of her banner, fighting for liberty and equality." The Philadelphia In iptirer has had the curiosity to refer to the official register of West Point cadets, in order to as certain the standing of these gentlemen. The examination revealed that two of them had been dismissed from the Academy fordeficiency in their studies, and a third for bad conduct, while a fpurth barely maintains a position in his class. The names of the other three are not found on the register, and must have been admitted since June, if students in the Acad emy. Trading in South Carolina. There is a bill before the South Carolina Legislature, which will probably pass, to the following efTect: " Hereafter it shall not be lawful for any petty shopman, itinerant salesman, travelling agent, or other person not having any permanent or established place of business and stock of goods within the State, out of which the tax may be levied, to carry on trade, or make contracts for sales by means of samples or patterns, or other wise. And that for every such offence the party so offending shall be deemed guilty of misde meanor, and, upou conviction, shall be liable to pay a fine of not less than.$2,000, and npon de fault of such payment he shall be imprisoned not more than six months. Provided nothing in this act shall be held to apply to venders of flour, grain, bacon, tobacco, cotton gins, planta tion implements, and domestic articles, the pro duction of the industry of any of the slavehold ing States." Well Characterized. The Evening rosfs Washington correspondence says : " The message was playfully but quite hap pily hit off by Mr. Seward, just after the read ing, when some friends of the President asked him what he thought of it. ' I think,' said the New York Senator, 'the President bas conclu sively proved two things: 1. That no State has the right to secede unless it wishes to; and 2. That it is the President's duty to enforce the laws, unless somebody opposes him.' " Ofiicial Vote of Missouri. Tho official vote of Missouri has been annouueed as follows : For Douglas .... 58,801 " Bell 58,372 " Breckinridge- - 31,317 " Lincoln 17,028 A Point. At the Winter Garden, on Wednes day flight, when "Richelieu" (Mr. Booth) said to his page, " Take away the sword ; States may yet be saved without it," the sentiment was instantly applied to our present political condition, and the entire audience united in a loDg and hearty burst of applause. A Southern editor, once, in attempting to compliment General Pillow as a " battle scarred veteran," was made by the types to call him a " battle scared veteran." In tne next issue the mistake was so far corrected as to style him a " bottle scarred veteran." Tho Bridgeton Chronicle notices an organ ization of young men in that town, styled "Zouave Oddities," who bavo banded together for the purpose of sawing and splitting wood for destitute families tho ensuing winter. With wood-saw astride of horse, and axe in hand, they proceed to the premises, and reduce the wood to stove size with an alacrity unknown to those who labor for polf. There is a touch of ptulanturopy in tbis, wormy ot imitation. From a recent survey, it is estimated that the coal region of Spain covers 120 square leagues, containing 2,300,000,000 tons of coals, of qual ity but little inferior to our own. In France, the consumption of coal amounts to Bixty mil lions of tons annually. William A.
