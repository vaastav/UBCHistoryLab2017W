STATEMENT BY THE FORMER TREASURER a -3 4 ft .Li . 1. ! : rra the Moacr Avoid a Long Drama Out Law Suit Wltk ( Attendant Worry ana Erae Aliened Mhortaae la Sen. De'nlrntloa. Topcka. Kan.. Dec. 11 F. E. Crimes, ex-state treasurer, Tuesday voluntarily iuid to the state of K:in aa the aura of $9,381, tor which amount an Invest hunting commltu e some time ago nem nis nanum-ura-tlon responsible. The alleged short age was never considered in the light of a uVraleation in any sense of the word und resulted from a practice that had been the rule in the state treasurers office for many years be fore and after Mr. Grimes assumed the office. The Investigation showed conclusively that Mr. Grimes was not benefitted In any way through this practice In his administration. There fore In making a payment to the state now of the amount Involved, he has In an effort to clear his administra tion, assumed a responsibility at a personal loss to himself. Mr. Grimes' action closes a case that had become famous. Mr. Grimes said In speak In gtf the case: "In order to avoid a long-drawn-out suit, with Its attending worry and expense of lawyers, witnesses and court costs and feeling under a moral obligation to do so, I have agreed to make settlement wtth the state of Kansas on the basis of $9,381.25. It Is the Judgment of the attorney gen eral that this Is the amount for which my administration as state treasurer, should be held responsible. I said, last January, when the Hasklns and Sells, the accountants, report was made public, that there was about IV 000 which appeared to be unac counted for. I feel as though I should have been given the benefit of several items, by the attorney gen eral, which would have lessened the amount considerable. I bad no knowledge of any loss at the expira tion of my term of office but the state shall not suffer any even though I am in no wise to blame for It. "Many of the apparent shortages were caused by the practice of al lowing bond brokers to detach coupons from bonds sold to the state and there Is no complete re cord of the bonds sold during that time. I have letters from bond brokers stating that they legitimately received the clippings of certain coupons for the sale of bonds to the state, some of which I am now com pelled to pay although they were never charged against the treasurer or never were In the treasurer's office However, the conclusion of the attor ney general is that I shall pay the above amount, an1 I, therefore, ac quiesce In his decision. "I have never had one penny from rtlie state t'nat did not honestly belong ito me. I have been tiie victim of cir cumstances, mistakes and unfaithful ess of others and it is a very great (hardship for me to have to pay this rnirmey. I am, however, deeply grate ful to the people of Kansas for the confidence they have shown In me .... during-lbe. discussion of this matter. The press has been most kind and so fcave the people everywhere, and Vfh'is has helped me to maintain my ifioaltion and credit before the world. t iiM rather have the name of IhtHng honest and have the confidence nt mv friends and the people than any amount of money." After Mr. Grimes had paid over the money Tuesday to the state treasur er's office, C. C. Coleman, attorney a-nneral. issued the following state ment: . -"There will be a general feeling of . sympathy on account of Mr. Grimes havinc to pay this amount Mr. Grimes has shown a disposition all the way through to help In making right the matter so that the state should not lose anything on account sf nay possible mistake , which may have occurred during his admlnlstra tton. No one connected with the case would believe hut that Frank Grimes has been absolutely straight and honnat in his administration of state treasury affairs.'' Gov. E. W. Hoch said: "The action of Mr. Grimes Is very commendable and entitles him to the confidence that I have always felt In htm, and which I .believe most persons feel, that he was absolutely honest la the admin Istration of the office of state treas urer.' On the cheek with which he paid the alleged shortage Tuesday, Mr. Crimea wrote these words: "Victim of circumstances.'.

The' com- sUttM Tuesday declined to make fa- vorafc!e reports on these nomlnationi Washington. Dec. 11. President Roosevelt sent a special message to congress Tuesday, regarding Porto Rican affairs, telling of his recent visit to the Island and recommena Ing that full American citizenship be accorded Porto Rlcans. The mes sage In part Is as follows: To the Senate and House of Repre sentatives: On November 21 I visited the is land of Porto Rico, landing at Ponce, crossing by the old Spanish road by Cayey to San Juan, and returning next morning over the new Ameri can road froni.Areclbo to Ponce; the scenery was wonderfully beautiful, especially among the mountains ol the Interior, which constitute a verit able Switzerland. I could not em bark at San Juan because the harbor has not been dredged out and can not receive an American battle ship. I do not think this fact creditable to a nation, and I earnestly hope that immediate provision will be made for dredging San Juan harbor. I stopped at a dozen towns all told, and one of the notable features in every town was the gathering of thfl school children. The work that has been done in Porto Rico for educa tion has been noteworthy. The main emphasis, as is eminently wise and proper, has been put upon primary education; but In addition to this there is a normal school, an agri cultural school, three Industrial and thrte high schools. Every effort U being made to secure not only thj lenefits of elementary education to all the Porto Ricans of the next gen- ration, but also a3 far as means will pcimlt-to train them so that the in. duMrlal, agricultural and commercial opportunities of the island can ba utilized to the best possible advant- 1 was very much struck by the ex cel rnt character both of the insular po'ice and of the Porto Rlcan regi ment. They are both ot them bodies that reflect credit upon the American administration of the island. The insular police are under the local Porto Rican government The Porto Rlcan regiment of troops must be ap propriated for by congress. I earn estly hope that this body will be kept permanent. There should ' certainly be troops In the island, and it is wise that these troops should be them selves native Porto Rlcans. It would i be from every standpoint a mistake not to perpetuate this regiment There is 'a matter to which I wish to call yonr attention, and that Is the desirability of conferring full Amer ican cltlienshlp upon the people of Porto Rico. 1 most earnestly hope that this will be done. I can not see how any harm can poeslblly re sult from it, and It seems to me a matter of right Ad justice to the peo ple of Porto Rico. They are loyal. they are glad to be under our flag, they are making rapid progress along the path of orderly liberty. Surely we should show our appreciation of them, our pride In what they have done,. and our pleasure In extending recognition for what has thus been done, by granting them full Ameri can citizenship. Under the wise administration of the present governor and council, marked progress has been made In the difficult . matter of granting , to the people of the island , the. largest measure of self-government that can with safety r be given at the present "time. It would have ,been a very serious mistake to have gone . any faster than we have already gone in have complete and absolute ony In all their municipal ments, the only power over them possessed by the Insular government being that of removing corrupt or In competent municipals. It la not a power with which it would be safe, tor the sake of the Island itself to dis pense at present. The lower house l absolutely elective, while the up per house Is appointive. This scheme Is working well; no Injustice of any kind results from It, and great bene fit to the iBland. and It should cer tainly not be changed at this time. The machinery of the elections Is ad ministered entlerely by the Porto Rican people themselves, the gov ernor and council keeping only such supervision as is necessary in order to Insure an orderly election. Any protest as to electoral frauds Is set tled In the courts. Here again it would not be. safe to make any change In the present system. AH the Insular governments should b placed In one bureau, either In the department of war or the dapart ment of State. It Is a mistake nit so to arrange our handling ot these island at Washington as to be able to take advantage of the experience pained In one, when dealing with the problems that from time to time arise In another. in conclusion let me expwisa my admiration for the work done by the congress when it enacted the law under which the Island Is now being mlmlnistered. After seeing the Is land personally, and after five years' experience in connection with Its ad ministration, It Is but fair to those who devised this law to say that it would be well-nigh Impossible to have devised any other which In the actual working would have accom plished better results.

Senator Rnrrnwa fnll nn Re.oln. tlon Declaring; Seat of Mormon AioHtle Vacnut. Washington, Dec. 11. Senator Bur rows, chairman of the senate com mittee on privileges and elections called up Tuesday the resolution de claring that Hon. Reed Smoot is not entitled to a seat as senator from Utah and addressed the senate on that subject. Senator Burrows said there had been no proof submitted to sustain the alle gation that Mr. Smoot Is a polygamist, adding that the recommendation of the committee on privileges and elections In favor of declaring vacant the seat of the Utah senator Is not based on such charges. Mr. Burrow s Impeachment was based entirely upon the connection of Mr. Smoot with the governing body ot the church consisting of the presi dency and the twelve apostles. He referred to this body as a "belrarchy," and said it dominates the state of v tan i. noiumg pracucai.y every or- Proceedlng, the canty court fttlal rweHHrt In titan stntaa nrnvnat.
