LARGEST CIRCULATION OF ANY SOUTH MISSISSIPPI PAPER. VALUATION OF RAILROADS "The inter In his recent message to congress, President Taft said: state commerce commission has recommended appropriations for the pur This has al pose of enabling it to enter upon a valuation of all railroads, ways been within the jurisdiction of the commission, but the requisite funds have been wanting. Statistics of the value of each railroad would be val uable for many purposes, especially if we ultimately enact any limitations upon the power of the interstate railroads to issue stocks and bonds, as I hope we may. Btanding of the facts, it would be wise to make a reasonable appropriation to enable the interstate commerce commission to proceed with due dispatch to the valuation of all railroads. I have no doubt that railroad companies themselves can and will greatly facilitate this valuation and make it much less costly in time and money than has been supposed." I think, therefore, that in order to permit a correct under The prevailing opinion in Wall street is that the ultimate effect of the Much uneasi physical valuation will be very much in favor of investors. however, is felt because it seems impossible to find anyone qualified ness to value the roads except railroad men, and the general public would be as skeptical of that as they are of any revision the republicans might give to the tariff schedule, it is. the prevailing opinion among New York bankers physical valuation will prove every railroad in the country that a worth more than the par of its outstanding securities, because of the high Such valuations as have prices of land, material and labor at present, been made are said to demonstrate this.

This generation can never right all the wrongs that were committed by dead financiers, aided and abetted by corrupt politicians and subsidized legisla tion. 

WHERE THE PROFIT GOES The case of California ought to be instructive to those communities that think they can get more out of a protective tariff than it will cost them. Very possibly California contains more people who are actually inter ested in the maintenance of a protective tariff than any other state in the union.
