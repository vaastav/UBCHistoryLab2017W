The firstMessage of President Arthur was presented to Congress t'o 6th. It is very long; so long that we cannot find space for it, but wIl attempt to give some of its main features. After speaking of the great calamity that befell the iation in the death of President -field, he congratulates the coun try.upon the rare good fortune en joyed during the year in abundant harvests, the freedom from the ragages of disease, and the peaceful relationa existing between this and other nations. He devotes a large space tthe discussion of our diplo matic and 'consular relations with other governments, in. which there is nothing of special interest. In regard to the finances, he states that the oidinary revenues from all sources for the year.ending June 30, 1881F:were $360,782,922.57: the ordinary expenditures lor the same periodbeing $260,712,887.59. The revnttie f6r the.present fiscal year he estimates at'$400,000,000, and the -expenditures at $270,00,000. Herirecomends the reduction of the reienue'by removing the tax t6in iaties,' proprietary articles, bank, cheeks and bank deposits; but..in view of. the drain made upon the Treasury from the pay ment of arrearages of pensions, he thinks if not advisable at present to rednee tlhe taxation on liquors and tobacco, -He coincides with the reommendation of Gen. Sher rian -tha'the number of ienlisted eitth army be increased to the maximum allowed by law-30, 000. Ee'also reicommends that the navy and'ouE harbor fortifications be put in a more efficient condition so as to pro~vTeigaint any emer acen The receipts frpm the Post OBie)epartue'nt for-the past fis esf yend were $36,785,397.97 ; the expsnide' $39,251,.736.46. He re commends that the money order system he so changed as to reduce $the fees for-post ofiie money orders, and to allow sums up to $100 to be sent tg~ rder, instead of $50, as no~IIoyedbyair. In regard to Indian affairs, he says that the plan formerly-pursued of settling the -Indians upon -res4rvations remote from 'ivilization has pr'oved totally ia~aifctory and disastrous ; and thali the- plan lately pursued of set tling-them in the midst of civilized bomniunifres and thus allowing Thern"to be 'sbsorbed among the Whited and 7,o be benefitted by schools and by the ordinary indus tries and pursuits of life, is working well. Thedesident urges earn estly -upon Congress the duty of -srressig polygamy. The diffi cly amounting almost to an im .posibility, of proving polygamous mz&riages, be thinks can be obviated to a great degree by removing the incompetenfof tif wife to testify against -the husband; and by re q uiridg; under heavy penalties, per sonis performing marriage ceremo nies in:theTerritories to file certifi cates ofsuch marriages in the Su preme Cotruf t1ffTerritory. The President estirates that it will re qi~e$2355 00,000 to pay pension c.1nime d4ti- present year. :He.ad vocates' thensystem of competitive examinations in the civil -service and a fixity6f-tentre, so that per. -sons applying for appointments niavte '&rhz?ieas to their fitness, hatlt pro,motions shall depend upon merit, and that appointees may feel secure in their positions so long as they do the -duty The sum of $1,000,000 is lying in ile'ational Treasury that has ac cumulated from unclaided money orders. Considering that the money order syste.mv as,eatablished only :eighteen years ago,.and that money cannof(>e sent by post:office order -oYVer $50, 'the -fact that such an amonthas gone astray gives some i4-a of the vast amoiunt of money that has ben senLJby this method. - h1.;Jillson, Saperintendent of Edu~catiI3 in this-State under Re p@lican regime, died recently at h is hiome,pringfield, 3Iass. CoL. Jno. W. Forney, a noted iournalist of Philadelphia, died the instant.I TI Stale Grange Met in Columbia the 6th instant, the session lasting three days. James N. Lipscomb. Worthy Mas ter. delivered his annual address. which was referred to the appropri .te conlmittee. A motion was adop ed that a (.owwittee from the xrangc confer immediately with he agricuitural committees of the Iwo houses on the subject of the ien law.-- 8tamning committecs I -verC appointed, and officers made their reports. A resolution author zing the Worthy Master to deliver lectures on the work of the Grange throughout the State was adopted; a motion that each Grange be as sessed )10 to pay his traveling ex penses was lost; and a motion that each Grange contribute what it can for this purpose was adopted. The committee appointed to enquire into the feasibility of starting an agricultural journal reported, re commending that the Grange give its support to any newspaper that would open its columns to the Grange. A resolution asking aid from the National Grange for needy members of the State Grange was adopted. Columbia was selected as the next place for the annual meet ing. There :, a very general disposi tion among persons with families in the country to come to town. The chief reason is that the free school system has rendered it al most impossible to have good pri -te schools in the country; and the workings of the free schools is so fitful and uncertain, and the pay so small, that it is almost impossi ble to get good schools in the coun try. Persons with several children to educate find it less expensive to rent --out their farms and live in town than to send their children to board ; besides they thus keep their children under their own eyes and under the influence of home life and the family circle, and this is an im portant consideration. Some of the opponents of the lien law seem to think that if there were no liens there would be no debts. So intelligent a man as Mr. Rucker, of Anderson, in a speech favoring the repeal of the law gave as one of the reasons why the law should be repealed that persons who give liens are com pelled to plant nearly all their farms in cotton to enable them to pay their liens. Suppose they got cred it on some other basis than a lien on a mortgage for instance ; or on no security at all-wouldn't they have to raise cotton all the same to pay their debts ? Washington Newsi. Postmaster-General Thomas L. James has resigned. The President has nominated Frederick T. Frelinghuysen, of New Jersey, to be Secretary of State, cice James G. Blaine. The Senate confirmed the nomination. A bill was introduced in the Sen ate the 12th authorizing the Secre tary of the Treasury to pay the necessary and reasonable expenses incurred in behalf of the late Presi dent Garfield to the amount of 8100,000. The Cotton Crop. The Charleston Exchange has just made a report based on 54 re plies from 27 Counties, average date November 30th. From these replies the total yield in the State as compared with last year is esti mated as follows: Two replies esti mates the same as last year : three at i ; fourteen at J: twventy eight at 4: ten at i. Three-fourths of the crop has already been marketed. The prosecution began last week to pro.dnce evidence in rebuttal in the Guiteau case. A number of physicians testified that they did not believe the defendant crazy, but thought he was shamming. Several persons who had known Guiteau a long time gave their opinion, substantiated by facts, that it was not craziness that was the matter with him but meanness anad depravity. It begins to look decidedly squally for Guiteau. Superintendent of Education Thompson makes two excellent suggestions in his report to the Legislature. One is that the School Commissioners be appointed by the .State Board of Examiners. The other is that the power of local tax ation for school purposes be given to the school districts, with the re striction that only property holders be allowed to vote on the question. A theater at Vienna burned down the night of the 9th instant during a performance attended by 2,000 people. The number of lives lost is reported_at 917 ; most of these perished by suffocation and by be-. ingermpled n. Legilative---The Lien Law. &c. The bill to repe-d the Lien Law was discussed at !ingth in the louse Fri ,iav. Mr. lhauj, argued tha! 0h, law wa.: n-.eeity a t p'reset lIr. 4ay,o .\ 'bevilk-. spse the r-:pea of the law ; he e!:iutd zhi.t it had worked great raod that a time would co:.e ffr its repeal, but now is nutt thr tit,: .,r. Allen, of Spartanbura, spoke on the same side, and said it woud be a great hardship on the poor man to repeal the law and thus Ie prive imi of the only means of credit be has. Mr. Wilson, of Newberry. opposed the repeal If the law wer( repealed many poor white men as well as blacks would be compelled to worb for w:t.es. The merchants would not be hurt by the repeal of the law, and the farmer wouid not be benefitted Landlords would give no bL ter termi for supplies furnished than tnerchants give. le thought the effort to repea was un effort to build up the laodlord at the expense of the merchaut. Hi, colleague (Mr. Sligh) had said thal the profits of the Newberry mere-hanti were from 20 to SO per cent. Thif was either gross ignorance or gros. misrepresentatiou. He (Mr S ) bac said that the days of the Lien Lam were numbered. The advocates of tb bill say thar if this Legislature do iou repeal the law the people will sent representatives here who will. HI (Mr. W.) hoped the people would sem representatives to take cure of theil interests, and if they chose to repea the law the responsibility would be oi them. Mr. Scarbort;ugh was oppose( to the repeal of the law now on accoul of the bhort crops. Mr. Dargan, o Sumter, was opprsed on the saun grounds. Mr. Rucker, of Anderson favored the repeal because (1) by put ting the farmer in the power of thi aierchaut to whom be had given i lien it prevented his getting the bene fit of competition : (2) it cuapelle< the farmer to raise nearly all cotton t enable him to pay off the lieu ; (.3 the law induced many to undertak the runing of farms who were no capable of doing so successfully. Mr Murray, of Anderson, opposed th, repeal. le said that the advocates u repeal claimed the law was injurin the poor people of the State, and y( these poor people were not the one asking for repeal. The law has eua bled many a man to w.-rk himself int the possession of home aud land. Mr fHemphill. of Chester. favored a repea now, to take effect at a future time so did Mr. Verner. of Ueonee. Mr Hntson. of Hampton, said that so fa as he could see the only persons whi would be benefitted by the repeal wer, the lawyers. Mr. Sligh replied to hi colleague Mr. Wilson. who har charged him with gloss ignorance o misrepresentation He said that hi (Mr. S.) bad not confined his remark to the merchants of Newberry; noJ had he confined his statement of thi interest charged for advances to an~ one year. He intended his remark: to cover the whole period of the exist ence of the law: and he was prepare< to substantiate what he had said Mr Racker stated that if the advocates o the repeal failed in repealiug the law at once, they would then cffe: an amendment that the repealing aic should take effect Oct. 1, 1882. A vote was then taken on the bill t< repeal the law immediately, and was lost by 70 to 37. A bill to simplify and amend crim inal pleadings, the principal objeci being to do away with the long and tedious method of drawing indictment, and to substitute therefor simple: forms, was lost in the House Saturda~ by a vote of 48 to 26. Mr. Johrstone, of Newberry, Chair man of the Committee on Wavs and Means, reported the appropriation bil Monday ; the total being $095,640.50 In the Senate Monday the bill t< repeal the Lien Law was indefinitel' postponed. Mr. Dlevereux, of Charleston, gavi notice of a bill to prevent me'rehante charging lienors more than 7 per cent over the cash price of the goods sold on liens. The General Assembly has accepted an invitation to visit the Atlanta Ex position. and the members will go th~ 20th inst.aot. 'The bill providing for calling Constitutional Convention is undeo consideration, with very little pros pects of being passed. The bill to make the Stock Las extend over the whole State will pass a few Counties, Colleton, Georgetown and one er two others in the loV country, will probably be excepted with the proviso that they build thi line fences. The election bill passed the Setnat< Tuesday. It provides for S boxes al each preciuet-2 for Ftderal ffcers and 6 for State and County.
