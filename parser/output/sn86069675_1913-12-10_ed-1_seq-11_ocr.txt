President Wilsons General mosagc to Congress follows the precedents set by his special mes sages in brevity, Ufcidity and pointcdncss. He has broken a way from the custom of making the annual message a ponderous omnibus for -the conveyance of personal preachments on this, that and 'nothing, and of the lumber of the various depart ments, addressing himself di rectly to the topics which- he deems of present greatest mo ment. This is a most welcome departure from the policy of his immediate predecessor in partic ular, who, not content with issu ing a daily dissertation from the White House, utilize the oppor tunity of his annual message for the verbose demonstration of his cocksurencss about everything (always excepting the tariff) this side of infinity and eternity -i not a little beyond. Theodore Roosevelt broke all records as a breaker of preced ents, but Woo.drow Wilson has done more and better by break ing this one precedent than Roosevelt did by breaking a hun dred. So admirable is the result that it is no longer necessary to sum marize the message for the busy reader. It is compressed in a compass to make it quickly read able, and it should be read' by everyone who wishes to know what the President thinks about our foreign relations, about rural credits, about anti-trust legisla tion, about presidential prima ries and national party conven tions, about our insular wards, the development of Alaska and the improvement of labor condi tions in the mines, on the rail roads and at sea. He has nothing new to say about Mexico, contenting himself with a denunciation of the Hue rta usurpation and with a reiter ation of his "waiting and watch ing" policy, jsatisficd that the collapse of Huerta is not far a way. He seems, as he has seem ed all along, to have more faith in Mexico's qualifications for self-government that is justi fied by Mexican history or Mex ican conditions. Huerta's down fall may be inevitable, as Mr. Wilson thinks, but why he should think that Huerta's downfall would be followed by constitutional government in Mexico is not apparent. Un doubtedly his policy of watching and waiting is a far more com mendable policy than the policy of intervention urged by our jin goes andour exploiters of the John Hays Hammond dollar mark, but how much better pol icy it would have been if, dis carding the mischievous Roose velt pervasion of the Monroe doctrine and disabusing himself of the notion that it is for the United States to dictate the standard of government or mor als of Latin America, he had blazed out as the Wilson doctrine that it is for the United States to work out its own ideals in its own territory, without essaying to lay down standards of gov ernment or morals for peoples for whom we have no responsi bility and over whom wc have no authority save that which we may assume in short, if he had set his jaw and made up his mind that, in so far as he was able to effect it, we were going to mind our own business and leave other nations to mind theirs !

WANAMAKER AND ADVERTISING In an address delivered in Philadelphia recently John Wan amakcr said the first necessity of success in retail trade is good merchandise. He added that good advertising is "quite as much of a necessity to a busi ness that is to keep up a healthy growth." "If you have in your shop," said Mr. Wanamakcr, "exactly what 500,000 people of this city want, but only 500 of them know you have it, the care and energy you have expended in maintain ing a stock of high quality will do little good, either to your cus tomers or to your business." Mr. Wanamakcr may be con sidered an authority on adver tising, for there has been no more consistent advertiser in all the history of the United States. He is one of the country's great est merchants. He began busi ness on a rather meager basis, but by judicious use of the news papers, he let all Philadelphia know what he had to sell, and increased his establishment and his outlay for publicity until he made the name of Wanamakcr known around the world. In the half -a century or more that the Wanamaker store has grown from nothingness to its present proportions thousands of stores in Philadelphia have come and gone without leaving a rip ple on the city's commercial sur face. Honest merchants, many of them, who dealt in good goods and gave their customers a square deal, but they cither neg lected the publicity end of the business or botched it so badly that they got no results. "The satisfaction of knowing that your name stands for good merchan dise," said Mr. Wanamaker in his recent address, "is a great thing certainly, but it is not apt to be greatly profitable unless the public at large knows it also." The retail merchant who docs not advertise cannot hope to build up a big, growing and en during business. All merchants it is true, cannot be Wanamak er's, but there is no merchant who cannot enlarge his trade by intelligent advertising.
