Th" tariff, as a political Issue, at present seems to be very dead, but, perhaps, the trust agitation may revive the corpse. General Joe Wheeler m.'.y tempt con gress tod far, now that it has begun the business of attempting to unseat duly elected members. It begins to look as though Santa Claus Otis might be able to place a Filipino president in Mr. McKinley's Christmas stocking. The United States four per cent bonds, which Mr. Cleveland sold at J1.04, passed $1.33 yesterday, and two per cents were quoted $1.021.i. Senator Beveridge's information about the Philippines has been locked up in his brain so long that it may be mouldy when finally exposed to view. The rate at which bills embodying important legislation are being offered in congress indicates that this is to be a business session. Already there is one for the reform of the currency and one for laying a cable to Manila. As the estimated cost of the Pacific cable is but $S,C"j0.000 there can be no hesita tion about voting the appropriation on the score of scarcity of money, in the present plethoric condition of the treas ury. IN 

COMPLETE ACCORD. For the first time in a long while the president and both houses of congress are in accord politically, and, if noth ing is done, the people will know whom to condemn or approve, as the case may be. Durng Grant's last two years as pres ident and Hayes' administration, the house of representatives was Demo cratic, and in the last two years of the latter the senate also. During the first two years of the Garfield-Arthur term the house was republican, but the sen ate was equally divided, while in the last two the house was Democratic and the senate Republican. During the tirst two years of Harrison's adminis tration both houses were Republican, but the silver men of that party had already begun to exhibit the spirit that later led them to abandon their organ ization upon the adoption of the gold standard plank in the St. Louis plat form, and in the second half of the ad ministration the house again became Democratic. During the first half of Cleveland's cecond administration both branches of congress were Democratic, but even then the differences on the monetary question that split the party in 1896 be gan to make themselves felt, and the supreme court had a majority of Re publican members. In the second half of that administration the house again fcecame Republican and has remained eo up to this time. During the first half of this administration the house was Republican, but in the senate nei ther party had a majority, though the Republicans had a plurality and suc ceeded by the help of protection Demo crats in passing the Dingley tariff bill through that body. 

MESSAGE OF T HE PRESIDENT. The annual message submitted by the president to congress, Tuesday is not able as a careful, and comprehensive review of the con 3ition of the country rather than for tae number of recom mendations it contains. In the latter particular it is rather more deficient than documents of like character usual ly are. His suggestions regarding currency legislation had already been forstall ed by the introduction erf the bill pre pared by the house Republican caucus committee on Monday 34 hours ahead of the presentation of true message. He distinctly urges the maintenance of the g-old standard, the permanent retire ment of the greenbacks a.nd the confer ring of power on the secretary of the treasury to issue bonds when it shall eeem desirable to do so. "While he does not so.y so in plain terms, the president makes it apparent that he favors the system of govern ment subsidies for steamship lines and pays he believes the country is with lilm on that proposition. Trusts he declares to be bad things, and urges congress to do the best it can to protect the people from their en croachments. A large portion of the message is de voted to pur foreign relations. The most notable feature of this portion of the document is that which contains a hint to the Sultan of Turkey that he would better pay up or it may be worse for him. The necessity of an ocean cable to Manila is set forth in Btrong terms. "While government construction and op eration is clearly favored, the cable itself is regarded to be of primary im portance to the means of getting it. That portion of the message devoted to Cuba leaves no doubt of the intention Sf the president to carry out, as far as lies In his power, the pledge made by congress to give the island a stable' and independent government. The advocates of a postal savings bank will seek in vain for any encour agement in that part of the message devoted to postal affairs. j That portion of the message which deals with the Philippines Is In entire s accord with previous expressions of the president on that matter in speeches ; delivered at various times and places . and contains nothing new on the sub- ' ject, except it be that emphasis is added to previously- expressed views. On the whole, perhaps the message j may be said to be more remarkable for : what it does not contain than for the important recommendations therein found. Exeept for the currency fea ture, there is evident on the part of the ! president a disposition to let what he considers well enough alone, as regards the internal affairs of the country. 

GLOBE SIGHTS From the Atchison Globe. "We do not remember a time when "trade" was good enough to satisfy the merchants. If you haven't an item for a reporter, you can at least be sorry you haven't one. Nearly every man tries to tell Irish stories; only one in a thousand can tell them well. "When a man can get fun out of his business, instead of going out of town for it, he is all right. If a woman has a yellow, bilious look, it is the society way to refer to her rich, creamy beauty. It seems to be a man's duty to keep the wolf from his own door, and his wife's to scare oft the wolf in front of her church. It is unfortunate that some people do not work as hard to pay off their own debts as they work to pay off the debts of the church. Now that the football season is over, it would be interesting to have the Missouri and Kansas teams come to gether for a spelling match. "We don't know what the connection is between finger nails and girls, but as soon as a boy gets interested in the latter, he wants a manicure set. After a man passes fifty, he is second-handed as surely as an old wagon that the owner is willing to sell at less than half its original value. So far, the winter has been so mild that the special newspaper correspon dents have been compelled to send out stories of cattle being killed by hail stones. Occasionally you find a man willing to be the under dog. because of the sympathy that goes with it. The dog on top, although the best dog, is never admired by anyone. The first day after a fire, you can't coax a fireman away from the efcgine house, but the third day he goes a block away, and within a week has forgotten all about his caution. "When a girl who has earned her liv ing for a number of years, gets en gaged, the feeling that she doesn't have to work for a living, makes her as happy as if she had cast all her burdens on the Lord. The women are beginning to count up all the friends out of town whom they visited last summer, and to whom they will send Christmas presents. Those they visited a year ago will get only Christmas cards. POINTED PARAGRAPHS. From the Chicago News. Silence is merely sound put to sleep. Set a bad example and it will hatch out mischief. Courage is the thing that enables us to forget our fears. "When two nations are at war even the dispatches conflict. Narrow minds overlook a charitable act and search for the motive. Time and patience will enable a per son to conquer almost any obstacle. If a man is unable to sell or give a thing away he proceeds to raffle it off. Paradoxical though it may seem, a good old age is often a very bad one. The man who failed as a merchant is seldom satisfied with a job as clerk. The evil-doer is afraid of his shadow when it looks like a detective on his trail. A man isn't necessarily brilliant be cause he sits down and reflects oc casionally. A theory that has neither faith nor trust in its foundation doesn't amount to very much. Tou can scracely blame a yacht for jumping up and down when it is put on another tack. Perhaps the reason a woman's work is never done is because she employs a domestic to do it. If climbing stairs will reduce flesh it is but logical to suppose that the descent of them will increase it. It is a very easy matter to be pop ular with your friends. All you have to do is simply agree with them in everything. "There is no telling" would certainly be an appropriate motto for a sewing society if the members would only live up to it. In everv home where there is a num ber of sisters and a bath tub, there is no reason why Turkish baths should not be taken at home. "Why couldn't one sister scrub and rub the other? It would be sensible and beneficial, but it will never be done. Sisters are so modest when together that when one sister puts a plaster on the other's back, it has to be done in the dark. BACHELOR BUTTONS. From the New Tork Press. Women wouldn't ' talk too much if they only spoke their minds. A woman is never truly happy unless her heart is bleeding for somebody. Probably Cupid had to be pictured with no clothes on because his stvle ' never changes any. The average woman can do more with a tack-hammer and a bent hairpin than a man can with a sixty-dollar tool chest. A woman never feels exactly intimate with the woman that lives next door till she has once asked her to feed the cat while they are away. KANSASJEWS. Entire Outfit of Edlinger, Mur dered Near Fort Scott, Found at Stockton, Missouri, and Thoroughly Identified. TIIKEE MEN IX JAIL. Two Men Who Had the Team Are the Suspects. One of the Men Recently Married and Abandoned a Girl. Fort Scott, Dec. 6. The team, wagon and entire outfit which belonged to Leopold Edlinger, the young Bates county, Mo., farmer who was murdered about a month ago and thrown into Mill creek five miles northwest of this city, have been recovered at Stockton, Mo., and two brothers named Smith are in jail there charged with the murder. Deputy Sheriff Bales and Edlinger's brother-in-law today identified the team, and Bales will bring the men to Fort Scott. Another man named Amos Phillips, has been arrested at Butler, Mo., from which place Edlinger start ed on his journey through this vicinity, charging with having had the team since the murder. By telephonic communication with the sheriff of Cedar county this after noon the entire story of the arrest was learned from hint. The "two Smiths live on a farm about six miles from Stockton. They are known to have been away from home for some weeks and to have but recently returned. Last Thursday a horse buyer drove in to Stockton leading a dark brown mare. It was recognized by a man named Turck of Butler, Mo., as the animal which Leopold Edlinger bought at Butler before he started for Okla homa, and which was tied behind his wagon when last seen. Vpon being questioned the horsebuyer told where he got the animal. The fact that the Smith boys had been away from home and, as is claimed by the sheriff, that they were considered bad men, caused suspicion to rest upon them. Turck communicated the fact to Constable McKinney and he and McKinney went out to the Smith brothers' place and there Turck identified Ediinger's wagon and mule team. Only one of the Smiths was at home and he was ar rested and taken to jail. All their ef fects were levied upon by the sheriff and hauled to to.n. Herman Leimer, a brother-in-law of Edlinger, was called to Stockton and among the effects upon which the sheriff had seized he identi fied not only the mule team, wagon, mare and harness with which Edlinger started to Oklahoma. but the cook stove, trunk, grub-box, shirts, comforts, some socks and other articles of cloth ing which belonged to the murdered man. There was also in the wagon the ax Edlinger carried and with w hich his head was probably crushed. Mr. Leimer put the handle in the ax for Edlinger before he started. Meantime the Missouri officers laid for the other Smith brother who had gone to Nevada, and they caught him and locked him up, away from his brother in order that they might not communicate with each other. They absolutely refuse to talk, except to say that they will explain how they came into possession of the team and effects when the proper time comes. It is supposed by some that one of the Smith s now under arrest at Stock ton is George Smith who enticed a country girl to marry him and took her to the Tremont hotel during or after the street fair where he abandoned her after taking all of her money which was something about $450. A WOMAN EVANGELIST. Miss Minnie Johnson Holds Success ful Revival at Larned. Larned, Dec. 6.

Anderson, living five miles south east of Enterprise, has -returned from the Klondike, bringing with him a bride and a fortune. He went to Alaska less than two years ago penniless as a mis sionary. Illness unfitted him for preach ing and he went to mining. His first claim, the "Famous No. 9." proved a winner. Several nuggets worth over $50 each were taken out, the larg est being worth $56. The largest ever taken out in the Klondike was $450. He was offered $75,000 for his claim before leaving, but refused. He will go back in the spring. He has another claim that is also promising well and five others that are unworked. He is pre paring to fit up a fine home for his par enuts on the farm and will make them comfortable.

The state has brought suit against the Topeka board of education for the payment of certain school bonds and the school board is without an attorney to conduct the case. The suit has been brought by the state treasurer to force the payment of school bonds of district 22. Several years ago part of district 22 was taken in by the city and the school board as sumed the management of the school which is now known as Euclid. When the district was divided and the final settlement made the treasurer did not turn over to the city the money in the sinking fund to be used in paying the bonded indebtedness. The state treas urer sued district 22 for $15,000 and the city of Topeka was made a party to the suit. The suit will soon come up in court. President Edward Wilder, of the school board, called upon City At torney Bird and requested him to look after the case for the city. Mr. Bird said he did- not believe it part of his duties to look after the legal affairs of the school board and that besides he was too busy to conduct the case. If Mr. Bird does not conduct the case the board will have to employ a lawyer at considerable expense. Mr. Bird has an assistant in the public court, who conducts the cases brought there by the city, and an assistant in the dis trict court who looks after most of the cases brought there. What does Mr. Bird do to earn his salary? POOtt 

HEATING FACILITIES Clay School Suffering From Some One's Blunder. The school board is having trouble with the heating plant at Clay school. The two buildings at Clay school are heated by one plant. Up to the time of the present cold snap the rooms were well heated but on Monday the plant i could not furnish heat enough for both buildings. The heat was turned off the south building but the plant would hardly heat the north building. The plant was put in by Chaney & Morton on specifications furnished by T. H. Lescher, the architect. The bill for the plant was approved by the architect. When the contract was awarded the contractors appeared before the board and claimed that the plant as called for would not heat the buildings. Mr. Lescher said the radiation was suffi cient and upon his assurance that the plant was large enough to heat the buildings the board ordered the plant put in according to the specifications. At the board meeting last night Chaney & Morton presented a bill of $250 for the final settlement on the original contract of $l.StJ0. The board deferred payment until the matter can be investigated.
