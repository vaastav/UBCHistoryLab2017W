B. Clark, of Jamestown, N. Y., in visiting in town, looking un usually well. Tracy, the murder of his cousin and sweetheart, will hang at Smcth port, McKean Co., to-morrow. Our venerable Postmaster is kept busy these days trying to keep even with the "wart-bog" on postage. Mr. M. Ulrich, representing Lud wig Mayer, of Oil City, stopped in town a few hours last Wednesday. Hunters will take notice that but a dozen days yet remain of tho deer season, and govern themselves accord ingly. The young folks, and some not so young as they used to be, had a very pleasant party at Partridge's Hall Thanksgiving evening. , Thanksgiving passed off in this place without a "squawk" from either chicken or turkey that wo could learn. While some had fowl ethers were fowl less, and all gave thanks accord ingly. Leander Berlin, a young man of Whig Hill, cut his left foot quite se verely oVe day last week, while scoring timber. Our informant states that all of the toes were nearly eevered from the foot. Mr. Einstein returned last Satur day, having gathered together nearly all of his "stove-up" lumber and run it to Pittsburgh. His loss was uot as great as at first reported. Go and ask Morris "vat ho Sinks of the lumber bissness." Mr9. W. A., Greaves, and Mrs, Anna Lcepcr, sister of Mr. Greaves, of Warren, Ta., who have been visi ting with the family of E. L. Davis, Eq., returned home on Saturday Miss Maude Davis accompanies them for a few weeks' visit. Albert George and John Irvine of Burnett Two., who havo been con fined" in our jail frr the ast five weeks on a charge of disturbing a meeting, were yesterday taken out and discharged from further custody on a writ of habeas corjms issued by Associ ate Judge Dale. Mrs. II. Shoemaker, accompanied bv her three children and Miss Nora Huliugs departed for Atchison, Kan sas, on Monday. Mr. Shoemaker has been at that place for several mouths, and we understand has been doing well. We wish them all happiness and prosperity. Jake Stitzinger, of the Mealy Set dement, claims to have beaten our deer Kory, ot last. week, lie and a companion wero out hunting, when two very nice deer came within ten feet of them. They both shot but neither one took effect. That beats it, sure. Derickson & Co.'s new mill at Hunter's Station steamed up yesterday morning. The boys in the woods have a large number of bolts ahead aud Mill probably keep this mill stocked all winter. Mr. II. E. Moody has a job of cutting bolts, which be is rush ing through lively with tho help of several men. Mrs. Dean, of Whig Hill, widow of the lato Geo. W. Dean, culled upon us yesterday, and -settled her sub scription. She said it was one of Mr Dean's last requests that the Repub lican be paid up promptly, and that that ft as her mission to our saucum May the live and keep her health many years to enjoy reading it. Several parties of hunters from the big woods passed through town last week on their way home, generally 6peaking, empty-handed. One party had with it a horn, aud while passing through the Btreets discoursed some very nice strains. They were pre pared to "blow their own horn," and hud to do it, too. Quito a number of deer passed in their checks last week. Ad. Shriver killed one; Geo. and Theo. Huddle son, three in one day ; Daniel Black three two at one shot, tome more wero killed, hut we could not learn who the lucky chaps were who slew them. All these, except Blacks, were killed within a radius of five or six tnilcs of Tionesta. Mr. Diflgman received his new 3-barrol breech-loading Baker gun ycBterday. It has two shot barrels, with rifle barrel underneath, the latter of which shoots the ordinary Winchester cartridge ; has a very handsome walnut- pistol grip stock, and altogether is the finest. g" n town, and Mr. D. feels as happy over it as a boy with a pair of new red-top boots. Hope he'll initiate it on a ven ison and not forget the printers. Mrs. White, well known to our older class of citizens as the widow of the late Judge Wm. White, a former citizen of this county, who removed to Kansas several years ago, is at present visiting her relatives and old acquaint ances in this neighborhood. She is said to be still hale and hearty, with very little change In her appearance. Mrs. White is a sister of Mrs. C. F. Gillespie and Mrs. A. B. Root, and of Adam and Henry Zuendel, all old resi dents of our county. President Hayes' third annual message to Congress, which met on Monday, will be found in Supplement form in to-days paper. We have been at a good deal of expense in giv ing this interesting document to our readers in this form, both as to prid ing and additional postage, and we hope they will appreciate our efforts in this particular. It is an instrument which every voter and tax payer should read, as therein are laid down the views of the President regarding the administration of National affairs, and there is no point of general or particular interest to the government but what is touched upon. It might bo well to further remark that it is no quack medicine circular. Mr. N. S. Foreman met with quite a severe and painful accident on Friday last. He, in company with Mr. J. S. Henderson, of East Hickory, has a job of putting in logs near that place, and while he was engaged ar ranging some on the "skid way," his leg was caught, and the outside bone of his left leg was broken about three inches above the nnklo. Ihe fracture was reduced by Dr. Blaiue, and Mr. Foreman was brought home on Satur day evening. He received a wound in the same leg in tho army, since which time it has b,een stiff; lad it not been for this he would probably have heen able to escape tliU injury. He is doing well, aud will be able to be out in a couple of weeks. The "Wait-Hog" insists that because we have heretofore folded up supplements in our paper, we shouldn't find fault at him for doing likewise. We wish to remark that there is a vast difference in these cases: We have frequently folded supplements in our paper, but thoy were made up of choice reading matter, and went in as "Supp'eraents," which every publisher has a right to do, provided he pays the postage, and the postmasters books will show that we have complied with the law in every instance. We got no return from them, but did it wholly for the benefit of our readers. We never enclosed a quack mediciue cir cular in our paper for any purpose; not even to defraud the government out of postage, and until we do, we shall continue to find fault with others for doing so. In order to get the benefit of this law, a supplement must be part aud parcel of the paper, and contain a certain amount of general reading matter. But the bitterest and most heart-rending wail is jvheie be 6ays we "try to injure his professional reputation." S u f-f-e-r-i-n-g Invalids! Think of it ! Trying to injure v'oburu's professional reputation ! Why you nearly take our breath away! Now, we have frequently heard of persons trying to spoil rotten egg9, but this is the first instance, to our knowledge, of anybody trying to injure Coburn's professional reputation. Really; didn't you intend that for a joke f Business at the Recorder's Office. Instruments recorded for tho week ending Dec. 2, 1879 : Deed, Daniel Black, Treasurer, to Samuel D.

From tho Derrick's remarks on the President's Message, we cull the fol lowing: "The message of president Hayes, submitted to Congress yester day and laid before our readers hours before those bodies received it, is by far the ablest effort of his pen. As usual, it is verbose and drawn out to an unnecessary length, but each topic is carefully analyzed and treated with care. The opening portion is devoted o finance, which subject is exhaustively elaborated but does uot present any new features, being but a repetition of the report of the secretary of the treasury. Llr. Hayes handles the Mormons without gloves, and recom mends heroic treatment in their case by withdrawing their rights of citizen ship unless they abandon polygamy. On Indian affairs the president comes out strongly and with some very good suggestions. He takes hold to that difficult subject without fear. On the whole, it is a fiua paper but would bo vastly improved by boiling down." School Reports.

It seems your correspondents have somewhat slighted this locality lately ; nevertheless, we move, live and have our saur kraut, murphies and "sassage" comfortably regular. Any person desiring a mess of ven isou, jerked, roasted, boiled or other wise, would do well to call ou Mr Burhen he having secured fivo of the beauties during the last snow. Mr. John Hunter, on visiting his trap one day last week, found that Master Bruin, age 1 year had taken possession without leave or li cense. He ousted Sir Bruin with the ceremonies becoming such occasious. The schools of our township are all in operation, and we believe judging from our knowledge of the selection of teachers by our very efficient school board are doing good work. Mr. Daniel Andrews has just finished his last road job for thin season, viz.: The making ofa piece of new road, crossing Ross Run, just below the old mill, doing away with the old bridge which was a pain in the side to all the nativesand erecting a good, substantial one in its place. Thanksgiving be'ng over our tur keys have assumed a more cheerful aspects than bad been their want for a few days previous. But we suppose they do not realize that Christmas is looming up in the not distant future. Alas! delicious tidbit, we ar feeling for, but have not touched, tasted, nor handled thee as yet. Rev. Mr. Weikel admiuisters to our spiritual wauts, once every two weeks, at Heath School House. Now and Then. Star P. O., Nov. 29, '79. Our Next Instituie. The next session of the Forest County Teachers' Institute will assem ble in Tionesta, - Dec. 15, 1879, and will remain in session until the Friday following. The prospects are very favorable for a good attcudauce and interesting and instructive exercises. Supt. Geo. R. Dixon of Elk county, who was with us last year, aud who gave such general satisfaction, has, at the solicitation of a number of teachers, been re-engaged, and will give in etruction at each session on such sub jects as may be deemed advisable, or as the teachers may desire. Prof. A. G. Langley, of the Edia boro Normal School, will be with us the first part of the week ; and Supt. A. J. Davis, of Clarion Co., will be present from Wednesday to the close of the Institute. We have the condi tional promise of other prominent ed ucators to be present, and lroru present indications we think our ap proaching Institute will be ono of uue- qualed interest and profit. We there fore earnestly invite and solicit the ' attendance of every teacher in the County ; also of all who expect to teach next year. We cordially invite all friends of education throughout the County to be .present and unite with us in making this the most successful institute ever held in the County. We have, at the present writing, but partially completed our arrange ments, and in consequence cannot pre sent the programme in full this week, but it will appear in the next issue. H. S.
