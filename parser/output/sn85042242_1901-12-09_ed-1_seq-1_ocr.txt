Our market opened %c lower and on very heavy selling the market became weak and sold l^jc below Saiburdaiy's high point. There has been some rainfall in the winter wheat belt and this was what caused the selling. The selling has been mostly by local traders though and the country holds on. The vis­ ible shows an increase of only a little over two million bushels "Which has served to help the market. Wheart recovered some of the early loss and sold up to 7814 for May but another selling movement set in and it was knocked down, to TTOc at which point some suport was given the market and ^prices stiffened up considerably. This decline in wheat is but natural and we look for another boom and think it is a purchase on any recessions for good stiff profit During the last hour •wheat made up the loss of the early trading and gained l.^c over the open­ ing selling at 79%c. Coorn has been weak also, selling off l%c from Saturday on heavy selling. At the low point some buying orders •came in and/the price worked up %c where it held steady, then sold up lc, closing a trifle lower than yesterday. Oats have shared the weakness of wheat and corn and sold off l%c. Around 46c there -was some good buy­ ing and the market became strong and took a shoot up. Provisions were some lower on early realizing, but a decided strong under­ tone developed and- May pork sold 10c higher than yesterday in sympathy with the strength shown in the last liour in coarse grains. FINANCIAL SUMMARY. New York, Dec. 9.—The stock mar, keffc was weak today. Money rates were marked to 7 per cent in the early trading and stock values suffered sharply. Enormous liquidation fol­ lowed calling off loans. Later the money rate eased off and a more cheer­ ful feeling-followted, stocks advancing all through the list. Copper shares were well bought and it begins to look as if the liquidation in this class of securities was over. We do not ex­ pect much bulge in the stock market until after January 1st CLESWS' WEEKLY LETTER. New York, Dec. 8.—The situation in some respects is very remarkable. Never before were stocks so highly concentrated and the steadying power resulting from this process is*'highly significant Apparently the powers In control -are able to hold the market impregnable against all ordinary as­ saults and white this situation lasts judgment must be directed according ly.§ ,Aft theeame time stocks are being slowly scattefled, and the large sums off monies seeking investment may en­ able the market leaders to successfully lighten their burden if prosperity con­ tinues sufficiently long as some axe bold enough to believe it will. But the business situation is spotty. Great activity is apparent in the iron trade where the physical revolution in rail -t road standards is causing an abnormal demand for iron. There is also great prosperity in the coal trade, and an a \,-X tive demand at profitable prices *or Tnany articles off food and clothing. Prices tor these are the highest In ten years, and people are spending: vastly more on luxuries and commodities ap­ pealing to aeethetic tastea than usual. Elconamy is the exception and extrava ganoe thefule, and how long this will continue no one knows. There arei signs off reaction which only- theblind will not see,-andtheydemand caution. We will soon begin to visibly pee the effect off the com crop failure and the consequent loss off freight tolhuea traversing' th» com belt. As a remit •prices of cattle feed have risen abnor­ mally. Another blow is th* shrink- c°"t°"wmMtek' gay vetrsely affect important sections of ttye south. High prices and scarcity are not conducive to continuous prosperity in spite off a delusion to the contrary which some people entertain. Still another unfavorable feature has been the declines in our exports, which, though perhaps not permanent, indi­ cate a cessation of the excessive trade balances which have been a fruitful source off selfcongratulaition. Our exports of copper declined about $23, 000,000 during the first ten months of 1901 and our exports off iron manu­ factures showed a loss of $24,000,000 in the same fferiod. Such factors as these cannot be ignored. They are signs off oui" being at or near the top, and common prudence dictates caution in transactions entering into the fu­ ture. A HEARTY.LAUGH. The Wonderful Effects I Has Upon tbe Human System. "Laugh and grow fat" is a saying as old as the hills. It has long been an accepted fact that humor is a promoter of digestion and merry words the dead­ liest foes of disease. Dr. J. E. Kenne­ dy, editor of the Iowa Health Bulletin, writes an interesting article on the val­ ue of laughter, in which he shows it is not only a remedial agent, but is also a valuable preventive against a host of diseases. The physical effects of laugh­ ter are thus put down by Dr. Kennedy: Laughter increases the blood circula­ tion. It enlarges the heart It expands the lungs. It jiggers the diaphragm. It promotes the dioculation of the spleen. In other words, laughter stirs up tin. vital regions of the body, gives them healthful exercise and produces a men­ tal exhilaration which acts upon the system much as a brisk walk in a crisp atmosphere does upon the appetite. As strong allies to laughter Dr. Kennedy gives the following directions for men­ tal peace of mind: Beware of theologians who have no sense of mirth. They are not altogeth­ er human. Keep your chin up. Don't take your troubles to bed witt you. Hang them on a chair with your trousers or drop them in a glass of wa­ ter with your teeth. Dr. Kennedy has surely hit the nail on the head. If his prescription and advice are followed, his own bills will be decidedly cut down. Burlington Hawkeye. LURED BY SCENT. Rats Caught In Numbers by an In­ genious Means. Rats are very susceptible to the odor of certain drugs, and any ordinary trap set in their haunts is likely to be suc­ cessful if dressed with these scents, the attraction of which, rat catchers affirm, they cannot resist. An example is: Powdered assafetida, eight grains oil of rhodium, two drams oil of aniseed, one dram oil of lavender, one-half dram. Shake together in a bottle and use a very small quantity to dress the bait. To catch rats, cover a common barrel with stiff, stout paper, tying the edge round the barrel. Place aboard so that the rats may have easy access to the top. Sprinkle cheese parings or other food for the rats on the paper for sev­ eral days until they begin to tjiink that they have a right to their daily rations from this source. Then place in the bottom of the barrel a piece of rock about six or seven inches high, filling with water until only enough of it projects above the water for one rat to jlodge upon. Now replace the paper, first cutting a cross in the middle, and the first rat that comes on the barrel top goes through into the water and climbs on the rock. The paper comes back to its original position, and the second rat I follows the first Then begins a fight for the possession of the dry place on the stone, the noise of which attracts the othere, who share the same fate.— Baltimore American. The Blcetrlo Uglit The electric light was exhibited for the first time in the United States at the Centennial exposition, but those who saw it were skeptical regarding the possibili­ ty of using it upon any scale that would be of practical benefit to mankind. tyhiie. arc lighting was produced upon a commercial scale in 1877, the real ills' tory of the art as regards its modern as pects dates from the opening of the Pearl street station in New York city by Thom­ as A. Edison "on Sept. 4, 1882 in which the Edison incandescent lamp was used. In nineteen years this industry has grown to where the investment in electric light' ing plants in the United States alone now readies the enormous sum of $700,000, 0p0, according to a very careful tabula* tion made by The Electrical Review of New York. This extraordinary achievement repre­ sents a struggle with powerful and well organised competition of a long estab­ lished industry—-that of gas illumination. It made its way against bitter opposition, against corrupt councils and the difficul­ ties and failures incident to overcapltal leation to where lt is now, one of the sol* Id, certain and remunerative Industrie* ottheeoantry. a •.'• :-f\ Attorneys Appear before the Supreme Court today to Argue Habeas Corpus for West Attorney John Cochrane Appears for the Defendant and States Attorney Opposes. Facts in the Case Presented by Both Sides to Sustain Contentions Pro and Con. In the supreme court today is being argued an application for a writ of ha­ beas corpus for the release of W. E. West, who shot and killed Frank March at Grand Forks, on bail. The application is being argued by J. M. Cochrane of the firm of Cochrane & Corliss for West, and is being resisted by States Attorney Wineman, who ap­ pears for the staite. The particulars of this application are familiar to readers from the proceedings had at Grand Forks, where the application for bail was made before Judge Fisk, who refused to admit West to bail. West's attorneys claim that the case is such a one as should entitle the'de­ fendant to be admitted to reasonable bail. His attorneys claim that the elieimenit of self defense enters into the crime committed, and that there was a lack off premeditation on the part of West in shooting March, who, they claim, was the aggressor in the unfor­ tunate affair which resulted in his death. The state does not admit the contentions off the defense, and claims that West had thorough knowledge off what he was doing at the time he fired the shot, and that he was at that par­ ticular time, not in danger off violence, as the men had been separated. The case will be taken under advise­ ment by the count ASKS ANOTHER JUDGE J. C. CLARK, INDICTED BY THE GRAND JURY AT MANDAN, ASKS FOR ANOTHER JUDGE. At the term of court at M«-nrian Sat­ urday, J. C. Clark, the former con­ stable, was arraigned on a charge of libel, and filed an affidavit asking for another judge to hear his case. F. H. Register is his attorney. It is likely that an application will be made for a change off venue from Morton county for the hearing of the case. "SHE BURNS GREEN." The Discovery «f Borax In Death Valley by Aaron Winters. The greatest discovery of borax in the United States was made in the ter­ ribly hot region known as Death val­ ley and in a most romantic way. The Chicago Record tells the story. In 1880 Aaron Winters lived with his wife, Rosie, in a gulch known as Ash Meadows, not far from the month of Death valley. He was so fond of his wife that he would not allow her to be long absent from him, although their little hut on the side of the moun­ tain was a hundred miles from the nearest neighbor, in a wild, rugged forsaken country. One day a desert tramp came along and spent the night at the Winters home. He told the hunter about the borax deposits of Nevada. When be went away. Winters thought that he had seen deposits of the same kind on his explorations into Death valley. Accordingly he and his wife went to­ gether to make the search, having pre­ viously provided themselves with cer­ tain test chemicals, which when com­ bined with borax anil ignited would produce a green flaftie- Having procured a piece of the sub sl&nce which he believed to be borax. Winters and his.wife waited for night­ fall to make the test. How would It burn? For years they had lived like Piutes on the desert entirely .without luxuries and often wanting for the very necessi­ ties of life. Would the match change all that? Winters held the blaze to the sub­ stance with *a trembling hand, then shouted at the top of his voice: "She burns green, Rosiel We're rich! We're rich!" They had found' borax. The mine was sold' for $20,000, and Winters took his Rosie to a ranch in Nevada. -a— —, V,. Tbe Birthplace.

Chicago, Dec. 9.—A Record-Herald dispsibch from Washington says An­ drew Carnegie will give then millions of dollars to the cause of university ex­ tension in the. United States. Mr. Carnegie was here a few days ago and took luncheon with President Roose­ velt. when the details off the plan were fully discussed. Mr. Roosevelt has thought it best to create a national board to handle the matter and Presi­ dent Roosevelt will probably nominate such a board. VAN

Vol it is a familiar boast of English peo­ ple that we are above all others a washing nation. Soap and water is a standing dish in Great Britain, but so little were we disposed to credit the habitual cleanliness of foreigners that a piece of soap in the valise was till re­ cently the habitual companion of an Englishman on his travels. All kinds of theories have been raised to account for this national tendency to ablution, and most diverse qualities have been attributed to its possession. The familiarity of islanders with wa­ ter and the use of it occasioned by the national custom that led the ancient Britons to paint their bodies are sol­ emnly urged as the foundation of the English proneness to washing, and the fresh complexions and smooth skins of young Englishmen are held to replace the more dusky and hirsute counte­ nances of the Latin races because of their closer and more frequent ac­ quaintance with the articles of the washstand. It is quite obvious that even in Eng­ land there are people who wash too little. It is not so generally recognized that some people wash too much. The skin is not well adapted to frequent applications of water accompanied by even the least irritating of soaps. A tendency arises to maceration of the superficial part of the epidermis, which is too frequently removed and occa­ sions probably too rapid a proliferation of the cells of the Malpighian layer. There is no doubt that many cases of roughness of the skin of the face come from the frequent applications of wa­ ter. It is a good thing to rub the face with a soft, clean, dry towel two or three times a day. If, in addition, wa tec is used in the morning and at night, the skin will be kept in -a sounder, smoother and healthier state than if. as is often the case, soap and water are Used three or four times a day. Men are not often offenders in this respect, most men sparing little time for the refinements of the toilet. ^Vom en and children, whose skins are the most easily affected by superfluous ab­ lution, are the very persons in whom such excess is too common. They should be taught that there are dry methods of cleanliness as well as wet ones.—Lancet A
