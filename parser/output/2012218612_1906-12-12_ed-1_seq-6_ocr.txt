LETTE3 lay F The fire blazed and crackled in the grate, the crimson curtains were closely drawn, and, comfortably en sconced in the most inviting of easy chairs, Judge Lindsey sat ruefully contemplating a huge pile of un opened letters that lay on the table before him. Letters there were of all sorts and sizes-letters in big envelopes, busi ness letters-from ladies, who, trust ing in the well known liberality of the judge, ventured to appeal to him in behalf of some pet missionary so ciety-from young ladies who had been robbed by cruel guardians from young men in need of money to start themselves in business-all mingled in one shapeless mass, loom ing up steenly, as if to szare him out of countenance should he attempt to sink back in hisiuxurioas chair and crjoy the_6,ce far niente, spoiling the f.,*er of his cigar, until with a pfevish "pshaw!" he, dr.shed it into the grate, then paused a. moment, as if to summon resolution, and, plung ing in his hand to the very bottom of the pile, drew forth a dainty little billet which he -enet and forthwith began to read. It ran as follows: "Judge Lindsey-This is strictly a business let'er and conndential. But .irst, as we have no mutual acquaint ance to perform the du::y, I must in troduce myself. I am twenty years of age, neliher pretty nor clever, but I have a heart to appreciate honest integrity of character, as exemnified in yourself when you refused the bribe of Mr. Burnette, truly a fortune in itself, rather than sally your soul by assisting to defraul a widow of the inheritance willed to her by a be loved husband. And I am constrained to write this to tell you how much I admire, and even love-not the pol ished gentleman on whose escutcheon rests no stain-but him who in an age of unparalleled corruption, holds fast his integrity, unmoved by the * clamor of friends or the promptings of interest. "I was losing faith in all mankind. You have restored it, and I, thank * you. I implore you to believe that this is no impertinent jest, but that I am writing earnestly and from my heart. . "In all probability we shall never mneet on earth. Indeed, I could scarcely wish it, for what could you think of me, save that I was bold and uinmaidenly? But wherever you may be, like guardian angels shall go with you, the prayers of, "ALTHEA." *The event here recorded transpired soon after the trial of the famous Burnette will case, where the family * of the deceased contested the will of their son, the parents protesting against allowing the whole property to revert to the young widow, on the ground that the deceased had died childless, together with the fact that the wife had brought no dower to her husband, Mrs. Burnette having been a poor girl at the time of her mar riage. Judge Lindsey had been the de ceased millionaire's legal adviser In the management of his estate, and had assisted in framing the will, the event having occurred when the son, Henry Burnette, was in sound and vigorous health, some three years prior to his death. And it was the lawyer's intimate knowledge of his son's affairs that led the elder Mr. Burnette to appeal to him to take charge of the case, offering Judge Lindsey a heavy bribe in order to in duce him to do so, and' a share also in his son's estate, should he succeed in winning the case. But Judge Lind sey had re.iected the bribe with scorn, and refused to act in direct opposi tion to the dictates of his own heart. And it was this act in his life to which the writer referred in the ex traordinary letter the .judge now held. in his hand. If some artist, engaged in a grand allegorical painting, and seeking'for a personification of aston ishment, could have transferred to canvas the expression of Judge Lind sey's face as he finished reading the 'dainty missive, his fortune had infal libly been made. Was ever a bach elor of six-and-forty so addressed be fore?-and it was a lady-the per fumed paper and delicate chirography left no doubt of that-young and fair, or she would not have denied it. The heart of the dignified lawyer beat as rapidly as that of a maiden in her teens while he began to ex perience a curious glow in the region of that organ, and a tingling sensa tion in his veins as if the blood flowed freer and faster, when his eye acci dentally fell upon one of those obtru sive communications addressed to him in a masculine hand, and he awoke from his dream. What had he to do with love--that namby-pamby passion, fit only for beardless you.ths and romantic schoot girls? Was he, a man of the world, to be disturbed by an anonymous let ter? He would have none of it, and would thrust the whole thing from his mind. He would throw the letter into the grate-no, he would keep it as a curiosity; and so the dainty bil let was locked in his desk, and the lawyer resumed his duties. From this houar a marked change came over Judge Lindsey's whole life. Wherever he went, at home or abroad, a presence, invisible to all but himself, accompanied him; a fair. HEART IE POLLOCx.

He who had heretofore been care- c less about his dress, now surprised I his tailor with an order for a fash ionable suit of clothes; and instead of I lighting his cigar, as was his custom C -the crusty bachelor!-with invita- t tions to Mrs. Jones' soiree dansante, r and Mrs. Smith's ball, accepted them, was introduced to various young I ladies of all sizes and complexions, I took them into supper,plunged boldly into the melee of the table to secure C them creams and chicken salad, till 2 the report actually gained credence s that Judge Lindsey had become one of the first "ladies' men" in the city; a whereas, if the truth must be told, 1 be was only searching for that foolish little Althea. The winter passed; still he had not Cound the ideal of his dreams. But de was not disheartened,as one might aturally have supposed; on the con trary, as the weeks passed, he grew more hopeful and sanguine in his be lif that at some unexpected mo ment he should meet the one whose letter had made so deep an im-pres sion on his mind. And so it proved, for on a bright afternoon in May, when sauntering in the park, his at tention was suddenly arrest'ed by the a ppearance of two ladies walking in front of him. From her tall form and stately bearing he recognized in the elder lady a former friend. But it was uponi the graceful, petite formof the one beside her that his gaze be- 2 caine riveted, and, prompted by some sudden impulse, he hastened his steps and was soon quite near them. And ' here one of the ladies accidentally dropped her pocket handkerchief, when a sudden puff of wirni sent it futtering almost at Judge Lindsey's I feet. Both ladies halted, evidently in- C ent on securing the prize. "Permit me, madam," said Judge 1 Lindsey, instantaneously stooping and t picking it up. C But on lifting it daintily in his fngers, what was his astonishment on beholding in a corner of the deli- E ate cambric the talismanic name, f Atheal 'C And here-introduced to him as s Wiss Westbrook-stood his ideal with t blue, haunting eyes, rosy mouth, t snowy cheek, just tinged with a faint C blush, with sloping shoulders, arch- d Ing neck and queenly air-all as he had dreamed. As these thoughts passed through his brain with the rapidity of light- ~ ning, he glanced up in time to .git- f ness the sudden start, the C.eep blush, ~ Lhe halt-repressed exclamation at the I! tterance of his name, and assurance E became doubly sure.I Presently, under pretense of exam [ning some plant or chrub, he drew 5 the elder lady a little one side and, in a low tone, said:c "Mrs. Van Dorn, I am most anxious a to extend my acquaintance with your :ousin, Miss Westbrook, and can you manage It for me without her knowl- I edge of the fact?" "Nothing is easier," she began. I "Mrs. Van Dorn, you are an angel," t he nterrupted, eagerly. t "No doubt," said the lady, with at light laugh. "But as I was about to C remark, if you will take a seat in my C carriage I will invite you to dine 1] with us." And so It was settled. ~t Not suspecting that her handker.- ' chief had betrayed her, Miss West- d brook was in mortal dread lest some a accident might reveal to him the knowledge.that she was the author of the letter that had been written I six months before. But as Judge ~ Lindsey made no reference to the i past, she trusted that the circum- ~ stance had been blotted from his s mind.c After dinner was over, Judge Lind- a sey begged the young lady to favor r him with some music, and she com- E plying, he conducted her to the piano. r Her playing was at first nervous and C unequal, but as the beauties of the I theme 'gradually developed, hers cheeks flushed, her rr3y lips parted, ' a soft fire burned in her eyes, and I then flashed forth golden notes, 3 choral harmonies, and soft, dying 1 melodies. "Charming! exquisite:" burst from E the lips of her enraptured auditor. "Is it not"" she said, simply. "When I play that I always fancy myself in some dim forest, and I think I hear the wind sighing amid i the pines, and the birds calling from s their green recesses." "Miss Westbrook," he returned, c gently, "I know not which most to 1 praise, your admirable genius, s or-"d "Pray don't compliment me-I do not deserve praise; music for me is a c pleasure. a recreation, a delight." t "If this lovely, artless child be not Althea" he said to himself, "I do not i cae to find1 her," S0UTHERN * ___) 7 ICS Of !NTER EST T7 7 R PLAA Dairyin. in the South.

Now let us consider the dairy cow for a moment and see if -we can do without her. Milk is the natural food for man and all animals. The first nourishment the new born babe takes is milk, and it is the same .with the new born calf, ih fact, this is the first food of all animals. Con sider for a moment what a very small percentage could be raised if it were not for mill:. Then, again, take. for instance, the sick, and milk is one of the most nourishing die-, that are used in the sick room. As I see it the dairy cow should occupy one of the first places on the farm. Outside of her importance, which I have already spoken of, let us see if It cannot be made profit able. One of the great beauties of the dairy cow is she does not run on a credit system. She settles her ac counts every twenty-four hours. and if properly handled will pay you a nice dividend on the money paid for her. I know of no investment that will pay as ha.ndsome a profit as a dairy cow. She will pay for herself andi all expenses in twelve months. Let us investig:te this and see iF it is not true. The average grade Jersey cow will cost you S40. She will give 3500 pounds of milk in twlve months, which is a low esti mrte. This is about 440 gallons o. milk. This milk at a low estimate can be sold at twenty cents per gal lon. Now every one knows this is ten cents below the average price paid in our towns and cities. but we mnst mane cu: estimates on a con servative basis. At twenty cents per gailon 440 gallons of mil: will bring SSS; the cost of the cow is S10, cos' of f-ed $^0, which rMakes the to'a. os: for cow and feed $70. Now we have t e cost o' cow. The 440 gal ons of mil: sells for SS, the man ure for $12. the calf S5, total grosl ircone of the co w ,105. Deduct the cost of cow and feed. $70, and -ou will have 'S-> "ef: to her credit. T want to ask you if you can make an investment of $700, which would be the cost of a herd of ten cQws and their feed. and enter any other busi ness and in twelve months make such a dividend on your investment. The quickest road to a dollar is through a dairy cow. Her cost, as well as her expenses for twelve months, you still have a profit of fifty per cent. on your investment. One man can milk, feed and take care of ten head. The great beauty In dairy farmmna is that it pays both .ways. Any dairy farmer can double the production ol his farm in ten years. This withi: itself would be a handsome profit. I have tr-ied to show you what ,seful and necessary animal the dairy cow is, and that she can bs made profitabie, and i can say to you Ithat there is no place on the globe e-e dairying can be made as prof itable as in this Southlar.d of ours. Why? Beeause we aav.e more natur al advantages than in other countries which I have investigated. T, have met dairymen from all over these United States, and being intere.sted in dairying have~ discussed the sub ject fully with them, both as to feeds and the price obtai,ned for their pro duct. Why, gentlemen. we get twice as much for our milk ahd cream as the Northern and Western dairymet get for theirs. There is no place or the globe that so many varieties oi forage crops can be raised in one season as in the South. Why, we can raise two crops on our land e year-besides, we can grow many more varieties of grazing grasse! than the Northern and Western sec tions, and it is more nutritious, as i1 as a longer season in which to gro~ and mature. It is not so woody a The Department of Agriculture ai Washington sees what a great indus try the South has lying at her doo: undeveloped, and the Governmeni~ has appropriated 320,000 to help de velop dairying in the South.

It is to be feared that many pro fessed Christians read John 3. 16 thus: "For God so loved the Anaglo-Saxons." But the missionary enterprise stands for the opposite. Its watch word is: "The World for Christ." Anything short of this is unworthy the name of Christian, for Christ died for "the world." His last command, given just before he left the Judean mountain top, to be seen no more, was: "Go ye into the world and preach the gospel to every creature." There fore, we must go or send, or be re creant to our trust. "'Ours not to reason why," but to obey. We are not to stop to consider whether or not the heathen can be saved without the gospel; nor are we to question whether missions are a success or not; or demur on any account what ever. There is the unqualified, un conditioned, naked, "GO."

It matters not that he moves to the other end of the room, Dr anywhere within the room, he will still be looking straight into that d1eadly tube and into those unrelent ing eyes. The "Go ye" of Jesus is like that, only it Is full of the urgency of a love and yearning for lost souls that stopped not at death itself. Let the church shirk the obligation to go, and her light will go out. The missionary spirit is her light.

Gentle:nen, this kind of farming is the hi *est type of agriculture. I know there are men sitting in this audience who are ready to say dairy ing and stock raising cannot be made profitable in the South. Thirty years ago was the South a cotton manufacturing country? No. I a man had predicted then that twenty-five years from then would see South Carolin'a one of the lead ing cotton manufacturing States in the country, there were people who would have said that man is crazy. Now, gentlemen, why is South Car olina one of the leading cotton man ufacturing States? Because she has put brains and capital into the in dustry and because she has more natural advantages than the New England States. To-day the cotton mills of the South are paying the largest dividends of any other State. I- hope that I may live to see the day come when' our people will quit say ing that we cannot raise as fine cat tle, hogs, sheep and horses in South Carolina as can be raised in Ken tucky or the Northern States, for I teii you it is not true, for history tells us that the South has produced as brilliant men as any country and if it is true of men, why cannct it be the same with producing fine ani mais. The fault is not in the con ditions around you, but in your own selves. I hope to see our own men ele vated above a cotton patch, a mule a.nd a free negro. Gentlemen, this kind of farming, I have been speak ing about, a free negro cannot do; but he can ralse cotton and comue in competition with you and his cotton bale will bring on the market just as much as yours. In fact he has bsen pricing your cotten for the last twenty yearZ. We hear 'Far-:rs say there is no -market for dairy products. Why should a man say that, when there are at least $400,000 or.$500,000 worth of butter shippe.d into South Carolina every year and sold to our people? I tell you every dollar's worth of that butter can be raised by .the farmers of South Carolina. Now, brother farmers, we will have to change our method of farm labor and the sooner we begin it the better off we will be. How are we to do this? By diversification and rotation. The farmer who rotates his crops, improves his soil, improves his surroundings, improves himself and makes it easier for the next generation to travel life's journey. He is a race benefactor, making, as he does, this world better and better the longer he lives in it and contin ues his good deeds. The farmer who rotates his crops will feed, clothe and educate his children better than his one crop neighbor. His children will love him :,etter and he will love them better. The community will speak well of him while he lives and go into true mourning when he is gone.-Columbia State. Cotton, 'Hog, Hominy. - Colonel J. B. Killebrew, in South ern Farm Magazine, says: In the cotton growing districts of the South It is all important that the farmers should practice a diversifica tion of crops, at least to such an ex tent as to make their own breadstuffs and provisions. Hon. M. C. Butler, of South Carolina, declares that cot ton may be rais'ed at six cents per pound when the planter makes his own hog and hominy, or his bread and meat. To buy these important necessaries with the proceeds of the cotton crop will make the cost of pro ducing the cotton not less than eight cents per pound. It is a most oppor tune moment when the cotton plant ers have risen otit of the slough of despond in which they have wallowed for years to enter upon a line that will make them always independent. There is no better money crop on earth than cotton, and yet all this money may be required to supply the ordinary comforts and necessaries of life. Nothing will compensate the planter for the loss of independence. By raising his own supplies he will be able to hold his cotton for a good price. The raising of these supplies will also diminish the acreage of cot ton and so increase its price by a re duction in the size of the crop. This Is a practical problem that may be easily solved by the harmonious ac tion of the great army of cotton growers. R eflections of a Bachelor.
