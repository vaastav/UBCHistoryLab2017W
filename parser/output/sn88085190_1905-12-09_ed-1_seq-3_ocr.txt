It is obvious that if the com *ui. ion' of statistics be the limit of the \ i ral power, it is wholly ineffective to 7'nlate this form of commercial inter* 'virsc between the states, and as the in ' Hrance business has outgrown in mag iuide the possibility of adequate state division, the congress should care en v consider whether further legisla -1 "I. 1; (a be had.

The president hopes much rrom ,],,. Hague conference. Several reforms in (he army are recommended. v Applying- the Monroe Doctrine. One of the roost effective instruments for peace is the Monroe Doctrine as it has been and is being gradually develop ed by this notion and accepted by other nations. No other policy could have [', as efficient in promoting peace in the Western hemisphere and in giving to each nation thereon the chance to develop along its own lines. Li we had refused to apply the doctrine to chang ing conditions it would now be complete ly outworn, would not meet any of the needs of the present day, and indeed would probably by this time have sunk into complete oblivion. It is useful at home, and is meeting with recognition abroad because we have adapted our aplication of it to meet the growing and changing needs of the hemisphere. * • That our rights and interests are deep ly concerned in the maintenance of the (i.xirine is so clear as hardly to need argument This is especially true In view of the construction of the Panama canal. As a mere mater of self-defense we must exercise a close watch over the approaches to this canal; and this means that we must be thoroughly alive to our interests in the Carribean sea. ■ ; There are certain essential points which must never be forgotten as re gards the Monroe Doctrine. In the first place we must as a notion make it evi dent that we do not intend to treat it in any shape or way as an excuse for ascrandizement on our part at the ex pense of the republics to the south. We must recognize the fact that in some .South American countries there has been much suspicion lest we should interpret the Monroe Doctrine as in some way in imical to their interests, and we must try to convince all the other nations of this continent once and for all that no just and orderly government has any ling to fear from us. There are cer i.iii!.-publics to the south of us which have already reached such a point of stability, order, and prosperity that they themselves, though as yet hardly con s' nus, are among the guarantors of this Doctrine. These republics :we now meet not only on a basis ef entire equal ity, but in a spirit of frank and respect lul friendship, which we hope is mutual. I; all of the republics to the south of us will only grow as those to which I allude have already grown, all need for us to be the especial champions of the trine will disappear, for no stable p..] growing American republic wishes to see some great non-American military power acquire terirtory in its neighbor hood. All that this country desires is I that the other republics on : this ; conti i.ent shall be happy and prosperous; and they cannot be happy and prosperous un less they maintain order within . their j imuntlaires and behave with a just re gard for their obligations toward out siders. It must be understood that • under no circumstances will the United , States use the Monroe Doctrine as a cloak for territorail aggresison. We de sire peace with all the world, but per haps most of all with the other peoples of the American continent. There are of course limits to the wrongs which any self-respecting nation can endure. I: is always possible that wrong actions toward this nation, or toward citizens of this nation, in some state unable to keep order among its own people, unable to secure justice from outsiders, and un wililng to do justice to those outsiders who treat it well, may result in our hav ins to take action to protect our rights; but such action will not be taken with a view to territorial aggression, and it will be taken at all onl" with extreme reluctance and when it has become evi <if-nt that every other resource has been exhausted. • '. / ; ■!- Moreover, we must make it evident that we do not intend to permit the Mon •■■'■' Doctrine to be used by any nation on this continent as a shield to protect it irom he consequences of its own mis '■lw-da against foreign nations. If a re public to the south of us commits a tort «?ain,<t a foreign nation, such as an 'mirage against a citizen of that nation, 'lien the Monroe Doctrine does not force 'is to interfere to prevent punishment of <•■•'■ tort, save to see that the punishment doeg not assume the form of territorial occupation in any shape. * * .*- -, Chinese Immigration. - ■. -• The conditions In China are such that we entire Chinese coolie ■ class, that is, the class of Cninese laborers, : skilled ;<nd unskilled, legitimately * come under >"■*• head of undesirable imigrants to 'his country, because of their numbers, the low wages for which they work, and their low standard of living. Not only ls it to the interest of this country to Kef them out, but the Chinese authori ses do not desire that they should be admitted. At present ". their entrance is prohibited by laws - amply adequate to accomplish this purpose. : These > laws ;; lv been, are being, and will be thor oughly enforced. The violations ;of them ; 're so few in number as to be infinitesi mal and can be entirely disregarded. /here is no serious proposal to alter the mmiKration law as regards the Chinese aborer, skilled or unskilled, and U there ls no excuse for any ■ man ■ feeling^ or feting to feel the slightest alarm ;on the subject. . ■ s'■ , f«t in the effort rto ■ carry > out the '."•; of excluding Chinese: laborers, hinese coolies, grave injustice and "r'*ns have been done by this nation to *ne people of China, and therefore ulti mately to this nationv itself. Chinese * luuents. business and professional I men ? r all kinds—not E only merchants, <but inkers, doctors, | manufacturers, M pro- J^sors, travelers,: and the like— should l>e- encouraged to come here and treated 5" 1 precisely the same footing - that %we l'eat students, business £ men, travelers, «nd the like of other nations.

We can "°t ask the Chinese to do to us what we j*re unwilling to do to them if our labor '"& men threatened to come into H their i n such numbers .as to jeopardise me well-being of the Chinese population; ??A as these were the conditions with *hich Chinese immigration actually fought this,• people face to face, we "*? and have a perfect right, while the T -ninese government in no way contests, " act as we have acted sin the matter of J^ncting coolie immigration.

But we must treat the Chinese student, traveler and business ; man in t a spirit '?of the broadest Justice i and ) courtesy £if\ we ex pect similar treatment atol be % accorded to our own people of similar rank who go ,to ; China.

I earnestly advocate the adoption of legislation which will explicitly confer American citizenship on all citizens of Porto Rict>. I earnestly ask that Alaska be given an elective delegate. Some person should be chosen who can speak with authority of the needs of the territory. The gov ernment should aid in the construction of a railroad from the Gulf of Alaska to the Yukon river, ,in American tern* tory. I should prefer that the delegate was made elective, but if this is not deemed wise, then make him appointive. The natural resources of Alaska are great. Some of the chief needs of the peculiarly energetic, self-reliant, and typically American white population of Alaska were set forth in my la«t mes sage. I also earnestly ask your atten tion to the needs of the Alaskan In dians. All Indians who are competent should receive the full rights or Ameri can citizenship. It is, for instance, a gross and indefensible wrong to deny to such hard-working, decent-living In dians as the Metlakahtlas the right to obtain licenses as captains, pilots and engineers, the right to enter mining claims, and to profit by the homestead law. These particular Indians are civil ized, and are competent and entitled to •be put on the same basis with the white men about them. The Philippine Islands. The income of the Philippine govern ment has necessarily been reduced by reason of the business and agriculaural depression in the islands, and the gov ernment has been obliged to exercise great economy to cut down its expenses, to reduce salaries, and in every way to avoid a deficit. It has adopted an inter nal revenue law, imposing taxes on ci gars, cigarettes, and distilled liquors, and abolishing the old Spanish indus trial taxes. The law has not operated as smoothly as was hoped, and although its principle is undoubtedly correct, it may need amendments for the purpose* of reconciling the people to its provis ions. The income derived from it has partly made up for the reduction in customs revenue. A year from next April the first legis lative assembly for the islands will be held. On the sanity and self-restraint of this body much will depend so far as the future self-government of the is lands is concerned. The most encouraging feature of the whole situation has been the very great interest taken by the common people in education and the great increase in the number Of enrolled students in the public schools. The increase was from 300,000 to half a million pupils. The average attendance is about 70 per cent. The only limit upon the number of pu pils seems to be the capacity of the government to furnish teachers and schoolhouses. The agricultural conditions of the is lands enforce more strongly than ever the argument in favor of reducing the tariff on the products of the Philippine islands entering the United States. I earnestly recommend that the tariff now imposed by the D^ngley bill upon the products of the Philippine islands be entirely removed, except the tariff on sugar and tobacco, and that that tariff be reduced to 25 per cent of the present rates under the Dingley Act: that after July 1. 19*9, the tariff upon tobacco and sugar produced in the Philippine is lands be entirely removed, and that free trade between the islands and the United States in the products of each country then be provided for by law. Merchant Marine. To the spread of our trade in peace and the defense of our flag in war a great and prosperous merchant marine is indispensable. We should have ships of our own and seamen of our own to convey our goods to neutral markets, and in case- of need to reinforce our bat tle line. It can not but be a source of regret and uneasiness to us that the lines of communication with our sister republics of "South America should be chiefly under foreign control. It is not a good thing that American merchants and manufacturers should have to send their goods and letters to South America vie Europe if they wish security and dispatch. Even on the Pacific where our ships have held their own better than on the Atlantic, our merchant flag is now threatened through the liberal air be stowed by other governments on their I own steam lines. * • » i Panama Canal. The point which remains unsettled is the question of type, whether the canal shall be one of several Jocks above sea level, or at sea level with a single tide lock. On this point I hope to lay be fore the congress at an early day the findings of the Advisory IJoard. of American and European Engineers, that at my invitation have been considering the subject, together with the report of the commission thereon; and such com ments thereon or recommendations In reference thereto as may seem necessary. What is needed now and without delay is an appropriation by the congress to meet the current and accruing expenses of the commission. The first appropria tion of $10,000,000, out of the $135,000, --000 authorized by the Spooner act, was made three years ago. It is nearly ex hausted. There is barely enough of it remaining to carry the commission to the end of the year. Unless the con gress shall appropriate before that time all work must cease. DCriNITION Or GRArTCR. Gov. folk, of Missouri, Writes It for Standard Dictionary. Jefferson City, Mo., Deo. 4.—Got. Folk's definition of graft is to be used in the Standard dictionary. Gov. Folk received a letter from the publishers of the dictionary in New York asking permission to place his definition in that dictionary, whioh is being revised. Gov. Folk's definition of the word is as follows: "Grafter —One who preys on the people, either against the law or under the law. The boodler sells his official vote or bays official acts contrary to law. He is a grafter, bat a grafter is not necessarily a boodler. Grafting may or may not be unlawful. It is either a special privilege exercised con trary to law, or one the law itself may give." Army Officers Win Learo to took. Washington, Deo 4.—Under a new policy deoided by the war department offloers of the oommissary department are to be taught to bake bread and will be given practical instructions in cook ing. Offloew of the oommissary depart ment will accordingly be sent to the sohool of application for oavalry and field artillery at Fort Riley, Kan., for a course in the sohool for oooks and bakerr. It is expected that with the acquirement of praottoal knowledge by the offloers in the baking of bread and cooking food a great reform will be brought about in the preparation of food in the army. 

CANNBNJPEAKER HOUSE ELECTS 111 TO SUCCEED HIMSELF. John Sharp Williams Democratic Nominee, and Therefore Leader of the House—Little Besides Or ganization WIU Be Accomplished the first Week. Washington, Deo. 4.—Republican and Democratic memben of the house held their respeotire oanooses Satur day evening. The Democrats nomi nated John Sharp Williams, of Mis sissippi, for the office of speaker, and he thereby becomes leader of the mi nority on the floor of the bouse, a po sition he has held for several years. The Republicans renominated Joseph G. Gannon, of Illinois, to snooeed him self. All the other officers of the house were also renominated. Both nominees for speaker made brief speeches to their followers. Mr. Will iams outlined the legislation for which his party should work, and Mr. Gan non reviewed the history of his party, tooohing at the olose upon matters of importance likely to come up at the pres°nt session.. He also pointed out that, the Republicans having a good majority in both houses, business should proceed without delay, and that an early adjournment of congress should be possible without detriment t3 pub lio business. Washington, Deo. 4.—Congress con vened at noon and the house at onoe proceeded with the business of organi zation. Joseph G. Gannon of Illinois, was re-elected speaker, receiving the full vote of his party, the Demoorats voting for John Sharp Williams, their oauous nominee. Very little besides the organization of the house will be aooomplished the first week of the session, although it is possible that an emergenoy appropria tion for tie Panama canal may be passed the latter part of the week. Until the committees are appointed suoh a bill would have to be consid ered by unanimous consent, or under a speoial order. It will depend upon the needs of the oanal finanoes wheth er the emergeaoy appropriation will be mshed through this week or go over until the week following. It is already understood that tte rules of the last house will be adopted as soon as the members have been sworn in. The biennial lottery of seats was an interesting feature of the first day, and at its conclusion adjournment was taken. The President's Message. Tuesday will be devoted to the pres ident's message, and that pobably will olose the real business of the house for the week. Speaker Gannon has not yet completed his committees, but it is expeoted that he will be ready to an nounce them early in the session. Nothing but preliminary work will engross the attention of the senate this first week of the session. The senate is already organized, as it is a contin uous body, and besides there was a speoial session last spring, when new senators were sworn in. To Honor Late Senator Platt. Monday was a very short session, the senate adjourning out of respect to the memory of Senator Platt, of Con necticut, as soon as the neoessary for malities for the beginning of a new congress had been oonoluded. Tuesday the president's message will be received and read, and Wednesday is likely to be devoted to the introduction of bills. A short session will be held Thursday, and the senate will then adjourn until the following Monday. It is quite likely that a Republican caucus will be held Tuesday or Wed nesday for the purpose of the appoint ment of a committee to fill committee vacancies in the senate and for the se lection of a steering committee for the sesssion. It is expected that commit tee vacancies will be filled very early in the session. One notioeable feature was the ab sence of flowers, whioh heretofore have been common to both oh ambers. On opening days the display has been so great that the exhibition alone would have been sufficient alone to draw great crowds, and the absenoe of floral trib utes, due to a resolution adopted unan imously by the senate and to an order of the speaker of the house, robbed tbe oooasion of opening of maoh of its pio taresqaeness. 

ROBERTS OrT rOR SEATTLE. Director of Flint WIN Take Charge of Assay Office Inquiry. Washington, Deo. 4.—Direotor Rob erts, of the United States mint, left Washington yesterday aiternoon for Seattle, where he will Make oharge of the assay offioe investigation. Just before leaving he said he had reoeived no information of new devel opments in the assay offioe affair, bat he is going to Seattle in fulfillment of an intentiion formed immediately after he heard of the arrest of Cashier Adams. New York Printers to Strike. New York, Deo. 4.—ln anticipation of a general strike of printers January 1, following the rejection of the de mand of Typographical Union No. 6 for an eight boor day, the New York Typothetae, tbe prganiaatton of em ploying printers, hat sent out a oirou lar to railroad agents throughout New York State offering a oommisalon of 5 per cent for every oompoaltor who can be induoed to oome to New York and aooept employment.

Creditable Showing CouM Be Ifatfe In 1907, but Later Date WouW Insure an Exhibit That WouW Command International Atten tion. Seattle, Deo. 6.—ln the opinion of the committee on permanent organiza tion, chosen from among the directors of the Alaska-Yukon exposition, it is inadvisable to hold the fair dating the year 1907. The committee is a unit in favor of selecting 1909. This conclusion was reached after a thorough oanvass of the situation, and Executive Commissioner Chealander will oall the board of directors together on Thursday afternoon for the purpose of reoeiving the report. In reoom mending a postponement of the exposition for two years, Commis sioner Chealander states that the com mittee did so after becoming oonvinoed that, while a creditable showing could be made if it be held in 1907, a muoh more comprehensive exhibit, and one whioh would insure international at tention, could be collected if the man agement had four years instead of two in whioh to perfect the details and as semble the material. Three years was considered by a majority of the com mittee to be ample time in whioh to prepare for the exposition, but in view of the fact that this would necessitate holding it during a presidential year, it was deemed best to recommended 1909. "The postponement," said Commis sioner Ghealander, "insures the oollec tion of exhibits whioh will command the attention of the whole world. It will also allow abundant time in whioh to exploit the undertaking to the full est extent, so that when the doors are opened its snooees will be assured. I have maintained from the beginning that the exposition oould be held in 1907, but it is a parent that there are many reasons whioh appeal frr a post ponement. One is the faot that James town will hold a tercentenary exposi tion in 1907, under government patron age, in oommemoration of the settle ment of this country. Patriotic socie ties urged that the spirit surroundiing the Jamestown undertaking should give it the right of way. "It should not be inferred that if the directors see fit to postpone the exposi tion, tbat there will be any cessation, on the part of Seattle, Alaska and the Yukon country in their efforts to pro mote it. Every d%y of the time inter- vening can be profitably used in the way of preparation. The committee will make a detailed report to the di reotorate at the meeting whioh will be ollead foi Thursday afternoon." OREGON SCHOOL UNO CERTIFICATE FORGERIES Portland, Or., Deo. 4.—Only when all persons holding certificates for school land in this state have sent their certificates to Salem to have them ex amined will it be possible to make an estimate of the extent of the gigantic swindles perpetrated on Easterners by unscrupulous land operators. Gov. Chamberlain stated to the As sociated Press that there is no limit to the number of forged certificates whioh oould have been made, and it is safe to say, he added, that where the cer tificates were hypothecated the full amounts shown by the oertiofiates were obtained, or where sales were made outright that the full value of the land, as shown by cruising, was paid by the victim. Very few of the persona who possess forged certificates are known so far, but from the fact that persons in Min nesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, New York, New Jersey, Ohio and Florida are in possession of them, the officials fear that when the whole number develops it will inolnde people in every state east of the Mississsippi rviver. The heaviest losers known to the officials so far are H. Goddard, of La Crosse, Wis.; George H. Baldwin, of Appleton, Wis., and H. M. Delaittre, of Minneapolis, Minn. Gov. Chamberlain said that at the present time he was unable to say who the fraudulent operators a*e. The certificates whioh were forged were all for land sold by the state prior to 1900. Only two methods by which holders may determine the originality of their certificates without sending them to Salem are offered by the state officials. The first is that so far all the forgeries discovered are on paper bearing the watermark "Sterling," a brand of pa per that has never been sold in Oregon, and the other is, the forged certificates are printed from sino etohings made from photographs of the original bunk form. rinns iMln Another Victory. flebingfors, Finland, Deo. 4.—The oonsti*Mtlfln*H*tf have won another great viotory in the appointment off a new ■mmln on oonatftational lines. It ia headed by Prof. Meohilin, who was baniahed by the late Gen. Bobri koff and include* representatives of all partiee, even of the SoolaHst Baton Wxede, one of the rioe presidents of the senate, and three of the new eena ton were, like Prof. Meohilin, banish ed by Gen.

"RATIFYING THE CONSTITUTION" IN RUSSIA. —Chicago Inter Ocean. THE OLD SANTA FE TRAIL. Old Track Through the Wilderness Now Paralleled by a Railroad. To the traveler crossing our western plains to-day on a well appointed rail road train the transformation wrought upon this wilderness through the agen cy of the locomotive is most striking. He can hardly realize that this fertile farming country with its thousands of towns and cities was once, only a mat ter of forty years ago, the stamping grounds of vast herds of buffaloes and the battle-field of fierce Indian tribes. The march of civilization has almost obliterated every vestige of the old life, and it is only here and there that the ruins of a fort, or a rude inscrip tion on a rock, or an unmarked grave beside a fertile field recall to the mind of the beholder that amidst these peaceful scenes rang the war-whoop PRINCIPAL DANGER OF THE WEST IN THEJ OLD DAYS. of painted savages and the crack of the frontiersman's rifle. The transformation of the region is especially striking along the old trails that led from the rim of civilization out into the wild West Of these for mer overland routes the Santa Fe Trail was the most Important, and along Its course some of the most stir ring scenes of the West were enacted. It led from Ft. Leavenworth, then the outpost of civilization, to the valley of the Arkansas, which stream it fol lowed Into* Colorado, thence trending (southward into New Mexico to Santa OK THE WAY TO THE WEST. Fe, the center of Spanish trade in the Southwest One can easily trace this old highway on the map by following the course of the Atchlsou, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad, which in a general way parallels it The build ing of a railroad along the old trail is good evidence that from an engineer- Ing standpoint the course was well se lected by the illiterate trappers that first penetrated the Plains. It is not unlikely that before tv» white man came that way the Trail In part had been used as a highway by the Indi ans, and before them by the wander ing buffalo herds. Proceeding from Leavenworth, the railroad to-day passes to the west of the Trail through Topeka, crosses It at the Tillage of Wakarusa, and meets It at Great Bend on the Arkansas,, whence It runs on and parallel to the old road t» Holly on the Colorado boundary. From Holly the Trail branches off to the south through the Raton Mts. into New Mexico. At Dodge City, Kansas, the site of old Ft. Dodge, a branch of the Trail led away to the southwest through a cor ner of Oklahoma, uniting with the main road near Las Vegas, N. M. In many places the ruts made by the wheels of the heavy transport wag ons and stage-coaches can still be seen in the hardened soil, although the road has been abandoned since the first train ran over the Santa Fe Rail road in 1880. Especially about Great Bend relics and reminiscences of the old days are abundant. Three miles to the east of that place, at the mouth of Walnut the ruins of Ft Za rah can be seen from the car windows. On a farm nearby a score of low mounds indicate the spot where the soldiers who were killed In the eon-' filets with the Indians He burled. jOn the present site of Court-House Square In Great Bend a thrilling fight took' place In 1864 between two army offi cers and a horde of savages. Thir teen miles east of the town a : solitary cliff loomed above the level waste. This was the famous Pawnee Rock, the rendezvous and lurking-place of the marauding red men. To-day a broken - heap of rock, used as a cattle corral, is all that remains of \ this si lent sentinel of the plains, that looked down upon many a desperate light. la its | shadow the wily Cheyenne* ;or Pawnees lay In wait for the approach ing wagon train or cavalcade of j trap-. pers.. It was the most dreaded spot on the whole route, and In the seventy six years—from 1804 to 1880— which $ the Trail was the only highway to the ; Southwest hundreds jof fights took place at Its base.— O.
