An attempt was made on Sunday evening last to fire the buildings of the Titusville Manufacturing Co., iu Titusville. The iuceudiary was ob served, and chase given, hut was too fleet for his pursuers. The fire had just been started, and was easily put out. The police have a description of the individual, and will undoubtedly bring him to time. Messrs. Grove it Wolcott have put up a rig on the Kepler farm, near Kepler s well, and aro going to work immediately to put down a well, and get oil. Iheir last well, opposite Trunkeyville, was recently tested and proved of no account. They have in this venture, as they have had in all others, our virtuous hopes for a com f lete success. Brown, of tho Clarion Democrat, recently called Young, of tho East Brady Independent, "a land pirate," whereat Samuel waltzes off on his largest ear, and calls Brown "a poor, God-forsaken, whitewashed sucker, who will not know his place, save when his belters teach him what it is, by giving him the most terrible whip ping ever bestowed upon a candidate." We wait patiently for the next Demo crat to see what Young is now. A man giving his uame as Ed ward Wilson, was arrested the latter part of last week, atTruukeyville, and lodged in the jail at this place on a charge of filching currency from C. S. Richardson. Yesterday morning he had a hearing before Eii. Mercilliott, who bound him over in 8500 for his appearance ut court. The requisite bonds not being procurable by the prisoner, he wus remanded to jail, there to await tho action of the next court. Judging by what wo heard of the case, the prisoner stands a chance of oqpiuting his err rs and learning a profession in the Western Penitentiary. . . . 1 1 , j i.-l hlovc the bridge, by Win. Pollock. It was started up on the hill just east of town, and run down between Tate's office and the school house, und through the vacant lots north of Sloan A Van Giesen's blacksmith shop, thence into the river, where it came to grief. We are not exactly prepared to say that it "bit the dust j" but that it chewed up large quanties of ice in its death struggles is told for a fact. A. C. Porter, formerly of tho Independent Democrat, of this place, was in town last week, and in reply to our inquiries, informed us that the paper he is to publish in Clarion will shortly appear to tbe eyes of the world. The reason for its non-appearance before, is, that ho is making It an 8-column paper instead of 6-col- umn, as contemplated. Mr. Porter will undoubtedly cause some shaking among the dry bones of the old poli ticians of Clarion county, and now, that his paper is to be as largo as any of them, he will have a fair chance. On Sunday morning last the kitch en and dining room of the Solders' Orphan School, in Titusville, was de stroyed by fire, and the remainder of the buildings came near ehnring the same fate. The building destroyed was 100 feet long, by 20 wide, and was valued at $1,000. The provisions, furniture and cooking apparatus was valued at $1,500, all of which is a to tal loss. Gurdou S. Berry, principal of the school, solicits aid from the public to rebuild, and furnish the building. '.Ve learn from the Tidioute 7oir nal that a Dr. Brownell, who is in the employ of E. L. Jones of Tidioute, was robbed near Babylon, on Thurs day evening last, under tho following circumstances. He was driving a light wagon, and just outside the village he was accosted by two men, who said. give us a ride, Uncle." He told them to jump in, which they did. They remarked about tho roughness of the roads, and for fear of falling out passed their arms about the Dr. One of them suddenly threw a horse blanket over the Dr.'s head aud bent him backward over tho seat. They then robbed him of his pocket-book, containing 8250 and a revolver. Brownell yelled aud kicked while they were going through his pockets, but did not rouse anybody. They ran off over the hill. The polico are on the watch for the robbers.

About half past four this nfteruoon a darkey named Lucas became involv ed in an altercation with an unknown mau in a restaurant here, and before the bystanders could interfere, drew a revol rer and fired threa shots, one of which proved iustautly fatal.

WEST. This is an enquiry which every one should have truthfully answered-before he starts on hit) journey, and a little care taken iu examination of Routes will in many cases save much trouble, time aiid money. The "C. B. A Q. RR.," running from Chicago, thiough Galesburg to Bur lington, and tho "I. B. A W.

R. and form the great Burlington Routo, which runs direct through Southern Iowa to Nebraska anil Kan sas, with close connections to Califor nia aud the Territories; and passen gers starting from Tionesta, on their way westward, cannot do better than to take tho Burlington Route.
