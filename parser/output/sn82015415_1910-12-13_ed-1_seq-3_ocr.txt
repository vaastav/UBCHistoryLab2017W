President Describes Canal And discusses Its Future Management And Defense Following are the remarks and re commendations on the Panama Canal In President Taft's message to Con gress: At the instance of Colonel Goethals, the army engineer ofHcer In charge of the work on tho Panama Canal, I havo just made a visit to the isthmus to inspect the work done and to con sult with him on the ground as to certain problems which are likely to arise In the near future. The progress of the work Is most i atlsfactory. If no unexpected obstacle presents It self, the canal will be completed well within the time, fixed by Colonel Goe thals, to wit, January 1, 1915, and with-i in iuu emiuiiue oi cost, $o io,uuu,uuu. Press reports havo reached the Unit ed States from time to time giving ac counts of slides of earth of very large yardage In the Culebra cut and else whore along the line, from which it might be inferred that tho work has been much retarded and that the time of completion has been necessarily postponed. The report of Doctor Hayes of the Geological Survey, whom I sent with in the last month to the Isthmus to make an Investigation, shows that this section of the canal zone is oonjposed of sedimentary rocks of rather weak structure and subject to almost im mediate disintegration when exposed to the air. Subsequent to the deposi tion of these sediments, igneous rocks, harder and more durable, have been thrust Into them, and being cold at the time of their Intrusion united but indifferently with the sedimentary rock at the contacts. The result of these conditions Is that as the cut is depened, causing unbalanced pressure, slides from the Bides of the cut have occurred. These are in part duo to the flowing of surfare soil and decom. posed sedimentary rocks upon inclin ed surfaces of the underlying unde composed rock and in part by the crushing of structurally weak beds un der excessive pressure. The slides oc. cur on one side or the other of the cut through a distance of four or five miles, and now that their character Is understood, allowance has been made in the calculations of yardage for the amount of slides which will have to be removed and the greater slope that will have to be given to tho bank in many places in order to prevent their recurrence. Such allowance does not exceed ten millions of yards. Con sidering that the number of yards re moved from this cut on an average of each month through tho year Is 1,300, 000, and that the total remaining to be excavated, including slides, is about 30,000,000 yards it is seen that this addition to the excavation does not offer any great reason for delay. While this feature of tho material to be excavated in the cut will not se. rlously delay or obstruct the con struction of a canal of the lock typo, the Increase of excavation due to such slides In the cut made eighty-five feet deeper for a sea level canal would cer- talnly have been so great as to delay Its completion to a time beyond the patience of the American people. J Among questions arising for present solution is the decision whether the canal shall be fortified. I have al ready stated to the Congress that I strongly favor fortification and I now reiterate this opinion and ask your consideration of the subject In the light of the report already before you mado by a competent board. If, in our discretion, we believe mo dern fortifications to be necessary to the adequate protection and policing of tho canal, then it Is our duty to construct them. We havo built tho canal. It Is our property. By con vention we have Indicated our dpslro for, and Indeed undertaken, Its univer sal and equal use. It Is also well known that one of the chief objects In the construction of the canal has been to Increase the military effectiveness of our navy. Failure to fortify tho canal would leave the attainment of both these alms in the position of rights and ob ligations which we should be power less to enforce and which could never In any other way be absolutely safe guarded against a desperate and Irres ponsible enemy. 

CANAL TOLLS. Another question which arises for consideration and possible legislation Is the question .of tolls in the canal. This question Is necessarily affected by tho probable tonnage which will go through the canal. It Is all a matter of estimate, but one of the government commissions in 1900 Investigated tho question and made a report. They concluded that the total tonnage of tho vessels employed In commerce that could use the isthmian canal In 1914 would amount to G,843,803 tons net re gister, and that this traffic would In crease 25.1 per cent per decade; that It was not probable that all the com merce included In the totals would at once abandon the routes at present followed and make use of the new canal, and that It might take some time, perhaps two years, to readjust trade with reference to the new con ditions which the canal would estab lish. Ho did not include, moreover, the tonnage of war vessels, although it is to be inferred that such vessels would make considerable use of the canal. In the matter of tolls be reach. ed the conclusion that a dollar a net ten would not drive business away from the canal, but that, a higher rate would do so. In determining what the tollS should be we certainly ought not to insist that for a good many years to come they should amount to enough to pay the interest on the investment of $400,000,000 which the United States has made In the construction of the canal. We ought not to do this, first, because tho benefits to be derived by tho United States for this expenditure is not to be measured solely by a re turn upon the Investment. If It were then tho construction might well have been loft to private enterprise. It was because an adequate return upon the money Invested could not bo ex pected immediately, or in the near future, and because there were pecu liar political advantages to be derived from the construction of tho canal that It necessarily fell to the govern ment to advance the money and per form the work. In addition to the benefit to our naval strength, the canal greatly in creases the trade facilities of the United States. It will undoubtedly cheapen tho rates of transportation In all freight between the eastern and western seaboard, and It will greatly increase that trade by reason of the reduction in its cost. . Then, if we nro to have a world canal, and If wo are anxious that the routes of tho

I In nil these cases the question who. 1 ther the Panama Canal Is to bo used and its tonnage increased would be determined later by the charge for Its use. My own Impression is that tho iv-iio uugui nui io oxceeu $1 per net ton. On January 1, 1911, tho tolls In tho Suez Canal aro to bo seven francs and twenty-fivo centimes 'for one net ton by Suez canal measurement, which Is a codification of Danube measure-, ment. A dollar a ton will secure un der the figures above a gross income , from the Panama canal of nearly $7,-1 nnn (in a tm, i . . I operation Is estimated to exceed $3, 000,000. Ultimately, of course, with the normal Increase In trade, the in come will approximate the interest charges upon the Investment. On tho whole I should recommend that with in certain limits the President be au thorized to fix tho tolls of the canal and adjust them to what seems to be commercial necessity. The Inquiries already made of tho Chief Engineer of the canal show that the present con sideration of this question is neces sary in order that the commerce of the world may have tlmo to adjust it self to the new conditions resulting from the'openlng of this new highway. The next question that arises Is that of the maintenance, management and general control of tho canal after its completion. It should be premised that it Is an essential part of our navy establishment to have the coal, oil and other ship supplies, a drydock, and repair shops, conveniently located with reference to naval vessel passing through the canal. Now, if tho gov ernment, for naval purposes, is to un dertake to furnish those conveniences to the navy, and they are conveniences equally required by commercial ves sels, thero would seem to be strong reasons why the government should take over and include in its manage ment the furnishing, not only to the navy but to the public, drydock and repair shop facilities, and the sale of coal, oil, and other ship supplies. The maintenance of a lock canal of this enormous size in a sparsely po pulated country and In the tropics, where the danger from disease is al ways present, requires a large and complete and well trained organiza tion with full police powers, exercising the utmost care. Tho visitor to the canal who is impressed with the won derful freedom from tropical diseases on the isthmus must not be misled as to the constant vigilance that Is need, ed to preserve this condition. The machinery of tlie locks, the necessary amount of dredging, the preservation of tho banks of tho canal from slides, tho operation and maintenance of the equipment of the railway will all re quire a force, not, of course, to bo lllf. ened in any way to the present organ ization for construction, but a skilled body of men who can keep in a state of usefulness this great Instrument of commerce. Such an organization makes it easy to Include within its functions the furnishing of drydock, fuel, repairs and supply facilities to the trade of tho world. These will be more essential at the Isthmus of Panama than thoy are at Port Said or Suez, because there are no depots for coal, supplies, and other commercial necessities within thousands of miles of the Isthmus. Another Important reason why these ancillary duties may well be under taken by the government is the oppor tunity for discrimination between pa trols of the canal that is offered where private concessions aro granted for the furnishing of these facilities. Nothing would creato greater preju dice against tho canal than tho sus picion that certain linos of trafllc were favored in the furnishing of supplies or that tho supplies were controlled by any largo interest that might have a motive for increasing the cost of tho use of the canal. It may bo added that tho termini are not amplo enough to permit tho fullest competi tion in respect to the furnishing of these facilities and necessities to tho world's trade even If It were wise to Invite such competition and the grant. Ing of the concession would necessar ily, under these circumstances, take on the appearance of privilege or mono poly. I cannot close this reference to tho cannl without suggesting as a wise amendment to the interstate com merce law a provision prohibiting in terstate commerco railroads from own ing or controlling ships engaged In tho trado through the Panama canal. I bollevo such a provision may bo need, ed to save lo tho people of the United States tho benoflts of the competition Jin trade botwoen tho eastern and wostorn seaboards which this canal will bo constructed tc-ecurc.
