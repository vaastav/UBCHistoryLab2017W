Washington , Dec. 15. The Browim vlllo affair consumed nearly the entlio session of the senate. Senator For- ulcer obtained the floor early In the day and rend letters from a former soldier of the Twenty-fifth regiment , | telling of the procedure of the govern ment In attempts to got a confession from him. Mr. Forakor introduced an amendment to his original bill for the re-onllstment of these soldiers pro-1 vldlng that a commission of three re tired army olllcers bo created to deter mine whether the discharged soldiers are Innocent of complicity In the shooting up of Brownsville as a pre requisite for their re-enlistment , In stead of leaving that duty with the president , as provided by the Warnei , bill. I The president's message , giving the results of the war department's in vestigation of the Brownsvillo affair , ' was read , as follows : , "I enclose herewith a letter from the secietary of war transmitting a re port of the Investigation made by Mr. Herbert J. Browne , employed by the department , In conjunction with Cap tain W. G. Baldwin , to Investigate ni far as possible what happened at j ! Brownsville on the 13th and 14th of August , 190fi. "This report enables us to fix will ) tolerable dellnlteness at least some of the criminals who took the lead In the murderous shooting of private citizens at Brownsville. It establishes clearly the fact that the colored soldiers did the shooting ; but upon this point fur ther record was unnecessary , as. the fact that the colored soldiers did the shooting has already been established beyond all possibility of doubt. The Investigation has not been far enough to enable us to determine all the facts , and wo will proceed with it ; but it has gone far enough to determine with sufficient accuracy ceitaln facts of enough Importance to make it advisa ble that I place the report before you. Concealment a Grave Offence. "It appears that almost all the members of company B must have been actively concerned In the shoot ing , either to the extent of being par ticipants or to the extent of virtually encouraging those who were partici pants. As to companies C and D , there can be no question that practic ally every man in them must have had knowledge that the shooting was done by some of the soldiers of B troop , and possibly by one or two others In one of the other troops. The conceal ment was Itself a grave offense , which was greatly aggravated by their testi fying before the senate committee that they were Ignorant of what they must have known. Nevertheless , it 13 to be said' in partial extenuation thav they were probably cowed by threats , made by the more desperate of the men who had actually been engaged In the shooting as to what would hap pen to any man who failed to protect the wrongdoers. Moreover , there are circumstances tending to show that these misguided men were encouraged' by outsiders to persist in their course of concealment and denial. I feel , therefore , that the guilt of the men who , after the event , thus shielded the perpetrators of the wrong by refusing to tell the truth about them , though serious , was in part duo to the unwise and imntopcr attitude of others , and that sonic measure of allowance should be made for their misconduct. In other \\ords , 1 believe we can afford ] to reinstate any of these men who now truthfully tell what has happened , | give all the aid they can to fix the re- i sponsibility upon those who are ically j guilty and show that they themselves had no guilty knowledge beforehand and were In no way implicated In the affair , save by having knowledge of It afterward and failing and refusing to divulge It. Would Reinstate Some Soldiers. "Under the circumstances , and In view of the length of time they have been out of the service , and their loss of the benefit that would have accrued to them by continuous long service , we can afford to treat the men who meet the requirements given above as having been sufficiently punished by the consequences they brought upon themselves when they rendered neces sary the exorcise of the disciplinary power. I recommend that a law bo passed allowing the secretary of war , 1 within n fixed period of time , say a I year , to reinstate any of these sol- ' filers whom he , after careful examlna- I tlon , finds to have been innocent and whom he finds to have done all in his power to help bring to justice the guilty. "Meanwhile , the Investigation will be continued. The results have made it obvious that only by carrying on the Investigation as the war depart ment has actually carried it on la there the slightest chance of bringing the offenders to Justice or of separat ing not the innocent , for there wore doubtless hardly any innocent , but the loss guilty from those whose guilt woa heinous" heinous"A A Saving Or ce.

You know Uncle Oscar's bin getting fat sins he quit farming and cum to live in a hotel and his big toe's bin hurting him dreadful and the doctor se'd he had a touch of the gowt and proskribed more outdoor exercise. That's why Uncle Oscar was so tickled to go skating. So 1 went up on Ilnrney to wheio the girl lived and when I got there they was aiiuther girl there abed of me witli her skates and they was about to stall together so of course I had to take 'em both.

Uncle Oscar Inokt kind of agast when we all filed into the rostarant for seven times ten was seventy cents but he had the lady in bine with him and he shelled out butifiilly. We herded a park car and Uncle Oscar pade the fair , and ho sed it seemd like old times to be going skat ing agen. He sed he lister be con sidered the chninpyun skater of In- jlanna , that onct when ho lived on the old home farm his little sister got sick in the nlte and it was twelve miles down ( he river to where the doctor llvd and the rodes was blockt with snow and ho put on his skates and skated them twelve miles In forty minnits , and the river was open In places In the middle and he had to jump sum of these open places that was from ate to ten feet wide and It was nite too. And the doctor sed ho cndent get thru witli a team so Uncle Oscar borryed a hand-sled and hauld the doctor home In an our and five minnits , and got him there in time to save his little sister's life. The girls all ses , Oh ! wnsent that fine ! But one of them ast how ho got across the open places with the sled. Uncle Oscar sed he'd forgot to explano how that was but it was very simple : T ( was such a cold nito that the open places was all froze over sollid when he cum back and he just skated rite nloti'j. The girls all ses Oh ! agen , and i the la'v in blue sos it must indeed have been cold. | Uncle0..cnr sed it had been mennj 'a ' day sins lie had skates on and il mite bother him at first but ho blieveil after he got limbered up he cud show his heels to enny of the young fellers ( and he suvo did ! ) He sed ho wasenl nster these new fangled lower skates that wlien he skated he had skate ; that ho scrude Into his heels ant strapped onto his soul so they novel cud cum off.
