DEPARTURES. iiitqh vmrra'a (alt laxx link: Mr Woldenberg Wr yesterday met Mr. Barber, who arrived on Monday from White Pine, at which place he was engaged as night foreman on the smutting works. He states that the last ran of the furnace was a good one, but was not a financial success owing to the poor class of rock bought, which hardly paid for the haul iug. The ore shipped from here by the American flag mine worked splendid, If all of the ore had been of tba same character the run would have been 1 grand success. Mr. Barber intends re siding here during the Winter. Hu says the late Ntriko m the Eherhardt, at Treasure Hill, made last Thursday on toe 4 i0 foot level of that mine, dips to the east and is of such grade and char aoter as to justify the hope that further developments will give very favorable indications. Ii was reported yoiterday by parties who seemed to credit the report that Philip Klingen Smith had been mur dered down in the vicinity or the Colo rado river. We could learn uo particu lars excep t that he was reported to have made his way from Beaver down to that vicinity all alone, preferring to trust to the Indians and the dancers of the road than to encounter any Mormons in his travels. Ha entered a house down near the ferry ot the Colorado to get his break fast, and after getting through and com ing out be was shot dead, as was sup posed, by a Mormon. The affair is said to have occurred about the 25th of No vember. Ha has been threatened at various times since the Lee trial, and the late action of hostile parties teuds to confirm the report.

At 12:13, on motion of Senator Frelinghnysen of New Jersey, the Senate took a recess until one o'clock. Upon reassembling, Anthony, from the joint oommittee to wait upon the President and inform him of the organ ization of the two houses, reported that the President Bnid he would communi cate with Congress immediately in writ ing. At 1:15, Mr. Luckey, Private Sec retary to the President, appeared at the bar of the Senate with the message, and it was read by Qeo. C. Oorham, Secretary of the Senate. The reading was con cluded at two o'clock, and was listened to with marked attention by the Senators and a largo audience in the galleries. Sir Edward Thornton, British Minister, was in the diplomatic gallery and appeared deeply interested. Portions ot the mes sage in regard to the school question, taxation of church proparty, Cuba, our financial affairs, and the condition of the navy especially attracted the closest at tention. On motion of Senator Conkling of New York the message was ordered to lay upon the table aud be printed. He also offered the usual resolution to print extra copies, which was referred to the Committeo on Printing. The President pro tern, laid before the Senate reports of the various Cabinet officers and Con troller of tho Currency which were or dered printed and laid on the table. Adjourned. 

B0TJ8S. On motion of S. J. Bandult of Penn., the House took a recess till one o'clock, the hour fixed for the drawing of the seats. At that hour the recess wa ex tended to give the members abscut on the committee to wait on the President Cox, Knott and Blaine an opportunity to be present and seleot their seats when their names should be called. The ootir tesy of allowing the oldest continuous members to seleot seats in n.lv.inoa of drawing was extended to Kelly. A mem ber was also permitted to seleot a seat for Alex. Stephens of Georgia. A 1 :15 Cox reported the committee bad waited upon the President and that a communication in writing would be sent to the House forthwith. The Speaker submitted the question whether the House would draw seats or have tbo President's mossage read. The former course was adopted; a blind folded page then drew the names ot the members from the box one by one and the member drawn came from the outside bar, where all were congregated and occupied the seat which he proposed holding for the Congress. The first name drawn was Whitehouse, and amongst the first half dozen, Hoar, Ely and King. The Democrats mostly took their seats on the east side to the right of the deer's chair the side which they have partially occupied many Congresses. Some however selected seats on the west ern or Republican side of the Chamber. Barnes selected the seat whioh be for merly occupied, at the extreme loft, re sisting the invitation of Blaine to take a seat near bim, and in timated that the atmosphere about there was too strong for him. It was 2:20 when the drawing was oompleted, As soon as order was restored the President's message was re oeived and presented to tho House, and read by the Heading Clerk, Mr. Mehany. The reading occupied two hours and five minntes. At first tho message was lis tened to with considerable interest and attention, but after passing the portions relating to education, church property and Cuba, the attention began to flag; members gradually retired, so that dur ing the reading of the latter portion of the message there were probably not forty members in their Beats, and few of those werj paying the slightest attention. The message was ordered printed. Cox presented the petition of W. H. Trescott and others of South Carolina, with ref erence to the right of representative of the Third Congressional District of South Carolina, and moved that it be referred to the Committee on Elections; referred. The House then adjourned till Friday. Chicago, Deo. 8. A Washington spe cial says the city, not less than the Honse, is taken by surprise at the moderation of the President's message in relation to the Cuban question. It was known be yond a doubt that General Grant had been slowly maturing the purposo of bringing the Spanish campaign in Cuba to a crisis. His sympathies were openly expressed, and to some extent assurances given to the friends of Cuban independ ence that an energotia protest should bo addressed preparatory to the formal rec ognition of belligerenoy on the part of rebels. General Grant never appre hended war ss the resnlt of this recogni tion, it is alleged, hence, oa beginning the message be bad olearly mads up his mind to lay tha case plainly before the oouutry avowing his sympathy with the insurgents. A singular piece of inside history has been made known. At the eleventh bonr the Fish policy, as it may be called, prevailed, and that portion of the message which bad already been written in accordance with the President's strong inclination, beginning at the seventh paragraph of that section pertaining to our relations with Cuba was obliterated and the present utter ances substituted. The Republicans are naturally unwilling to discuss the matter, but, as understood by those familiar with tha political changes going on within the party, that the interests of the Republican future demand an end of entangling or outside alliances and that any policy involving war or rumors of war tends to distract the country and shake confidence in the party in power. It is known that the changes referred to in the message were only brought about after the election ot Kerr, which not only alarmed the ring and subsidy people, but warned the Republican leaders that tha Democratic party is for the time- being at least resolved npon the policy of wisdom and conservatism. Had Ran dall been elected there oan be no doubt from the evidence at hand that General Grant would not havo been urged by this virtual canons of the Republican leaders to forego his intention of a Cesarean policy in settling the Cuban trouble. while the Democrats are obagrined at the escape of tho administration from the dilemma in which prononnoed action would have placed them. Thoro is wrath beyond expression in tbe ranks of those credulous believers in Cuban free dom who have invested in insurgent bonds and Havana oorner lots. This class is by no means a limited one; there is and has been for the last four years a Cuban ring which has possessed itself of many of tbe important papers ot the oonntry to plead tha cauBe of the dwindling rebellion whioh oalls itself the Cuban Government. Whatever General Grant's interest in Cuban freedom may be beyond his sympathy with the strug gling armies it is not probable that the same motives which nrged bim to the San Domingo acquisition wore not alto gether ignored in bis new venture. En- oouraged by the election of Kerr and tha tractable spirit of the Southern members the National Democratic Executive Com mittee now in session has arranged a plan of action for the guidance of Con gress and the future of the party. It has been resolved that Congress shall grant no subsidies this Winter and shall vigorously diminish appropriations and ourrent Government expenses; that in vestigations in all forms of Government expenditures shall at once be set on foot and so far as practicable ecouomy be adopted. conducted of which city carries a Hag at balf-mast to day in reepect to his memory. Deceased wa a native of France, and has resided here since tbo earliest settlement of tbe city. He was a zealous advocate of tbe inter ests of Eastern Nevada, and his death is deeply regretted by all classes in this city. Joseph Town, the minor who fell down the Oregon shnft on Monday night died this morning. His funeral will take place to-morrow, and will be by the Reese Rivor Pioneers, society Towne was a member. San Francisco, Deo. 8. A small sloop of nina tons register, owned by John Pugh, of Port Discovery, Tuget Sound, left San Francisco harbor on the 24th of October for Port Townsond, with women on board. The craft has not been heard from since, and is supposed to have been lost. The City of San Franoisco will sail for Sydney at twelve o'clock on Friday next instead of to-day as heretofore an nounced. In the Police Court to-day S. II. Har rington, who made tho late attempt at robbery and murder at tbe Palace liotol, waived examination and was held to answer in two charges, with hail fixed at $10,000 in each case. Mr. Bernard, owner of Spriugbok and Golden Gate, tbe former beiDg among the horses entered for the great $30,000 running race, lias ordered them home. So far the order has not been complied with. Negotiations ore pending with a view of inducing Mr. Bernard to recon sider his resolution. Notwithstanding the delightful weather there is no hope of the raeo coming off this year. None of tbe horses entered oro now in training, all of them hnvo been suffering more or less from tho epizooty and they have not yet fully recovered from the effeots. If Springbok is withdrawn it is very prob able the raco will be declared off altogether.
