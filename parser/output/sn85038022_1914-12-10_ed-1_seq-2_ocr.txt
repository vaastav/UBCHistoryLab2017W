"It is rigiit that we should provide it not only, hut that wo should make it ns attractive as possible, and so induce our young men to undergo it at such times as they can command n little freedom and can seek the physical development they need, for .mere health's sake, if for nothing more. Every means by which such things can be stimulated, are legitimate, and such a method smacks of true Amor ican ideas. "It is right, too, that' the National Guard of the states should be developed and strengthened by every means which is not inconsistent with our ob ligations to our own people or with the established policy of our government. And this, also, not be cause the time or occasion specially calls for such measures, but because it should be our const out policy 'to make these provisions for our national peace and safety. "More than this carries with it a reversal of the whole history and character of our policy. More than, this, proposed at this time, permit me to say. would mean merely that we had lost our self-possession, that we had been thrown off oilr balance by a war with which we have nothing to do, whoVo causes can not touch us, whose very existence af fords us opportunities of friendship and disinter ested service which should make us ashamed of any thought of hostility or fearful preparation for trouble. " "This is assuredly the opportunity for which a people and a government1 like ours were raised up, the opportunity not only to speak but actually to embody and exemplify the counsels of peace and amity and the lasting concord which is based on jus" ticc and fair and generous dealing. "A. powerful navy wc have always regarded as our proper and natural means of defense; and it Jias always been of defense that Ave have thought. never of aggression or of conquest. But who shall tell us-now what sort of navy to build? AVe shall take leave to be strong upon the seas, in the future as in the past; and there will be no thought of of fense or of provocation in that. Our ships are our natural bulwarks." President Wilson's Message. 

ILLITERACY DEFINED. Hev. 13. E. Smith's contribution to the Messenger on Thursday was timely as well as novel. The topic chosen by him for treatment was, "Illiteracy, One of the Causes of the Great AVar In Europe." The amplification of this theme made the notable ar ticle. It was novel chiefly in the broader meaning given by Dr. Smith to the word "illiteracy." In common parlance the word is taken to mean the absence of knowledge of books and other things strictly literary. This is the moaning given to the word by most of those who use it. This is conveni ent aud customary, but Dr. Smith delves deeper and peers further and gives us a new significance for this now quite current word. He makes it mean not only ignorance of letters, but ignorance of men and their manners. He even hints that there is not only ignorance of neighbors, hut misinformation founded on preconceived notions nurtured by egotism and jealousy. And just here is where he accounts for the war most rationally. Not only does he find the cause in a rational way, but he also does it ethically and thus accounts for the more brutal and more fre- qucnt wars of the past when men (or brutes, were they?) stood face to face and bayoneted each other to death, or even broke each other's skulls with clubs or stones. Yes, illiteracy the lack of knowledge of each other's interests and purposes, no doubt caused the war and other wars. Owensboro Messenger. AN OUTRAGEFAGAINST te RAILROADS, The statement is madd by a well informed rail road man that the railroads of this country "kilt over 5,000 persons annually, an average of fourteen every day, because there arc no laws penalizing trespassing on railroad tracks. In other countries men arc fined for exposing themselves by walking on railroad tracks. Hero wc assess heavy damages against railroads hecaifsc men put themselves where those operating Ihe trains can not avoid killing or injuring them. We have seen so much here of this free train hop ping, walking on the tracks and the eternal pen chant to trespass on the danger zones of the raiU-, ways, and the resulting accidents and tragedies that one almost is forced to think that many hu man beings are incapable of reasoning. If a hobo, tramp, loafer, deadbcat, or any one else is killed oV injured while trespassing on a rail road, the company should not bo blamed. Wc mean those who trespass. The railroads are common carriers and if a dead hobo is a superior being vested wjth special rights and privileges, the statutes ought to say so but they don't. Keep off the ears unless you have it ticket aivftj keep off the tracks even if yon have forty tickets. WHERE WAS SOCIAL JUSTICE? What became of Social Justice at the Chicago conference of the Progressive party? Wc can find no reference to it in the reports of the proceedings, and the canned statement issued in behalf of the committee was devoted in large part to explaining the need of "a permanent non-partisan tariff com mission.'.' That particular article of faith could just as wOll have been framed under the inspiration of Uncle. Joe Cannon, Boise Penrose and William Barnes. Let them appoint the tariff commission, and they do not care how permanent or non-partisan it is. But this is all as far from Armage'ddon as the kaiser is from Tipprary. The Army of the Lord used to battle for Social Justice, and if it has noth ing better than n permanent non-partisan tariff commission to fight for, we fear thrit recruiting will be slow and desertions heavier than ever. Social Justice ought to have gone to Chicago. Was it obliged to stay home because the Colonel staved home? New York World. WILLIAM JENNINGS GREAT BIG TWO-FER.
