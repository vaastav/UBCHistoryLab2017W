Jaacary iJ61 - -- THE 'SSIccItla ftltmts THURSDAY, DECEMBER Jo, i875. A EEK ABEABLE MESSAGE Pcsident Grant's message is a meat le inarkable political document. Evidently great care has been bestowed upon its prep ara.Ion, and the President has made him self thoroughly acquainted with every toj ic lie discu-ses. Hie views on the public school question meet with the approval of Protestant, Catholic, Jew and ragan, and will convince chronic disturbers that the common school system, which has done so much to educate the masses and build up the country, must and eball be preserved. The President is equally firm and delei mined in hi opposition to tl'e unl-o'y and i'Scgal practices of Brigham Yodfig and his followers. Polygamy is a disgrace to our country, and a crime which should be severely punished. The President's manly Ftand on the Cu ban question, the taxation of all property, and the imortation of Chinee women for sinful pnr;j--es, will also be approved by the great mass of the people. U. S. Grant aiways wrile3 a message which com mands attention and respect. 

COMMENTS OF THE PEES3 The newspapers of the Missouri Y rll yesterday morning, did not extensively comment on the message, it not being re ceived until a very late hour. The Si. Joseph Herald, Kepuhlican, says: "It is an able and exhaustive document, and as the various questions discussed are of vital importance to the country, it will be read with great interest by all. To thoe who are awaiting with confidence the dread ful apparition of CarearUra, the message w ill prove a signal disappointment. By the thoughtful and dispassionate, it will be deemed an able review of the important questions to which it is his duty as Giief Executive, to direct the attention of Con gress." The St. Joseph Gazette, Democratic, says: "The President's message, which we. lay before our readers to-day, will doubtless command more attention than any similar document that has hitherto been written by Mr. Grant. Evidently, the state pajer has been prepared with more than usual care." The Lawrence Journal, Republican, says: "This message will be widely read and will produce a profound impression. It carries with it a style of eotscious power, a knowledge of the people and of the ques tions uppermost in their minds, and a skill in stating and meeting thoe ques-:ons which few of our public men can equal in their happie.it or profoundest moods.'1 The Lawrence Tribune, Independent, says: "We have had little time to even scan its recommendation. It is, however, a con servative and plainly-worded, straightfor ward document, and will commend jt"elf to the careful attention of the reader." The Atchison Champion, Republican, has no editorial on the subject. The Topeka Gmmontreallh, Republican, say: The message is briefly summarized in the lat paragraph, which summary we commend to those styled by the President "the right-thinking and patriotic citizens of the United State?.' We think, more over, that the roeagc as a whole will suit that clas of jTople."' The Kansas City Journal, Republican, says; "It is altogether the tnol interest ing and imprersivc utterance that has yet emanated from President Grant, and as ad elrenscd to the opening ssssion of the Forty fourth Congress, and upon the eve of anoth er Presidential canva, will lie read with uuirersal interei-t and elicit widespread and exciting conimen.." The Kansas City Time, Democratic, pays a high compliment to the message, by se verely criticizing it from a partisan stand jioint. The President's utterances hurt the opposition. The Chicago Tribune, Republican, 6ays : "A careful reading of the message seems to justify the expectation that has been made, and a pretense of serious dk-apointment in any quarter will lie captious, partisan and unreasonable, It may be said in general terms that it takes a brod, comprehensive, national and statesmanlike view of the subjects it treats, and nowhere degenerates into the spirit of mere partyim. Its tone is essentially patriotic, without once aban doning that moderation which should characterize self government, and the swell ing pride of a review of a century's progress unparalleled in the history of nations is tempered by a timely warning against the dangers that threaten the Republic" The St. Louis Globe-Democrat, Republican, remarks : "Though long,! is not dull, but is so full of matter and interest, that his successor need hardly expect to do as well, and if the recommendations contained in it are carried out, the last year of Grant's administration will be the most brillianf in our national history. But whatever the legislation which shall result therefrom, the message will stand conspicuous not only for that plain, common-sen which has always distinguished his Excellency, but forabreadlhof scope, a depth of in sight, a statesmanlike grasp, and treatment of great subjects which will lie admit.ed even by his most determined opponents. The St. Louis Times, Democratic, obser ves: "On the whole, this ionderous docu ment reads moderately well, and is only obe:tionable in spots." The Atchison Champion, Republican, ays: "The seventh annusl menage of President Grtnt was laid before the read ers of the Champion, in full, yesterday morn ing. It has been read, we believe, with general satisfaction and approval. The most lengihy message the President has ever transmitted to Congress, it is also, we think, the best Its recommendations are wise and statesmanlike, its tone is frank, honest and dignified, and its statement of the condition of our demestic and foreign relations is clear and satisfactory." The Council Bluffs XonpareV, Republi can, says : " The document, as all who hare perused it with any degree of care and fair-mindedness, will agree, is a practical, straight-forward, business-like affair, emi nently characteristic of the man and the times." 

BEPOBTOF THE 8ECBETABY OF THE KAVY. A more peaceful document than the re port of the Secretary of the Navy it would be difficult to compose on a subject prima facie so warlike. It consists mainly of a matter-of-fact description of the Navr, its condi-ion and capacity. Iu operations' are also detailed, but they are of the most qui et nature. A couple of vessels dropped in at Tripoli last August to exact an apology for insults offered an American official by some Tripolitan seamen. Once or twice in the course of the year Bear-Admiral ilul lany, of the North Atlantic Squadron, has "assisted" at a Central American revolu tion, keeping an eye on American inter ests and the isthmus railroad. And once a Commander wag directed to stop at the Samoan Isles to give the natives a : - ' - y. - - brief cour-e of instruction in civ ilized deportment toward citizens of the United States. This Lj about the ex tent to which our navy hag been required to intervene jn our relations with other governments. Besides this service, it has contributed its part toward the ob-ervation ol the transit of Venus, has made import ant deep-sea soundings in the Pacific, and examined carefully the route of the Cali fornia steamers; it has determined accu rately the geographic position of a number of points in the West Indies, and has aided in the exploration of routes for canal navi gation ac:os the Isthmus of Panama. Its scientific labors have been interesting and valuable, but not so extensive as was desir able, and might have been practicable, had not the limits of the appropriations been so soon reached. A ELEEL CHOWS No one was able to get a nomination from the Democratic caucus held on Sat urday last who could not show a clear rec ord in favor of the rebellion. The Speaker and the Sergeant-at-Arms, the only North ern men cho-en, were both Northern men with Southern principles, as well during as after the war, and both were chon be cause of their well-known sub-erviency to the South. The Clerk is a notorious Ken tucky rebel ; the Doorkeeper wan former ly Doorkeeper of the Confederate Congress ; the Postmaster was a rebel, driven out of the Alexandria po-l-office for his disloyal ty, and the Chaplain was exiled from Con necticut to Washington, because he persist ed in giving aid and comfort to the rebels during the war. These are not accidental happenings. The men referred to were chosen for thee places solely because of their rebel record. The Chsplainship, we are told, in the his tory of the caucus proceeding", was given to the successful candidate after a speech by Mr. Barnum, stating why Connecticut grew too hot for his continued residence there. Tltol settled the contest in his favor. To have been a rebel, or a friend of the re bellion, was essential to the success of any one, in that caucus. THE FIEST SUCCESS. The first day's cession of the Democratic House of Representatives witnessed a sharp and exciting contest on the Louisiana ques tion a contest in which superior political acumen and parliamentary skill carried the day as against the advantage of numbers. It was Fernando Wood's first effort to seize the Democratic leadership, and in the out come that gentleman's pretensions were ef fectively disposed of by the promptness and energy with which ex-Speaker Blaine, sec onded by Mr. Wheeler, of New York, threw himself into the breach and defeated tbc attempt to once more tear open the Louisiana question. Mr. Blaine's success was brilliant and complete, though it was not complete 1 until Lamar and Cox had committed the serious blunder of siding with Wood and sharing in the -humiliation of his failure. It was a pretty fight, and handsomely won. It looks as though the minority, led by Mr. Blaine, will be able to carry their joint every time, against the wishes of a large majority, under poor lead ership. . BEPOST OF THE EECSJ TAET 07 WAB Tiic report of the Secretary of War states that the morals of the army is excellent; that a better class of recruits are enlisted; that the system of graded comjtensation and savings deposit at interest, lately insti tuted, works very well; that more military bandi are needed ; that the officers should be required to keep a historical record of the posts in their command ; that the law should bj more stringent against the enlist ment of married men ; that the coast sur vey in the interest of Ead's jetty at the mouth of the Mississippi has begun; that the entire army is now supplied with new rilles and carbines of No. Ao calibre, and tha' there is a reserve supply of about -o,000 o; the new and improved aims; that the Academy at West Point still vindicates its efficiency and tiermancni utility, etc., etc BEWAEE OF HIM A lelter has U-en addressed to the New Yoik Givptu; signed by one '"Father J. V. McXaniara," calling for a general gather ing of Irishmen from all parts of the coun try, in Philadelphia during the Centennial elebration, not only to participate therein, but to council together in regard to the pro posed revolution in their native land. If this gentleman and the "Father McNani ara" at the head of that secret revolution ary society which was exposed in New York a short time ago, are one and the same person, it would be well for the Irish men to be very cautious in4regard to acting under his leadership. BEGISTEB OF THE SALISA LAND OFFICE The editorof the Salina Herald this week publishes over one column of extracts ta ken from State exchanges, speaking in com plimentary terms of Mr. B. J. F. Hanna, for Register of the Salina Land Office. No gentleman in the State is more modest cr retiring, and none more deserving of a good office. If his brethren of the press can aid him, Mr. Hanna is sure of the ap pointment, as the Junction City Union, To peka Commonvcalth, Sumner County Irett, Abilene Chronicle, Osborne County Farmer, Wyandotte Gaulie, Oskaloosa Independent, Hays Sentinel, Waierville Telegraph, Man hattan SationaluJ, Solomon GczeUe and Leavenworth Times, have all strongly en dorsed him. A CHANGE The Atchison Patriot has changed hands. Mr. Nelson Abbott retires, and is succeeded by Messrs. Park, Vandegrift and Peters. The Pairiet i much improved in appear ance, but politically is as unclean as ever. The Champion compliments the new firm, and assures it that there is room for two daily papers at Atchison. We trust that the Patriot will succeed. TAXATIOH OF CHTJBCH PBOPEBTY. Editor Times: Since we, who warmly cherish equal rights or genuine Republi canism, have been greatly surprised to find in our President's message the recommend ing, as a matter of justice, the taxation of ecclesiastical property with other estate, corporate and private; since by such a rec ommendation, legislators, not only in Washington, but Congressmen in every State that has not already amended by striking off this exemption clause, can no longer overlook this question, it may be in order to state for the information of- Leav enworth citizens that this exemption of church property from taxation, coU every city tax-payer the sum of four mills for every dollar of tax assessed valuation that is, were church property taxed the same as other property, our city tax charge would be four mills lighter; county and State tax would also be reduced in propor tion. Anyone who may doubt this can easily find it to be the fact by consulting the pub lished and booked statistical figures. Yet here we are, as a nation, within but a lew months of our century" birthday, aad haveCthroagh all the past yean, been .' - vg'. - .y.TAj. boasting that our constitutional form of government realized to American citizens equal rights, and it seems to have taken the kick direct of these oppressive time, to open our eyes to the fact that we are not j emancipated from the thrall of those old I ill-governing monarchial theocracies, tho-e um xasnioneu insuiuttous iiuui huiui, h may be said, Americanism in protest sprang. By such protest, as a nation, did we not enter upon the arena of the world's nations, the special champion of free and equal rights? Is it not fitting, then, that we start into our second century in a mare consistent shape? The principle assumed in such a recom mendation as this of taxing church holdings the same as other property which now bears t e State expense alone, the principle being that of a more perfect justice realized, will involve, as well, all exemptions outside of State and municipal contiol, to-wit : that of science, the literary, educational, benevo lent an 1 charitable institutions, saving, per haps, that of reserve to each family, (see Kansas State Constitution), in whatever State such reservations are made. If such reservations are errors in our professed gov ernmental order, may they all be held to aciuunt, and the coast cleared by one move? The sooner the better. X. 0U2 

BEPBESEHTATIVES AT WOBK A Correspondent writing to the Wichita Eayle from Washington, speaks highly of Senator Ingalls. He writes, as an index of the standing of Senator Ingalls in the National capital, that "lie had not been in Washing ton more than half an hour before the news was spread over the city and at the Depart ineats, that Senator Ingalls, from Kansas, had arrived, in him Kansas ha a repre- sentative possessing ability and influence. The correspondent also says that Con gressman Wni. A. Phillips, from the First district, is at the capital. He and Senator Ingalls aie both busy looking after the in terest, of their constituents. Alex. Banks, for years Chief Clerk of the Kansas House of Representatives, is now private secretary to Senator Ingalls, and chief clerk of the committee on pension', of which the Sena tor is chairman. WHAT IS THE KATTEB 1 The Leavenworth Times is continually finding fault with Kansas people for pat ronizing Kansas City, but if we tell Platte cotintians to trade at home and let Leaven worth alone, the boot is on the other leg, and The Times don't seem to think that the sauce that sids the goose to materially will add anything to the excellencies of the gander. You know, Colonel, there are times when an editor, as well as a minister, could benefit himself by following his own ad vice. Westcn ComzierciaL Last week the Ccrnimercieu" endeavored to prejudice Platte countians against our city, by te'Iingits readeia that a Platte county firm was not fairly treated by the Peniten tiary Board of Directors. We answered the Commercial, showing it that that there was only one Leavenworth man on the Board, Mr. Gillett, and tlie Commercial it self admits that he voted in fav,r of the Platte county mill. The Commercial must rerrcnibtr that Leavenworth and Platte county have interests in common, while tlte great Slate of Kansjs. and Kansas City have none. Kansas City absorbs our wealth and offers us nothing in return. Leavenworth merchants have always treat ed their Missouri friends well, and have enjoyed the friendship and good will of the Platte City and Plattsburg papcis. What nils the Commercial ! Mr. Kerr, tue ntw Speakc-, is a tall, stately man, more than six feet in height, broad-shouldered, with a head well poised, a full growth of brown hair, and eyes that seem to read you through at a glance. His scholarship is of the highest o.der; books are his dealest companions, and his judg ment of men is keen and discriminating. The man is wholly practical. There is no element of humor or romance about him, and his manners are dignified almost to au sterity. He is 47 years old. Georgia is gradually filling up with cot ton factories, which continue to arise oc every hand. The Memphis Amlanche, in noticing the latest enterprise of this kind, predicts that the time is not far distant when a very large proportion of the cotton grown in the South will be manufactured at home, not only for domestic supply, but for export. The Democrats of other States waver, but those of Kentucky remain tiue and stead fast in their allegiance to the ancient faith. Some of the farmers of that State are sell ing their entire corn crops to distillers, to be paid for in whisky. The Columbus Democrat is not willing to give President Grant credit for his prosecu tion of the "whisky thieves"' of course Mr. Erislow is entitled to the praie- But may we ask who appoints the Secretary of the Tieasury, and sustains him in his woik? Ir is reported that the Grangers of the Northwest, at a recent meeting in Chicago, resolved to nominate a candidate for Presi dent. This is in violation of the principles of the order. It will be seen by his communication that our Winfield correspondent intends, in his next letter to The Times, to discuss the Herd Law. His views will be worthy of confident ion. Ix place of being ?200,000,000, as some placed it, the late William B. Astor'a es tate is computed by the New York Herald to figure up not more than 

S43,OO0,O0O in value. "Whek Henry Wilson made shoes, we learn from the Boston Traveller, he was the most expert workman at Natick. This was practical ambition beginning at the com mencement, and it always wins. Glekdenxixo, sometimes known as the New Jersey Beechcr, the alleged seducer of Mary Pomeroy, is now pastor of a parish in Henry, Illinois, and is said to be preaching acceptably to large congregations. Cardisal McCloskey reports the Pope as hale and hearty. He says that when they were walking together in the Vatican gardens, it was himself whom weariness first compelled to suggest sitting down. Growiso. The Colored Methodist Epis copal Church has now four bishops and a membership of 200,000 in the Southern and Western States. Yoc should never tell a man that he liea. Simply remark that he is guilty of heterophemy and drop the subject if he'll let you. MON-cox D. Coxway agrees with Spur geon in declaring that Moody and Saokey's work in Eogland has left no permanent re sults. The President's message meets with the endorsement of all honest, fair-minded citi zens. The election of Kerr for Speaker, instead of Randall, is a set back to Tom Scoll'a I Southern Pacific subsidy.
