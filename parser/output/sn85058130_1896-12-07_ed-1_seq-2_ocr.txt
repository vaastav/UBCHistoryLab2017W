FIVE EDITORS The best journalists of Germany those whose probity cannot be im peached are hopeful that the grand est result from the revelations of the trial of the five editors Baron Von Luetzow and Herren Ploetz Foellmar Leckert and Berger for libelling Baron I MarschaJl Von Bieberstein Prince Alexander Von Hohenlohe and Count August Eulenberg will be the extinc tion of the gang of members of the German press who are feeding upon doubtful official information I larger latitude were allowed t press criticism less corruption would be practiced the independence of the press would be greater and the position of earnest and selfrespecting journalists would be en hanced While the foreign office or any others of the governments denart ments continue to influence the news papers in inciting them to publish this that or the other bribing newspaper men by giving them information which is sometimes true and often false ac cording to the interests of the depart ment furnishing it there is little hope of reform of the existing abuses The leading public men who are getting their names smirched by the revela tions of the present trial may be led to recognize the fact that their sup port of the representative of the press hurts themselves more than i hurts anybody else A protracted conference was held last evening at the chancel lors between the imperial chancellor Prince Von Hohenlohe Baron Mar schall Von Bieberstein minister of foreign affairs Dr Schonstadt minister e justice and Frieherr Von Der Recke Von Der Horst minister of the in terior The conference was held at the command of the kaiser for the pur pose of arranging a limit to the de velopments of the trial of Baron Von Luetzaw and his associate defendants as for reasons of state it is regarded by jthe emperor a desirable that the rev Iations shall not be pursued much if any further I is whispered that Baron Von Tausch the chief of the political police who will probably be accused of being accessory to the forgeries and frauds committed by Baron Von Luetzow had backers of the highest influence in connection with the part he took in the scandalous acts and it is rumored that this fact fur nishes one of the strongest reasons for a desire to suppress further revela tions tons 

KAISER HEINRICH AND SUNK EN BELL Apart from the trial of the live edi tors and the scandals attached thereto the chief topic of discussion in Berlin social circles grows out of the circum stances of the production of Wilden bruchs Kaiser Heinrich at the Berliner theatre on Tuesday last and Gerhardt Hauptmanns Sunken Bell o at the Deutsch theatre on Wednesday Since the emperor awarded the two Schiller prizes to Wildenbruch over ruling the decision of the committee in favor of Hauptmann the feud which broke out among the partisans of the two authors has become most acute The emperor favored Wildenbruch and aesthetic Berlin especially of the young German school were fanatically in favor Hauptmann In consequence seats for the first nights at both theatres were selling at a premium for weeks in advance as high as 20 marks being pzid merely for standing room in the Berliner theatre by the cream of Tterlin The emperor and empress gave the signal for the applause which at the same time was a spontaneous as it was strong Kaiser HUnrich Js a powerful work 1 though possibly l is not Wilden bruchs est The emperor personally congratulated Wildenbruch at the con clusion of te performance II The Deutsch threatre was packed 1 c J ta r IH b < with a less aristocratic but more en thusiastic audience than that which filled the Berliner theatre and the ap plause was almost continuous Herr

chemists and others were called as expert witnesses among them Professor Gaffk = 7 of the Giessen Hy gienic institute and their testimony persuaded the court to decide that al though a small portion

MACKAY GOING HOME He Has a String of Thoroughbred Believes Business Will Improve Chicago De 6John W Mackay the California millionaire registered at the Wellington today He was on his way from Lexington to his ranch near Sacramento with the string of 34 thoroughbreds which he purchased at the combination sale held at Lexing ton last week Among them were the stallion Ornament for which he paid 26000 and Candlemass the brother of St Blaise which cost him 15000 The string altogether represented over 100000 They were conveyed in a special train of six Burton cars Mr Mackay with a party of friends traveled in a special car In each of the cars conveying the horses was an attendant The train left at 550 over the Burlington and will then travel over the Central and Union Pacific roads Mr Mackay said the Lexing ton sale was a successful one the sae prices obtained being beter than at any sale for a long time He was of the opinion it presaged an advance in the prices of thoroughbreds He believed the business outlook was decidedly promising and that a steady improve ment was to be expected from now on He said the result of the election ex emplified the truth of the statement made by John Stuart Mill the Eng lish economist that The American people had the unfortunate habit of going off at times on some wild finan cial heresy but had the good furtune to get right at the critical moment I FIVE MEN KILLED HeadEnd Between Southern Pacific Freight Trains New York Dec 7r4 Herald special from Houston Tex says A headend collision between two Southern Pacific freight trains occurred

EVENT IX THE HIS TORY OF THE COUNTRY J It Must Not Be Msitic a Bankers Con vention or lL Bankers Commis sion Tlibiifrh It Is Proposed That Their Interests Shall Be Protected in Conjunction With Others Indianapolis Ind Dec 6The move ment of the business interests of the country toward national currency re form upon wholly nonpartisan lines which has resulted in a call by the commercial organizations of the cen tral west for a convention in this city in January promises to become one of the notable things in the history of the country I is doubtful whether any of the delegates to the conference last week have any idea of the breadth of the plan Mr Hugh H Hanna chairman of the executive committee has in mind for accomplishing this reform During the conference there developed a sharp line of difference between those favor ing the adoption of a currency plan by the convention which is to meet on Jan 12 and those who believe that that convention should simply discuss I the various plans presented and refer the whole matter to a commission This difference of opinion did not crop put until the closing hour of the session and then i was too late to go into the subject intelligently M E Ingalls of Cincnnat was the most forceful ad vocate of the idea that the convention should endorse a plan He did this upon the very reasonable theory that congress would pay more attention to a large and representative commission even though the commission repre sented the convention Mr Hanna led that portion of the conference believing that a commis sion should be appointed Nothing however is further from his mind than that this commission after completing its work of devising a currency plan should go down to Washington and beg a hearing before committees and ask this member and that member to favor the bill I am convinced that we should have a commission said he in conversing with a reporter for the United Associ ated Presses today This is not a question upon which a large convention can make an intelligent decision in a day or in a week This is a matter that will require two or three months possibly six months continuous work and thought Every plan presented I should be carefully weighed and out of all that comes before the commission I believe i will be able to evolve some thing that every intelligent business man can heartily endorse I think a long step In this direction will be made if this convention should select a com mission composed of the very greatest and best men we have in the country We could afford to pay well for the services of those who could not other wise afford to devote the necessary time to the work Then when the com mission has finished its work the larg est part of our duty remains to be done in the thorough organization and con I centration of the business of the coun try behind the measure This is a mat ter of so much importance that we can afford to do this great as the under taking is Instead of sending a com mittee to Washington to ask a con gressional committee for a hearing we should when a bill that we can all indorse is evolved ask our representa tive to come home for consultation with his constituents If the members of congress with large business con stituencies can be thus thoroughly in formed as to the desires of the men who were potential in their election I do not believe there would be any doubt about the enactment of the meas ure into law I do not want to see it made a bankers convention or 3 I bankers commission though I want to see their interests as well as other business interests represented We want to solve this problem for the whole people not for any particular class of people or for any particular line of business I PART OF THE MESSAGE I IT WILL REFER TO THE VENE ZUELAN BOUNDARY DISPUTE Good Reason to Believe That the Troubles Will Be Amicably Set tled and All Through the Good Olllccs of the Imited States OII I Washington Dec 6The probable I assent of Venezuela in the proposed treaty of arbitration of the British Guiana boundary dispute negotiated through the good offices of the United States and the practical conclusion of a general arbitration convention be tween Great Britain and the United States it is stated will form two of the most important diplomatic announce I ments in the presidents message to congress What is understood to be in nearly all essential particulars a copy of the pre I liminary agreement entered into some weeks between Secretary Olney and SirJulian Pauncefote in the Venezue lan matter is made public The draft of the proposed treaty itself which the Venezuelan minister Mr Andrade car ried with him to Caracas to lay before his government is more elaborate than this agreement I starts with a pre amble of considerable length and in that portion which refers to the fifth year occupation of the territory in dis pute embodies other points besides mere occupancy and political control which will be taken into consideration by the tribunal These are expressed I in technical terms which international I lawyers will understand but which would not be readily comprehended by others Advces received from Caracas do not bear the impression that the Venezuelan cabinet is dissatisfied with the treaty or that Minister Andrade who will shortly return to the United States will bring with him the draft of a new treaty as modified by the Venezuelan authorities On the contrary there are grounds for the belief that President Crespo and his advisers have given their full adhesion to the proposed treaty Under these circumstances it will be signed by Minister Andrade representing the South American representng re public and by Sir Julian Pauncefote on the part of Great Britain after which the United States will drop out of the matter well satisfied to have been the medium of bringing the two countries together and of effecting a settlement of their long dispute through the peaceful channels of an I international board of arbitration I was only in this way it is asserted I on high authority that such authoriy a con clusion could have been reached as diplomatic relations between Venezuela and Great Britain have long been sus pended and It was well known that her majestys government would not consent that Venezuela should have any choice in the selection of the board While It is entirely true that the ratification fication of the treaty must still depend upon the will of the Venezuelan con gress no doubt is felt that that body will endorse President Crespos acton f < p In regard 108 general treaty of arbi tration by the United States and Great Britain it is stated that the presidents message will show that the negotia tions are practically concluded and that it will be the presidents pleasure within a few weeks at the utmost to lay the treaty before the senate for its consideration I is fin ished now excepting a few matters of details that are still the subject of cotrespondence but respecting

Special Correspondence New York Dec 2At any time now the long threatened rebellion in Porto Rico against the domination of Spain is likely to break out The agents of the many secret societies existing in this West Indian island have been working planning plotting and wait ing in this city for nearly a year and they say that the time is almost ripe to strike the blow for Independence Spain I has known of this condition of affairs from the beginning and has done every thing within the limited force of her crippled resources to meet the shock when It comes But these preparations are insignificant and the lapse of time does not add to their efficiency Delay is the policy of the men who are engineering the Porto Rico rebel lion They know that every day weak ens the aggressive power of Spain that the war in Cuba and the insur rection in the Philippine Islands have demoralized her finances that the fighting material of the mother country lias been drawn upon almost to the last man and that the navy is fully em ployed in the wars on opposite sides of the world Long ago the Cuban leaders urged the Porto Ricans to begin the strife and incessant pressure has been ex erted upon them for more than a year but the Porto Ricans want to make quick work of the struggle They pre fer to wait until Cuba has completed the demoralization of the Spanish forces and then they argue the task wi be an easy one The Cuban lead ers claim they would have driven the Spanish out of the island long ago had Porto Rico began the contest at an early date for the two rebellions would have divided the fighting strength of the enemy THE TIME NEAR AT HAND The repeated failures of the Spanish leaders to accomplish anything in the Philippine Islands or Cuba and par ticularly the showing made by General Weyler in the Pinar del Rio campaign have had the effect of hastening the work of the Porto Rican struggle The leaders of the latter do not intend to wait until the Insurrection Is ended in either Cuba or the Philippines their policy being to strike when Spain is at her greatest disadvantage This time has now come it is thought so the long threatened struggle may begin before the end of the year Should Spain lose Cuba and Porto Rica it will be the absolute end of her once great dominion in the western hemisphere One by one she has lost all of the countries which now make up the South American republics Cuba and Porta Rica being the only ones left Cuba has almost finished the task of breaking the Spanish yoke and Por to Rica counts upon a short struggle For its size Porto Rica is
