At the open ing of today's session it was deter mined to give an hour to the considera tion of pension bills. Vest, of Missouri, said: "I do not want to be captious about this pension business, and do not want to set myself up as a reformer but this thing of passing a lot of pen sion bills simply by reading the titles when a quorum of the senate Is not present has got to be stopped. Recent events have obliterated sectionalism and we are united. We can, therefore. come here and object to this spoliation. I nss the word advisedly, without fear of having our motives impugned or our words misconstrued. We are pay ing out la round figures $141,000,000 annually for pensions. It is our duty to find out why, thlrty-threa years after the close of the civil war, this thing of pension claims shows such an enormous sum. I have been criticised by some of my people because I have not taken a more determined stand on this pension ques tion. I want, however, to pay liberally pensions, I regard such payment as a sacred duty, but I do object to the pas sage of these bills without a proper consideration and with the same re striction hedged about other measures. Gallinger of Netf Hampshire as chairman of the pension committee, agreed with Ve3t In a desire to have the pension bills carefully considered. lie thought a quorum of the senate ought to be in attendance when the pension calandar was considered. During the consideration of the bills on the pension calandar Caffery, of Lousiana, introduced a resolution de claring it the sense of the senate that the "president enter into negotiations with the government of Great Britain for the purpose of abrogating or modi fying the Clayton-Uulwer treaty in so far and to the extent that the same may be deemed to prevent the United States from owning, constructing, controlling or operating any oceanic canal across the Isthmus of Darien." Senator Ve3t Introduced a resolution providing for the appointment of a joint commission to investigate the charges of corruption in the conduct of the war with Spain. The resolution calls for the appointment of three senators and five members of the house. I Senator Morgan moved to take up the Micaraguan canal bill. A motion to adjourn was made by Petiigrew. The bill was then taken up. The tenate then adjourned, on motion of Senator Morgan, till Monday next. THE 

HOUSE. On motion of Chairman Cannon, the appropriations committee went into committee of tks whole to consider the urgency deficiency bill for the support of the military and naval establish ment during the six months beginuing Jan. 1, 1899. "The bill gave rise to a long debate on Increase in the size of the army and the muster out of volunteers. A number of Democrats insisted ' that the bill would enable the , President to retain the volunteers in service after peace was declared. Dicker? and Sayers, leading Democrats of the appropria tions committee, defended the bill and eaid it could not be construed to modify the volunteer law, Rae, of Arkansas, announced his purpose to move an amendment specifically declaring the' bill should not have such effect, The house finally passed the urgent defi ciency bill.
