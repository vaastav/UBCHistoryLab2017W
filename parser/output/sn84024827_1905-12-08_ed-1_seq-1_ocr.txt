Graf. Of the thirteen members con stituting the board seven were pres ent. Mr. Frank Graf, Mr. H. A Smith, Mr. Walter Douglas and others were out of the city. The mosf Important matter discuss ed by the Board last evening was a re duction in the membership fee, which was fixed by the Chamber of Com merce originally at $25,000. Mr. Geo. Buxton, C. E. Rinehart, W. P. IcNalr and others stated that in their opinion s much larger and more effective or ganization could be secured by reduc ing the membership fee to five or ten dollars per month, and allowing the monthly dues of $1.00 per month to re- main. In this connection Mr. McNalr gave notice that at a meeting of the Chamber of Commerce, which has been called for next Thursday evening, he would submit an amendment to the by-laws fixing the membership fee at ten dollars. It is not unlikely that an amendment to the amendment will be offered on this occasion reducing the membership fee to five dollars. In this connection it is argued that the organization would carry more strength if on its membership rolls could be found all of the business men and property owners of the communi ty, both large and small, even if they did not take an active interest in the work to be carried on. than to fix a membership fee. which by some would bo considered excessive. . J. T. Hood, president, announced the chairmen of the various committees and the additional four members on each committee will be announced at the meeting of all members of the Chamber of Commerce to be held Thursday evening next.

PATENT FEES RETURNED. Commissioner Allen Corrects State ments of Supreme Court Justice. Washington, Dec. 7. "No fees paid Into the patent office are refunded,' said Commissioner of Patents Allen today. "An interview recently print ed in The Chicago-Record, in which a justice of the Supreme Court of the United States is quoted as saying that 'if the government finds that he (the applicant) is not entitled to a patent his fee is returned to him,' has brought upon this office a flood of letters from people whose applications for a patent have been rejected and who ask to have their money returned. "The justice discusses at some length defects which do not exist in our patent laws. He says. 'The gov ernment has been put to the trouble of looking up the applicant's right to be granted a patent. The govern ment should be paid for its trouble; it -should not refund the money for conscientious work done.' 'The- government does not refund under any circumstances, the fee paid when an application for a patent is filed. This money is retained as compensation for the work done in searching and determining whether the applicant is entitled to a patent. The filing fee is $15, and when an ap plication is allowed the patent is is sued upon th payment of a final fee of $20." o BROUGHT $71,000. Sire of Some Noted Turf Performers Brings Handsome Figure.

K . . . , . . , V, K K K ft ft ft ft ft ft Washington, Dec. 7. The subject of campaign contributions by the insurance companies occupied the major portion of the session of the Senate today. It came up with Mr. Tillman's resolution calling for investigation of the National Bank's aid in politics, and was ex ploited by the South Carolina Senator In a speech of some length. The address dealt with the president's recommendations for the punishment of bribery in elections, with Senator Piatt's testimony before the New York investigating committee, and with various other pertinent points. A resolution directing the Secretary of the Treasury to report whether reports of the National Bank examin ers show that the banks have made campaign contributions in re cent years was adopted at the close of Mr. Tillman's remarks. A large number of bills were introduced, among them being the joint etatehood bill. ft ft K ft ft ft ft ft ft ft ft ft ft ft ft ftft ft ft ft ft ft ft ft ft ft ft ft ft ft ft ft Washington. Dec. 7. An appropria tion of $11,000,000.00 was voted today by the house toward construction of thePanama canal. The amount was a compromise between the $16,500,000 carried in the bill under consideration and an estimate of something over $C 000,000 recommended by Mr. Williams, the Democratic leader, to carry on the work until the middle of January. Mr Hepburn, in charge of the bill, suggpsted that something over $11, 000,000 woaW carry on the work until March. There was no intention man ifest to delay the- work, the only argu ment for cutting down the original es timate " being that closer scrutiny might be kad of the estimate. The bill was amended in accordance with suggestion by Mr. Mann, directing the president to require the annual re ports from the canal construction offi cers covering all details of the work, and 'requiring such employes to give to Congress any information it desir ed, and restricting all expenditures to money appropriated by Congress, and to that received, by operation of the Panama railroad. Otherwise the bill was not amended. It contained besides the appropriation a provision recommending tax disabili ty against the proposed, bonds to boj issued for construction of the canal, thus placing the bonds on footing with, other government bonds as available for security for National banks' circu lation, and to reimburse the treasury' for money appropriated In the bill. The bond provision was the point of attack today. Mr. Williams offered several unsuccessful amendments, all seeking to abandon the policy of issu ing bonds for canal work, on the ground that there is sufficient availa ble funds in the treasury to meet all needs. Mr. Overstreet did not succeed with an amendment providing that $10,000, 000 already expended in canal con btructlon might bo refunded to the treasury from sale -of the canal bonds. The bond policy of the two parties re sulted in limited political discussions. Secretary Taft, accompanied by the auditor and purchasing agent of the canal commission, came to the capitol and remained available to give any in

The quinquennial census of the German Empire, taken yesterday, is expected to reveal that the population exceeds 61,000,000, against 5S,345,000 in 1900.

CURT JOINTURE Scathing Criticism of the Action Proposed for the Territories BIG FIGHT IS ASSURED Correspondent Says the Bill will Afford the Hot Act ion of the Session Chicago, Dec. 7. William E. Cum, the famous Washington correspondent of the Chicago Record-Herald, tele graphs the following from the capital: "The most entertaining legislative feature of Congress is not going to be the railway rate bill, but the fight over the admission of the Territories to the Union. In his message the President recommends the passage of the senate bill making two states out of the four territories, notwithstanding the earn est protests that have been made against it by the inhabitants. He e idently is making his recommendation, on the theory that new states will be 'rotten boroughs,' and that the fewer we have of them ihe better. He evi dently expects that four bad men like 'Bull' Andrews, of New Mexico, who is now lighting for his liberty in Pitts burg, will be elected senators, from the new btates, and that, it is better to have four such men than eight. But nobody has. yet been able to explain why it is necessary to force Arizona, and New Mexico into the Union to gether when an overwhelming major ity of- the population of both Territo ries are opposed to It. "Senator Beveridge, who has charge of the bill, taVes the ground that the inhabitants of the Territories hate nothing whatever to say about the mat ter, that the Constitution confers upon Congress the authority to make states, whenever it likes out of any material., it has at hand, without reference ta the wishes of those most interested. That the responsibility, be says, must be exercised with a view to the future land not to the present, anil Congress, and particularly his committee, by some pow?r of divination, is able to de termine what is best for the welfare of the future immigrants to the territo ries as well as for the present popula tion. "The iwople- of Indian Territory' and Oklahoma have practically settled down into submission to the will of the President and the Republican Sena tors, but SO if not 93 per cent of the population of Arizona and New Mexico will be heard from against joint state hood before Congress hps time to pass the bill. Petitions wilt come from "both Territories, begging Congress not to force joint statehood upon an unwill ing people, and they must have their effect. Committees from both Terri tories will come to Washington shortly to protest against the Beveridge bilL And you may be sure that nobody will come from either territory to ask Its passage except a delegation from Albu querque, which hopes to be the joint capital, and some others who are per sonally interested. "During the past summer several in fluential members of the House oC Representatives have been down there to investigate the situation for them selves, and evry one of them has come back convinced that neither New Mexico nor Arizona is ready for' state hood, and that the population of both are almost unanimously against the passage of the joint statehood bill. "Thinking men of both territories who have no selfish interests at stakt. have suggested that the best solution of the problem is to postpone the agi tation for statehood for the next five years, and then Congress can take up the matter again and do what seems to be right. "The property loss alone Incident on Jointure, would be enormous. The abandonment of two capitals for a new one more centrally located, the aban donment of one Stale University, one penitentiary, etc., and the private val ues thereby affected would be incalcu lable."
