Twenty of the young men sent to Camp Lewis with the draft contin gents from this county were rejected at the camp for physical reasons and have been discharged, according to official notification received by the local board this week.

Harrow, Claud Allen Jackson, Charles Leland Johnson, ilarry B. Keller, Walter M. Lohr, Hatton D. Loughman, James D. Mc- Arthur, Clifford Miller, Arley Deen Mills. Clarence H. # Morris, Ray D.

LET CONTRACT FOR TEMPLE THIS WEEK CAPITOL COMMISSIONERS WANT TO INSPECT OTHER BUILD INIJS FIRST. Contract for completion of the Temple of Justice by facing the ex terior will probably be let by the capitol commission Friday or Satur day, following an inspection of build ings in nearby cities constructed of the different kinds of stone suggested by contractors for use on the Temple. The construction will start within a short time thereafter. Six bids for the work were opened by the commission last Monday, and 10 different combinations of granite and sandstone were offered. The commission, in calling for bids, left the kind of stone for the facing up to the - contractors, specifying only that the base should be granite. The lowest bid on the granite base and sandstone was submitted by the E. C. Peters company of Seattle, being $157,118 on Boise, Idaho, sandstone. The Tenlno Stone com pany of Tenlno offered to put its sandstone on a granite base for $210,000, while the Puget Sound Bridge & Dredging company offered the same combination for $207,000. This company was also the lowest bidder on the all granite construc tion, its price being $278,500. Samples of the different kinds of stone proposed were submitted to the commissioners, who later decided to inspect some buildings construct ed of the different materials and note their appearance after several years' exposure. Bids for the interior finishing of the Temple are to be opened later this month. •I< •!* *l* »j, v v '!* •!* ❖ A VICIOUS RUMOR. * ❖ ❖ ❖ "Among the tnany absurd •> and vicious rumors put into •> ❖ circulation these days, probably ❖ ❖ through pro-German Influences, •}• Is one that the United States ❖ pro|H>ses to confiscate money on <■ v deposit in hanks.

Arrange Eemergency Signals. Realizing the fact that an emer gency might arise which would 're quire the hurried calling out of the local Home Guard, .arrangements are being'made by Captain E. A.

The proposal that the local company become identified with the new regiment of state militia is not generally favored by the mem bers. "HEW TO THE LINE; LET THE CHIPS FALL WHERE THEY MAY." OLYMPIA, WASHINGTON, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1917. COLOR OF PASS NO HINT AS TO SOLOIER'S HEALTH Merely Indicates Conformity to Mili tary Rules, Colonel Savllle Explains. The color of the pass carried by the soldiers visiting Olympia, wheth er the card is blue, pink or white, has nothing whatever to do with their physical condition but is mere ly indicative of the extent to wnich they conform to military discipline, Colonel Saville. head of the military police at Camp Lewis, told Mayor Jesse T. Mills and Police Chief Harry Cusack Wednesday. The local officials informed Use army officer of the stories that have been going the rounds locally, par ticularly with reference to the men bearing white passes. and th»- Colonel is reported to have been ut terly flabbergasted. When he re covered he explained that a man would receive a white pass Instead of a blue one for some infraction of military discipline, such as a button missing from his uniform or un shlned shoes, while a man might be given a pink pass for being late ip reporting for duty. The blue pa£ men are those who have conformed to military rules in every particular. "No man who is not physically well is permitted to leave the camp" Colonel Saville said. "The color of the passes merely indicates how well the men are living up to military dis cipline." READY TO DECLARE WAR WITH AUSTRIA CONGRESS PREPARES TO ACT OX WILSON'S RECOMMEND ATION. With a resolution before the house for action Friday, approved by President Wilson and Secretary of State Lansing, congress has paved the way for prompt response to the president's call for a declaration of war with Austria-Hungary, dating from Wednesday noon, and it is ex pected that it will pass both houses by the first of next week. Reconfmendatlons that congress declare recognition of a state of war with Germany's chief ally was a feature of the president's annual message to congress, delivered Tues day afternoon, in which he also made a definite statement to the world of America's aims and of the basis upon which peace will be considered. Referring to Turkey and Bulgaria —also .Germany's tools—he coun seled delay as to war declarations, because "they did not yet stand in the direct path of our necessary ac tion." To win the war, the president de clared in emphatic and ringing tones, is the immediate and unalterable task ahead. He urged congress to concentrate itself upon it. The president sharply dismissed the possibility of premature peace, sought by German intrigue and de bated here by men who ho declared understand neither its nature nor the way it may be attained. With victory an accomplished fact, he said, peace will be evolved based upon "mercy and justice"—to enemy and friend—with hope of a partner ship of nations to guaranteo future world peace. The war will be deemed won, he declared, "when the German people say to us, through properly accred ited representatives, that they are ready to agree to a settlement based upon justice and reparation of the wrongs their rulers have done." E. N. Steele, a prominent local at torney and Democrat, was appointed a member of the Thurston County Game Commission this week by State Game Warden L. H. Darwin, to suc ceed Thomas M.

REGISTRANTS HAVE TILL DECEMBER IS TO ENLIST War Department Again Change* the Rules—Local Boards to Grant Permits. Once more the war department has changed its attitude on the matter of enlisting registered and certified men in this state who were not need ed to fill the state quota. Such men may now enlist in either army or navy, according to choice of service, until December 15. ' Permission had been previously granted an 9 later rescinded. The war department's latest order permit ting enlistment follows: "Between now and December 15 It is desired to afford registrants as ! wide an opportunity as possible to enlist in botfi army and navy; there fore, any registrant, even though he 1 hag been called by hi 3 local board to 'report for physical examination, may enlist until December 15, upon pre sentation to the United States re cruiting officer of a certificate from his local board that he will not be needed to fill any deferred percentage of the quota of that board, j "Regardless of re-examination of registrants under the new selective service regulations, each board | should keep available and should re i fuse permission to enlist to a suffi cient number of selected men to com plete deferred percentages of their quotas." iPRICE OF LUMBER i TO BE FIXED NEXT MANUFACTURERS TAKE PLAN UP WITH WAR INDUSTRIES BOARD. Lumber is the next basic commod ity to go through the government price-fixing process. Action in this connection will take place imme diately national capital dispatches say. Unlike government price-fixing in other lines the manufacturers are taking the initiative at least the West coast lumber manufacturers, they re garding government regulation of prices essential to war service effi ciency. R. B. Allen secretary of the Association, has had frequent con ferences with the war industries board regarding government regula tion. y The South's attitude on govern ment price-fixing'is not known, but there is likely to be some objection to the program from that source, especially since the West coast man ufacturers have coupled it up more or less with a proposition for a na tional eight-hour day within the lum ber industry. During the labor disturbances in this state last summer, the manufac turers said the.V favored\a national eight-Hour day. but could not grant the regional eight-hour day on ac count ( of competitive marketing con ditions in which the South, already having the advantage of lower wages, longer hours, shorter freight hauls a nd cheaper freight rates, would have a still further and added differ ential of $2.50 per thousand feet of lumber in favor of Southern mills. The West coast lumbermen are now making good their eight-hour day promise, but are uncovering con siderable opposition from the manu facturers of the South. Peddlers Must Have Liron.se*>.
