LEAGUE. Annual ftlertinv nl the I'nlon I.envue-Klec-llon ol' O direr. Ijisl evening the annual meeting of the Union Iague of Philadelphia was held at the League House, Broad and Sansom streets. After the transaction of the usual routine of business, the annual report was read, of which the following is an abstract: The Report commences with a eulogy of Gen eral Grant, and expresses satisfaction that no single act of the President looks like a depar ture irom me strictest principles ot tuo Union party. The policy of General Grant's adminis tration is then adverted to, and It Is claimed that it is characterized by honesty, economy, impar tiality, and wisdom. The report states: If the promises which the administration now gives be verified and it needs little more thau adherence to the present policy to bring that anoui wno may calculate tnewcaitti, tuo power, the political solidity, and the influence in the world's affairs to which our country will attain within the life of a generation of men ? The bonds which hold together these States are stronger to-day than they have ever been slnco tho adoption of tho Federal Constitution. As far as the eye may look, we can seo no cause. however distant, that may again threaten the Union. ' Wo have had reason to rejoice, with onr fel low members of the In Ion party, at three im portant events which have taken place in our Mate since tue last annual meeting of the League: the passage of a constitutional Rcsrls- try law, the decision of tho courts in tho con tested election eases, and tho re-election of our candidates for Governor and Supreme Judge. In the early part of tho summer a single point of public Interest Invited and received the attention ot tue Hoard. 1 he Danisninent of the heads of Washington and Jackson from the postage stamps most in use, and the remarkable substitution of the representations of a locomo tive engine ana a mounted post-boy iu their places, had been publicly criticized in the League with great dissatisfaction and regret, and subsequently tho subject was brought directly to the attention of tho board. In such an uu worthy change we were satlstied tho administration of President Grunt had taken no part. Tho new stamps had been prepared by the contractors under President Johnson. A committee was appointed to communicate to the Postmaster-General what the board bclievod to be the general feeling in the League on the subject, and such a representation was accord ingly made. I he miscarriage ot his letter ap pears to have deprived tho Board of the receipt of the Postmaster-General's acknowledgment of our communication. Wo learn, however, that the memorial of the committee was received, and its suggestions carefully considered. We have reason to suppose that our views coincided with those ot the rostmaster-ueucrai, as we have the satisfaction to learn that new dies arc now in preparation, and five profile and five full lace heads ot Washington, Hamilton, r rank.hu. Jackson, and Lincoln are to be substituted for tho ten denominations ot stamps, ana that the present stamps are to bo withdrawn as soon as possible. mo report oi tuo ubrary committee exhibits a sensible and proper activity in that depart ment. Lost year the Board of Directors made an appropriation of two thousand dollars for the purchase of books, and this year they have ap propriated twenty-nve nunarea aoiiars lor tho same purpose, with these appropriations the foundations of a library have been laid. Tho total uuiubcr of volumes now in tho library amounts to twenty-six hundred and ci'-'htv-nine. Tho roll of the League, on tho first day of De cember, 1800, contaiued tho names of one thou sand eight hundred and fifty-eight members. Of this number, ninety-three were eleeted since the date of the last report. We have lost since that date, sixty-eight members by resignation, twenty oy death, ana tuiriy-uino were suspended lor non-payment oi their annual dues. The reports of tho Treasurer and of the Audi tors for tho year lSti'J are now upon tho table for examiuatiou. The income of the Leutruo for tho year ending on the first of December, 1800, was inly thousand and eighty-two dollars and lifty elgtit cents, which, added to the surplus of the previous year, amounts to sixty-seven thousand, nine hundred aud sixty-two dollars aud thirty- six cent. The disbursements for the same pe riod were lorty-seven thousand, nve hundred and ninety-eight dollars ana one cent, leaving a surplus of twenty thousand, three hundred and si.xiy-l'onr dollars and thirty-fivo cents. Thoro is no indebtedness outstanding to diminish this amount, faking into consideration the nourish ing condition of our treasury, the directors have lixed the anuual tax for tho following year at twenty-iivo dollars. t An election ol otneers for tho ensuing year was then proceeded with, and after an exciting coiiK'ft tlio following ticket was elccted:- I'KESinKNT.
