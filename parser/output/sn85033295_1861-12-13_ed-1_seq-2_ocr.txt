The Victory in New York. Our readers have already learned that Opdyke, Republican, has been elected may or, by plurality, in New York. The na tional metropolis has always exerted a powerful influence upon the nation. To tho commercial body New York has been what Washington is to tbe political body. Although the heart is radically diseased, there may he soundness in other parts, and even it may be restored ; such being the indication *f present spmptoms. Com merce and politics generally’go hand in hand ; and lienee it is not strange that, while the Black g od, Slavery, has hereto- fore reigned in both Washington and Naw I York, both cities alike, in both moral and 1 political character, have been exceedingly \ despicable. Is it not a little remarkable that, no sooner is the head.of the Black Dragon at Washington bruised by a Re publican Administration, than, at the very next municipal election in New York, the Black Dynasty of Fernando Wood, Slave ry and the D 1, is put to rout. The triple headed monster may writhe, and skulk, and squirm, and, by cunning and perjury over the halLt box, pervert its utterances ; but this characteristic devei opmen‘ will, in the end, tend only to con firm the popular verdict which has inau gurated anew divinity over the million oit}'. Not only as a national omen, hut also as a matter of great local interest and import ance, this victory can scarcely be over es timated. Ancient Ninevah, to which the ancient prophet who was swallowed by a whale was sent to proclaim its destruc tion, in point of mental ami moral degra dation, probably was a mere pigmy, in comparison to New York. Its surging and seething mass of corruption may well he comj arsd with the firey mass which frets and fumes in the great heart of the earth, from which the smoke and lava of volca noes proceed, to say nothing of the bot tomless pit, of which New York corruption has long been an apt symbol. Were the readeE to spend a wholo month, in simply glancing an eye into the homes of this do mestic, social and moral pollution, consti tuting hut an hundredth part of the sick ening aggregate; could only a tythe of the multitude of rag-pickers, and of the brothels, high and low, which diverge and extend from that great Cancer, denomina ted ‘the Five Points,” he seen by him, he would then have only a key to the subject. And by such forces—almost as bad and morally terrible as the monster rebel army—Fernando Wood has long ru led New Fork. No wonder then that, had the world listened, it might have beard the same Angelic Choir that sung at the Advent, when Fernando was ousted. Truly, the World moves !—there is profit in labor, the day of deliverance draws nigh- M 0 really hope that, while steam is up. and the Grand Train is moving majestical ly onward, some kind hand may just take hold of the cord that draws our city and hitch it on, just as the hoys in our streets drag their sleds by the passing vehicles. Thus there would be an end to Democrat ic, (ahas, diabolic) rule in Watertown, and good men would once more lift up their heads and rejoice. 1 bus would thcjtax pay era no longer groan under enormous bur dens impo ed by gigantic “steals” to sup pert secession papers, and ether flagrant kindred practices. If New York has been redeemed, then can Watertown ho also, and will he. We confess to an itching to have the day of the great battle hasten ed, and to mingle in the thick fight. We learn that Government has sent or ders to Col. Daniels, of the Wisconsin Cavalry regiment encamped at Kenosha withdrawing all further supplies. There are certain grave irregularities in connec tion with the organization of this regiment which the Uar Department cannoV sanc tion, and will doubtless he disbanded.— Exchange. There scorns to be a strange fatality at tending the movements of this regiment. It has been organizing for months, and while other regiments which commenced their formation long after this did have been luily equipped and left the State, Col. Daniel’s Regiment until within a few days past had not received any uniforms, hut little money, and is banging around the State yet in tjbubt as to whether it is to be disbanded or to go into service. There must be some cause for all this but what it is we of course cannot tell.— W only know that considerable disaffec tion exists among the men at the treat ment they have received, and that they are : anxiously awaiting the developments of the future. Destination of Wisconsin Regiments. The Madison Argus gays the Ninth, Twcdth and Thirteenth Regiments, are or dered to Fort Leavenworth, and to report to Major General Hunter. Arms are or dered to that point for them. These Reg iments only await the visit of the Pay master General to be in re ness to start for thoir destination. Tko President and Sec. CaniEron. j A difference of opinion seems to exist | between the President and Secretary Cara- ! eron as to what shall he done with the slaves, and whether they shall or shall not bo made to play any part in pulling down the existing rebellion inaugurated by the j South. The report of Secretary Cameron | as it first appeared in the Western papers, took strong and decided ground in favor ot the doctrine that it is tbe right, and may be the duty, of the Government to arm the slaves and send them forth with our army to aid in fighting our battles ; but the same, it appears, was distasteful to tho President, and that portion of it to which wc have alluded was considerably modified in the report whioh was sent to Congress. Pamphlet copies of tbe origin al report, however, had been printed and forwarded in advance to tbe most import ant cities throughout the West and it was ■ too late to recall them, so that simultane | ous with the announcement by telegraph i that the President’s Message was being ! road in Congress, Secretary Cameron’s re port was given to the public at these re j mote points, as he first wrote it, though it is not by any means the same iu word or | spirit as that now claimed to bo tho offi cial copy. To show the dissimilarity be i tween the two documents, we need only ; quote the following passage, the first ex tract being from the report first submitted by Secretary Cameron to the President: “It is clearly a right of the Government to arm slaves, when it shall become neces sary, as it is to use gunpowder taken from the enemy. Whether it is expedient to do so is purely a military question. The right is unquestionable by the laws of war The expediency must bo determined by circumstances, keeping in view the great object of overcoming the rebels, re-estab lishing the laws, and restoring peace to the nation. It is vain and idle for the Government to carry on this war, or hope to maintain its existence against rebellious force, with out employing all the rights and powers of war. As has been said, the right to de prive the ri-bels of their property in slaves and slave labor is as clear and absolute, as the right to take forage from the field, or cotton from the warehouse, or powder and arms from the magazine. To leave the enemy in the possession of such prop erty as forage and cotton and military stores, and the means of constantly repro ducing them would* he madness. It is therefore equal madness to leave them in peaceful and secure possession of slave property more valuable and efficient to them tor war, than forage, cotton and mil itary stores. Such policy would he na tional suicide. What to do with that spe cies of property, is a questien that time and circumstance will solve, and need not he anticipated further than to repeat that they cannot he held by the Government as slaves It would be useless to keep them as prisoners of war ; and self preser vation, the highest duty of a government, or of individuals, demands that they should he disposed of or employed in the most ef fective manner that will tend most speed ily to suppress the insinuation and restoie the authority of the Government. If it shall be found that the men who have been held by the rebels as slaves are capable of hearing arms and performing efficient mil itary service, it is the right and may be come the duty of the Government to arm and equip them, and employ their services against the rebels, under proper military regulation, discipline and command. But in whatever manner they may he used by the Government, it is plain that, once liberated by the rebellious act of their masters, they should never again be restored to bondage. By the master’s treason and rebellion ho forfeits all right to the labor and service of hiy slave ; and the slave of the rebellious master, by his seivice to the Government, becomes justly entitled to freedom and protection.” All of this however, and much more of the same import, was stricken out and the following was substituted at the instance of the President : “It is already a grave question what shall he done by the slaves who ar aban doned by their owners on the advance of our troops into Southern territory, as at Beaufort District, in South Carolina. The number left within enr control at that point is very considerable, and similar cases will probably occur. What shall be done with them ? can we afford to send them forward to their masters, to he by them armed against us, or used in introducing supplies to mantain the rebellion? Their labor may he useful to us j withheld troui the enemy it lessens his military resources, and with hclding them has no tendency to induce the horrors of insurrection even in the rebel communities. J hey constitute a military resource, and being such, that they should not he turned over to the enemy, is too p.ain 10 niseuss. Why deprive him of supplies by a blockade, and voluntarily give him men to produce supplies? The disposition to he made of the slaves of rebels, after the close of the war, each be safely left to the wisdom and patriotism of Congress. The representatives of the peop!* will unquestionably secure the loyal slaveholders every right to which they are entitled under the Constitution of the country,” V* bile Secretary Cameron is positive in j his method of dealing with the rebels, the 1 resident, it will be seen is entirely nega tive. Just what the latter would do in the premises does not appear. And in so tar as he leaves the question in the fog. we think the popular feeling will be with Secretary Cameron ; for, remember, he docs not u:sn! upon the immediate arming < f the slaves, but simply contends that it mav eventually become the duty, as it is the right, of the government to avail itself I oi their services, in ease the rebellion i can he put down in no other wav. e do not see anything objectionable in that. We take it for granted that the Government means to so conduct the war as to maintain itself and squelch Jeff. Pa ris and bis piratical crew so that they will never bo beard of for all time to come. If such is the fact, why stand upon ceremo ny V If this is a war, why not treat it as a war, and use all the means that God has given us for sustaining ourselves ? It may net be necessary, and we trust and believe it will not be, to act upon the sug gestion of Secretary Cameron, but if it , should be, the President should waive his ; present c’c'icacy and accept tbe services of the slaves for fighting purposes, as read ily as he does for digging trenches, or do ing any other necessary work. Taking this view of the case, it would, in our ; judgment have been better had Sec. Cam- ' eron's report been left as it was in the | first instance and the rebels had been giv en to understand that every resource, eveu ■ to the arming of the slaves, if necessary, j will be used against them to bring them | to terms. They would have been far more likely to understand, than they are ! now, that tho North is in earnest in this ; matter and means to conquer them. The President evidently wishes to throw the responsibility of inaugurating extreme measures against the rebels upon Congress. His course undoubtedly has reference to i the Border States and is so shaped as to bold them where they now are and win them, if possible, more firmly to our side. The consummation of that object is all im portant and the President perhaps is the better judge as to the means that should be employed to bring it about. But wo cannot but believe that more is lost to the Union cause ;han is gained by any policy which squints towards the protection rath er than tho wiping cut of slavery and the rebels. Wc have faith and hope in Con gress. The high and noble stand already taken there with reference to this rebellion leaves no ground for fear that the Union cause is to suffer for the benefit of our en- emy. Let its legislation be wise, bold, and decisive, and whatever means it may devise for the prosecution of the war, wo have no doubt the President will readily adopt, though it may become neecssary for biro to abandon his present position and avow the very doctrine from tke pro mulgation of which be now shrinks. Negroes in tire Rebel Service. Bcliable intelligence is said to have been received that there are several regiments of blacks in the rebel army at Manassas, fully uniformed, armed and equipped.— That is a game at which two can play.— Chicago Journal. But the question is will two play at it? That they can is clear enough, but that they trill is not so evident. We must say that the manipulations Secretary Cameron’s report underwent at the bands of the Pres ident look veiy much as though all the fighting by negroes is to be done on the rebel side. President Lincoln, it seems, is not inclined to take advantage of that mode of warfare at present. He may be constrained to como to it, however, and we presume will be, should the exigencies of the case require it hereafter. Which Shall It £e. The telegraph, the other day, announced that the people of Charleston Lad become frightened and were discussing the ques tion as to whether their city should be sur rendered or burned, the Governor alone favoring the latter proposition. We think the Governor is right. The war began in Charleston and it is fitting that there should be some demonstration there com memorative of the fact, and more signifi cant than would be the mere surrender of the city. It ought, therefore, to he burn ed. Let it he swept entirely from the face of the earth. Leave not a vestige of it, so that hereafter it will he a difficult matter to tell whore Charleston stood.— Let there he a bonfire by all means ; and have the same conducted upon a grand scale. $162 50, This is the amount illegally voted by the late Board of Supervisors in this coun ty, to the publisher of the Welthurger, for printing the Treasurer’s Tax List “without authority.” Tax payers, when they come to pay their taxes, will do well to bear it in mind. By the way, we would like to know if any one lias yot heard an explanation of ‘the peculiar circumstances surrounding the case'which justified the payment of that bill i M e have not been able to get any light upon the subject. “We find no au thority for paying for the same,” said the committee in their report, “but after con sidering all the circumstances surrounding the case recommend its allowance.” Do tell ug what those “circumstances” were. The public wants to know. Redeeming In Specie.

[From the Washington Republican, 4th.l Washington is essentially a Yankee city at the present time. In every department business is thriving to a degree unparallel ed in its history. Ileal estate has advanc ed to unexpected figures, and it is a mat ter of impossibility to find suitable accom modations for the vast influx of business pouring in upon us. Enterprise is now the watchword, where a short year ago in activity and decay prevailed. Vigorous competition has reduced the price of many of the necessaries of life. Old monopolies have bet'n scattered to the winds, and the consumer generally is beuctitted by the change. The Washington of to-day is to tally different from the Washington of 18(30. Many are unacquainted with the cause of the transformation, and look with wondering eyes at - tis only a legiti mate consequence. The fact is, the antiquated coaches of the past regime have rolled away, and the lightning locomotives of Northern energy replace them. Thus will it be iu other latitudes than this. The fossil remains of an obsolete idea will but serve as memen toes of a darker age, and happiness and prosperity will be the ressults of its anni hilation. Vive la Yankee. —The Kansas correspondence of the Fall Fiver (Mass.) News writing on the 25th ult., says : “Here is a specimen of Kansas justice to the rebels. After the taking of one of the Missouri towns, oui troops found them selves encumbered with four prisoners, men of dogged, determined secession prin ciples, who if left free under any oath, would be found again in the enemy’s ranks another day. They wcr sentenced to bo shot, and were led out upon the prairie and shown where they were to be buried, nay more, made to stand and lock at the digging of their graves, so near that the dirt was thrown upon their feet. This is war, and such are its results; it tends to blunt and destroy the moral feelings.— The above is not the only instance of that kind.” —A letter from a citizen in the western part of North Carolina toafriend in Wash ington has passed the rebel lines, and was to-night placed in the bands of Gen. Mc- Clellan. It brings the clearest confirmation yet received that there is a large and deter mined organization of Unionists in that State. They are putting themselves in communicat’on with the Unionists in East Tennessee, and await only the dawn of hope for a general uprising. They expect Brownlow to be reinforced by the Government, and will accept that movement as the signal for their own ac tion. —Mr. Diven of Now York, who is be lieved to represent Seward, admitted at the caucus, last might, that the war would be the end of slavery. “So,” rejoined Jim Lane, “says “everybody I meet, North and South. “How much more blood and treasure “before the end. Why not end now?” The statement of Thad. Stevens, at the caucus, that McClellan threatened to resign it Camera's original report was sent in, has been confirmed by several members to-day. The bugler bay, ostensibly a deserter, but probably a spy, is in confinement. —Mayor Wood takes his defeat in New ! York with the air of a philosopher. It is conceded now that Opdyke cannot be coun- ! ted out of his election, and Wood has made ! a speech to his Mozart followers eompli- | mentary to his successor in office, asa ( gentleman who would bring dignity and | ability to the new administration. He expressed the hope that now the Legis lature at Albany would clothe the Mayor of New York with such powers as would enable him to be useful in bis responsible position. —The conviction of Rev. George Gor don, president of Iberia college, in the United States district court, at Cleveland, on the old charge of obstructing officers in a fugi live slave case, and his sentence to six months imprisonment and £>3oo fine.— stirs up the indignant feeling of the free people yf northern Ohio. Public meetings have been held and an outspoken denun ciation of the sentence indu[ged in. A committee from Oborlin have visited pres ident Gordon in jail and tendered him theis sincerest condolence. —The Berdan regiment of sharpshooters about which so much has been said, is still encamped on the east side of the Potomac, unsupplied with arms, with the exception ot a few privates who have their owh guns of various descriptions. It has been under stood that Government would furnish the i regiment with Sharpe’s rifles, but owing to fault somewhere, they have remained without then). It would cost about forty 1 thousand dollars to equip the regiment I with this arm. —D. G. Wattles and J. Butler, Demo 1 ci#tic rebels of Lapeer, Mich., have been j arrested and sent to Fort Warren. A correspondent of the Detroit Free Press is very indignant that Democrats should be “kidnapped and stolen away to Fort War ren. ' It makes a difference whether you | kidnap a nigger or a Democrat.

Conkling, of New York, has presented the form of a bill for the retrenchment of National expenses, which embodies the following ideas : 1. A reduction of twenty-five per cent on all salaries, civil, naval and military, amounting to SIO,OOO a year cr over, in cluding emoluments, 2. A similar reduction of twenty per cent where the salaries and emoluments are over $5,000 and under SIO,OOO. 3. Similar reduction of fifteen per cent on compensation between $2,000 and $5.- 000. 4. The redaction of salaries of members of Congress to $2,000 per annum, subject to a forfeiture of $lO for each time that a member does not answer to his name on a call of the yeas and nays, and the reduc tion of mileage to ten cents per railo from the post offne nearest the member’s resi dence to Washington city, estimated by the nearest mail route. 5. The absolute and total abolition of the franking privilege. 6. The cessation of the system of ap pointing supernumerary officials, and the reduction of the officials in all the depart ments of the Government to the number actually requisite for the proper transac tion of business. Foreign Sympathy with Rebellion.— If the En glish in England may be judged by those of their countrymen whom I meet in Paris, 1 think there is no doubt on which side their sympathies lie With one exception, every Englishman I have con versed with in Paris upon the subject has plainly exhibited that his feeling was in favor of seeing our Government destroyed and the South successful. The exception was an English gentleman, who, about two years ago, was waited upon, one evening, by a committee of citizens of Mobile,and re quested to leave the city before morning, his fault having been the expression of sentiments in opposition to slaverv. He of course he acceeded to the request, and very naturally now bis sympathies are not with the South.—Paris cor. Boston Post. Washington, December 8.1861. Sec retary Chase’s Report is finished, and it will be sent to Congress to-morrow. It is said to contain a more profound and origi nal discussion of financial questions than any Treasury Report made for years.- He estimates the Public Debt in 1863, at the present rates of expenditure, at eight hundred million dollars. He will recom mend a tax upon promissory notes, and also upon bank notes, in order to remove them from circulation, and substitute in their place currency of the United States; also tax deeds of conveyance, decrease duty upon liquors and tobacco and increase those upon tea, coffee, and sugar. The Report in all, is about the same length as Secre tary Cameron’s. Mr. Chase touches upon the slavery question in a paragraph—advising the confiscation of rebel property as a means of revenue. He excepts slaves, because he says the United States cannot become a slaveholder; but he recommends the emancipation and the employment of those liberated, in the service of the Govern ment, Glasgow, Mo., Dec. 8. The notorious marauder Capt. Sweeney and his band of robbers, who have for some time past, kept this section of the country in terror, were captured yesterday at Rogers’ Mill, near here, by a detach ment of Cavalry under Capt. Merrill.— Sweeney’s pickets were surprised and cap tured, and his whole band, thirty five in number, taken without firing a gun. For some time past the enemy has sent out daily from Fairfax C. H. a scouting party of 1,000 or 2,000, which break up into squads of 50 or 100, whe attack our picket guards. Lieut Knight, of Cos. B, Third New Jersey, went with 55 men as far as Burke’s Station on the Orange and Alexandria R. R. They stretched two telegraph wires across the old Braddock road, one as high as the forehead of a man on horseback, tho other lower, and awaited the result on this side. Presently half a company of rebel cavalry dashed up on a charge. The wires unseated two or three of them and threw the rest into confusion. Our men rushed up, emptied six saddles and took one prisoner. Eight of the party, who were in ambush, completed the rout, aud emptied two more saddles. Eight horses galloped within cur lines. One horseman taken prisoner was orderly sergent T. H. Dunham, of the Sixth Georgia Hus sars. He gives information respecting the enemies scouting expedition. He says that the P. U. hitherto at Fairfax has been removed to Manassas. —The Constitution of the new State of West Virginia is being made with care, and will be quite as progressive as the most progressive of the free States. It will provide for th :■ giadual extinction of slavery in the State ; for free schools; for a free ballot ; and for other reforms not included in the aristocratic constitution of the Old Dominion.
