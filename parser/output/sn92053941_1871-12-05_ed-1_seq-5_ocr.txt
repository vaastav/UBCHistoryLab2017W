KTBNTS OV MR YEAH. The past ver '!9 under a wise Provi der.ee, been one of general prosperity to the nat.on. It ha, however, beensrtttxd ed with more thai u-uil cLa-t.scmect in loia of life a:d ropcity, by stoitn and fire These disters have set red to call forth the beat elements of humn i ature in cur country, and to dcvl p a friend- hip for us on the pait of fi rpign nations, which coca tar toward alleviating the dis tress occasii md ly the diamine'.

THKATY WITn CHEAT 11KITA1N. The relations of. the United States with foreign powers continue to be friendly. The year has been an eventful one in wit nessing two gnat nation speaking one lai guc;e and having one l'ntage settling by jeceiui atoiLration, 1113 ciisputes oi long statdirg, which were liable at any time to bring those nat ons into bloody and hostile conflict. An simple has thus been ait wh eh, if successful in its final issue, msy be followed by other civilized nations, tn i to the final lueana of return ing to productive industry mdlion of men maintained tos.ttle tie disputes cf cations by the bajomt anl broadsword. I transmit herewith a Ci py of the treaty alluded to, which hns been concluded tirca the adjournment of Congress with her Britanic JIaiosly, and a copy of the proto cols of the coLferetcei e f the Commis sioners by whom it was negotiated. Th's treaty provides methods for adjusting the questions pending between tin two na tions. Various questions are to be aJju'.i 1 by arbitration. TF1E GENEVA COUNCIL. I recommend Corgress at an early diy to make the necessary proviiiir.s fjr the tribunal at Geneva, and for the ssveral Commission's on the part of the United States called for by the treaty. His ma jesty the King cf Italy, the President of the Swiss Confederation, and his majesty the Emperor of Brazil, hive each consent ed, on ll e joint request ot the two pawcrs to came an nritra'or tor tie trnunal at Geneva. I Lave caused my thanks to bi suitably expressed for the ret d cess with which the joint request has b?en complied with by tin appointment of gentlemen of emicer.ee and learning to these impart act positions. His majesty the emperor of Geruary hss been plea-ed to comply with the joint wish of the two governments, and tat cor.sertcJ to aciiniha arbitrator of the disputed water boundary between the United States ar.d Great Britain. The contractu g parties in the treaty have un dertaken to regard as between themselves certain principles of public Uw for which the United States have contended from the commencement of their history. They cave also agreed to bring these principles to the kcowledgo of the other maritime powers, and to invite thero. to accede to them. Nogotia'ins arc goinj en as to the form of no:e by which ttis invitation ia to be cxtcndel to the powers. 

FISHERIES, CANALS AND L0UNDAR1ES. I recommend the b-gislstion necessary a tbefpart of the Unite 1 States to bring Into operation the artic'.eiof the treaty re lating to the Cutleries, and to tl.e other matters touching the relations cf the Uni ted Stttes towards the B.i-uh North American provinces, to become operative ss toon as the proper legislation bha'.l be bad on the prn of Great Britain and its possessions. It is much to be desired that tbia legislation may become co operative before the fi shernun of the United Staes begin to make their arrangements for the coming season. I have addressed a comir.unication, cf which a cojy is transmitted herewith, to the Oovemors of Jiew York, Ptnnsylva i, Ohio, Indiana, llicb'gar, Illinois and Wisconsin, urging upon ttc g ivernments cf those States respectively the ncrejsiry action on their pnrt to cirry into cffict the object ot the articles of tbe treaty which contemplates the me cf the canals on either side connecting with the navigation of the lakes and rivers forming the boundary, in terms f equity by the inhabitants of both countries. It is hoped tlat the import ance cf the object and tee benetiis to How therefrom will secure the speedy approval and legislative tanctioncf the States con cerned. I renew the recommendation tor an appropriation for determining the true ponuon of the forty ninth parallel f t lat nude, where it forms the bounda-y be tween the United States and the British North American possessions between the " Lake of the Woods" and the summit of the Rocky Mountains. The early action of Congreis on the recommendation named would pet it in the power of the "War Department to place a force in the ntld during the next summer. FOLICY TOWARDS FRAKC8 AND GHBUANY. The resumption of diplomatic relations between t ranee and Germany baa enabled me to give directions for the withdrawal of the protection extended to Germans in France by the diplomatic and consular renreaentatives of the United States in that country. It is jatt to add that the delicate duty of this protection has been performed by the minister and the consul at Paris, and the various consuls in France mndcr the supervision of the latter, with great kindness as well as with prudence and tact. Their coarse has received the commendation of the German government and bas wounded no susceptibility of the French. The government of the Emperor of Ger many coctinues to manifest a friendly feeling toward the United S'ates, and a dea;re to harmonize with the moderate and just policy which this government m iini ana in us reiauon mm Asiatic p w tra, is well as whh the South American republics. I have fciren assurance that the friendly feeling of that governnnt are fully ttiarel by the United fckates. The ratification of the consular ar.d natur al!!. tion connections with the Austrian II a i gvy empire have been exchanged. CUAKOKS I ITALY. I lave been officially informed of the anmxttion tf the State of the Chutch to the kingdom of Italy, and the rem jyhI of the ctpito! of that kingdom t Rome. In c nf rmity with the eatablished policy ot ilia Uuited S ates, I have n-o gnued this charge. The ratification oi the new treaty of Commerce be-tween the United States and Italy has bee a eich&igei. The two powers have agreed in their tietty that lroperty at sei ahall be exempt from c.-ptnre in case of war between the twj p.iwe.s. CLAIMS AGA1S8T tPAlS. Tl e United States have spared no op pcriutii y of ircorpnatirg tuis mle into the otligatiocs ot tatious. The For:y first Congress, at its third setsion, mid-j an appropriation lor the orgaoiZit'on of a mixed c mmissi.n, for aljudiciting upon tbe claims of the citizeus of the United Slates sgeinst Spain, growing out of the insuireciioo la Cubi, and tlt ommis sicn Las since been crgacized.

CONDUCT OP MINISTER CATACAXY. Tha intimate and friendly relations which have so Ions existed between the United States and Russia continues undis turbed. The visit of third son of the Empe ror is a proof tint there is no desire on the rsrt of his government to diminish the cordiality of those relations. The hos pitable reception which has been given to the Gran t Duke is a proof that on our Eide we share the withes of that govern ment. The inexcusable course cf the Rustian Minister at Washington rendered it necessary to ask his recall, anl to de cline to logger rceeive ths.t functionary as a diplomatic representative. Xt was imiiossible with self-respect or with au gust regard to the dignity of the country to permit fir. Catacezy to con tirce to hold interviews with tbis sovern-ncnt after his abuse of trovernment vffi :ial., and during his persistent interference through various means with the relations between the United Stales and other powers. In ac cvrdance with my wis-hes our govern meet has been relieved of further inter course with Mr. Catacizy, and the manage ment of the affairs of the imperial nation his pissed into the hands ot a geatleman ntirtly ur.ooj'ictionable. URHKI.ATIOM WITH JAPAH. With Japan we continue to ma ntain ia timate relations. The cabinet of the Mi kado has, since the close of the la;t ses sion cf Congreis, selected citizens of the United States to serve in offices of import ance ia the several di pert ment s of govern ment. I have reason to think thit the te lectioa ii due to an appreciation of the disinterestedness of the policy whuhthe United Stites have pursued toward Japan. It is cur desire to continue to maintain this dinaterested and just policy with China as well as Japan. The correspon dence transmitted herewith shows that there is no disposition on the part of this government toaweivj from its es ab'.iahcd cours BARBAR1T1KS IS CORE A. Frompted by a desire to put an end to the barbarous treatment ot our ship wrecked sailors on the Corcan coat, I in s.rucied our minister at I'eKin to euaeavor to conclude a convention with Corea for securing the safety ar.d humane treatment of such manners. Art.niral Kogcra was natructed to accompany bira with a suffi cient force to protect bim in cae of teed A small surveying party sent, cut on reaching the coast, and tf treacherously attacked at a disadvantage. Ample op portunity was given for pxpianation and aoolocv for the insult. Neither came. A force was then landed, vad alter an ar duous march oter a rugged and d.flieult country, the forts from which the out rages had been committed were gallantly assaulted and were destroyed. Having thus punished the criminals, and hevinj vindicated the honor ot the ling, tee ex peditian returned, tiLdmgit impracticable under the crcurotticccs to conciuae me desired Convection. I respectfully refer to the corresponds C8 relating thereto reiuta submitted, and leave the eurect for such action as Congrjs3 may sec tit to tiko. MEXICAN TROUBLES. The lepublic of Mexico his not vet reDealed the very objectionable laws e tabiisbing what is known asiue iree zone on the frontier ot the united States. is bored that this may yet be done, and also that more stringent measures may be taken by that government to mtisin tne lawless persons on its frontier. I hope Mexico, by its action, will soon telieve this government of tuo dithcuity expe rienced from th'.si causes. CENTRAL AKD SOUTH AMERICAN AFFAIRS. Oar relations with the various republics of Central and South America continue with one exception, to bj cordial and friendly. I recommend eome action by Conzress tesardins the overdue instai menu under the award of the Venezuela claims commission of 1SG6. The internal dissensions of this government presents no iustification of the absence or irurt to meet their solemn treaty obligations. The ratification of an extradition treaty witn rucaraugua has been exchanged. ABOLITION 0V SLATERT IN BRAXIL. It is a subject for congratulation that the great empire of Brazil has taken the initiatory steps towards the abolition of slavery. Our relations with that empire were always cordial, and will naturally be maae more aj cy this act It is not too much to hope that the government of uraau may hereatter nnd it lor its inter est, as well as intrinsically right, to ad vance toward the entire emancipation mora rapidly than the present act con templates. The true prosperity an 1 great ne-s of a natioa is to be found in the ele- Tdtion and education of its lab rers. It is a subject for regret that the reforms in tins ditection. which were volunta ry promised l y the statesmen of Spain u.'ive noi oeen carried out in its West In dian colonies. Thn laws and regulation for tha apparett abolition of tUvery in Cub. and Porto Rico leave most ot the laborers in bondage, with no hipeef re lease until tkeir lives become a burden to their employers. I det-ire to direct your attention to the fa::t that citizens of the Lnited S'a'ea are largely holders, in for eipn lands, of this species of property for bidden by th3 fundamental law cf their tlleged country. LAW 

AGAINST SLAVE-HOLDING. I recommend to Congress to piovide by string nt legislation a suitable remedy against the holding, owning or deal ng ia ale-ves or ben g interested in slave proper ty in iortizn Unas as eittier owners, hirers or mortgagers by persons of the LLited htatei. distuhbancks in cuua. It is to be regretted that the disturbed condition of the Island of Cuba continue to be a source of annoyance and anxiety as tha existence of a pro.racted struggle n such close proximity to our own tern tory, without apparent prospect of antarly termination, ctnnot be other tLsn an oi ect c-f concern to a pe.ple who, while a'. staining from iLterfirecce in the affairs f o'.lur piwers, naturally desire to si tveiy country in the ucdUtutbed enjr raii t "f peace, liber'y tnl the b'essirgs of free institutions. Ojr natal comraanders in Cuban waters have bjen instrueted, iu case it should Is come necessary, to spare no effort to pro tect the lives and property ot bona fide American citizens, ana io maintain tue dignity of the fi.ig. It is hoped that all tei dinz questions with Spain growing cut of the affairs in Cuba may be adjusted in the spirit of pece and conciliation which has hitherto guided the two powers in their treatment of such questions. REPRESENTATION IN CHINA AND JAPAN. To give importance and to ai l to the efficiency cf tur diplomatic relations with Japan and China, tojt'urther retaining the good opnnton oi these peop;e, ana to secuie to the Utited States its share of ihe commerce destined to flow between tboEe nations and the balance of the commercial wotld, I earnestly recommend that an appropriation be made to support at leait four American youths in eacu oi tnose countries, to serve as a part of tho official families cf cur mini te:s there. Our rep- reientatives would net even then be placed upon an equality with the representatives of Greit Britain and sme etaer powers. As now situated, our repreteutatives in Japan and China have to gc pend for interpreters and translators uoon natives of those countries, who know our language imperfectly, or pro cure for the occasion the services of em ployes of foreign busineta houses, or the interpreters to other icrciga ministers. I would also recommend liberal meas ures for the purpose of supporting the American lines of ste.sn.ers now plying between San Franciico and Japan atd China, and the Australian line, almost onr cn'y remaining lines of ccean steamers, and cf increasing their service. j TrlK NATIONAL DEBT has been reduced to the extent ot f 88, 057,126 80 during the year, and by the negotiation of national bonds at a lower rate, the interest on the puMic de t hns been so far diminished that the sum to be raised for interest account is nearly seven teen million dollars lets than on the 1st of March, 1869. Unas highly desirable thit this rapid diminution should take place, both to ttrcngtncn the credit ci he cjantry and to convince its citizens of their entire ability to mett every dollar of their liability without bankrupting them. But in view ot theaccompluhmcniot lucse desirab'e ends, and of the rapid develop ment of reources of the country, its lncrets- ing ability to meet large demands and tlie amount already paid, it is not desirable that the present resources of the country should continue to be taxed in crder to continue this rapid payment. There fore, I recommend a modification et tlie tariff, anl that the internal revenue taxes be abolished except these on wines, spir ituous and malt liquors and tobacco in its various forms. In nKADJUSTIStr'THR 

TARIFF, I suggest that a careful estimate be made of the amount of surplus revenue collected tinder the present laws, after presiding for the current expenses of the govern ment the interest account and a sinking fund, and that this surplus be reduced in such manner ss to afford the qreitest re lief to the creatist number. Thera are many articles not produced at home, tucli as medicines compounded, ana teurces from which very little revenue is derived but which enter into general usr. All such srt.cles I recommend to be placed on the free list. Should a further reduction prove advisable, I would then recommend that it be made on those articles which can bear it without disturbing home pro duction or reducing the wages of Amen can laborers. I have not eutcrcd into any figure because to do so would be to re peat all that is laid before you in the re port cf the Secretary of tha Trcasuiy, The present laws for collecting revenue, pay collector s of customs small salaries, but provide lor shares in all seizures which at the principal ports of entry particularly raise the compensation cf those officials to a larger sum. It has always seemed to me as if this system must at times work perniciously. It holds out an inducement to dishonest men, should such ect posses sion of those offices, to be lacking in their scrutiny of goods entered to enable them finally to make large seizures. Your at tention is respectfully invited to this sub ject. The continual fluctuations in the YALUa CF 

OOLD compared with the national currency, has a moat etamaging euect span the increase ana development or the couctrv in keep ing up the prices of all articles necessary in every day life. It fosters a spirit of grumbling prejudicial alike to national morals an l national finances. If the ones tion can be met as to how to get a fixed value to our currency with that value con stantly ana uniformly approaching nat with specie, a Yery desirable object will be gained, for the operations of the army and in tha improvement in tha number and efficiency of tha nayal forces, without material increase in the expenie of tup- porting it. NAVAL IMPROVEMENTS. This is due to the pclicv which has been adopted and ia being extended as fait our material will admit ot using small er vessels as cruisers on the several sta- tions.By these means we lave been enabled to excupy at once a larger extent of cruis- ng ground, to cause more of the officers in eech grade cf staff corps to be fixed, to that whenever the number in any one grade falh below the tumber so fixed, that the vacancy may be fillet by promo tion from the gradj below. I also recom mend that wiien tha office of chitf of corps becomes vacant, the place may be hi led by sett ct ion trom the corps m which tne vacancy exists. The report of the Secretary, cf the turveys authorized by Congress of the Ishtmuses of Drien and Tehauntepec, shows that the same authority has sent out an expedition completely furnished and equippsd to explore thj uuknown ccean of the north. The suggestions of the report show the necetbity ot improving and in reestn the mutemi ot the navy Frequently the pottswhere the pretence of our llsg is desir ble, generally d;scharge more efficiently the appropriate duties tf the Navy in time ot peace, without e.xceediog the number of men m the expenditure author izcd by law. During the past yeir the ravy has, in addition to its regular service, supplied ihe men and officers for ths v s:eU of the cocst survey, end hasc impeded the officers to ini' r3ve themselves in the knowledge of their profes-noa. The pr. sent cost of maintaining lha tavy compared w.th that of the prtcedn g year, and the estimates tor the etsuing year, ere contained in tac accompanying report cf the Secretary of the navy. Tlsey are reduced to a peace standing Ly the abolition of certain grades cf effieers. The reduction of others and the employment tf some in the service of the Conimerciil marine are we 1 consider ed and deserve the thoughtful attention of Congress. I also recommend that all pro motions in the navy above fie rank of Captain, &c, by selection instead of by seniority. This course will securs in the higher grades gre.Uer efficiency a: d hold out an incentive to the voung. TnB POSTAL SERVICB. The receipts cf the Pott Offi.e Depart ment, es shown by the accoropjnyirx re port of the Postmaster Central, exhibit a gratifying increase m that branch ot the pnblic service. It is the index of the growth of education and cf the prosperity of the people, two elements highly condu cive to the vigor and stability of the Re public. With a vast territory like ours, much cf it sparsely populated, but all re quiring the services tf the mail, it is not at present to be txpected that tne atpirt ment can be made self sustaining, iiut a tzradual erproach to this end lrcm year to year is cinfidettiy relied od, and the day is not far distant when the Post Office Department of the government will prove a much greater blessing to the wnoie peo ple than it ia now. 

KU-KLUI OUTRAGES There his been imposed upon the execu tive branch of the government, the execu ion of the set of Congress approved April 0. 13 7 Land coramoMjknown as " I he nu Klux Law." In a portion cf the Mate cf South Carolina the necessity ot the course punucd will be demonstrated by the re ports of the committce,to investigate sruth ern outrages. Unler the provitions fi the above act I issued a proe mma'ion cv.n ing the attettioa cf the Unite 1 States to the saaie, and declaring my reluctance to exercise anv of the extraordinary powcrs thereby conferred cpon me, except in ctse of imperative nViceskity. But making known my pnrp se to exercise such pow- frs wherever it kUouid oecimo cects'SBr to do so for ths purpose cf secrini to all citizonsof tho United States the peaceiui enjoyment ef the rights guaranteed by the Centtitunon end ttc laws. After the passage of this law ir forma tion was received from time to time that combinations cf a claraeter referred to in this law existed, and wtrj powerful in many arts of the Southern State", partic ularly in certain e unties in the State o South Carolinx Careful investigation wa made and it was ascertained that in nine counties cf that State auch combination were active and powerful, embracing a suf ficient portion of the citizens to control the locil authority, and having, anions other things, the object of depriving the emancipated class ot the substantial bene fits of freedom ard tha privilege cf pout ical action. Among their operations were frequent tcourinss of the country and ec casional assassinations, generally perpctra ted at night Ly disfp.v.shed persons, toe victims in almost alt t.ves rtirg citizen of diff rint lulitioalsentiniitits Iro n tkei own,rr tree persons who hal ahown a uitp.isitioa to claim equal nsuts. mou sands of inoffensive and well disposed cit tzens were the sutTcrera by this lawles, violence. Thcreutwn, on the 13th of October, 1871, a proclamation was issued in tctms ot the law, calling upon the members ot the combination, to disperse within hve days, sni to deliver to the marshal or I military officers of the United States all rrcs, ammunitions, uniforms, disguise?, and other means and implements used by them fer carrying out their unlawful pur poses. This warning not having been heeded, on the 17th of October another proclamation was issued suspe iding the privilege of the writ of haboas corpus in nine counties of that State. Direction was given that within the counties so des ignated, persons supposed upon ersdita bis interrelation to be members of such unlawful combinations should be arrested by the military forces of the United States and delivered to the martul, to be dealt with according to she law. In two of the counties, Yoi k and Spartinsburg, many arrests have bu made, at last accounts the number cf per sons thus arrested was one hundred and sixty-eight Several hundred whose criminality was ascertained to be of an in ferior degree, were released fer the pres ent. These have generally made confes sions of their guilt. Great caution has been exercised in making tear ar rests. Notwithstanding the large number, it is believed that no innocent person is now in custody. The prisosers will be held for regular trial injudicial tiibunals of the United States. As soon as it ap peared that the authorities of the United States were about to take vigorous meas ures to enforce the law, many persons ab scond! and there is good ground for tup- pi ainsr tuai all of sui h persons nave vio- awa tue law. A full report or wliat lias een done under this lw will be submitted to Congress by the Attorney General KKFOnCKMKNT OF LAW IN UTAH. In Utah there st 11 remains a romnsnt of btrbaritm repugnant to civilization. decency and to ihe lawa af the Uuited State. Territorial officers, however, have been founds who are willing to perform their duty in a spirit of equity, and with due sense ot sustaining the maj sty ol the law. Neither pjlygamy nor nuy other violation cf existiug statutes will be per mitted within the territory of the United States. It is not with tie religion of the self styled Saints we are row dealing, but their practices. They will be protected in the worship cf God according to the dictates ot their consciences, but they will not be permitted to violate tha laws un der the cloak of religion. it may be ad visible for Congress to con sider whut, in the execution of laws ajaint polygamy, is t be the status of plural wives and their off prirg. The propriety of Congress passing an enabling act authorizing the teriitorial legislature of Utah to legitimatize all l-oru to the time fixed in the act might be justified l y its humanity to thee innocent children. This is a su icestioa only, not a recom- mendation. THS INDIAN POLICY. The policy pursued to-wards the In dians La resulted favorably so far as can be judged frim the limited time during which ir has been in operation, though to the action in the TArinus societies of Chris tians bas been entrusted the execution cf the d'leies of the Board ef Commissioner anthrrizsd by the Lews of April 18th, 1S69. Many tribes ot Indians have teen nduced to settle upon resirvations, to cultivate the soil and perform productive labor of v-irious kinds, and to partia'ly ccept civilization. They are being euied r in such a way. it is hoped, as to in duce those still piurs'iing their old habits f life to embrace the only opportunity which is left the Indians in the territory west of Arkansas en 1 Miss- url, and south of Kanrai. In doing so, every right it guaranteed to the Indians bj the treaty to avoid extermination. I recommend a liberal appropriation to carry out the Indian pace policy, rot only because it is humane, christian like and economical, but btcau3e it is right. I re commend to your favorable consideration also the policy of granting a territorial government to the Indians. An imperial government to the Indians should be se cured, as such a course might in time be the means cf collecting most of tne In dians now between the Missouri river and the Pacific, an 1 south of the British pos sessions, into o.ie territory or one State. The Secre'ary cf the Interior bus treated upon this subject at length, and I recom mend to you his suggestions. I renew my recommendation ttat TOE FfRLlC LANDS be regardel as a heriUge to our chiHreu, to be disposed cf only as required for oc cupation and to actual settlers. Those al ready granted Lave beeu in a great part ditpoicd ot in such a way ai to sreure ac ce:stothe balance by the hardy settler who may wish to avail himself of them ; but caution thould be exercised CTen in attainire so desirable an object. The educational interest may well be served by the grunt cf proceeds of the sale of public lands to settlers. 1 do not wisu to be understxd as recomniendirg in the least decree a cuitiilment of wliat is be- irg done by the grniral goveremtnt for the encouragement of education. CENSUS, EDUCATION, AGRICULTURE, ETC The report of the Secretary of Interior, submitted with this, will give ycu in formation collected and prepare for pub lication in regard to the census takn during the year 1870, the operations of the bureau cf cducatioa fvr the year, thj patent office, the pension office, the land office, and the Indian bureau. The report of the Commissioner ef Ag ritulture give? the operations of his de partment for the je.ir. As agriculture ij the ground wcrk of our prospt rity, too much importance cannot be attached to the libors of this department. It is in the hands of an able heal, with uble essisttnts, all zealously devoted to intro ducing into the agricultural piroduction of the nation all useful products adapted to anv of the various climates and soils of cur vast territory, snd to giving all useful information as to th method of cultiva ting the plants, cereals and other produces adapted to particular localities." Quietly but surely the agricultural bureau is working a great national good, and if it is lioerally supported the more widely its influence will bo extended and the less dependent we shrill be upon the products t f foreign countries. PAY OF PUBLIC OFFICERS. The subject of compensation to the hea is ot bureaus atel officials holding po titirr!3 of responsibility, of requiring a'o'li'y ard character to till properly, it i ne to which your attention is invited. But few of t li a officials receive compensa tion equal to the support of a family, while their duties are such as to involve millions in private life, demand a compen sation eq ial to the services rendered. A wise economy would dictate the same rule in the government service. GOVERNMENT ESTIMATE?. I have not given the estimates for the support of the government for the ensuing vear, nor a comparative statement between the expenditures for the year just passed ana tne one just preceding, because all these figures are contained in the accom panying reports, or in those presented di rettly to Congress. These estimates have my approval. POLITICAL DISABILITIES. More than six year having elapsed since the last hostile gun was fired be tween the armies then arrayed against esch other, one for the perpetuation the other for the destruction of the Union, it a a ... " may wen do considered whether it is not now time that the disabilities imposed by the Fourteenth Amendment should be re moved. That amendment does not ex clude the ballot, but only requires the dis ability to hold office of a certain class. When majorities are sure to elect officers reflecting the views of the majority, I do not see the advantage or propriety of ex cluding men from office merely because they were, before the rebellion, of stand ing and character sufficient to be elected to positions requiring them to laKoanoain 10 support tha constitution, ana admit ting the eligibility of those enter taining precuely the same views but of less stiu'iing in their communities It may Lc said that the for rter violated an oath, while the la'ter did not. The latter did not have it iu their power to do so. If they had U ken this oath it cannot te doubted that they would have broken it as did thefonner class. It tbereare a' y gfeatcriminais distinguished above all othira for the pait they took in exposition to the government, they might in the judgment of Coi gress be excluded forn such an ammsty This subject is submitted for your cireful consideration. i ne condition ot the fcoutnern states is unhappily not such as all tiue tatriottc citizens would like to see, ts s cial ostracism for opinion's sake and personal violence or tbieits towards persons enter taining political views oppi sol to those entertained by thj in-jirityof tho citi zens, prevents ioimigiation andthefliw of much needed capiul ioto the States lately m rebellion. It will bs a happy condition of the cemntry when the old citizens of these States will take an in terest in public tffiir, and promulgate ideas honestly entertained, vote for men representing their views, and permit the sole freedom of expression and ballot in these eiteitainirg diff irent political cocntctseni. DISTRICT CF COLUMBIA. Under the pn visiors of the act of Cn griss approved Febtuiry 21st, 1871, a ter ritorial government was organized in the District of Columbia. Its results have thus far fully rcibzed the expectations eif its sd vrcati s. Under the direction of the territorial efficers a system of improve ments has been inaugurated, by means cf which Washington is rapidly leci roing a city worthy the nation's capitol. The cit izens cf the District have voltirtsrily taxed themselves to a large amount for the purpose of contributing to the ad vancement of the seat of government. I recommend liberal spprepnations on the part of Congress, in order that tho gov ernment may bc-Er its share ef expense of csrrjirgout the various tysttnistf im provements. GOVERhMENT BUH.PIM-B IN CHlCAeJO. By the cieat firo in Chicago the mosi. important government build. ngs in that city were destroyed. Those burned had already become inadequate to the wants of the government in that city, snd ss re garded the tear future were totally in adequate. I recommend therelore tuat an appropriation be made immediately to purchase the remainder of the Square on which the the burted buildings stood, provided it can be purchased at a fair valuation, snd providid the legislature of Illinois will &"s a law authoiizing its condemnatien for government pur poses; end also an appiopriation of as much money t s can properly be experded towards the erection pi new buildings. IMPOSITIONS VTON EMIGRANTS. During this fiscal year the tumbct cf emigrants igncrant f our laws and hab its coming into our countiy annually has become so great, and impositions piacticcd upon them sre so tumercus and flugract, that I suggest congressional actiou for their protection. I cannot now state as fully as I desire the complaints made by emigrants cf the treatment tbey icceive, but will endeavor to do so during the sua sion of Conereis, paitieularly if thosuD jeet should riceive ycur attention. TUB CIVIL SEIIV1CB. It has been the aim of the administra tioa to enforce honesty and efficiency in public efficers. Every public servant who has violated the trust place 1 in him has been proceeded against with all the Yigor of the law. If bad men Lave secured pisses, it has been the fault of the system established by law, the custom for making appointments, or the fault of these who recommend for Government position, per sons not sclliciently well Known to mem per?eually,or who give letters endorsing ths character of cilice seekers without a proper scne of the grave rcspomibiiity which such a cr urse devolves on them. A civ. I service reform which can cor rect this abuse is much desired. Pi mer car.tile pursuits the bus'n' ss men who give a letter ot recommendation to a friend to enable him to obtain credit from a 6tranger, is regarded as moral ly responsible for the integrity of his frien J, snd his ability to meet his obligations. A reformation which woold enforce this principle against all endors ers of persons for public place, wiuld en sure great caution in making recommen dations. A salutary le?son has been tanght the careless and the dishonest servant in the crcut number ot prosecutions and convictions in the last two years. It is gratifying to notice tho favorable change which is taking placo throughout tho country in bringing to punishment those wbo have proved recreant to the trusts conuded to them, and in elevating to pub lic office rone tut those who rofess the confidence of the hi nest and virtuous. who, it will alwsys be found, comprise the majority ert ihe community in which they live. In my message to Congress one year ago, I urgently recommended a reform in the civil service of thee untry. In couaformity with that recommendation, Congress in the ninth section of an act making appro priations for the tunu.y civil expiaxs ot government and for other piurpose a, ap proved March 3d; 1871, gave the necessary authority to the executive to inaugurate a civil service reform, an 3 placed upon him the responsibility of doing so. Under the authority of said act I convened a board of gentlemen eminently qualified tor the work, to devise rules and regulations to effect the needed reform. Their labors are cot yet complete, but it is believed that tbsy will succeed in devising a plan which can be adopted to the g eat relief f .the Executive, the heads ot Departments and members of Congress, and which will re dound to the true interests of the puhlio service. At all even's the expciiwent shall hive a fair trial. CONCLUSION. I have thus hastily summed op the oper ations of the government during the last year, and made such suggestions aa oec so lo me to be proper for your consideration, I submit them with a confidence thatyour combined action will be wise, tatesmsn like and in the beet interests of the whole country.
