Thk Senate Standing Committers ?The rommittee appointed by the Senate caucus on Tuesday to rearrangs the standing committee" of the Senate have completed their work, but there was no republican caucus held this morn ing on account of the democratic Senators not being ready to report a list of members to rep resent their side" in the various committees. The republicans decided to allow the democrats one member, as heretofore,on each of the lead ing committtees, and two on minor committees. The liberals were reckoned as democrats under this arrangement. A caucus ot democratic members was held fa day to determine upon the names to be sub mitted for the committees from that aide. The liberal senators did not take par! in this caucus, not choosing to be reckoned as democrats and claiming that their numbers (seven) should en title them to separate recognition on commit tees. An adjourned meeting of the republican caucus will be held this afternoon immediately upon the adjournment of the Senate when the names selected by the democratic caucus will l?e presented and the full list of committees will be made out and announced in the Senate to morrow and that body will be ready for work. The Senate will, however, adjourn over until Monday alter the announcement of the com mittees. Later It is rei-orted that the matter has been settled between the liberals and democrats, and that Mr. Casserly retires from the committee on foreign relations, leaving Mr. Schtirz thereon; Mr. Fenton from the finance committee, leav ing Mr. Bayard; and Mr. Trumbull, fr>>m the iudiclsry committee, leaving Mr. Tbarman. Mr. Sumner, as already stated, inclines serving on any committee, on account ol his bad health. Tub Civil Service?An Erroneous Im i'ressh?

Mr. PatUn ^N.

He insisted ?h ?t there should be a better plan and more information upon the subject before tLi' measure was adopted. Mr. Cox (X. V.j said that the hi'tniliatiug coiite*sion had been made that the work could be done cheaper in private yards than in the r.avy yards of the government; and the gentle man trorn California (Mr. Coo^hlan had told them that the workingmen were oppressed by contractors. It was evident there were defects in the navy yard system, and he thought a bet ter system should be devised. He advocated a.-this was proposed as an experiment that the number should be reduced to six. so that the experiment should be less expensive; and he would then vote for three to be built by the navy ami three by private contract. Mr. Beck (Ky.i said he was not prepared to vote for the bill at -he present time. He desired mote information on the subject. He said that at the close of the war we had 6"?0 vessels, aud oi these 171 had been sold. We were expending twenty millions of dollars annuilly tor vessels, ami jet there were no new ones, and the 471 vessels sold in the last five years were sold in a way that Congress knew nothing of. lu answer to a resolution introduced by hiui and adopted the House, the Secretary of the Navy had sent in a very unsati>factory reply.

V I.en he via* informed where these worthless vcfsels w< re built; how t'n?y were built, and by whom; why they were sold, and at what jrice, and why they proved failures, he would be pre pari d to vote any amount ot money and lor any number of vessels to build up our ntvv. We were, ho said, keeping up cxpem-ive bureaus and cottly machiner v, an 1 yet wo ha 1 nothing at the close of a year to show lor it. He wanted to see that something was to be obtained in re turn tor exj>enditurea before he voted money tor the navy. Mr. Randall tPa.) urged that there sboald be more safeguards thrown around the bill, ami contended that the Secretary oftbeNavv was resj-onsible tor the depletion of the navy by the sale of vessels.
