J., Evening Ifcws.) Valvular disease of tho heart has ahvnya been considered incurable. Tho following Interview, therefore, will Interest tlic med ical profession, since it describes tho suc cessful use of a new treatment for this dis ease. The patient is Mrs. George Archer, of Clifton, N. J., and this publication by the Xcws is the first mention made of tho case by any newspaper. All physicians con sulted pronounced the patient suffering with valvular disease of the heart, and treated h;r without the slightest relief. Sirs. Archer said: "I could not walk across the floor; neither could I go upstairs with out stopping to let the pain in my chest and left arm cease. I felt an awful constriction about my arm and chest as though I were tied with ropes. Then there was a terrible noise at my right ear, like the labored breathing of some great animal. I have often turned expecting to see some creature at my side. "Last July," continued Mrs. Archer, "I was at Springfield, Mass., visiting, and my mother showed mo aa account in the Springfield Examiner, telling of the won derful cures effected by the use of Dr. Wil liams' Pink Pills for Pale People. My mother urged mo to try tho pills and en November 25th last I bought a box and began taking them, and I have taken them ever since, except f or a sh ort interval. The first box did not seem to benefit me, but I perse vered, encouraged by tho requests of my relatives. After beginning on tho second box, to my wonder, tho noiso at my right ear ceased entirely. I kept right on and the distress that I used to feel in my chest and arm gradually disappeared. The blood has returned to my face, lips and ears, which were entirly devoid of color, and I feel well and strong again. "Mv son, too, "had been troubled with gastritis and I induced him to try the Pink Pills, with great benefit. I feel that every bodv ought to know of my wonderful euro and'l bless God thatlhave found something that has given me this great relief." Dr. Williams' Pink Pills are now given to the public as an unfailing blood builder and nerve restorer, curing all forms of weak ness arising from a watery condition of the blood or shattered nerves, two fruit ful causes of most every ill that flesh is heir to. These pills are also a specific for the troubles peculiar to females, such as sup pressions, all forms of weakness, chronic constipation, bearing down pains, etc, and in tho case of men will give speedv relief and effect a permanent cure in all eases arising from mental worry, overwork, or excesses of whatever nature. Tho pills are sold by all dealers, or will bo sent post paid on receipt of price, (50 cents a box or 6 boxes for S2 50 they arc never sold in bulk or by the 100) by addressing Dr. Williams' Mcd'icino Company, Schenectady, X. Y. THE EDIBLE FROG. In Defiance of t. Patrick Ho Prospered In Irloh MarshcH. The edible frog is found in England, though, as it was first noticed in Foul ness Mere in 1S43, it is probably an in troduction from the continent. In the course of the last fifty j-ears attempts have been made to naturalize it in various parts of the south of England, but without much success. Nor has any bettor fortune attended the invol untary immigrants placed in Irish marshes, where, it may be mentioned, the common brown frog has prospered since 1C9G, in spite of the popular legend touching St. Patrick and his curbe. It is difficult to understand this aversion of the edible frog to the south of En gland. The climate is much the same as that of northern France, and conse quently the theory that its tadpole cannot undergo full development dur ing the dry summer, before the advent of autumnal cold, must be unfounded. At all events, it ought to flourish in Uedfordshire. Even for decorative purposes some of its kindred are worth acclimatizing. The American bullfrog, with a gape wide enough to swallow a chicken, or the unsightly Austrian Alytcs, the male of which bears the fe male's eggs on his thighs, would per haps not be acceptable introductions. Hut the beautiful tree frogs, one of which the European llyla is kept in Germany as a living barometer, sink ing or rising in the water as rain or drought is approaching, ought to be unobjectionable. The lovely striped species of the north African streams, which it inhabits in company with a trout, would be scarcely hardy enough, but the leopard frog of the United States might, with a little care, soon form an interesting addition to our or namental ponds, and, supplemented by the green "esculenta." impart the con trast of color to the homelier swarms of their brown denizens. London Tel egraph. HIS OWN MISTAKE. He Got Itadly Mixed Cp In the Chinese War rollcy. "Did you have a pleasant evening?" she asked, with just a little tinge of sarcasm in her voice as he appeared in the breakfast room looking weary and uncomfortable. "Fair, fair,' he sighed. "But we made one mistake." "Only one!" she exclaimed. "Usually when you go out to renew old associa tions with your college friends you make a dozen or more. What did yon do?" "Oh, we had a little champagne spread, early, yon know, so that we conld go to the theater, and after the theater, of course, we were hungry again " "And thirsty," she suggested. "Of course," he acquiesced, "both hungry and thirsty. Then we hunted up a good restaurant and had a little more champagne and and "Yes. What else?" "It slips my mind for a minute," he aid, wearily. "It was something in the nature of a Chinese war policy." "Chinese war policy!" she exclaimed. "Are you crazy? You're usually fool ish enough to eat Welsh rarebit about midnight and suffer for it all " "That was it," he interrupted. "That was what we had." "But what has that got to do with the Chinese war policy?" she asked. "It creates internal dissensions and disturbances," he replied softly. Chi cago Post. Patriotic Correction. The historian of Warwick, R. I., tells a story of Elder Charles llolden, who was pastor of the church in that town at the time of the declaration of Amer ican independence. He had been ac customed to pray for "the king and all in authority" in his public services, and his thoughts, from long running in the same channel, had crystallized them selves in words from which he found it difficult to break away. The elder was patriotic, and the new order of things interfered with his set forms of speecli. At one time, while praying, he came to the place, "We pray for the king and all in authority," and before he was aware of it, the words were uttered. He stopped short, and after an instant's hesitation, added: "Living in Rhode Island." Youth's Companion. THE RAILROADS. Report of the Interstate Commerce Con mission Freight Schedules Discussed. Washington. Dec. 0. The interstate commerce commission transmitted itf eighth annual report to congress yes terday. The report says it is the dut of shippers, railroad managers and citizens generally to assist the govern ment in running down violations of tho statute designed to protect their inter estss. It recommends that carrying corporations be made indictable and subject to fine for violations of the act. The report speaks of the unreasonable freight rates from Chicago and Cincin nati to southern points. Also of the unreasonable rates on wheat. It re fers to the failure of many carriers to post their traffic as required by law. The commission explains the necessity of providing single classification of freights for the whole country, saying that experience has shown the neces sity for congressional action, and sup ports the belief that uniform classifi cation depends upon the passage of a. statute requiring its accomplishment. The report states the railway service which pertains to shipping, billing and the statement, collection and correc tion of charges, especially as to tho traffic over connecting roads, is con ducted with much uncertainty, lack of system and regularity, so it justifies charges of gross carelessness and disre gard of the rights of the shipping pub lic. Carriers ought to publish their tariff rates and schedules plainly enough and employ agents skilled enough to enable them to correctly quote rates to ship pers. The fact that carriers under take, after the collection of over charges, to adjust the same, while right and proper in itself, does not fur nish an excuse or justification for the practice of overcharging to the extent to whics it is carried on. The present method of adjusting claims of this character is attended with such de lay and vexation to claimants that it is extremely unsatisfactory, resulting in great injustice to shippers and con signees. Undercharges also result in grave in justice. It is stated the provision of law relating to through routes and through rates on account of the limited meaning which had been given to it by the courts, is practically inoperative, and it is strongly urged that the law be amended in order to give effect to the intention of congress in respect to this matter. After a lengthy review of the rail road pooling bill, the report says: "We submit for the consideration of con gress that pooling without other reme dial legislation is unadvisablc. Pool ing under conditions to be approved by the commission and rendered capable of easy and direct regulation with ac companying effective remedial legisla tion we believe might safely be tried." On the government ownership of rail roads, the commission refrains from expressing any opinion. As to the great strike of 1S01, the commission states its reasons for not entering upon an investigation of this matter. The controversy included matters outside of the commission's jurisdiction. It is urged the commis bion should have express authority by statute to investigate the acts of all parties in relation to such matters. As to the financial condition of rail ways, reference is made to the financial embarrassment of railwa3's resulting from the commercial depression and other causes. On June 30, there were 156 roads in the hands of receivers, while the financial depression has been a factor in bringing about embarrass ment of railways, it is believed that many of the receiverships were the natural sequence of mismanagement, over-capitalization and ill-advised pro jecting. Although the traffic has largely decreased during the year, the rates have also declined, showing that there has been unusual competition for the decreased traffic The commission includes in its re port statistics of railways for the year ended June SO, 1S93. On that date there were 174.4G1.77 miles of line in the United States, being an increase during the year of 4.S97.S5 miles. Tha number of railway corporations wan 1,890, being an increase of sixty-eight over the previous year. The capital ization of the roads reporting was S10, 500,235,410. The number of passengers carried was 593,3CO,G12, and the num ber of tons of freight carried was 745, 119.4S2. 'The gross earnings were Sl, 220,751,S74. the operating expenses SS27,921,299, leaving net earnings o S392.S.-j0,575, which is equivalent to 52, 314 per mile of line. The jm3ission calls further attec tion to the legislative enactment re quiring the application of automatic couplers and other appliances on the cars of the rsiiways, and gives figures showing to what extent equipments have been fitted with such appliances up to June 30, 1S93. It is stated that all new cars ordered by the railways are being supplied with automatic couplers and a large proportion with air brakes. The accidents of the year show little decrease on account of tho use of automatic couplers, and such a result is not expected until more uni formity in such appliances has been attained. Horses Cremated. HorKixsYiLL.E,Ky., Dec G. The largo stock stable of S. H. Perkins, situated near Elkton, Todd county, together with all its contents, consisting oi crops and fifteen head of horses, was entirely destroyed by fire.

Onstatt, a prosperous farmer of the Chickasaw nation, who was on his way east, changed cars at Monett and there fell into conversation with a Carthage man, who incidentally referred to the fact that Judgo John Onstatt was a resident of Car thage. Being convinced that it was his brother, Abraham Onstatt came at once to this city and the meeting was a joyous one. The brothers have been less than 200 miles apart for forty years, and during all that time each has supposed the other dead. To Prosecute Election Frauds. Kansas Citv. Mo., Dec a Gov.

TOILERS MEET. The American Federation of Labor Called to Order. TIIE PRESIDENT GIVES HIS VIEWS. Compulsory Arbitration Is Denounced by Him The Secretary's Keport John llurns, the Englishman Makes a Speech. Denver, Col., Dec. 11. The four teenth annual convention of the Amer ican Federation of Labor was called to order by President Gompcrs yester day. President Rhodey Kenehan, of the Denver trades assembly, delivered the address of welcome, to which !Mr. Gompers briefly responded. The latter spoke feelingly of the almost desperate condition of labor at the present time. Thomas 31. Patterson, of Denver, was then introduced and delivered an ad dress on "Labor's Rough, but Noble Struggle." When the convention came to order for the afternoon the committee on credentials reported on contested dele gations and asked time to consider three contests. The request was grant ed. The report states in conclusion: "In presenting this report your com mittee takes pleasure in reporting that we have had placed before us creden tials of David Holmes and John Burns, representing the trades unions of Great Britain, and it affords us unbounded pleasure to recommend to the conven tion the seating of these delegates from over the ocean and the granting to them of the full privileges of the con vention." The president then delivered his an nual report He complimented the or ganization upon being able to preserve its existence during the recent adverse circumstances. He defended the action of the federation in regard to the A. R. U. strike by the assertion that Mr. Debs' proposition submitted to them was a virtual acknowledgment that the strike was a failure. The honest effort of the government to regulate immigration was 'acknowledged, but amendments to the laws were suggest ed, the most important of which were speedy trials of immigrants suspected of being under contract, and the send ing of agents to foreign countries to inspect prospective immigrants. Hope was expressed that government tele graph and telephone service will soon lie established in connection with the postal department and unions among government employes were recommend ed as an aid to the movement. The es tablishment of a national labor day was referred to as the only sunbeam labor received from the last session of congress. The convention was asked to indorse the Phillips bill for the creation of an industrial commission. The efforts of the officers of the federation in behalf of free coinage of silver were men tioned, and a better understanding of the subject by laboring men gencrally was reported. The matter of proposed i-cmi-annual conferences witli the Knights of Labor was referred to the convention, but a union of th-s organi zations was not recommended. Mr. Gompcrs strongl" opposed any move ment looking to independent political action by organized labor at present The present time was suggested as op portune for the inauguration of a vig orous demand for an eight-hour day and for a law prohibiting contract work on government improvements. The proposition to establish compul sory arbitration was denounced, and the charge was made that designing persons were advocating it as a means of destroying labor organizations. Secretary Chris Evans submitted his report of the finances and numerical strength of the federation. The re ceipts from sources, including a bal ance November 1, 1S'.3. of S7.177. J I were stated at S-2.493.S7. The expend itures were given at S17.30J.0S, includ ing $3.573.3t donated to the sustenance of striking unions. Five hundred of this was given to the Debs defense fund. The receipts and expenditures were less than in 1S92 and 1893. There is a balance of $5,191.79, which is less than at any other time since 1S90. The report showed that 1G7 charters were issued during the year for local and central unions and state federa tions in thirty stites. Several unim portant amendments to the constitu tion were recommended.. Regarding the proposition that the federation en ter politics, the secretary recommend ed that such action be consigned to work independent of any party. Closer organization and a geneml breaking away from political parties was recommended. The treasurer, John B. Lennon, made his speech and was practically a resume of the finan cial items of Secretary Evans' report. President Gompers then introduced Hon. John Burns, who made a short address. He said: ".Air. David Holmes and myself were chosen by the organi zations of labor of the Old World to represent them in this, the first Amer ican labor convention at which En gland representatives were present The convention that appointed us com prised 400 delegates, of whom 100 were members of Parliament, jus tices or municipal officers. This shows what a hold organized la bor has upon the people of En gland. I shall be pleased to hear ten 3-ears from now that you have pro gressed as far as we have to-day. Our coming here is interesting for many reasons, one of which is that the coun try from which we come initiated the emploj-racnt sj-stern. I would say, however, that while England inau gurated industrial competition, Amer ica has eclipsed her in monopolies." He spoke feelingly of the warm wel come they had received and gave some words of "advice as to the future work in convention. Mr. Holmes excused himself from speaking on account of a heavy cold contracted on his way to the city. The interstate commerce commission has issued a preliminary report on re ceipts and expenditures of railroads. TnE composer of the air of "Annie Laurie" and of the words as now sung is still alive.

CONGRESS. Condensed Proceedings of tho Senate and House. TnE second session of the Fifty-third con cress opened at noon on December 3. Prompt ly at that hour the vice president called the seuato to order and after roll call Senators Harris (Tcnn.) and Mandcrson (Neb.) were ap pointed a committee to wait on tho president and Inform htm that the senate was ready to rcceUe any communication he had to make.

At 12:3C o'clock tho announcement of the death of Con (frcssman Wright, of Pennsylvania, was made and the senate adjourned. ...Tho house had a small attendance and the only business trans acted was tho passage of the bill for the estab lishment of a military national park at the battlclicld of Shiloh. Tho appropriation was cut dow n from J 150.000 to $75,000. The senate held a brief but animated session on the uth, the chief event being the effort ol Senator Vest to procure a change in the rules whereby business might be expedited. The matter went over. Mr. Lodge offered a reso lution calling on the secretary of stato for tho tict3 in regard to the execution of two Japan ese students by Chinese authorities while under protection of the United States, which went over after a sharp debate.

Mr. Clark (Mo ) occupied the morning hour in u speech against the bill. The pooling bill was then debated until adjournment. 

COST OF OLD BOOKS. Tho Prices Vary According to tho Quality or the Dealers Putrons. The book hunter soon finds out that the prices for old, rare tomes varies in ratio to the quality, or wealth, of a dealer's patrons. This is as true of the book shops of San Francisco, Chi cago, New Orleans or Boston as it is of New York, the leading old book mart of the country. If you go into the stylish book stores of any of these cities you will have to pay twenty-five to fifty per cent, more for a book than if you went to the inconsequential dealers in out-of-the-way places in cellars or in tumbled down shops. Another point in book prices is the high prices charged for one sort of books and the cheapness of others. On the live and ten-cent counters will be found beautifully bound religious works and volumes of novels, worn and cheap editions of popular novels and technical works, too ancient to be of any special service at this time. It is an unusual thing to find a bargain on any of these cheap counters: the deal ers are exceedingly careful on that score. Albeit, every once in a while, a dealer gets caught napping, and the book hunter picks up a tome of great value. Then the prices go tip and down, ac cording to the fads. The Napoleon fad is now on, and everything about the little Corsican is selling at an advance on last year's prices. There is also a boom on Americans the early editions of Lowell, Hawthorne and Holmes now hring good round figures. Just as soon as the dealers find that the public is after a certain line of books,the dealers put up the price. This the dealers deny, of course, but the book hunter who makes regular rounds of the shops knows better. It may be said that religious works sell at the cheapest prices; dramatic works, memoirs and annals of the stage at the highest Works on sport average up with the drama. Audibon's works are always held at high figures. Frank Forrester's works, now out of print, are hard to pick up, and the few found on sale go at fancy figures. The high prices for sporting works are owing to two causes. Works of this character are rarely issued, except in limited editions, and are well printed and bound. Dramatic and sporting works seldom go into second editions, so when an edition is exhausted the purchaser must go to the old book store. These works gotten up in the style of Booth's letters and Jefferson's autobi ography both exquisitely illustrated are not thrown away when read, like most novels arc. but are preserved for reference. Hence, when a copy gets into second-hand book stores the figure asked is often greater than the pub lisher's price. N. Y. Advertiser. She Was Read)-. The train was full of fierce robbers.

What "A Prominent Senator" Has to Say About Currency Keform. WAsniNOTUx, Dec S. Mr. Carlisle's plan of currency reform is attracting great attention in and out of congress, and while his plan is favorably com mented on by tnany prominent mem bers of both houses, there are others whose opinions are of value who argue that the plan proposed by Comptroller Eckels, in his annual report, has su perior merit, and when thoroughly un derstood will meet with general ap proval. A prominent senator who is recognized authority on all financial luestions explained his views on the two plans. He said: Mr. Carlisle's plan for currency reform, when applied to practice, will produce the fol lowing results: Taking for the purpose of illustration the example of a bank havingilOO, 000 capital, such a bank would be entitled to issue notes up to the limit of J75.000 (75 per cent, of tho capital), but before doing so must deposit "legal tender" notes to the amount of SJ2,50) (30 per cent, of circulation). This In effect would be equivalent to a net Issue of 152,500 in circulation by the bank, or 175,000 received in notes from the government. Upon this $52,000 of currency the bank would earn Its profit, prov ided It could keep them in circulation, after deducting costs of redemp tion tax for "safety fund" and tax for adminis tration of comptroller's bureau. As a plan for relieving the general govern ment from the burden and charge of redeeming United States notes it would, according to tho secretary's estimate, result in securing the temporary deposit of $225,C0).0X) of these notes with tho government if all the national and state banks now in existence should take out circulation to the full amount proposed. Letus seo how this result would be arrived at. The present capital of all national hanks now In existence Is about 

JCC8.000.00J. If to this is ndded $332,000,000 as the capital of state banks availing themselves of the privilege, a total capital of SI. 000,000,000 would be had as the basis upon which to Issue currency. Assuming that all the banks possessing this capital is sued currency up to tho full limit of 75 per cent., wo will lime an Issue of bank currency to the amount of $75O.0O0,OJO. Against this le gal tenders to the amount of 30 per cent, of cir culation must be deposited, or SiS.OOJ.OUO. What will bo the effect of this upon the vol ume of money In circulation? Add bank notes issued, $750,000,000; less na tional bank currency retired. J172.000.UOJ; legal tenders deposited and withdrawn from circu lation, $S2'.000.000: total, 3397.000,000; net In crease in circulation, $353,000,003. Assuming that this Increase could be kept In circulation, a withdrawal or $Ti. 000.000 of United States notes is effected temporarily, but as there are $38,000,OJJ of these altogether outstanding, mere wouia still remain outstanding the major por tion ot tho mass, or about 23.OOJ.000, to harrass the treasury by presentation for redemption in gold. If the STjO.OO.OOO is not kept in circulation, the amount of legal tenders returned by redemption of circulation would be added to the large sum not refunded. Again, If the legal tenders deposited by tho banks are to be used for redemption of thoe notes on prcscntataion, there would be no difficulty in procuring any amount of them by presenting bank notes. So much for the working of the secre tary's plan, and now we take a look at the plan proposed by Comptroller Eckels. As he gh es few figures on which to base a compilation, but simply lines the principles of his plans, only a hypnotic illustration of Its practical working can be attempted. Taking a bank with $100,000 capital, as in the other case, the comptroller's plan appears to require that the bank deposit with the treasury $50,000 in United States or legal tenders (for cancella tion), in exchange for which It will immediate ly recche S.0.0OJ in bank notes, for the current redemption or whifh only It shall be liable dur ing Its lifetime, the got eminent assuming re sponsibility for ultimate redemption of the bank notes of this class only upon the failure or liquidation of tho b.ink. In this feature, there fore, there Is neither expansion nor contraction of the currency, simply tho exchange of one kind of currency for another just as good, but for the purpose and with the effect of entirely relic ing the go crnment of the burden andcost of current redemption during the existence of tho b.ink receiving and issuing the same. Under this branch of the comptroller's plan with the present capital of national banks (viz. 

JCGH.OUO.000) ?33t,0OJ,O0O of legal tenders would Immediately be retired and withdrawn from the possibility of being redeemed in gold by the general government, while a hanking capital of $17,00J,000,00J would serve as the basis for retiring the entire issue both of United States notes and Sherman act notes amounting together to about $98,000,000. While under the secretary's plan a capital of 81. O0O.0OJ would effect a withdrawal according to his own estimate of only $225,000, 000. Should the bank notes issued against "le gal tenders" be made available for lawful money reserve against deposits, as are now the legal tenders, this would operate to withhold them from redemption by tbe banks. Passing, to tho other feature of Mr. Eckels' recommendation It Is found that a bank with $100,000 capital could also Issue as much as 50, 000 of safety fund notes, constituting a llrst loan upon Its assets and upon the liability of Its shareholders, and redeemable upon the fall uro of the bank promptly out of a "safety fund." created by a light tax upon all the banks Issuing this kind of circulation. It Is upon this class of notes that the bank should make a profit, which would be a clear one over and above the light expenses for cost of redemption and taxation for the safety fund and for cost of operating the comptroller's bureau. It is on this class of currency also that the clement of "elasticity" would he found, for each bank could Issue cither none at all or as much as 50 per cent of its capital. Of the pres ent national bank capital 50 per cent, would bo $334,000,000, or a sum $1CC,000,000 greater than the total of present national bank circula tion, viz.: $l?i,000,000, while a capital of $1,003,000,000 would provide for $500, 000,003 of this "safety fund" circula tion, a sum $328,000,003 greater than tha present bank issue. So within the limits of $500,000,000 would be the expansion or contrac tion of this currency, and this limit could easily bo extended In future if necessary by reducing the percentage of "legal tender" currency to be supported by the banks and extending the limit for "safety funds" currency beyond 50 per cent of capital. The "legal tender" currency out of the way by Mr. Eckels' plan of substitution of bank notes, the practical result would be bank notes redeemable only In gold or silver coin, for there would exist onlv bank notes, gold certificates and sih cr certificates. Homes for Disabled Soldiers. Washington", Dec. 8. The annual re port of the board of managers of the national home for disabled volunteer soldiers was sent to the house of repre sentatives yesterday.
