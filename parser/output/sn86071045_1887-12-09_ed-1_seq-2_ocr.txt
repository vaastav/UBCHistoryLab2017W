The President's Message- Tariff his Only Topic. Thi mihhsjjh of President Cleve land to Congress is a rather skgnlar document. Heretofore it has been tbe practice, and supposed to be the command of tbe Constitution, that the President in bis annual message ■tost give to Congress "informstion of tbe State of tbe Union." The an anal messages of Presidents generally contained a summary of tbe affairs of tbe country. But President Cleve land ignores this practice—makes a "new departure" in fact, by referring Congress for information to the re ports made by tbe different beads of departments, on ail subjects save that of tbe tariff. This subject be treats in such a way as to bring it op and make it a direct and immediate hsoe before the people. Certainly tie Republicans can have no objection to this. It is jnst what tbey would desire, and tfcey have to thank Mr. Cleveland for Ma apparent forcing the issue. His whole argument ia against tbe prin ciple of protection. And tbey are tbe old arguments, such aa used fifty years ago. Tbe following from bis mssssge will show we do him no in justice In this statement.. Speaking of onr "Scheme of Taxation," as be calls onr tariff laws, be sayi: "Tbese laws, as their primary and plain ef fect, raise tbe price to consumers of all articles imported and subject to to dnty, by precisely tbe sum paid for such duties. Thus tbe amoont of the doty measurea tbe tax paid by those who porchase for use tbese im ported srtteL. Many of tbese things, however, are aianufactored la our own country, and tbe duties now levied opon foreign goods and products sre called protection to these home Manufacturers, because they muler it possible for those «»f our ppopfr «ho sre manufacturers to [f.t. frwH articles sod sell them for a price equal to that demanded for tbe imported goods that have paid customs doty. So it happens that while comparatively few use tbe im ported articles, millions of our people who never nse and never saw any of the foreign products, purchase and oss things of the same kind made in this country, and pay therefor nearly or quite the same enhanced price which the doty adds to tbe imported artielss. Those who boy imports pay the doty plscsd and charged thsraoo Into ths Usaaory, but tbe gnat majority of onr citizens, who boy domestic articles of tbe same doss, pay a som at least spproxi metely eqoal to this doty to the home manuiaciurer." A careful reading of the above dis closes tbe old free trade principle. But what if the amoont of duty laid doss rsisc tbe price to consumers!' Is it not better it sboold be so tbao to bs dependant upon and buy from foreign countries? Protection to borne Industriss gives smploymsnt to home laborers and mechanics, and a market for formers and prodoeers. So if even tbe consumer doss psy tbe manufacturer tbe price of tbe tariff, r the tariff at tbe same time bas givsn I ths consumer employment sod s mar ket at borne for bis labor or produc tion. Suppose there is no home pro tection or home market. Then would ws not pay to tbe foreign manufacturer what we now pay to our own ? And there woold be no competition, "tbe Hfe of trade " And there would be bo place for boms labor, and hence bo home market. It would be a Strongs country that does not protect its own industries, as as a pisi* who did not protect bis own business. Ths whole argument of ths Prssldsnt Is sgainst this prin eiple, and, bringing it op in tbe manner be bas, it will soon bs acted opon by tbe people at tbe polls, sod talll bs decided against bim. We will give bia message ia foil io oor next. —A "Surprise Party" and other ' communications will be seen on tbe fourth page of this psper. —Mr. W. N. Harlev of the Capi tal University, Columbus, Ohio, fends us a copy of tbe "Spectator," a mootbly published there in tbe in* terest of tbe University snd for which he bss our thanks. Th« President's tariff policy, says the Pittsburg Di*patch , seems to be iu brief ibet a "vicious, inequitable aod illogical "tariff should not be 100 ▼lciou*, inequitable and illogical, but just vicious, inequitable and illogical enough.

BLAINE wan pres cat in Paris sod witnessed tbe elec tion of a French President on Satur d*y lost. On seeing tbe mode iD wbicb it wan done, by tbe vote# of tbeir Chamber of Deputies, which is «univalent to our Congret»s, be iflust have thought bow easy a way it was compared to bin own eoiiutry, where a candidate bag to go before all tbe vo ters, once at least, and probably twice in Blaine's case. Still, oar fystem is better gTeatly than tbat of France, or any other Nation. 

LOTS of Presidents bare been de . AM ted for a second tor ID, Mr. Cleve land. John Adams was defeated for ; (••election by Jefferson in 1800; John Quincy Adams was defeated tor re-el ection by Jackson in 1824; Martin Van Buren was defeated (or reelec tion by liarrison in 1840 and again by Taylor in 1848, and Millard Kill- Mora waa defeated for a second term fo 1856. Tyler, Pollr, Fillmora, and Faarce were candidates for reoomina tion at tbe close of their terms, but were not nominated. Prosident ■ Cleveland has a discouraging history p to face and everyone knows history Meats itself. •« A "Dark Horse" Saves France. France has jast passed through a crisis in her Government that was looked upon by all the world with in terest if not with dread. This inter eat and dread came from the feet that her President had been forced to re sign his place and a new one was to be chosen. The manner of choosing is not like onto that in the U. S. While France is called a Republic, and is saeh in many features of her present government, jet the people do not elect their President. This is done by her Legislative assemblies, or what we call Congress. This body is composed of over 800 members and elects a President for tbe term of sev en years. But when the Legislative body refuses to approve the course of the President, or to vote him the money necessary to carry on the gov ernment, then the practice, if not the necessity, is for him to resign. This tbe late President, Grevy, one of the best public men of France, was com pelled last week to do. His offense was in having a son-in-law who used tbe name of the President and the seal of government in corrupt transactions. Strange enough tbe name of this son in-law is Daniel Wilson. Just how the President came to have a son-in-law of the English name Wilson has not yet appeared. But from his acts the French President was forced "to step down and out." Then tbe question of bis successor arose. Tbe different parties, "Right" and "Left" of the Legislature, Monarchists and Repub licans, had all assumed so violent a position that riot and tumult, if not another revolution was threatened, it was clear that unless a man accept able to all tactions should be chosen there would be trouble ahead. A long contest ended in securing such a man, Carnot, who was elected last Saturday over all others. He be longs to what are called the Republi cans, but is known for his prudence, moderation, fairness and honesty. He came in as what we would call in this country the "dark horse," and was nominated something after tbe fashion our "dark horses" are nomi nated in onr State and National Con ventions. And in fact tbe election of a President in France resembles somewhat tbe nomination here of our candidates for President, in our Na tional Conventions, where "dark horses" frequently ame. In France, it shows that there are some sensible, level headed men there at present, who had tbe wisdom and courage to ward off and defeat tbe aims of extrem ists. Carnot's selection satisfies all. It is hailed by tbe people, tbe press, and in Europe, as a happy deliver ance from an impending revolt among tbe lower classes of tbe French peo ple, who were determined no one of monarchists views should come to the Presidency. And thus France is saved from tumult at present. But how long quiet and order may con tinue there, no one knows. —The Children's Aid Society wilt meet la the United Presbyterian Cfaarcb Friday Dec. 9at 230 r M.

Tbe Supreme Court of tbe United States has passed upon and sustained tbe right and power of a State to pass Prohibition laws. Tbe cases before tbe Court were three, taken up from tbe State of Kan sas, tbe principles involved in each being tbe same as those involved in and urged against tbe proposed Pro hibitory Amendmout to tbe Constitu tion of Pennsylvania. The Supreme Court affirms tbe power of tbe State to pass sucb a law and answers ail tbe objections made against it. As to tbe argument often made that sucb a law would deprive persons of their property without compensation, tbe Court answers that according to reas on and common sense. It declares tbat it is not depriving a man of bis property; tbat it does not take bis property but simply abates a nuisance and tbat tbe owners are ouly prohib ited from wring it for a tptcijic pur pose which i H injurioun to the com munity. Tbe following is the lan guage of tbe Court on this point, tbe most important point urged against tbe rigbt of prohibition. Tbe Court says: "With reference to tbe assertion tbat tbe probiibtion of the manufac ture and sale of liquor deprives liquor dealers of their property without duo process of law, tbe Court say tbat all property under onr form of Govern meut is subject to the obligation that it shall not be used so as to injurious ly affect tbe rights of tbe community and thereby become a nuisance. The State of Kansas bad a rigbt to prohib it tbe liquor traffic. It did not there by take away tbe property of the brewers. It simply abated a nui sance. Tbe property is not taken away from its owners; they are only prohibited from using it for a specific purpose which tbe Legislature declar ed to be injurious to the community." All tbe other objections made to the passage of a prohibitory law are an swered in this decision. Tbe Court declares that no just rights of any one are infringed upon by tbe pass age of such laws. That the rights and well being of a community are superior to tbe rights and interests of any one citizen or class of citizens. That it is for tbe Legislative power of a State to say what is injurious to its people. And that when it says tbe manufacture and sale of liquors as a drink are injurious to its people generally tbat such a law is constitu tional and rigbt. This decision on tbe coses from Kansas will settle tbe question iu all other Htates as to tbeir power and right to pass prohibition laws, leaving only for tbe people to sustain tbem by tbeir votes when tbe time comes to place tbem in tbeir Bute Constitu tion* Breaking the Conferree System The Republicans of the 24th Con gressional district,this State, compos ed of the counties of Washington, Greene, and Fayette and part of Al legheny County, have already moved iu the matter of breaking away from the old system of making nominations Each county has appointed its com mittee of three to meet with the oth ers and decide upon the change to be made. The meeting of these oom mittees will be held in Pittsburg on to-day, Dec. 9. Their action will be noticed very caiefully by the Re publicans of this and other districts which are also moving in the matter bnt have not got as far along as the •24th district has. The Pittsburg Press, in alluding to the action of the Republicans of the 24th district, makes the following pertinent remarks relative to tbe same and its application to other dis tricts: "The call for the meeting of this committee recalls the fact that the last Republican state convention rec ommended the abolition of the old "conferee system." This is an aus picious time to inaugurate a new method of making nominations where two or more counties constitute a dis trict. The last legislature passed new apportionment bills which chang ed the lines of nearly every district in which the conferee sytem has been in vogue. There could be no better time then to alter the manner of se lecting candidates. The iniquities, unfairness and corruption incident to the conferee system have been dealt, on for years past by the Press. It has led to tbe defeat of many good men, and to Berce party strife and di vision in different districts. The peo ple demand its abolition. This con terence committee should lead the way in Pennsylvania. Let it declare that the people shall make all nomi nations directly in tbe new Twenty fourth district; then the people will see that tbe nominees are elected. Other districts are discussing the rec ommendation of the state convention. Tbe Twonty-fonrth should set them a good example." A Wealthy County. A citizen of Allegheny who lately made a trip through part of this coun ty, expatiates in print as follows : I notice in the papers from time to time a great deal about Alabama iron-ore mines. West Virginia coal lands, Kansas City and Paducab town-lot booms, and it does seem Btrange to me, that people will invest BO much money in these far away places when within fifty miles of Pittsburgh there are as yet undevel oped thousands of acres of the richest lands in U. S. Some time since I boarded a train for old Harmony. From here I traveled north into the backwoods ot the county. I spent over two weeks exploring along the waters of Slipperyrock creek and on Yellow creek. The natural scenery on Slipperyrock is Ihe grandest 1 have found auy where, especially at Muddycreek Falls. A valuable vein of limestone twenty foet iu thickness crops out boldly along this creek Higher above the limestone is a thick vein of iron ore. The water-power if utilized of Slipperyrock would run the machinery of a city. Traveling east of Slipperyrock to the headquar ters of Yellow creek, f fouud au im mense coal field. As you go up the ereek the vein gets thicker. The vein in many places along the creek is washed bare and runs from four to six feet in thickness. Many farmers drive their teams close to the hill side and dig out their winter's supply of coal of the best quality. Still higher above the six foot, or lower, is a three-loot vein, arid still higher up is a four-foot veio, which the farmers call block coal. At the head waters of Yellow creek up to the sum mit at Portersville there are thous ands of acres of this valuable coal bat s* yet undeveloped. This high couutry being tree from frost,is well adapted to fruit-growing 1 saw the most thrifty apple and peach orchards you caii find in the State. I saw hundreds of bushels of apple* rotting uuder the trees for want of cheap shipping facilities, Tnen, too, many intelligent, well-do fartuers iu western Butler county own large farms and have become rich at sheep raising. I also fouud some mossbacks who have never seen the electric light or a locomotive. On my return home 1 came by way of Butler. I visited the new French plate works, said to b<* the largest in the world.Naturalgas has made Butler boom. Six hundred new houses have been built there the past summer Taking into consideration the oil. na tural gas. iron ore, limestone, fire clay and the coal belt, there is not a richer county iu minerals in the United States than Butler. What Butler county needs is more railroads to car ry out the immense treasures to the market, A branch railroad built from Harmony by way of Yellow creek, would penetrate the great coal belt. A branch railroad built from Butler westward thirty miles to New Castle would also tap the Yellow creek coal belt. 1 may not live to see it, but the time is coming when a hundred acre coal fnrrn in Butler county will prove a bonanza to its owner. p.

Almost all the boot and shoe deal ers of this county, and many of our hotel keepers knew Frank Wbitmore, clever, sanny-tenipered Frank, whose cheerful face appeared at regular in tervals at their places of business. We have taken many an enjoyable ride with him, when on his business trips, and know that the woods of Butler County have resounded with the Methodist hymns, that he would sing on the way. For some years he has been a member of the firm of W E. Schmertz & Co. of Pittsburg, and lived at No. 19, Sherman Avenue, Allegheny, with his sisters. Two weeks ago he became ill with diphthe ria and suffered intense pain He was unable to sleep notwithstanding powerful opiates administered by the attending physician. The loss of sleep had the effect of dethroning his rer>son. This was first noticed last Sunday morning, when he asked bis sister to remove the screen from his bed He raved very much upon find ing that this could not be done. Af terward he claimed that two hideous looking tramps were standing at the foot of the bed taunting him. Every effort was made to compose the pa tient. and shortly after noon he fell asleep. About 2 o'clock his sister left his bedside She had not been absent from the room more than two min utes when the sharp crack of a revol ver rang through the house The members of the family hastened to the room of the sick man, aud upon entering saw him lying upon the floor with a smoking revolver clutched tightly in right hand. Blood was spurting from a bullet hole on the forehead between the eyes. The leaden missile lodged in the brain,and death was instantaneous. The body was immediately placed oa the bed aDd Dr. McCann was sum moned, bat his services were not needed* Mr. Wbitmore carried a re volver only when traveling. Several months ago he purchased a fine Smith & Wesson 32 calibre weapon, but never used it. The weapon wag placed on a shelf in a closet in his bedroom. Although very weak, he succeeded in walking across the room to the closet, where he procured the fatal Instrument. Mr. Wbitmore was 37 years of age He was a single man. About 18 years ago be entered the employ of W. E. Schmertz & Co as salesman. He paid the closest attention to every detail of the business aud soon gaiued the confidence ol his employers They advanced him until be occupied the most -eßponsible position in the es tablishment, and about three years ago he was admitted into the firm. The deceased was a member of the Christ M. E Church on Penn avenue and took an active part in cturch woik for 17 years. He was also in terested in charities and benevolent inbtitutioiiu. Powder! y's Decision. INDIANAPOLIS, Nov. 24 E. F. Gould, of this city, secretary of Dis trict Assembly No. lOG, Knights of Labor, recently wrote to General Master Workman Powderly urging him to reconsider his determination to retire from the leadership of the Knights of Labor at the expiration of his present lerm. He has just re ceived a response from Mr. Powderly, in which he says that he does not see how he can consistently reconsider his determination In speaking of abuse and threats of impeachment he says : "Thronjfh this cloud of gloom hut one ray of light made ita way, and that carue from far away Denver, where District Assembly, 82, passed those ringing resolutions endorsing my eonrse and condemning the Anar chist element which sought to prosti tute the order to its own baseness I felt, brother Gould, the order would stand more <"heerf illy by some other man than it would stand by me. Tru«, 1 have never had cause to find fault with the official treatment I have received, hut when blows full thick aud fast a friendly hand of in tercession now and then cheers the person upon whose head the blows are falling' I believe the best s«-r vicis that I can ren'lur the order is to step aside and allow some other member to do do the work 1 am try ing to do. I h ve d voted years to the cause of labor. My life iu the service of humanity has been one constant fi#ht by night aud day against the enemies of labor and the elements of discord which opposed me from within and without. Such a lift* has been a most exciting one, and had left me with a legacy which 1 can never part with, in the shape of a heart trouble, that may do its work at any moment. I could not make such a subject a matter for dis cussion iu my unnual moSMsagc or before the General Assembly.

The warden was away when Sher iff Kramer went to the penitentiary for him, and the Sheriff had some trouble getting him, aud he was not allowed to come until the President of the Board authorized it. Then both his feet and hands were secured by chains and he was put in a buggy and hauled to the West Penn depot accompanied by the Sheriff, and two officers of the Pen. named Dean and Geyer. While in the Court-room and about the Court House quite a number of people shook hands with him, and that afternoon when he was taken from the jail to the depot, a crowd of about one huudred assembled around the jail door to have a last look at him. Old Miss McKeever, who pos itively identified Simpson,on the trial here as one of tbeburglars, was stand ing in the door,and was seen to shake ber head vigorously after Haggerty passed her.

BBIDOEPOUT, CONN , Dec. s —Mrs. Gilligan, the renowned puncher ot the Numidiaa liou, is to be married in Ma dison Square Garden, New York, in February, "under the management of P.T Baruum." Two weeks ago Mrs. Gilligan was hardly kuown outside her own neigh borhood. She came in prominence from prodding the escarped lion from the burning winter quarters of the show The lion was dining on Mrs. Gilli gan's cow. Mrs. Giliigan beard the cow lowing aud moaning. She hur ried to the burn and bravely smote the lion with a hoe handle. The lion paid uo attention to Mrs. Gilli gan, as he wus occupied with the cow. Mrs. Giliigan thereupon whacked the fierce beast a secoud time. The king of beasts thereupon ejaculated an aw ful roar, which cause Mrs. Giliigan to hastily withdraw. Help was sum moned and the lion was shot. Mrs. Giliigan was given a fine Jer sey cow by liarnum, and was after u ards hired for next season by the showman. Now conies the story that Don Diego Enpinesi, a ranchman of the West, has offered himself in marrigo to .Mrs Giliigan, and ar rangements have been made to have the knot tied in Madison Square Gardeu. TLe wedding ceremonies will occur upon a raised platform. The bride is to stand upon the skin of the lion which she belabored. In adjoining rings are to be mounted knights and ladies* Dens of wild beasts will be brought in as a side-show The other details are not yet arranged, but the steam calliopes will be tuned up to Mendol- Bohn's "Wedding March," aud twen ty clowns will strew flowers. The wedding is to be the crowning event of Barnum's life. It will be: "Here's to the man that married the woman that whacked the lion, that eat the cow, that dwelt iu the house at Bridgeport." Scenes In The House. WASH r.*j(riroN, Dec. s—Long be fore the hour of noon the galleries of the House were crowded to the ut most capacity with spectators drawn together to witness the opening scones of a new Congress. The ladies were in the majority anil their gay costumes lent an air of ani mation to the chamber. On the floor members congregated arid exchanged greetings aud congratulations. There were very few floral decorations upon the desks of members. At noon the Clerk of the House called the body to order and was about to call the roll when a crank iu the gallery started a Salvation army hymn, which he sang lustily till ejected by a doorkeeper, which was not until several minutes elapsed, as the crowd impeded the official in his attempts to reach the musician The Clerk then proceeded with the roll call amid a good deal of confusion caused by gentlemen renewing old acquaintances or forming new ones amid much talk and laughter. The crank who had interrupted the proceedings by singing in the gallery was seen shortly niter he had been ejected, and asked, "Who are you ?" "Patrick Dugau," wan the reply.
