In pursuance of the notice given, short though it necessarily was, a number of farmers gathered at the Court House, Nov. -".ith, and were met by Hon. Thomas J. Edge,Secre tarv of Agriculture of Pennsylvania ; HoilJuIiii Hamilton, Deputy Secre tary and Director of Institutes; Prof. Goo. T. Powell, of the Penn sylvania State College. Mrs. Edge, wife of the Secretary was also pre sent. The institute was called to order nt 2 p. m. by J. H. Van Etten, Chairman of County Committee of institutes for Pike, who introduced Prof. Hamilton, that gentleman ex plained the object and the beginning of the work in this state. He said it is not a new thing. The state hoard of agriculture liegan tho work years ago and began by inviting peo ple to come into it. The first meeting was small but tho work has gained until now it covers the entire state. At the last session of the Legislature a bill was passed establishing a De partment of Agriculture creating a secivtury, and defining his duties. Under this are several Hulftlopart- ments. The Forestry Commissioners, Dairy and Food Commissioners and Geological Department. Tho whole object is to lx-nofit the agricultural interest. The act is of wide scojie and covers the development of all branches of industry pertaining to the farming. A few years ago there was not so much competition as now, and not as much difficulty in making money in farming. The farmers raised cattle, wain, horses, butter and pork, and found it all profitable. Now there is a change, and it becomes a grave question whether he can make both ends meet. Tho state recognized this fact, and established this bureau. Tho farmers of to-day aro lietter farmers than they were then be cause they now farm more scientifi cally, and with better understanding of cost and profit. Some attribute tho present depression to silver, some say the tariff , and others foreign competition, and tho board was es tablished to enquire into those ques tions, ThisdciMirtnient of institute work is to get men to come here who have spent their whole lives in the work of farming, and to meet the young men who are beginning. We come to compare notes, and to se if our wisdom combined cannot get at the root of the trouble. ( )ur farmers are busy, they have no time to travel, and many have not tho means to go out and by observation and study learn of those who havo mado suc cessful experiments, These in stitutes aro to bring these ex periments, and tho history of their success homo to every one. It is far easier to move one man than to transport tho fanners to those places. The fruit grower, tho dairy men, the grain raiser are all enquiring what is liest to do Tho institute proposes to bring the men from the places where these things have boon done successfully and havo them tell the story of the manner in which it was accomp lished. It is proposed to go into all the world and get the men who stand at the head of the different branches of agriculture, such as Gov. Hoard, in the dairy j the horsemen, the gmjio man, the grain man, and bring them before you, tliat they may tell of tho methods, kind of soil, prepara tion, and care neceessary to make successful tho different branches. It is also proposed to go a step far ther, and add a department which sliall get all these matters in books, and to have a central agency, which 

MILKORD. PIKE will tell you the best bonk on any of these subjects. Formerly in making inn, it was the custom to let a man givss t lie quan tity of ore of each, kind m-eei-s-w , to produce a certain kind of steel. Ho often made costly failures. Carnagie employs expert chemists, there js no guess work, and few failures, Tho banks figure their profits on of one per cent, small profits, but sure. The furniture manufacturer, who sell a bedstead, of oak, with carved headboard,cratcd complete F. O. B. for one dollar, knows to one half a cent the cost of every operation. He makes 10 cents on each one and it is a certain profit. Farmers a re behind in these matters, they do not know the cost of what the' produce. If you do not know just the quantity of hay or oats, a horse or cow needs and feed nn an imal It pounds per day more than necessary, you make it cost you the profit you should get. You measure your milk by quantity and not by quality, and you do not know which cow it is profitable to keep and which one is costing more than she pro duces. Fanners must look at the small things as do the bankers and the manufactures. They must know the exact cost of production and how to produce most economically in order to compete successfully with those who measure these mat ters. Prof. Geo. T Powell, of the Penn sylvania State College was then introduced. Ho spoke of the won derful development in the west and south, and the adaptability of the land in those sections to produce certain products. In tho east our agricultural industries are undergo ing a trial, and it is because in those sections the land produces of certain kinds more cheaply than ours.so when ho returned from there he re alized that certain kinds of farming aro better ndaptod to cheap lands such as grain growing and stock raising, and that he must abandon those branches on the high priced land in tho east. Minnesota is one vast wheat field, and the ability to raise grain and cattle so cheaply in the west and south has affected the price here. So we must change our lines and become somewhat of speci alists. Dairying is on a dilVerent basis from what it was. Butter making must be studied specially, and not carried on in tho same way as formerly to be profitable. We must not estimate gross results, but net results from each animal. We must liave cows that produce G or 7 thousand pounds of milk ier year and that will make not one hundred and fifty but three hundred pounds of butter in the same time. On cheap hinds they may keep cheap cows but on high priced land it cannot bo af forded. When you sell a cow how do you know her value? Is it by any test you hnve made of her qualities as a milk or butter producer ,or do you sell and buy by guess if so it is not a business way. Then, too, we have an advantage over the western states. Minnesota is an empire of whoat with no trees. In the east we can grow all kinds of fruit, the land here is good for tliat purpose. What are the re quirements for fruit culture, and what the cost and profit? Every ton of hay takes 15 worth of plant food from the soil. A ton of wheat $7. Two hundred dollars worth of butter takes 23 cents worth, fruit takes practically nothing. Our orchards in this state are mostly old orchards they should be cut down when you have to used a 20 foot ladder to gather fruit the trees are no good. First put the land in clover, cut two crops so that the ground may become full of clover roots, then put on corn thon trees. Plow the ground desp, plow several times throwing the furrows one way until you have a deep outfurrow, then plow back, and strike out with furrows 30 feet each way. Never plant out trees in small holes. They want thorough and deeply broken ground. Be tween the rows of apples you may plant pluin, pouch, apricots, and small fruits. In tlus wuy, you may make one acre produce 500. The COUNTY. PA.. EI! I DAY.

It is a good plan to plant .Northern Spy, and graft. Several questions were asked by farmers present, lcadir.g to tho ans wers that there was money in evap orating fruits, and (bat sweetapples wereexcelle.it leed for stock. A num ber of varieties of strawberries were named as among the bet tor ones : Michaels Eirly, Cu mberland Tri umph, Warfield, Haviland. Bubach, No.5,Gandy,Cr Mc.vit and Sharpless. The runners should bo cut off and the I'lants kept in rows, so they were not less than 8 inches apart. Ho had one plant which raised 210 berries. Good varieties of sweet apples, Lady Winter sweet, BaiUtys Sweet and Crow Egg, which was very fine. The poach yellow cannot bo cured. Its symptoms, the chang ing in color of the leaves on tho tops of the branchos, gradually extending down, and a bunch of fibrous twigs growing from tho trunk, Cut such trees and burn them, Good culture and thorough trimming (the best way is to keep cutting the brunob.es back) may completely change tlie character of, an orchard .whicb hag a yellow appearance, and this is some times mistaken for peach yellows, but is not. Too much water, bad drainage will cause this appearance. Remove the water, A northern or western exposure is the best. At the evening session, Hon. Thos. J. Edge, Secretary of Agriculture took up the matter of fertilizer. He said the farmers are paying about four millions of dollars annually in this state for fertilizer, and are throwing away about one million, not because they do not get what they pay for but because it is not worth that sum to them. Under the law in Pennsylvania there isa heavy penalty which may be inflicted not only on tho niaiiiil'actures, but on the at.vut v. ho sells fertilizer if it d ies not analyze, up to i he advertised standard, audit is the duty of the department to see that fertilizer as named is in the sack. Farmers do not understand that when the an alysis as printed is (i to that they never get more than 0. Tho manu facturer does not give anything n way. He has his business reduced to an exact science, and that science is to bout the farmer, and does it, be cause the farmer does not know his no((ds, and does not know what is adapted to his land. The first col umn is the test. Pure ground bone, run of the bone means a good deal, after tho umbrella handle makers, tho button makers, and tho sugar re finer, have had their pick, tho Ixil- nnco is run of the bono. Bone is val uable according to its fineness. If it is coarse you must wait a longer time for results. Tho kind of soil makes a great differences as to kind of fer tilizer you should use to secure best results. A stream of water on the fann may divide two kinds of soils. Nearly all soils need phosphoric acid and potash, few need nitrogen. It is waste of money to buy that. The difference botwoon soluble and insoluble, and what is phosphoric acid, and rock, and its value were all fully explained. Suit is no good for cutworms, or white grabs. Fall plowing is best. The remedy for po tato blight is Bordeax Mixture. In order to prevent scab on potutoes, which is a fungus, it is good to soak the seed in a solution of 1 oz. of corrosive sublimate in 20 gals, of water, soak for half an hour. This will not injuire the seed and will kill the spores of the fungi. Prof. But., who has the care of the greenhouses at the state college addressed the institute ou the sub ject, " How Plants Grow." Life is a mysterious force, the germination of the seed dojiondson theconditions of light, heat and moisture. Seeds will germinate in a temperature vvrying from 'M- to" - KjiVi'H liul. Fxporiments have beeunii.de showing that plants grow at night as well as day time, though much in ire slowly. The quantity of seed of a given kind required for an acre depends on the quality, and he ful fillment of tho conditions necessary to growth as well as the character of the land. Prof. John Hamilton was then in troduced and gave the best till k on roads, what they are and what they should be and how to make them so. There are enough miles of road in Pennsylvania to go three times a round the world and twice to San Francisco exclusive of streets in boroughs and cities. Over 80. Odd miles. Those roads cost in lstu to keep in repair over 4,000,0(i0, !?:l per mile, And they have been cost ing that sum for years and are no better now than 20 years ago. He illustrated the picnic method of road working and the tools used. Worn out shovels, plows and stone hum mers. These ho would nholish, and procure a stone crusher. Crushed rock can be made for 65 cents a cubic yard. He clearly demonstrated that stone ballast 6 inches thick and 7 feet wide can bo put on all the roads in the state in 7 years for tho same tax as is now raised. The roads should bo kept round so the water will run off and not al lowed to hollow out in the center. During heavy rains they should be watched so as to prevent the liegin ping of awash. He is a practical supervisor, anu condemns the method projioscd to have county and township engi neers, The supervisor should be elected for three years, and the road tax should be cash, with the prive lege to work it out, provided a man worked. His address was a most clear.for. cible, convincing and common sense presentation of the question. After this the institute elected the following officers for tho ensuing year : John M. Aldrich, chairman ; J. H. Van Etten, secretary. NOTKSOIi' THE l.S I'lTI Tl-:. Mrs. Edge, wife of the secretary was present.

LOOKS LIKE BUSINESS. A Syndicate of Capitelisti Interested in tho Monticello Entenjion. President Haines of the Monticello Ji.ll.Co. is in town today, accom panied by the representative of a syndicate of capitalists, who will probably furnish the money for the much talked of extension of the Moniiiello from Summit rifle to Kiv:lon. 'i be particular purose of the hit ter's visit is to satisfy himself and those he represents that all the debts and obligations of the old Monticello Company have been extinguished and are not in any way a lien or encumbrance on the property of the present company. Of c ourse proof of this fact was easily furnished and now, it is un derstood, funds will be forthcoming, not only for the extension ultovc mentioned, but probably also for the Delaware Valley to the coal fields. The uniform success which has hereto attended the plans of Presid ent Haines warrants tho belief that the present project will bo carried into excut ion with all possible dis. patch.
