In tho Senate yesterday immediately utter the moved to ad reading of the journal Mr. Cameron mado to him to withdraw jouru. Appeals wero hi, motion, but he refused, nnd the Senate ad journed. This hasty adjournment, it is soul was to prevent any remarks on tho death of Horace Greeley, which it was understood Mr. Sumner prepared to submit. It is barely possible that the "Winebago Chief" desired to defeat the wish of Mr. Sumner nnd thus annoy the Massachu setts Senator to gratify the occupant of the White House. But in either case be showed « spirit which does not commend itself; nor will it prevent the eulogy of Greeley by Sumner, which can be made at any other time just as well. It would have looked better in Cameron to have held back and allowed some younger Radical Senator, who had not received so many helps from the deceased journalist, to extiibit such unworthy spite. A i A was Comments on tho Message. The New York World in commenting on flic President's Message compares it with the queen s It says: —We have speeches from the throne, a President who took no interest m J'ubhc ques lions until he was brought under - t sense of official duty. A born statesman looks into these matters to satisfy an irrepressible mental took the slightest craving; but Oeu. Oraul never interest In the practical working ol the Uovh li ment until he was constrained by the requirements of his position. He has accordingly no lertihtj, no foresight, no strong grasp of any question, no original buggcstious to meet and match cmcr„iug situations. He is u passive bucket into t'kich minds ot more resources pump their ulese, nnd he merely empties out the contents into his annual messages. lu this last message - . , . many recommendations; but they relate inanity to gathering up the tail-ends ot spent questions. The emerging, rising future has uot dawned upon his obtuse mind. He has not the foresight to sow; he has not the vigor to reap ; he merely follow s as a gleaner behind those who have put in the seed and gathered the harvest. We will recite all the recommendations ot this message, auu we beg the readers to note how few of them suggest the handle tiie rake of the recital, cutting out President Grant makes spring plough, how many gleaner. We proceed to our every recommendation in the message, was never before such a collection ot the oudb And tail-ends of bygone subjects. The Age says, the document made up chiefly of the repital of public events and the enumeration of particulars from t he re ports of tine several Departments. >> e re member no message with so few original ^ icw s or opinions upon general questions. The Arbitrations are rehearsed, and all the parties to them are complimented. The New York Sien says: "The message submitted to Congressyoster day by the President is a very commonplace document, with very few features that w ill at tract attention or excite discussion. 1 erliaps it is not strange that it is so It seems to have been for the most part pre pared by the heads of the several depart ments whose accompanying r»iorts are epitomized in it. Its most noticeable feature is the constancy and consistency with which the President apnroves and urges every that looks towards consolidation oi 11 measure power in tiie Central Government." The N. Y. Tribune says: The message, a. a whole, is a plain business doument, exhibiting a satisfactory condition of ihe business of Government and the coun try, making no startling recommendations, pressing some mischievous old plans and pre senting some good new ones. It will not addjto the President'» reputation or popularity Neither will it diminish either. TtaeN. Y. 1 unes says: Nothing could be more plain and business like than the inessag» the President sent to Congress yesterday. The N- Y. Herald says: ''But upon his eteamphip subsidies and inland canal schemes General Grant is entering upon a field of cost ly experiments, compared with which our enormous Pacific ra lway grants ami bonds are mere trifles and tiie seven millions paid for Alaska were a bagatelle. But if the grants of money suggest'd as tiie beginning of these commercial subsidies are appalling, what will they be in their full developement ! Th® Newark, N, J., Jourrtal denounces tiie Message as one made up chiefly by stale news and reters'to the gigantic plan of (so-called)in ternal Improvements, whereof he presents an outline. Canals from the Mississippi to the Atlantic, through South Carolina and Geor gia; canals from the Ohio to Ute Atlantic, through the Virginia mourtaius; canalsaround Xiagra Falls and land-locked navigation from the coast of Maine to the mouths of the Mis sissippi.
