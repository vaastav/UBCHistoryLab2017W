THE FOREST REPUBLICAN. I. C. WINK, Cditor a Prophiitok. WE I) NTS DAY. PKCKM UK 11 1 4. The rresldcnl'a Message. President Harrison's lad message to Congress ia fully equal io breath and profundity to any State paper ever is suer! by hlro. He tonchea eloquently and ably on all the important imsnes. nd hi views are well worth consider ing, not only by men whose business it is to carefully study economic ques tions, but by the masses. Like all of President Harrison's messages to the people it is under standable it is intelligent. No man can misinterpret bis stalwart, vigorous English, and every oiao can compre hend his clean cut sentences, boldly setting forth the policy of his adminis tration. Tbls message will be read and com mented upon not alone in this coun try, but more entensively in those countries to which the President pays respects in dealing with the tariff quet tion. The President is not an alarm 1st. He merely fears for the future from the history of the past, aud very truely says that the present generation cannot be expected to be influenced to any great extent by an expereence in which it did not participate. The full text of his remarkably able documeot will be found on the first page of to day's paper, and should be read by all who would be posted on the state of the nation. President 11ai:i:ion evidently be lieves I hut I he IViitnprati will have a sweet time increasing t!ie prosperity of the C'tuntiy hy adopting legislation that must i -iu K iu the reduction of waes. And he is not the only one who thinks so, either. Nkw York wants a liip canal up the Hudson from New York to the Erie canal and lli.-ncu to Lake Eile Hope they'll get it. By the way, win, t ever bcciimn of that ship canal from Pittsburg in Lake Erie that the Pennsylvania Legislature had a spasm over about four years agoT There was a commission appointed and it spent $10,000 or so, aud it made a report, but there it coded. If we are to nave a ship canal it is about time somebody jumped iuto the grave yard ami resurrected that old report. Harrisburg Telegraph. The President's message has had a very decided effect in placing the Re publican party in Congress io ao ag gressive attitude. The rout of Mo vember had evidently left the party leaders io some doubt as to their re lations in future movements iu legis lation. The President has pointed out the way aud the lenders are very willing to take that direction. The Democrats are very much exercised over the political references or rather "partisan licks," as they term thetn, which tbey characterize as a bid fur 1896. At last we have it definitely that the Weaver electors were elected in North Dakota. This great question having been settled, let the country prepare for Christmas. Jav Gould entered Wall street at the age of 23 with $5,000 iu his pock et, saved by rigid economy. His sons continue business at the same old stand with a capital of $75,000,000. IT comes troni Washington that a boom is being started there for Con pressman Stone, of Warren for the Republican Gubernatorial nomination in 1894. It is rather eariy in the day to talk of candidates, but if Charles W. Stone should recievu the nnmina tion be would get the biggest majority given a candidate fur Governor in thirty years. He is a statesman clean through. JIarrkburg Telegraph. Right you are. With him as our candidate, the Democrats would be saved the trouble of going to the polls. The Democrats pretend to be afraid that the Republicans are going to capture enough doubtful legislatures, in those Western States which elect U. S. Seuators, to keep that wing of the national legislature under Repub lican control. Ileal I v tbey are afraid of no such thing. On the contrary the majority of the Democrats of the country are hoping nod praying that the Republicans will retain their ma jority in the Senate so as to prevent them (the Democrats) from blunder ing io the passage of much bad legis lation on the very important issues just Dow before the American people. Tbey are geltiug desperately uueasy io this particular, reminding one of the fellow who yoked himself up with the calf: "Heie we come, d u our fool pictures! head us, somebody." The Hon. Tom Watson, of Georgia, to whom the world at large is indebt ed for the story that a maudlin Con gressman asked the querdinu "where was I at?" has reached Washington and ia looked upon with disfavor by the Southern Democratic Congress men. Mr. Watson was fur years a prominent factor in Georgia politics as a Democrat, aud aided the Demo cratio party to keep back Republicans from the polls and suppress the few Republitau votes thai happened to get into the ballot-box. When be ran fur Congress at the late election on the Third Parly Farmers' alliance ticket the Georgia Democrats played the the same game on him and hie party, and be was not slow iu denouncing it, For ibis do the Democratic rebel tirig adiers hale him, aud he will be giveu the cold shoulder until bis term ex pires. Lieutenant Governou Hajle, the Republican caudidate fur Govern or of Massachusetts, at the lust elec tion, says that on the face of the re turns that is tbe vote an oouoted Govoner Ruee.ll is re elected, but he does not finish what be ought to say Tbe votes that were cast for llaile, and wnicn were not counted, would nave snowed Russell under by at least 11, 000 plurality, the trouble arose out ol
