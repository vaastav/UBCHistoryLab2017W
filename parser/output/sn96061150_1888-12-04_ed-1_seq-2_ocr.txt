Report of Tlie Secretary of Tlie Treasnry Railroad Collision Other Notts of News. Washington, Dec 3. Long before the bcrar of meeting of the second session of the fiftieth coDgress the public galleries were filled with spec tators. On the floor hand shaking was indulged in and congratulations on reelection or condolences on de feat were exchanged among the mem bers. Jocose raillery on the part of Republicans, patient resignation on the part of Democrats, was every where evident. Both houses have taken a reces3, the house at 12 SO for one hour, and the senate at 12:47 for half an hour. Republican members who are prominently mentioned in connection with the speakership came in for an extra share of felicita tions, it being generally conceded on the floor that the next house will be Republican, with from three to seven majority. When Randall entered the cham ber, which he did at a few moments beforo neon, he was surrounded by his friends, desirous of expressing their pleasure at seeing him once more resume his congressionalduties. At precisely 12 o'clock the fall of the gavel stilled the tumult which ex isted in the kail, and silence reigned while the chaplain offered a prayer. The roll of membership was then called, and the hum of conversation broke out afresh. During the progress of the call of members, president Cleveland en tered the executive gallery and be came an attentive spectetor. The call developed the presence of twenty three members, there being eighty eight absentees. THE 

SENATE. It was an uunsnally full senate that responded to president pro tern In galls' call to order at 12 o'clock to day. At that time all the galleries were fall except the president s and the diplomatic department, as the minute hand overtook the hour indi cator on the dial of the clock, Ingalls let fall his gavel and chaplain Butler opened tlie proceedings witn prayer. A few moments were spent in greet ing senators, and then senator Sher man offered the usual resolution that the secretary notify the house thnt the senate is ready to proceed to business.

PANAMA CANAL STOCK. Paris, Dec 3. Panama canal shares are quoted this afternoon at 183 francs and 75 centimes. WASHINGTON NOTES. Washington, Dec. 2. Washing ton merchants are bewailing the sor ry prospect of business this winter. They say that all the Democratic of fice holders will go to hoarding their earnings in fear of the rainy day that may come almost any time after the 4th of March. This affects every class of business except food sellers. The same state of affairs existed, only in a more marked degree, just before and just after Mr. Cleveland's inaug uration. Tho only enterprises tbat seem to prosper conspicuously at present are the suburban real estate schemes. Nothing cools that crrzj. Mr. Harrison will be called upon to fill, during his term of office, a great many vacancies in the army. On May 28, 18S9, adjutant general Drum will be retired, and later in the same year paymaster general Rochester, quartermaster general Holabird, and commissary general McFeeley will follow. Surgeon general Moore will be retired in 1890, and chief of engin eers Benet's time comes in June. 191. Several brigadier generals will also leave active service, with colonels ga lore. In tho navy a great many re tirements will occur, The amount of currying for favor that will be done by the eminent military candidates for there positions, will be something pleasantly exhilerating to behold next season. Tbero must be something radically wrong about the treatment which the private in the United States army re cieves. The annual teport of tho adjutant-general to tho commanding general of the army states that the number of desertions from the nrtny for the past year was 2,430. When the fact is considered that the entire number of enlisted men in the army has not averaged during thnt time over 23,200 men, it will be seen what an enormous percentage more than one in each ten the deserters repre sent. Army officers have for jears been trying, or pretending to try, to discover a preventative for the deser tions from the army, which is getting more nnmerous every year. They have failed. Why isn't it now in order for a congressional committee to try its hand? Secretary of war Endicott, in his report, says that "from investigations recently made it appears tbat 80 per cent of the desertions occur before the expiration of tho second year of service.'' In discussing various plans suggested to prevent desertions, the secretary says: "It is worthy of con sideration whether the officers in command of troops at military posts or captains of companies should not be authorized to impose punishment for a minor offense. But in granting snen authority it will be necessary to specify the extent and character of the punishment for each offense, otherwise there would be no uniform rule, nor would it be wise to repose so large discretion upon a single of ficer." Preparations already on foot for the 4th of March ceremonies indicate that the inauguration of Gen. Harri son will be a very imposing one. There will be no lack of money to carry out whatever programme may be formulated. It is a matter of pride with Washingtonians to make each inaugural event excel its prede cessor, and for the time being feel ings of partisanship and prejudice are suspended and Democrats and Re publicans work together harmoni ously.
