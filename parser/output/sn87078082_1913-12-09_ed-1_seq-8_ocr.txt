One hundred and ninety-seven passengers were taken off the steamer IUngrand nt se while the ship was on fire. The rescue was made by the steamer Swanmore.

The Ulngrand also had her lifeboats ready when the Swnnmore reached her They were hanging in their davits loaded with passengers. Tlie rescue was made 205 miles northwest of Diamond shoals during a sovm-e southwest blow. There was a high sea, but there was such perfect discipline among jtho crews of both steamers that not a boat was jammed against the sides of either ship. The crew on the Ringrand, almost exhausted by their fight with fire, were eager to take the passengers to safety The passengers were not aware that the ship was on fire until yesterday. It is said, although some of them'hsid spoken of the decks being hot and had noticed that most of the crow were bo low decks. No passengers were permitted below, nnd women and children were ordered to their staterooms. Crew Showed Bravery.

One report from the burning ship says that after the fire "was got under control the passengers were transfer red from the' Swanmore back to the Itlngrand. Another says some of the passengers are still on the Swanmore. The Swanmore was only u few miles away from the Ulngrand when the lat ter called for assistance.
