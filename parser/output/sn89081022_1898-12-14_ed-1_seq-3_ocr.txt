A HISTORY OF THE WAR WITH SPAIN ?ance I? a for the re la Deferre Until After he Ratificatio of he a Treaty—Other Matters. Washington. Dec. 5.—Following is the of President McKinley's annual message read at the opening of the last session of the Fifty-first congress: To the Senate and House of Representa tives: Notwithstanding the added burdens rendered necessary by the war, our people rejoice In a very satisfactory and steadily Increasing degree of prosperity evidenced by the largest volume of business ever re corded. Manufacture has been productive, agricultural pursuits have yielded abun dant returns, labor in the fields of industry Is better rewarded, revenue legislation passed by the present congress has In creased the treasury's receipts to the amount estimated by its authors, the finances of the government have been suc cessfully administered and its credit ad vanced to the first rank, while its currency has been maintained at the world's highest standard. Military service under a com mon nag and for a righteous cause has stiengthened the national spirit and served to cement more closely than ever the fra ternal bonds between every section of the country. A review of the relation of the United States to other powers, always ap- ropriate, is this year of primary impor in view of the momentous issues which have arisen, demanding in one in stance the ultimate determination by arms and involving far-reaching consequences which will require the earnest attention of the congress. he W a it Spain. The president begins his history of the war with a review of the events leading up to It, in which he cites the suggestions made in his message on the Cuban subject one year ago, the destruction of the Maine and the action of congress up to the adop tion of the resolution which Spain accepted as a declaration of war and which caused the breaking off of diplomatic relations. W a In Declared Spain having thus denied the demand of the United States and initiated that com plete form of rupture of relations which attends a state of war, the executive pow ers authorized by the resolution were at once used by me to meet the enlarged con tingency of actual war between Spain and the United States. On April 22 I pro claimed a blockade of the northern coast of Cuba, including ports on said coast be tween Cardenas and Bahia Honda and the port of Cienfuegos on the south coast of Cuba and on the 23d I called for volun teers to execute the nurpose of the resolu tion. By my message of April 25, the con gress was informed of the situation and I recommended formal declaration of the existence of a state of war between the United States and Spain. The congress accordingly voted on the same day the act approved April 25. 1898, declaring the existence of such war, from and Including the 21st day of April, and reenacted the provision of the resolution of April 20 di recting the president to use all the armed forces of the nation to carry that act into effect. Due notification of the existence of war as aforesaid was given April 25 by telegraph to all the governments with which the United States maintain relations In order that their neutrality might be as •ured during the war. The various gov ernments responded with proclamations of neutrality, each after its own methods It is not among the least gratifying Inci dents of the struggle that the obligations of neutrality were impartially discharged by all, often under delicate and difficult circumstances. In further fulfillment of International fluty, I issued April 26 a proclamation an nouncing the treatment proposed to be accorded to vessels and their cargoes as to blockade, contraband, the exercise of the right of subjects and the immunity of neutral flags and neutral goods under ene my flag. A similar proclamation was made by the Spanish government. In the conduct of hostilities the rules of the dec laration of Paris, including abstention from resort of privateering, have accordingly been observed by both belligerents, al though neither was- a party to that dec laration, a to Call to Volunteers Our country thus, after an Interval o' half a century of peace with all nations^ found itself engaged in deadly conflict with a foreign enemy. Every nerve was strained to meet the emergency. The response to the initial call for 125,000 volunteers was Instant and complete, as was also the result of the second call of May 25 for 75,000 ad ditional volunteers. The ranks of the reg ular army were increased to the 11m'ts provided by the act of April 26. The enlisted force of the navy on the 15th of August, »vhen it reached its maximum, numbered 84,123 men and apprentices. One hundred and three vessels were added to the navy by purchase, one was presented to the government, one leased, and the four ves sels of the International Navigation com pany, the St. Paul, St. Louis, NewTork and Paris, were chartered. In addition to these the revenue cutters and lighthouse tenders were turned over to the navy department and became temporarily a part of the aux iliary navy. Strengrth of he Navy. The maximum effective fighting force of the navy during the war, separated into classes, was as follows: Four battleships of the first class, one battleship of the sec ond class, two armored cruisers, six coast defense monitors, one armored ram, 12 protected .cruisers, three unprotected cruisers, 18 gunboats, one dynamite cruiser. 11 torpedo boats, 14 old vessels Of the old navy, including monitors. Auxil iary navy: Auxiliary cruisers, 28 converted yachts 27 converted tugs, 19 converted col liers, 15 revenue cutters, four lighthouse tenders and 19 miscellaneous vessels. W a The national defense under the $50,000,000 fund was expended in large part by the army and navy and the objects for which it was used are fully shown in the reports of the several secretaries. It was a most timely appropriation, enabling the govern ment to strengthen its defense and making preparations greatly needed in case of war. This fund being inadequate to the require ments of equipment and for the conduct of the war, the patriotism of the congress pro vided the means in the war revenue act of June 13, by authorizing a three per cent, popular loan not to exceed $400,000,000 and by levying additional imposts and taxes. Df the authorized loan, $200,000,000 were of fered and promptly taken, the subscrip tions so far exceeding the call as to cover It many times over, while, preference be ing given to the smaller bids, no single allot ment exceeded $5,000. This was a most en couraging and significant result, showing the vast resources of the nation and the determination ?f the people to uphold their country's honor. Brie is to of he W a It Is not within the province of this mes sage to narrate the history of the ex traordinary war that followed the Spanish declaration of April 21, but a brief recital of its more salient features is appropriate. "The first encounter of the war in point of tflate took place April 27, when a detach* inent of the blockading squadron made a reconnolssance in force at Matanzas. .shelled the harbor forts and demolished several new works in construction. Victory The next engagement was destined to •, mark a memorable epoch in maritime war- fare. The Pacific fleet, under Commodore Q&j Beorge Dewey, had lain for some weeks at k.

For this gallant achievement the congress, up on my recomiheriaaiitstt, fit*y bestowed up on theactors present permanent and sub stantial reward. The effect of thjs remarkable victory upon the spirit of our people and upon the fortunes of the war was instant. A pres tige of invincibility thereby attached to our arms, which continued throughout the struggle. Reenforcements were hurried to Manila under the command of Maj. Gen. Merritt, and firmly established within sight cf the capital, which lay helpless before our guns. On the seventh day of May the government was advised officially of the victory of Manila, and at once inquired of the commander of our fleet what troops would be required. The Information was received on the 15th of May, and the first army expedition sailed May 25, and ar rived off Manila June 30. Other expeditions soon followed, the total force consisting of 641 officers and 15,058 men. Following the comprehensive scheme of general attack powerful forces were as sembled at various points on our coast to invade Cuba and Porto Rico. Meanwhile naval demonstrations were made at several exposed points. On May 11, the cruiser Wilmington, and torpedo boat Winslow were unsuccessful in an attempt to silence the batteries at Cardenas, against Matan zas. Worth Bagley and four seamen fall ing. These grievous fatalities were strange ly enough among the very few which oc curred during our naval operations in this extraordinary conflict. A a of Cervera's Fleet Meanwhile the Spanish naval prepara tions had been pushed with great vigor. A powerful squadron under Admiral Cervera, which had assembled at the Cape Verde islands before the outbreak of hostilities, had crossed the ocean and by its erratic movements in the Caribbean sea delayed our military-operations while baffling the pursuit of our fleets. For a time fears were felt lest the Oregon and Marietta, then noaring home after their long voyage from San Francisco of over 15,000 miles, might be surprised by Admiral Cervera's fleet but their fortunate arrival dispelled these apprehensions and lent much needed reen forcements. Not until Admiral Cervera took refuge in the harbor of Santiago de Cuba about May 9 was it practicable to plan a systematic military attack upon the Antillean possessions of Spain. Several demonstrations occurred on the coasts of Cuba and Porto Rico in prepara tion for the larger event. On May 13 the North Atlantic squadron shelled San Juan de Porto Rico. On May 30 Commodore Schley's squadron bombarded the forts guarding the mouth of Santiago harbor. Neither attack had any material result. It was evident that well-ordered land opera tions were indispensable to achieve a de cisive advantage. Hobson' Ban of Heroes The next act in the war thrilled not alone the hearts of our countrymen but the world by Its exceptional heroism. On the night of June 3 Lieut. Hobson, aided by seven devoted volunteers, blocked the narrow outlet from Santiago harbor by sinking the collier Merrimac in the channel, under a fierce fire from the shore batteries, escap ing with their lives as by a miracle, but falling into the hands of the Spaniards. It is a most gratifying incident of the war that the bravery of this little band of heroes was cordially appreciated by the Spaniards, who sent a flag of truce to notify Admiral Sampson of their safety and to compliment them on their daring act. They were subsequently exchanged July 7. a of a a a By June 7 the cutting of the last Cuban cable isolated the island. Thereafter the invasion was vigorously prosecuted. On June 10, under a heavy protecting fire, a landing of 600 marines from the Oregon, Marblehead and Yankee was effected In Guantanamo bay, where it had been deter mined to establish a naval station. This important and essential port was taken from the enemy after severe fighting by the marines, who were the first organized force of the United States to land in Cuba. The position so won was held, despite des perate attempts to dislodge our forces: By June 16 additional forces were landed and strongly Intrenched. On June 22 the ad vance of the invading army under Maj. Gen. Shatter landed at Baiquiri, about 15 miles east of Santiago. This was accom plished under great difficulties, but with marvelous dispatch. he Santlaaro a a On June 23 the movement against San tiago was begun. On the 24th the first se rious engagement took place, in which the First and Tenth cavalry and the First United States volunteer cavalry, Gen. Young's brigade of Gen. Wheeler's division, participated, losing heavily. By nightfall, however, ground within five miles of San tiago was won. The advantage was stead ily increased. On July 1, a severe battle took place, our forces gaining the out works of Santiago on the second El Caney and San Juan were taken after a desperate charge, and the investment of the city was completed. The navy cooperated by shell ing the town and the coast forts. Sinking of he Spanis Fleet On the day following this brilliant achievement of our land forces, July 3, occurred the decisive naval combat of the war. The Spanish fleet, attempting to leave the harbor, was met by the American squadron under command of Commodore Sampson. In less than three hours all the Spanish ships were destroyed, the two torpedo boats being sunk, and the Maria Teresa, Almirante Oquendo, Vizcaya and Cristobal Colon driven ashore. The Span ish admiral and over 1,300 men were taken prisoners, while the enemy's loss was de plorably large, some 600 perishing. On our side but one man was killed, on the Brooklyn, and one man was seriously wounded. Although our ships were re peatedly struck, not one was seriously in jured. Where all so conspicuously dis tinguished themselves, from the command ers to the gunners and the unnamed heroes in the boiler rooms, each and all contribut ing toward the achievement of this as tounding victory, for which neither an cient nor modern history affords a parallel in the completeness of the event and the marvelous disproportion of casualties, it would be invidious to single out any for especial honor. Deserved promotion has rewarded the more conspicuous actors—the nation's profoundest gratitude is due to all of those brave men who by their skill and devotion in a few short hours crushed the sea power of Spain and wrought a triumph whose decisiveness and far-reaching con sequences can scarcely be measured. Nor can we be unmindful of the achievements of our builders, mechanics, and artisans for their skill in the construction of our w&rshiDS With the catastrophe of Santiago Spain's effort upon the ocean virtually ceased A spasmodic effort toward the end of June to send her Mediterranean fleet.under Ad miral Camara to relieve Manila was abandoned, the expedition being recalled after it had passed through the Suez canal. Captur of Santlaaro. The capitulation of Santiago followed The city was closely besieged by land, while the entrance of our ships into the harbor cut off all relief on that side. After a truce to allow of the removal of noncombatants protracted negotiations continued from July 3 until July 15, when, under menace of immediate assault the preliminaries of surrender were agreed upon. On the 17th Gen. Shatter occupied the olty. The capitu lation embraced the entire eastern end of Cuba. The number of Spanish soldiers sur rendered was 22,000, all of whom were sub sequently conveyed to Spain at the charge of the United States. Occupatio of to Rico With the fall of Santiago, the occupation of Porto Rico became the next strategic necessity. Gen. Miles had previously beer, assigned to organize an expedition for that purpose. Fortunately be was already at Santiago, where he had arrived on the 11th of July, with reenforcements for Gen. Shatter's army. With these troops, consist ing of 3,415 infantry and artillery, two com panies of engineers and one company of the signal corps, Gen. Miles left Guantana mo on July 21, having nine transports con voyed by the fleet under Capt. Higglnson, with the Massachusetts (flagship), Dixie, Gloucester, Columbia and Yale, the two latter carrying troops. The expedition landed at Guanica July 25, which port was entered witn little opposition. Here the fleet was joined by the Annapolis and the Wasp, while the Puritan and Amphitrite went to San Juan and joined the New Or leans, which was engaged in blockading, that port, The major general commanding was subsequently reenforced by Gen. Schwann's brigade of the Third army corps, by Gen. Wilson, with, a part of his division, and also by Gen. Brooke, with a Scersofand art his corps, numbering in all 16,973 of men. On July 27 he entered Ponce, one of the most important ports in the island, from which be thereafter di rected operations for the capture of the island With the exqeption of encounters with the enemy #.t Guayama, Hermlguerez, Coamo and Yauco, and an attack on a force landed at Cape San Juan, there was no se rious resistance. The campaign was prose cuted with great vigor, and by the 12th of August much of the island was in our post session and the acquisition of the remainder was only a matter of a short time. At most of the points in the island our troops were enthusiastically welcomed. Protesta tions of loyalty to the flag and gratitude for delivery from Spanish rule met our com manders at every stage. As a potent in fluence toward peace, the outcome of the Porto Rican expedition was of great con sequence, and generous commendation is due to tthose who participated in it. a of Manila. The last scene of the war was enacted at Manila, its starting place. On August 15, after a brief assault upon the works by the land forces, in which the squadron assisted, the capital surrendered unconditionally. The casualties were comparatively few: By this conquest of the PhilUppine islands, virtually accomplished when the Spanish capacity for resistance was destroyed by Admiral Dewey's victory of the 1st of May, was formally sealed. To Gen. Mer ritt, his officers and men for their uncom plaining and devoted services for their gal lantry in action, the nation is sincerely grateful. Their long voyage was made with singular success, and the soldierly conduct of the men, most of whom were without previous experience in the military service, deserves unmeasured praise. Our Losses. The total casualties in killed and wounded in the army during the war was as follows: Officers killed, 23: enlisted men killed, 257 total, 280 officers wounded, 113 enlisted men wounded, 1,464: total, 1.577. Of the navy: Killed, 17 wounded, 67 died as result of wounds, 1 invalided from service, 6 total, 91. It will be observed that while our navy was engaged In two great battles and in numerous perilous undertakings in the blockades and bombardment and more than 50,000 of our troops were transported to distant lands and engaged in assault and siege and battle and many skirmishes in unfamiliar territory, we lost in both arms of the service a total of 1,668 killed and wounded and in the entire campaign by land and sea we did not lose a gun or a flag or a .transport or a ship, and with the exception of the crew of the Merrimac, not a soldier or sailor was taken prisoner. Tribut to Patriotism It is fitting that I should bear testimony to the patriotism and devotion of that large portion of our army which, although eager to be ordered to the post of greatest exposure, fortunately was not required out side of the United States. They did their whole duty, and like their comrades at the front, have earned the gratitude of the nation. In like manner, the officers and men of the army and of the navy who re mained in their departments and stations of the navy, performing most important duties connected with the war, and whose requests for asignment in the field and at sea it was compelled to refuse because their services were indispensable here, are entitled to the highest commendation. It is my regret that there seems to be no pro vision for their suitable recognition. a Overtures. The" annihilation of Admiral Cervera's fleet, followed by the capitulation of San tiago, having brought to the Spanish gov ernment a realizing sense-of the hopeless ness of continuing a struggle now becoming wholly unequal, it made overtures of peace through the French ambassador, who with the assent of his government, had acted as the friendly representative of Spanish in terests during the war. On the 26th of July, M. Cambon presented a communication signed by the duke of Almodovar, the Span ish minister of state, inviting the United States to state the terms upon which it would be willing to make peace. On July 30, by a communication addressed to the duke of Almodovar and handed to M. Cam bon, the terms of this government were an nounced, substantially as in the protocol, afterwards signed. On August 10, the Span ish reply, dated August 7, was handed by M. Cambon to the secretary of state. It ac cepted unconditionally the terms Imposed as to Cuba, Porjo Rico and an island of the Ladrones group, but appeared to seek to introduce inadmissible reservations in re gard to our demand as to the Philippines. Conceiving that discussion on this point could neither be practicable or profitable, I directed that in order to avoid misunder standing the matter should be forthwith closed by proposing the embodiment In a formal protocol of the terms in which the negotiations for peace were to be under taken. The vague and inexplicit sugges tions of the Spanish note could not be ac cepted, the only reply being to present as a virtual ultimatum a draft of protocol em bodying the precise terms tendered to Spain in our note of July 30, with added stipulations of detail as to the appoint ment of commissioners to arrange for the evacuation of the Spanish Antilles. On August 12 M. Cambon announced his re ceipt of full powers to sign the protocol so submitted. Accordingly, on the after noon of August 12, M. Cambon, as the plenipotentiary of Spain, and the secre tary of state, as the plenipotentiary of the United States, signed the protocol, Hostilitie Suspended Immediately upon the conclusion of the protocol I issued a proclamation of August 12, suspending hostilities on the part of the United States. The necessary orders to that end were at once given by telegraph. The blockade of the ports of Cuba and. San Juan de Porto Rico was in like manner raised. On August 18 the muster out of 100,000 volunteers, or as near that number as was found to be practicable, was or dered. On December 1 101,165 officers and men had been mustered out and discharged from the service, 9,002 more will be mus tered out by the 10th or the month. Also a corresponding number of generals and general staff officers have been honorably discharged from the service. Our N I do not discuss at this time the govern ment or the future of the new possessions which will come to us as the result of the war With Spain. Such discussion will be ap propriate after the treaty .of peace shall be ratified. In the meantime and until the congress has legislated otherwise, it will be my duty to continue the military gov ernments which have existed since our oc cupation and guarantee the people se curity in life and property and encourage ment under a just and beneficent rule. As soon as we are in possession of Cuba and have pacified the island, it will be necessary to give aid and direction to its people to form a government for themselves. This should bo undertaken at the earliest moment con sistent with safety and assured success. It is important that our relations with these people shall be of the most friendly char acter and our commercial relations close and reciprocal. It should be our duty to assist in every proper way to build up the waste places of the island, encourage the industry of the people and assist them to form a government which shall be free and independent, thus realizing the best as pirations of the Cuban people. Spanish rule must be replaced by a just, benevolent and humane government, created by the people of Cuba, capable of performing all International obligations and which shall encourage thrift, industry and prosperity, whatever may have been their will among all of the inhabitants, whatever may have been their relations in the past. Neither tevenge nor passion should have a place in the new government. Until there is com plete tranquillity in the island and a stable government inaugurated military occupa tion will be continued. Nlcaragman Canal. The Nicaraugua canal commission, under the championship of Rear Admiral John G. Walker, appointed July 24, 1897, under the authority of a provision in the sundry civil act of June 4 of that year has near ly completed its labors, and the results of its exhaustive inquiry into the proper route, the feasibility and the cost of con struction of an interoceanic canal by a Nic araguan route will be laid before you. In the performance of Its task the commission received all possible courtesy and assist ance from the governments of Nicaragua and Costa Rica, which thus testified their appreciation of the importance of giving a speedy and practical outcome to the great project that has for so many years en grossed the attention of the respective countries. As the scope of recent inquiry embraced the whole subject, with the aim of'making plans and surveys for a canal by the most convenient route,- it necessarily included a review of the results of previous surveys and plans, and in particular those adopted by the Maritime -Canal company under its existing concessions from Nicaragua and Costa Pica, so that to this extent those grants necessarily held an essential part in the deliberations and conclusions ofthe: canal commission as they have held and must needs hold in the discussion of the matter by the congress. Under these cir cumstances and in view of overtures made to the governments of Nicaragua and Costa Rica by other parties for a new canal concession predicted on the as sumed approaching lapse of the contracts of the Maritime Canal company With those states, I have not hesitated to express my conviction that considerations of expedi ency and international policy, as between the several governments interested in the construction and control of an inter oceanic canal by this route require the maintenance of (he status quo. until the canal commission shall have reported and the United States congress shall have had Mfj the opportunity to pass finally upon the whole matter during the present session, without prejudice by reason of any change In the existing conditions. Nevertheless it appears that the govern ment of Nicaragua, as one of its last sover eign acts before merging its powers in those of the newly-formed United States of Central America, has granted an option al concession to another association, to be come effective on the expiration of the present grant. It does not appear what surveys have been made, or what route is proposed under this contingent granted, so that an examination of the feasibility of its plans is necessarily not embraced in the report of the canal commission. All these circumstances suggest the urgency of some definite action by the congress at this session, if the labors of the past are to be utilized and the linking of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans by a practical water way is to be realized. That the construc tion of such a maritime highway is now more than ever indispensable to that inti mate and ready intercommunication be tween pur eastern and western seaboards demanded by the annexation of the Ha waiian islands and the prospective ex pansion of our influence and commerce to Pacific, and that our national policy now more imperatively than ever calls for its control by this government, are proposi tions which I doubt not the congress will duly appreciate and wisely act upon. Pari Exposition There is now every prospect that the participation of the United States in the universal exposition to be held in Paris in 1900 will be on a scale commensurate with the advanced position held by our products and industries in the world's chief marts. The preliminary report of Moses P. Handy, who under the act approved July 19, 1S97, was appointed special commissioner, with a view to securing all attainable informa tion necessary to a full and complete under standing by congress in regard to the par ticipation of this government in the Paris exposition, was laid before you by my mes sage of December 6, 1897, and showed the large opportunities opened to make known rur national progress in arts, science and Manufactures, as well as the urgent need of immediate and adequate provision to enable due advantage thereof to be taken. Mr. Handy's death soon afterwards ren dered -it necessary for another to take up and complete his unfinished work, and on January 11 last Mr. Thomas W. Criuler, third assistant secretary of state, was des ignated to fulfill that task. His report was »i£ before you by my message of June 14, 1898, with the gratifying result of awaken ing renewed interest in the projected dis play. By a provision in the sundry civil appropriation act of July 1, 1898, a sum not to exceed $650,000 was allotted for the or ganization of a commission to care for the proper preparation and installation of American exhibits, and for the display of suitable exhibits by the several executive departments, particularly by the depart ment of agriculture, the fish commission and the Smithsonian institution, in the rep resentation of the government of the United States. Pursuant to that enactment I appointed Mr. Ferdinand W. Peck, of Chicago, com missioner-general, with an assistant com missioner-general and secretary. Mr. Peck at once proceeded to Paris, where his suc cess in enlarging the scope and variety of the United States exhbit has been most gratifying. Notwithstanding the compar atively limited area of the exposition site —less than one-half of the world's fair at Chicago—the space assigned to the United States has been increased from the abso tute allotment of 157,403 square feet re ported by Mr. Handy to some 202,000 square feet, with corresponding augmentation of the field for a truly characteristic represen tation of the various important branches of our country's development. Mr. Peck's report will be laid before you. In my judg ment its recommendations will call for your early consideration, especially as re gards an Increase of the appropriation to at least $1,000,000 in all. so that not only may the assigned space be fully taken up by the best possible exhibitor in every class, but the preparation and installa tion be on so perfect a scale as to rank among the first in that unparalleled com petition of artistic and inventive produc tion and thus counterbalance the disadvan tage with which we start, as compared with other countries whose appropriations are on a more generous scale and whose prep arations are in a state of much greater for wardness than our own. On a in Our relations with Great Britain have continued on the most friendly footing. As senting to our request, the protection of Americans and their interests in Spanish jurisdiction was assumed by the diplomatic and consular representatives of Great Britain, who fulfilled their delicate and arduous trust with tact and zeal, eliciting high commendation. I may be allowed to make fitting allusion to the instance of Mr Ramsden. her majesty's consul at Santiago de Cuba, whose untimely death after dis tinguished service and untiring effort dur ing the siege of that city was sincerely lamented. Canadia Negotiations It will give me especial satisfaction if shall be authorized to communicate to you a favorable conclusion of the pending ne gotiations with Great Britain in respect of the dominion of Canada. It is the ear nest wish of this government to remove all sources of discord and irritation in our relations with the neighboring dominion. The trade between the two countries is constantly increasing, and it is important to both countries that all reasonable fa cilities should be granted for its develop ment. A a on of a a ii Pending the consideration by the senate of the treaty signed June 16, 1897, by the plenipotentiaries of the United States and of the republic of Hawaii, providing for the annexation of the Islands, a joint resolution to accomplish the same purpose by accept ing the offered concession and incorporat ing the ceded territory into the union was adopted by the congress and approved July 7, 1898. I thereupon directed the United States steamer Philadelphia to con vey Rear Admiral Miller to Honolulu, and entrusted to his hands this important leg islative act, to be delivered to the presi dent of the republic of Hawaii, with whom the admiral and the United States minis ter were authorized to make appropriate arrangements for transferring the sover eignty of the islands to the United States. This was simply but impressively accom plished on the 12th of August, last, by the delivery of a certified copy of the resolu tion to President Dole, who thereupon yielded up to the representative of the gov ernment of the United States the sover eignty and. public property of the Hawaiian islands. Pusuant to the terms of the joint resolu tion and in exercise of the authority there by conferred upon me, I directed that the civil, judicial and military powers there tofore exercised by tbe officers of the gov ernment of the republic of Hawaii should continue to be exercised by those officers until congress shall provide a government for the incorporated territory, subject to my power to remove such officers and to fill vacancies. The president, officers and troops of the republic thereupon took the oath of allegiance to the United States, thus providing for the uninterrupted con tinuance of all" the administrative and municipal functions of the annexed terri tory until congress shall otherwise enact. Following the further provision of the joint resolution I appointed Hon. Shelby M. Cullom, of Illinois John T. Morgan, of Alabama Robert R. Hitt, of Illinois San ford B. Dole, of Hawaii, and Walter F. Grear, of Hawaii, as commissioners to con fer and recommend to congress such legis lation concerning the Hawaiian islands as they should deem necessary or proper. The commissioners having fulfilled the mission confided to them their report will be laid before you at an early day. It is believed that their recommendations will have the earnest consideration due to the magnitude of the responsibility resting upon you to give such shape to the relationship of those mid-Pacific lands to our home union as will benefit both in the highest degree, realizing the aspirations of the community that has cast its lot with us and elected to share our political heritage, while, at the same time, justifying the foresight of those who for three-quarters of a century have looked to the assimilation of Hawaii as a natural and inevitable consummation, in harmony .with our needs and in fulfillment of our cherished traditions.. The questions heretofore pending be tween Hawaii and Japan, crowing out o* the alleged mistreatment of Japanese treaty immigrants, were, I am pleased to say, adjusted before the act of transfer by the payment of a reasonable indemnity to the government of Japan. Under the provisions of the joint resolu tion the existing customs relations of the Hawaiian islands with the United States and with other countries remain un changed until legislation shall otherwise provide. The consuls of Hawaii, here and in foreign countries, continue to fulfill their commercial agencies, while the United States consulate at Honolulu is maintained for all proper services pertaining to trade and the revenue. It would be desirable that all foreign consuls in the Hawaiian islands should receive new exequateurs from this government. Our in a The secretary of the treasury reports that the receipts of the government from all sources during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1898, including $84,751,223, received from sale of Pacific railroads, ammounted to $405,321,335 and its expenditures to $443, 368,582. There was collected from cus toms $149,575,062 and from internal revenue $170,900,641. Our dutiable imports amount ed to $324,735,479, a decrease of $58,156,690 over the preceding year, and importations free of duty amounted to $291,414,175, a de crease from the preceding year of $90, 524,068. Internal revenue receipts exceeded those of the preceding year by $24 212,068. The total tax collected on distilled spirits was $92,546,999, on manufactured tobacco $36,230,522, and on fermented liquors $39, 515,421. We exported merchandise during the year amounting to $1,231,482,330, an In crease of $180,488,774 from the preceding year. It is estimated upon the basis of present revenue laws that the receipts of the government for the year ending June 30, 1899, will be $577,874,607 and its expendi tures $689,874,647, resulting in a deficiency Of $112,000,000. w«,m,jr a on I renew so much of my recommendation of December, 1897, as follows: "That when any of the United States notes are presented for redemption in gold and are redeemed in gold, such notes shall be kept and set apart and only paid out in exchange for gold. This is an obvious duty. If tbe holder of the United States note pre fers the. gold and gets it from the govern ment, he should not receive back from the government a United States note with out paying gold in exchange for it. The reason for this is made all the more ap parent when the government issues an in terest-bearing debt to provide gold for the redemption of United States notes—a non interest-bearing debt. Surely it should not pay them out again except on demand and for gold. If they are put out in any other way they may return again, to be followed by another bond issue to redeem them —another interest-bearing debt to re deem a non-interest-bearing debt." This hecommendation was made in the belief that such provisions of law would insure to a greater degree th,e safety of the pres ent standard and better protect our cur rency from the dangers to which it is subjected from a disturbance in the gen eral business conditions of the country. Other Currency Legislatio Needed. In my judgment the present condition of the treasury amply justifies the immedi ate enactment of the legislation recom mended one year ago, under which a por tion of the gold holdings should be placed in a trust fund from which greenbacks should be redeemed upon presentation, but when once redeemed should not thereafter be paid out except for gold. It is not to be inferred that other legislation relating to our currency is not required on the contrary there is an obvious demand for it. The importance of adequate provision which will insure to our future a money standard related as our money standard now and to that of our commercial rivals is generally recognized. The- companion proposition that our domestic paper cur rency shall be kept safe and yet be so re lated to the needs of our industries and internal commerce as to be adequate and responsive to such needs is a proposition scarcely less Important. The subject, in all its parts, is commended to the wise con sideration of the congress. Th Standing: Army. Under the act of congress approved April 26, 1898, authorizing the president in his discretion, upon a declaration of war by congress, or a declaration by congress that war exists, I directed the increase of the regular army to the maximum of 62,000, authorized in said act. There are now in the regular army 57,862 officers and men. In said act it was provided "that at the end of any war in which the United States may become involved the army shall be reduced to a peace basis by the transfer in the same arm of service or absorption by promotion or honorable discharge un der such regulations as the secretary of war may establish of supernumerary com missioned officers and the honorable dis charge! or transfer of supernumerary en listed men and nothing contained in this act shall be construed as authorizing the permanent increase of the commissioned or enlisted force of the regular army be yond that now provided by the law in force prior to the passage of this act, ex cept as to the increase of 25 majors pro vided for in section 1 hereof." The importance of legislation for the permanent increase of the army is there fore manifest, and the recommendation of the secretary of war for that purpose has my unqualified approval. There can be no question that at this time and probably for some time in the future, 100,000 men will be none too many to meet the necessities of the situation. At all events, whether that number shall be required permanently or not, the power should be given to the president to enlist that force if in his dis cretion it should be necessary and the further discretion should be given him to recruit within the above limit from the inhabitants of the islands with the gov ernment of which we are charged. It is my purpose to muster out the en tire volunteer army as soon as the con gress shall provide for the increase of the regular establishment. This will be only an act of justice and will be much appre ciated by the brave men who left their homes and employments to help the coun try in its emergency. Th Pacific a a In my last annual message I stated: "The Union Pacific railway, main line, was sold under the decree of the United States court for the district of Nebraska, the 1st and 2nd of November of this year. The amount due the government consisted of the prin cipal of the subsidy bonds, $27,230,512, and the accrued interest thereon, $31,211,511.07, making the total indebtedness*$58,448,223.75. The bid at the sale covered the first mort gage lien and the entire mortgage claim of the government, principal and interest." This left the Kansas Pacific case uncon cluded. By a decree of the court in that case an upset price for the property was fixed at a sum which would yield to the government only $2,500,000 upon its lien. The sale at the instance of the government was postponed first to December 15, 1897, and later upon the application of the United States was postponed to February 16* 1898. Having satisfied myself that the interests of the government required that an effort should be made to obtain a larger sum I directed the secretary of the treas ury, under the act passed March 3.1887, to pay out of the treasury to the persons en titled to receive the same the amounts due upon all prior mortgages upon the eastern and middle divisions of said railroad out of any money in the treasury not other wise appropriated. Whereupon the attor ney general, prepared a petition to be pre sented to the court offering to redeem said prior liens in such manner as the court might direct, and praying that thereupon the United States might be held to be subrogated to all the rights of said prior lien holders and that a receiver might be appointed to take possession of the mort gaged premises and maintain and operate the same until the court or congress other wise directed. Thereupon the reorganiza tion committee agreed that if said petition was withdrawn and the sale allowed to pro ceed on February 16 they would bid a sum at the sale which would realize to the gov ernment the entire principal of its debt, $6 303,000. Believing that no better price could be obtained and appreciating the difficul ties under which the government would labor if it should become the purchaser of the road at the sale, in the absence of any authority by congress to take charge of and operate the road, I directed that upon the guaranty of a minimum bid which should give the government the principal of its debt, the sale should proceed. By this transaction the government secured an ad vance of $3,803,000 over and above the sum which the court had fixed as the upset price, and which the reorganization com mittee had declared was the maximum which they would pay for the property. Th Posta Service. The postal service of the country ad vances with extraordinary growth. Within 20 years both the revenues and the expendi tures of the post office department have multiplied threefold. In the last ten years they have nearly doubled. Our postal busi ness grows much more rapidly than our population: It now involves an expendi ture of $100,000,000 a year, numbers 73,000 post offices and enrolls 200.000 employes This remarkable extension of a service which is an accurate index of the public conditions presents gratifying evidence of the advancement of education, of the in crease of communication and business ac tivity, and of the improvement of mall facilities leading to thetr constantly aug menting use. a of the W a The war with opain laid new and excep tional labors on the post office department The mustering of tne military and naval forces of the United States required special mail ^arrangements for every camp and every campaign. The communication be tween home and camp was naturally eager and expectant. In some of the larger places of rendezvous as many as 50,000 let ters a day required handling. This neces sity was met by the prompt detail and dis- 2 patch of experiencea men from the estab lished force and by directing all the instru mentalities of the railway mail and post office service as far as necessary lo this new need. Congress passed an act empow ering the postmaster-general to establish offices or branches at every military camp or station, and under this authority the postal machinery was speedily put into effective operation. Under the same authority, when our forces moved upon Cuba, Porto Kico and the Philippines, they were attended and followed by the postal service. Though the act of congress authorized the appoint ment of postmasters where necessary, ic was early determined that the public in terests would be best subserved not by new designations, but by the detail of ex perienced men familiar with every branch of the service, and this policy was steadily followed. When the territory which was the theater of conflict came into our pos session, it became necessary to reestablish mail facilities for the resident population as well as to provide them for our forces of occupation, arid -he former requirement was met through the extension and appli cation of the latter obligation. 1 gave the requisite authority, and the same general principle was applied to this as to other branches of civil administration under military occupation. The details are more particularly given in the report of the postmaster-general, and, while the work is only just begun, it is pleasing to be able to say that the service in the territory which has come under our control is al ready materially improved. Th Navy. The following recommendations of the secretary of the navy relative to the in crease of the navy have my earnest ap proval: 1. Three seagoing sheathed and coppered battleships of about 13.5U0 tons trial dis placement, carrying the heaviest armoi and most powerful ordnance for vessels of their class and to have the highest prac ticable speed and great radius of action. Estimated cost, exclusive of armor and armament, $3,600,000 each. 2. Three sheathed and coppered armored cruisers of about 12,000 tons trial displace ment, carrying the heaviest armor and most powerful ordnance for vessels of their class and to have the highest practicabla speed and great radius of action. Esti mated cost, exclusive of armor and arma ment, $4,000,000 each. 8. Three sheathed and coppered protected cruisers of about 6,000 tons trial displace ment to have the highest practicable speed and great radius of action and to carry the most powerful ordnance suitable tor vessels of their class. Estimated cost, exclusive of armor and armament, $2,150,004 each. 4. Six sheathed and coppered cruisers ol about 2,500 tons trial displacement to have the highest speed compatible with good cruising qualities, great radius of action and to carry the most powerful ordnance suited to vessels of their class. Estimated cost, exclusive of armament, $1,141,800 each. I join with the secretary of the navy in recommending that the grades of admiral and vice admiral be temporarily revived, to be filled by officers who have specially distinguished themselves in the war with Spain. Th Census. I earnestly urge upon congress the impor tance of early legislation providing for the taking of the twelfth census. This is nec essary in view of the large amount of work which must be performed in the prepara tion of the schedules preparatory to the enumeration of the population. Pensions There were on the pension rolls on June 30, 1S98, 993,714 names, an increase of near ly 18,000 over the number on the rolls on the same day of the preceding year. The amount appropriated by the act of Decem ber 22, 1896, for the payment of pensions for the fiscal year 1898 was $140,000,000. Eight million seventy thousand eight hundred and seventy-two dollars and forty-six cents was appropriated by the act of March 31. 1898, to cover deficiencies in army pen sions and repayments in the sum of $12, 020.33, making a total of $148,082,892.79 avail able for the payment of pensions during the fiscal year 1898. The amount disbursed from that sum was $144,651,879.80, leaving a bal ance of $3,431,012.99 unexpended on the 30th of June, 1898, which was covered into the treasury. There were 389 names added to the rolls during the year by special acts passed at the second session of the Fifty fifth congress, making a total of 6,486 pen sions by congressional enactment since 1S61. Th Publi a in The public lands disposed of by the gov ernment during the year reached 8,453, 896.92 acres, an increase of 614.780.26 acres over the previous year. The total receipts from public lands during the fiscal year amounted to $2,277,995.18, an Increase of $190,063.90 over the preceding year. The lands embraced in the 11 forest reserva tions which were suspended by the act of June 4, 1897, again became subject to the operations of the proclamations of Feb ruary 22, 1897, creating them, which added an estimated amount of 19,951,360 acres to the area embraced in the reserve previous ly created. In addition thereto two new reserves were created during the year— the Pine Mountain and Zaca Lake reserve in California, embracing 1,644,594 acres, and the Prescott reserve in Arizona, embracing 10,240 acres while the Pecos River reserve in New Mexico has been changed and en larged to include 120,000 additional acres. At the close of the year 30 forest reserva tions, not including those of the Afognac iorest and the fish culture reserve in Alaska, had been created by executive proclamations under section 24 of the act of March 3, 1891, embracing an estimated area of 40,719,474 acres. The department of the interior has in augurated a forest system, made possioie by the act of July, 1898, for a graded force of officers in control of the reserves. This system has only been in full operation since August, but good results have al ready been secured in many sections. The reports received indicate that the system of patrol has not only prevented destruc tive fires from gaining headway, but has diminished the number of fires. Th Indians The special attention of the congress is called to that part of the report of the sec retary of the interior in relation to the five civilized tribes. It is noteworthy that the general condition of the Indians shows marked progress. But one outbreak of a serious character occurred during the year and that among the Chippewa Indians of Minnesota, which happily has been sup pressed. While it has not yet been prac ticable to enforce all the provisions at the act of June, 1898, "for the protection of the people of the Indian territory and for other purposes," it is having a salutary effect upon the nations composing the five tribes. The Dawes commission reports that the most gratifying results and greater ad vance toward the attainment of the objecta of the governments have been secured in the past year than in any previous year. I cannot too strongly indorse the recom mendation of the commission and of the secretary of the interior for the necessity of providing for the education of the 30.000 white children resident in the Indian terri tory. A an a The department of agriculture has been active in the past year. Explorers have been sent to many of the countries of the eastern and western hemispheres for seeds and plants that may be useful to the United States and with the further view'of open ing up markets for our surplus products. The forestry division of the department is giving special attention to the treeless re gions of our country and is introducing species specially adapted to semi-arid re gions. Forest tires which seriously inter tere with production, especially in irrigated regions, are being studied that the losses from this cause may be avoided. The de partment is inquiring into the use and abuse of water in many states of the west and collating information regarding the laws of the states, the decisions of the courts and the customs of the people In this regard, so that uniformity may be secured. Experiment stations are becoming more ef fective every year. The annual appropria tion of $270,000 by congress is supplemented by $400,000 from the states. Nation-wide experiments have been conducted to ascer tain the suitableness as to soil and climate and states for growing sugar beets.' The number of sugar factories has been doubled in the past two years and the ability oft the United States to produce its own sugar from this source has been clearly demon strated. The weather bureau forecast and ob servation stations have been extended around the'Caribbean sea to give early warning of the approach of hurricanes from- the south seas to our fleets and mer chant marine. Sonclusion The alien contract law is shown by ex perience to need some amendment a measure providing better protection for seamen is proposed the rightful applica tion of the eight-hour law for the benefit of labor and of the principle of arbitration are suggested for consideration, and I com mend tnese subjects to the careful atten tion of the congress.
