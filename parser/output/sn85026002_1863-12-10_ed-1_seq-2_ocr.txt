PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. t'tUov-tHitent of the Senate and Home of Jiipretentatieei: Another year of health and ot sufficiently abundant harvests has passed For these. atid especially for the improved condition of oar national affairs, our renewed and pro found gratitude to God it due. We remain in peace aud friendship with foreign powers. The I'flTjris of disloyal citizens ot the United StHtc to involve us in foreign wars, to aid in inexcusable insurrection, have been unavail' ing. tier liriunnic Majesty's Government, M was justly expected, huve exercised their au thority to prevent the departure of new hos tile expeditions from British ports. The Km peror of France has, by a like proceeding, promptly indicated the neutrality which he proclaimed at the beginning of the contest. Questions of great intricacy and importance have arisen out ot tbe blockade and other belligerent operations between the Govern ment nnd several of the maritime powers; but they have been discussed, and, so far as was possible, accommodated in a spirit of frankness, justice and mutual goodwill. It is especially gratifying that our Prize Courts, br the impartiality of their adjudication, have co.'iimanded the resoect and confidence of maritime powers. Tbe supplemental treaty between trie Uuiled States nd Ureal Britain for the suppression of the African slave trade. made on the 17th day of February last, bus been duly ratified and carried into execution. It is believed that so fur as American ports and American citizens are concerned, that it bumau aud barbarous traffic has beeu brought to an end I shall submit, for the considera tion of the Senate, a convention for the ad justment ot possessory claims in Washington Territory, arising out ot the Treaty of the 16th of June, 1H40, between the United States aud Great Britain, and which have been the source of some disquiet anions the citizens ot that uow rapidly improving part of the country. A novel and important question, in volving the extent of the maritime jurisdic tion of Spain, in the wnters which surrounded tbe Island of Cuba, has been debated without reaching! an agreement, and it is proposed, in un amicable spirit, to reter it to the arbitra ment of a friendly power. A convention for that purpose will be submitted to the Senate. I have thought it a proper subject for the approval of the Senate to concur with the in terested commercial powers iu an arrangement for the liquidation of the Scheldt dues upon the principles which have beeu heretolore adopted in regard to the imposts upon naviga tion in the waters of Denmark The long petidiug controversy between this Govern ment and that ot Chili, touching the seizure of Silau, in Peru, by Chilian officBie, of a large amount iu treasure belonging to citizens ot tne United Slates, has been brought to a close by the award of His .Majesty, the King of the liflj'iuns, to whose arbitration the question was referred by the parties. The subject was thoroughly and patiently examin ed by that justly respected magistrate, and al though the sum awarded to the claimant may not have been us large as they expeoted. there is uo reason to distrust the. wisdom of His Majesty's decision. The decision was prompt ly complied with by Chili when intelligence in regard to It reached thai couutry. The Joint Commission, under the bet o: the Inst session, for carrying into effect the Conven tion with Peru ou the subject of claims, has been organized at Lima, and is engaged in the business intrusted to it. Difficulties con cerning luter-ocuanic transit through Nicara gua, are in course of amicable adjustment. In conlormity with principles set forth iu my last Message, i nave received a repiesentative trom the Lnited States of Columbia, and have credited a Minister to that Republic. Incidents occurring iu the progress of our civil war have forced upon my attention the uncertain statu ot international questions touching, tne rights ot foreigners in tins couu try, and of United States citizens abroad. In regard to some Governments these rights are at least partially uennea Dy treaties ; in no lustauce, however, is it expressly stipulated that on the iustance of civil war a foreigner residing in this country within the liars ot in surgents is to be exempted from Ibe rule which classes him as a bellgerent, iu whose beball the Uovernment ot his country can net express any privileges or immunities from that character. I regret to say, howsver,tb aucu claims nave oeen put tor ward, and in some instances in behait of foreignersa who have lived in the United States the greater part of their lives. There is reason to believe thai many persons born in foreign countries who have declared their intention to become citizens, or who have been fully naiuralized, have evaded the military duty required of them by d.uyiug the fact, aud thereby throw ing spon tbe Government the burden of proof. It bas been lourid difficult or impracticable to obtain this proof, from the want of guides to the proper sources of information. These might be supplied by requiring the clerks of courts, where declarations of tuleutioa may be made, or nationalized eflectedo send, pe iodically, lists of the namss of persons natu ralized or declaring iheirgiDteution to become rcilizeng to the Secretary of the Interior in whose Department theso names must be arranged aud printed for general information. There is also reason to believe that foreigners frequently become citizens of the United States tor the sole purpose of evading the duties imposed by tbe laws of their nalivs country, to which, uo becomiug naturalized here, they at once repair, and, though never returning to tbe United Slates, they still olaim the in terposiliou of the Government as citizens Many altercations aud great prejudice have heretofore arisen out of this abuse. Ic is therelore submitted to your serious con sideration. It might beadvisablo to fix limit beyond which no citizen of the Uuited States residing abroad may claim the interposi tion of his Government. The rigbtjof suffrage has often been assumed and exercised by aliens under pretense of naturalization, which tber have disavowed when dratted into the military service, i submit the expediency of such an amendment of the laws as will make the fact of voting an estoppel against auy plea of exemption trom military sei vi e or other civil obligation on grounds of alienage. . Iu common with other Wjsterq Powers, our relations with Japan have been brought in eeriojs jeopardy through tbe perverse opposi 4ion of th hereditary aristocracy of ibe tui- a the Tycoon, designed to brinr the country j mto the society of nations. It is to be hoped, anoougo noi wun enure cuuuuvuce, iunt iu!ib difficulties may be peacefully overcome. I ask Tour attent.nn to the Minister residing there for the damages he snttained in tho de- traction, by fire, of the residence of the legation at Yeddo Satisfactory arrangement bare been made with the Emperor of Russia, which it it be- lieTed will result in effecting a continuous line of telegraph through that empire from j our Pacifio coast. I recommend to your taror-1 able consideration the subject of an interna- telegraph across the Atlantic Ocean, I also of a telegraph between this capital j and the national forts along tbe Atlantic sea-: board and the Gulf of Mexico. Such connec tions, established with any reasonable outlay, would be economical as well as effective aids to diplomatic military and naval service. The consular systems of the United States, under tbe enactments of the last Congress, begin to be self-sustaining, and there is reason to hope that it may become entirely so, with the increase of tredo which will ensue when ever pence is restored. Our Ministers abroad have been faithful in defending American rights. In protecting our commercial interests, our Consuls have necessarily had to encounter increased lubors and responsibilities growing out of ihe war. These they have lor the most part met and discharged with zeal and elliciency. This ac knowledgment justly includes those Cousuls who, residing in Morocco, Egypt, China, and other central countries, are charged with com plications and extraordinary powers. The condition of the several organized Ter ritories is generally satisfactory, although the Indian disturbances in New Mexico have not been entirely suppressed. The mineral re sources of Colorado, Nevada, Idalioe, New Mexico and Arizona are proving tar richer than huretotore understood. I lay before yon communications on this subject from tbe Gov ernor ot New Mexico. I again submit to vour consideration the expediency of establishing a system for tbe encouragement ol tbe migration, although this source ot national wealth is again following with greater freedom than for several years before tbe insurrection occurred, mere is still a great deficiency of laborers in every held ot industry, especially in agriculture ana n our mines, as well ot iron and coal as ot previous metals While the detnnnu for labor is thus increased here, tens of thousands of persons, destitu'eof remunerative occupation, are thronging our foreign consulates ami oi- fering to emigrate to the United States, if es sential, but very cheap, assistance can be af forded them. It is easy to see that, under the sharp discipline of civil war, the nation is be ginning a new lite. This noble effort de mands the aid, and eught to receive the at tention and support, ot the Government lnmnrs unforseen bv tbe Uovernment, and unintended, may in some cases have been inflicted upon the subjects or citizens of for eign countries, both at sea and on land, by persons in tne service ot the United stales. As this Government expects redress from oth er Powers, where similar injuries are inflict ed by persous in their service upon citizens of the United States, we must be prepared to do injustice to foreigners. If the existing judicial tribunals are inadequate to this pur pose, a specinl Lourt may be authorized, with power to heare and decide such claims ol the character reterred to as may nave arisen un- dertreaties and public law. Conventions for ad justing claims by your commission have been proposed to some Governments, but no defini tive answer to these propositions bas yet been received trom any. in course ot the session I shall probably have occasion to request you to provide indemnification to claimauts. De- rees ot restitution nave been rendered and damages awarded by the Admiralty Court, and in other cases wbere this Uovernment may be acknowledged to be liabfe in principle, and where the amount of that liability has been ascertained by au informal arbitration. Th proper officers of the Treasury have deemed themselves required by the law of the United States upon the subject to demand a tax upon the incomes ot foreign Consuls in this cnun try. While such a demand may not be an in dication of public law, or perhaps of any ex isting treaty between the United States and a foreigu country, the expediency of so far modifying the act as to exempt from tax the income of such Consuls as are not citizens of tbe United States, derived from the emolu ments of their othceor from property not sit uated in the United States, is submitted to your serious consideration. I make this sug gestion nponihe ground "that a comity which ought to be reciprocated exempts our Con suls in all other countries from taxation. To the extent thns indicated the United States, I think, ought not to be exceptionally illiberal to international trade aud commerce The operations of the Treasury during the Inst year have been successfully conducted 1 he enactment by Congress of a nationa banking law has proved a valuable support of ttie public credit, and tne general legislation in relation to loans has fully answered the ex peutations of its favorers. Soma amendments may be required to perfect existing laws, but uo change in their principles or general scope is believed to be needed. Since these measures hare beeu in operation, all demands on the IreaBury, including Ihe pay of tbe army aud navy, have beeu promptly met and fully satisfied. No considerable body of troops, it is believed, were ever more amply provided, more liberally and punctually paid. and it may bo added that by no people were the burdens incident toa groat war more cheer fully borne. The receipt during the year from all sources, including loans and the bal ance in the Treasury at its commencement, were illl , 1 25.G74 86, tbe aggregate disburse menu $895,796,630 65, leaving a balance on the 7lb of July, 18o3, ol ,5,319,044 21. Of the receipts, there were derived from customs 1119,059,642 40; from internal revenue 137, 640,767 95; trom direct taxes $l,4b8,103 61; from lands $167,617 17; from miscellaneous sources, $.346 615 35, and fru.ni loans $776, 682,361 57, making the aggregate $901,112, 674 86. Hut the payment of the funded and tempo rary debt having been made Irom moneys bor rowed during the year, must be regarded as merely nominal payments, ' and the moneys borrowed to make them as merely nominal re ceipts, and their amount $181,086,535 07, should, therefore, be deducted b .th from the receipts and disbuieement. This being done there remains as actual receipts $7 14,10a, 995 bS, leaving a balance as already stated. The actual receipts and disbursements for the first quarutr, aud the estimated receipts and dis bursements for tho remaining three-quarters of tho current fiscal year of 1864, will bo shown in detail by the report of the Secretary of the Iraasury, to which 1 invito your alien- tiou. is hilly eel tortb in the letter ot Uenr-ral tlitch tionnl oock; fourth, operations under the act for eu and rolling and calling out the National forces, detailed in tbe report of the Provost Marshal lievod that the actual results will exhibit a state of the finances less formidable to the vuuuvit ihw vauiuairi wi wiki viuui unv- tofora submitted, while it it confidently ex pected thai at tUe close of the year both di baraemenu and debts will be found very con siderably less than haa been anticipated. The report of the Secretary of War ii a doc ument of (treat interest It consist of first, the military operations of the Tear, detailed in the report of the General inebief; second, the organization of colored persons into the war service; third, the exchange of prisoners General; fifth, the organisation of the Invalid Corps, sixth, tbe opcrat one ot the several de partments of the Quartermaster General, Commissary General, Paymaster General, Chief of Eugineers, Chief of Ordnance and Surgeon General. It has appeared impossible to make a valu able summary of this report, except such as would ba too extended for this place, and hence I contont myself in referring your at tention to the report itself. The duties de volving on the naval hraach of Die service during the year, and throughout the whole of this unhappy contest, have been discharged with fidelity and eminent success. 'The ex tensive blockade has been constantly increas ing in efficiency as the navy has expanded; yet ou so long a line it has so far bean impos sible to entirely suppress illicit trade. From the returns received at Ihe Navy Department, it appears that more than one thousand ves sels have been captured since the blockade was institnted, and that the valne of the pri zes already sent iu for adjudication amouHts to over thirteen million dollars. Thn naval force of the United States cousista, at this time, of 588 vessels, completed and in the course of completion, and of these 75 are iron clad armored steamers. The eveuts of the war give an incressed nterest and importance to the Navy, which will probably extend beyond tho war itself. The armored vessels in our Navy, completed or in service, or which are under contract and approaching completion, are believed to ex ceed in number those of any other power. But while these may be relied upon for harbor defense, and sea coast service, others of great er strength and capacity will be necessary for cruising purposes, and to maintain our right ful position oa tbe ocean. Ihe change that bas taken place in naval vessels and naval warfare since tbe introduction of steam as a motive power for ships of war, demands either corresponding ehauge in some of our existing navy-yards or tne establishment ot new ones for the construction and necessary repair of modern war vessels. No inconsiderable em barrassment, delay and public injury have been experienced from the want of such Gov ernment establishments. Tbe necessity of such a navy yard, so furnished, at some suita ble place upon the Atlantic seaboard, bas, on repeated occasions, been brought to the atten tion ot Congress by the Navy Department, aud is again presented iu the report of the Secretary, which accompanies this communi cation. I think it my duty to invite your spe cial attention to this subject, and also that ol establishing a yard and depot for naval pur poses; upon one ot tne western rivers. A naval force has been created on those interior waters, and.utider many disadvantages, within little more than two years, excesding in num bers the whole naval force of the country at the commencement of tbe present Adminis tration. Satisfactory and important ait has been the performances of the heroic men of the navy at this period, they are scarcely more wonueriui man tne services ot our me cbanics and artisans, in the production of war vessels, which has created a new form of naval power. Our country hue advantages superior to any other natiou in our re sources of iron and limber, with inexhaua - ible quantities of fuel in the immediate vicin ity of both, and all accessible and in close proximity to navigable waters, without the advantage of public risks, the resources of the nation have been developed, and its power displayed in the construction of nnavyof snch magnitude, which has at the very period of its orealion rendered signal service to tbe Union. The increase of the uumber of seamen in the public service from 7,000 men in the spring ot 1861, to about 24,000 at the present time, haa been accomplished without rspeeial legis lation, or extraordinary bounties to promote that increase, it bas been found, however, that the operations of the craft, with high bounties paid tor army recruits, is beginuin to affect injuriously the naval service, and wil if not corrected, oe likely to impair its effi ciency by detaching seamen from their prop er vocation and inducing them to enter the army. 1 therefore respectfully auggost that uougress might aid both the army and naval servica by adequate provision on this subject, which would at the same time be equitable to iue cuiuiiiuiiiues more especially imeuuea. commend to your consideration the sigges- t ons of the Secretary of the Navy in regard to the policy of fostering and training seamen for naval serv.ee. The Naval Academy rendering signal service in preparing midship men tor nigniy responsible duties, which in after life they will be required to perform. in order that the country should not be de prived of the proper quota of educuted officers tor which legal provision bas been madu ut the naval school, the vacancies caused by the neglect or omission to make nominations from the States in insurrection have been filled by the Secretary of the Navy. The school is now more lull and complete than at auy previous period, and in every respect entitled to the favorable consideration of Congress. During tbe past fiscal year the financial condition ol the rost-odice Department haa beeu one of increased prosperity, aud I am KFMuunu tu using awio suite bum liiu uccouuis ot postal revenue have nearly equaled the expenditure, the latter amounting million three hundred and fourteen I thousand dollars and eighty-four cents, and me lormer uj eleven oiinioa one nuuureu ana sixty-three thousand seven hundred and eighty- nine dollars and fifty-nine cents, leaviug deficiency of but one hundred and tifty thou-J saud four hundred and seventeen dollars and tweuty five cents. In 1860, the year immedi-( ately preceding the rebellion, tbe deficiency amounted to five million six hundred and titty-six thousand seven hundred and live dol-: lars aud forty-nine cent. Tbe postal receipts thai year were two millions six hundred and forty five thousand seven hundred aud I twenty-two dollars and nineteen cents less than those ol 18bd. ihe decrease since lobO the annual amount of transportation haa bseu only about twenty five per cent , but the an- nual expenditures, on account of tbe same, have been reduced thirty live per cent, It manifest, therefore, that tho Post-office De partment may neonate self-tuttaiuiust in a taw ! I j i neinou uau oeen pres.sea ouck into reuueen limits; yet the loue of ,iublic feeling and opiu eutire to ion at home and abroad was not salis elevea 1 factory. With other tiunt. the DODutar a of pity thai we were too blind to surrender. , Our commerce was suffering greatly by a fw armed vessels built upon and furnished from i foreigu shores, aud we were threatened wUh such additions from the same quarter as woijld; sweep our trade trom the sea end raise oiir blockade. We had failed to elicit from I1u of ropean Governments any thing hopeful upon in is torvice. The International Confernnce of! poiui! delegates from tho principal countries 01 curope auu niuerica, wmcu was caueu ai the suggestion of the Postmaster General met at Paris on the 11th of May last, and concluded its deliberations on the 8th of June. The principles established by the Conference as best adaptedto facilitate postal Intercourse between nations, and as the basis of future Conventions to inaugurate a general system of unilorm international charges at reduced rates of postage, can not fail to produce beneficial suits I refer yoa to the report of the Secretary of the Interior, which is herewith laid before yon, for the useful and varied information in relation to public lands, Indian affairs, pat ents pensions and other matters of public con cern pertaining to his Department The quantity of lands disposed of daring the last and the first quarter of the present fiscal years was 3,841 ,5-ia acres, of which 161,911 acres were sold for cash, 1,456,51 4 acres were taken up under tbe homestead law, aud the residue disposed of under laws granting lands for mil itary bounties, for railroads and other purpo ses. It also appears that the Bale of the pub lio lands is largely on the increase. It has long been a cherished opinion of some of our wisest statesman that the people of the Uni ted States bud a higher and more enduring in terest in the early settlement and substantial cultivation of the public lands than in the amount of direct revenue to be derived from the sain of them. This opinion has had a controlling influence in shaping legislation upon the surjeot of onr national domain. I may citejas an iustance of this the liberal measures adopted in reference to active set tlers, the grant to the States of the overflowed lands within their limits, in order to their being reclaimed and rendered fit for cultiva tion. The grunt to railroad companies of al ternate sections oi land upon the contemplat ed lines of their load when completed will largely multiply the facilities of reaching our distant possessions. This policy has recited its most signal and beneficent illustration in the recent enactments gt anting homesteads to actual settlers ; since the first day of January last the before. mentioned quantity of one million four hundred and fifty-six thousand five hundred and fourteen acres of land has been taken up under its provisions. This fact, and the amount of sales, furnish gratify ing evidence of the increasing settlement up on the public lands Notwithstanding the great struggle in which the energies of the aation have been engaged, and which has re quired so large a withdrawal of our citizens from their accustomed pursuits, I cordially concur in the recommendation of the Secreta ry of the Interior, suggesting a modification of the act in favor of those engaged in the military and naval service of the United States. I doubt not that Congress will cheerfully adopt such measures as will, without essen tially changing the general features of the sys tem, receive, to the greatest practicable ex tent, its benefits to those who nave left their homes, in defense of the country, in this ar duous cr sis. I invite your attention to the views of the Secretary of War, as to the propriety of rais ing by appropriation of legislation, a revenue from the mineral lands of the United States. Tbe measures provided at your last session for the removal of several Indian tribes have been carried into effect. Sundry treaties have been negotiated, which will in due time be submitted for the Constitutional action of the Senate. They contain stipulations for ex tinguishing the possessor's rights of the In dians, to large and valuable tracts of land. It is probable that the ett'ects of these treaties will result in the establishment of permanent friendly relations with such of. these tribes as have been brought into frequent aud bloody collisions with our outlying settlements and regiments the sound policy, and our impera tive daty to these wards of Government, de mand our anxious and constant attention to their well-being, and their progress in the arts of civilization, and above all to that moral training, which under the blessings of divine Providence, will confer upon them the elevat ed and sanctifying influence of the hopes and consolations ot the Christian faith. I suggest ed iu my lost anuual Message the proprietyof remedying our Iudian system. . Subse quent events have satisfied me of its necessity. The details set forth in the report of the Secretary will evince the urgent need for immediate legislative action. I commend the benevolence of the institu tions established or patronised by the Gov ernment in this district to your generous and fostering care. The attention of Congress during the last session was engaged to some extent with a proposition for enlarging the water communi cation between the Mississippi Hirer and the north eastern seaboard, which proposition, however, failed for the time. Sincathen, upon a call of the greatest respectability, a conven tion has been called at Chicago upon tbe same subject, a summary of whose views is contain ed in a memorial addressed to the President and Congress, and which I now have the hon or to lay before you. That this interest is one which ere long will force its owa way, I do not entertain a doubt, while it is submitted entirely to your wisdom as to what can be done now. Augmented interest is given to this subject by the actual commencement of work upon the Pacific Railroad, under aus pices favorable to its rapid progress and com pletion. Enlarged navigation becomes a pal pable need to this great road. I transmit the second annual report of Commissioners of the Department of Agri culture, asking your attention to the develop ments in that vital interest of the nation. When Congress assembled a year ago the war had already lasted nearly tweuty months. 1 and there had been many conflicts on both land and sea, with varying results. Tbe re- I elections theu just past indicted uneasiness among ourselves while amid ninch that was cold ana menacing, the kind words I coming from England were uttered in accents that subject. . i 1 The Emancipation Proclamation, which mas tuned in September, wus running its assigned period to the beginning of the New Year .-4 A mouth later the final proclamation catael including tbe announcement that colored nun) of suitable coudilion would be received into tbt we service. Tbe policy of emancipation "I ,m of black soldiers gave apeet, about which hppes, . fears and doubts contended in uncertain conflict, according to oar political system, as s BMiisr ei vivu BUMiuisirauiin. ins MOT- emmem naa noiawiui power 10 enect emanci pation in any State, and Tor a long time it had been hoped that she rebellion oould be suppressed without resorting to it as a military measure, it was all the while deemed possible that necessity for it might come, and that if it should the crisis of tho contest would then be presented. It came, and as intended, it was followed by dark and doubtful days. Eleven months having been passed we are prmitted to take another review, tho rebel borders are pressed still further back, and by tse complete opening of tbe Mississippi River, the couutry dominated over by tho rebellion il divided into distant parts. Practical communication between them and Tennessee and Arkansas has been so substan tially cleared of the insurgents control and influence, and the citizens in each, and the owners of slaves and advocates of slavery at thu beginning of the rebellion, now declare Openly for emancipation in their respective States. Of those States not included in the Emancipation Proclamation, Maryland and Missouri, neither of which, years ago, would tolerate any restraint upon tbe extension of slavery into their territories, only dispute now ss to the best mode of removing it from their own limits. Of those who were slaves at the beginning of the rebellion, fully ono hundred thousand are now in the United States mili tary service, about one-half of which number actually bear arras In tho ranks, thus giving the doubla advantage of tuking so much la bor for the insurgent cause, and supplying the places which otherwise must be filled with so many while men. So far as tested, it is diffi cult to suy they are not at good soldiers as any. No servile insurrection, or tendency to violence or cruelty hat marked the measures ot emancipation and arming the blacks These measures have been much discussed in foreign countries, and contemporary with such discussions, the tone of public sentiment there is much improved. When the same measures have been fully discussed, support ed, criticized and denounced, and the annual elections are highly encouraging to those whose special duly it is to boar the country through this great trial, thus we have the reckoning. The crisis which threatened to divide the friends of the Uuion is past Looking now to the present and f'nture.aud with reference ton resumption of the Nation al authority within the States wherein that authority has been suspended, I havo thought fit to issue a proclamation, a copy of which is herewith transmitted. Ou examination of this proclamation il will appear, as is believed amply justified by the Constitution. True tbe form of au oath is given, but no man is co erced to take it A man is only promised t pardon in case he voluntarily takes tbe oath. The Constitution authorizes the executive to grant it on terms as is fully established by judical and other authorities it is also prefer red that many of the Slates named a sent of government it shall be in the mode prescribed set up. Such government shall be xecogni.ed and guarrunteed by tho United States, and that under it the State shall, on subscribing to tho constituiionul conditions, be protected agaiast invasion and domestic violence. The constitutional obligation of the United States to guarranlee to every State in the Union a republican form of government, and to pro tect the State in the case as staled, is explicit and full, but why tender the benefits of this provision only to a Slate government set up in this particular way. This section of the Constitution contemplates a case wherein the element within a State, favorablt to re publican Government in the Uuion, may be too feeble for an opposite aud hostile element external to and even within the State, and such are precisely tbe cases with which we are now dealing; au attempt to guarantee and protect a revised state of Government, con structed in whole, or in preponderating part from the very element agaiust whose hostili ty a'.rl violence it is to be protected, is simply ausuru- mere must oe a lest by wnich o separate opposing elements, so as to build only from the sound, and that test is a suffi cient and liberal oue, which accepts as sound whoever will make a sworn recantation of his former unsoundness. But if it be proper to require n test of adm ssion to the political body, an oath of allegiance to the Constitu tion of the United States, and to the Union under it, why not also to the laws and procla mation in regard to slavery? Those laws and proclamations were enacted and put forth for the purpose of aiding in the suppression of the rebellion. To give them the fullest ef fect, there bad to be a pledge for their main tenance; in my judgment, they have aided, and will lurther aid, ihe cause for which they were enlisted. To give up their principle, would be not only to relinquish a lever of power, but would also be a cruel and astound- : I L .r.:.L T .JJ . nig urrucn ui lauu. x may auu, at mis point, that while I remain in my present position, I shall not attempt to retract or modify the Emoncipation Proclamation, nor shall I re turn to slavery any person who it made free qy the terms of the Proclamation, or by an act of Congress. For these and other reasons it is thought best that the support of these persons shall be included in the oath, and it is believed the Executive may lawfully claim it in return for pardon aud restoration of projected rights, which he hat dear constitu tional power to withhold altogether, or grant upon the terms which be shall deem wisest for public interest It should be observed, also, that this part of the oath is subject to tl e modifying and abrogating power of legis lation, and supreme )udicial decision. The proposed acquiescence of tho National Executive in any honorable temporary State arragenient lor the freed people is made with a view of possibly modifying the contusion and distressed destitution which must at last attend all classes by a total revolution ot labor throughout the whole United States. It is hoped thut the 'already deeply atllicted people in those States may b" somewhat more ready to give up the cause ot their allliction, and to this extent this vital matter is left to them selves, while no power of the NationalJExecu- uve to prevent an abuse it abridged by ibis proposition. The suggestion in tho Proclamation as to maintaining the political frame-work of Ibe States on what it called reconstruction, it made iu Ihe hope that it may do good with out barm. It will favor labor and avoid great confusion. But why any proclamation upon the subject T This question it beset with the conflicting views that the step might be delay ed too long or be taken too soon, la some ele ments for resumption have been ready for action, bnt remain iuactive, apparently for a rallying point a plan of action. Why shall A adopt the plan of B, rather than B that a, anu it & ana a snouia agree, now can .they know but that the General Government here will respect Iheir plan. By the Procla- maliou a plan it preteuted, which may be au- ceplcd by Uieni a rallying point, and which, they are assured in advance, will not be rn- jected here, Thit may bring them to act sooner than they otherwise would ina ob jection to a premature presentation of a plan by the'Xational Executive, consistsin danger of eomiaittanlt. In points which could be more safely left to further developments, care hat been taken to to shape the document as to avoid embarrassment from this source. In saying thai on certain terms certain classes will be pardoned, with their rights restored, it is not said that other classes on other terms will never bo included. In saying that are construction will be accepted if presented in a specified way, it is not said that it will nev er be accepted in another way. , The movements by State actions for eman cipations in several of the States not included in the Emancipation Proclamation, nre mat ten of profound gratulatinn, and while I do not repeat in detail what I have heretofore to earnestly urged npon this subject, my general views and feelings remain unchanged, aud 1 trust that Congress will omit no fair opportu nity of aiding these important steps to tbe great Consummation. In The midst of other cares however impor tant, we mutt not lose sight of the fact that the war power is still our main reliance. To that power alont can we look yet tot a time to give confidence to the people in contested regions that the insurgent power will not again overrun them. Until that confidence shall be establisned little ran be done any whom for what is called reconstruction.
