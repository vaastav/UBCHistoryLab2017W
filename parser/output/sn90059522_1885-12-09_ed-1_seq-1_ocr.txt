New York, Dee. 8.- -William H. "Van derbilt is dead. Without a moment's waru isig the message came, and he was no more. The gilt iron cross over the sate that leads into the grounds of the Roman Catholic or phan asylum on Fifth avenue gleamed brightly under the electric lamp to-night, Seen from the grand entrance of the Van derbilt mansion, opposite, against the som ber gray of the marble edilice it was the only thing on the wide, deserted avenue, that also seemed stricken as with sudden death. The rays of its brightness were re flected in the huge brown-stone pile, behind ■whose closed curtains one of the riciiest men lay dead, stricken suddenly and with out warning. The busy hum of traffic and the noises of the street were hushed in the block, carriages turned out and passers by stopped to ask if it was tnie that he was dead. Deine tolil that they had heard aright they went their way. s <bered and si lent, tarn ing mayhap a minu^; to gaze pity ingly at the stone pile, liwde. the ser vants and friends tip-toed about with grave and saddened faces. The door-bell was rung almost every minute, and the wide portals swung open to admit other friends who came to mourn with the mourners. Upstairs, behind the drawn curtains of the millionaire's bedroom, were 

SOUS AND TEAKS. The children of the dead man were gath ered there in his bedroom about his coruse. None of them had been with him in the hour of his death. To none had he had time to speak a word of farewell. As he lay upon the carved bed in the large square room, the windows of which overlook the avenue, from the northeast corner of the south wing of the building, to the left of the main entrance, Mr. Vanderbilt looked as if he had fallen into a gentle sleep, llis features were peaceful and natural, as if he had just ceased talking and laid down to rest. Ilis death had been as painless as it was sudden. Mr. Vanderbilt was always an early riser. When in his young days he worked his Staten Island farm it was his custom to rise with the sun, and he used to savin later lite that he had often arisen at 4 o'clock to go to New York and return to his breakfast and his plow at 7. Of late years he had made it a practice to leave his bed at 7 o'clock, or not much later, and throughout the increasing ill-health of the last two winters he had adhered to this . practice. After arising to-day he had held I HIS USUAL MOUSING CONFERENCE I with his sons, Cornelius and William, who I were the active managers of his railroad | properties, and afterward with Mr. E. V. . Kossiter, his private secretary and treasurer • of the New York Central railroad, to whom ;he intrusted a large share of the man ; agement of his private business affairs. > These conferences were held in Mr. Van derbilfs study on the ground floor of the mansion in the comer to the left of the main entrance from the avenue. It was his favorite room, where he wrote and transacted all his business. During the morning conference to-day he had been more than ordinarily alert and active, and so mucL >o as to excite comment, to which he replied in a good-humored, jocular vein. He had eaten a good breakfast, and was looking forward with pleasant anticipations to a ride up the boulevard with his son-in law. Hamilton McK. Twombley, in the aft ernoon. At 11 o'clock he send to the Grand Central depot for his old-time friend. Chauncey M. Depew. president of the New York Central railroad, with the mes sage that he wished to see him. Mr. Ditppw was engaged in a conference at the depot, and sent word that he would not be able to come for an hour or two, and Mr. Vanderbilt delayed the appointment till 1 o'clock, and to occupy the interval went down to the studio of J. Q. A. Ward, the sculptor, in West Fifty-second street, to sit ; for a 

BRONZE BUST OF HDCgKIf, which the trustees of the College of Physi cians and Surgeons wished to place in the vestibule of the college, for the erection of which he recently gave 5500.000. He re turned and took lunch at 12:-20 with his wife and son George and Mr. Twoiubly. At the table he was noticeably bright and cheertul. At 1 o'clock Mr. Hubert Garrett, the president of the Baltimore & Ohio rail road, called upon Mr. Depsw at the Grand Central depot, ami. Ending him still de tained, he went up to Mr. Vanderbilt's house to inform the millionaire and take Mr. Depew's place. Mr. Yanterbilt greeted him cordially and engaged in a long and animated conversation with him about railroad matters. The conference lasted more than one hour, and Mr. Vanderbilt Bent word to Mr. Twombly that he would be compelled to forego the intended drive. The two railroad magnates were discussing the new terminal facilities of the Balti more & Ohio, the new inlet into the city it had secured by way of Staten Island, and Mr. Vanderbilt showed a lively interest in the results that were to follow for the island of his birtli from the new enterprise. It was while the talk turned upon the scenes of his childhood and early wort, contrasted with the tremendous achievment of his old age, that Mr. Gar rett. sitting on the sofa and facing the mill ionaire, who leaned forward in his arm chair, as was his habit when thoroughly in terested, that the president of the Baltimore & Ohio was suddenly made aware of a slight indistinctness in Mr. Yanderbilt's speech, that grew into an inarticulate sound. As be leaned over to catch hi 3 words, Mr.Van derbilt pitched forward without a word of warning and fell heavily on the floor on his face. Mr. Garrett. springing to his feet with an exclamation of alarm, and siezing the pillow on the sota, laid it under his friend's head. He then summoned Mrs. i Vanderbilt and George, the youngest son. j 

HBSSENGBBB WERK SENT in haste for family physicians. One from j the neighborhood responded tirst. and was ' followed almost immediately by the family doctor. Dr. James \V. McLean. Such simple restoratives as were at hand had been applied, but human aid was in vain, i Mr. V anderbilt never spoke or moved after ! he fell under the sudden stroke, and died j within a few minutes without a struggle. To all intents and purposes he was dead the instant he fell forward upon the floor. It was 2:30 o'clock when Dr . McLean j led the stricken widow from the room | where her husband had sat planning and j working in the full pride of health and , strength five minutes before. Dr. j McLean pronounced his death the result of a sudden stroke of paralysis due to the bursting of a large blood vessel at the base of the brain the bursting of which is always absolutely fatal at the" moment. He stated that Mr. Vanderbilt's death was as painless as it was sudden. The doctor knew his patient most intimately, and promptly certilied to the cause of* death, avoiding the unnecessary formality of a coroner's inquest and an au topsy. As soon as it was ascertained be yond doubt that Mr. Vanderbilt was dead, the men servants were summoned, and helped to carry the body of their dead mas ter upstairs to the bedroom he had occupied in life. Mrs. Vanderbilt was prostrated with grief, and telephone messages were sent to the Grand Central depot to summon her sons, and to the residences of her sons in-law, to inform them of tin bereavement. William K. and Frederick W. Vanderbilt had been together in the offices at the depot less than half an hour before the message came, and had gone away together. The message found Mr. Cornelius Vanderbilt in a meeting of the trustees of the American Bible society, at the Bible house. He has tened at once to the house, whither Mr. Depew had preceded Him. DUMB WITH DISTRESS over his friend's death. One by one the other children arrived, and as the report spread with lightning-like rapidity through the city, the nearer friends of the dead magnate also came. Universal consterna tion and grief prevailed at the most unex pected news. Mr. Vanderbilt, while he had been a victim more or less of indiges tion, with its attendant ills and kindred disorders, had lately, despite the frequent reports of his death, been apparently mend ing. There had been an improvement in the general tone of his health that was par ticularly noticeable to-day. On Monday night he attended the performance in the Metropolitan opera house, and nothing was apparently further from his mind than sud den death. Like most people, Mr. Vander bilt bad his own little private superstitions, and one of them was that if he ever passed the age of 65. which for some reason, in the family history, he looked upon as the criti cal age. lie would bo good for twenty years more. In conversation with a near friend, not more than three we»ks ago, he stated this as his belief when the subject was brought up, and he rejoiced in the knowl edge that the turning point was nearly reached. Had Mr. Vanderbilt lived to May 8. next year, he would have be?n 05 years of age. He was born at the Stateu island homestead on that date in the year 1821. THE NEARNESS OF THE TIME which he himself considered critical gave him no apparent concern, however. He did not expect, neither did he fear death. It came to him very swiftly, very gently. He did not know when it seized him. By arrangement of the nearest friends with members of the family, it was decided the funeral should be on Friday next and at 10 o'clock from St. Bartholomew's church on Madison avenue and Fourth street, of which Rev. Dr. Cook is pastor. Mr. Vanderbilt was a vestryman in the church, to the con struction of which he had contributed largely. The sexton for the church was charged with the funeral arrangements. At Mr. Vanderbilt's own desire he will be interred in the family mausoleum in the Moravian cemetery at New Dorp, Staten island, which has just been completed. It was one of the last acts of his life to turn over, by deed for SI. all the old farm prop erty of the family of Staten island to his son George to do with as he desired, and for this purpose father and son visited and went over the island together last Saturday, incidentally inspecting the just completed mausoleum. Mr. Vanderbilt had made a will. What its provisions are is not known to anyone outside the family and his CONFIDENTIAL COUNSEL A.\D FRIEND, Mr. Depew. But the Vanderbilts were a very united family. Mr. Depew ventured the prediction that the millionaire's death would make no change in existing condi tions. The Vanderbilt railroad systems will be managed and owned as heretofore. The sous will manage the estate and the property, all of which are here, the same as if the master hand was still at the helm. No commotion in financial circles need re sult. Mr. Vanderbilt had long ago aban doned Wall street and the stock market. He owned no real estate as an investment. Like the commodore (his father) he had no faith in real estate, but believed that, for men in active affairs, it was the correct thing to invest in properties that could be turned into money instantly if need. He besides had a theory, which he used to ex press in words to this effect, that real es tate was really owned by the municipality; the owners were really only tenants. The children Mr. Vanderbilt leaves are in their regular succession in age from Cornelius, who is about 40 years of age. down; Corne lius, William X.. Frederic W. and George \V. and four daughters, Mrs. Elliott F. Shepard, Mrs. Wiiiiani D. Sloane. Mrs. Hamilton McK. Twombley and Mrs. Dr. S. Ward Webb. Cornelius and William K. are both actively engaged in the manage in jnt of the FAMILY EAILROAD INTERESTS and who will continue. Cornelius is the chairman of the board of directors of the New York Central and the Michigan Cen .tral systems, and William K. holds the same office in the Lake Shore and Nickel Plate systems. Frederick W., who is about &2 years old. is a director in all the roads. Mr. Vanderbilt, was, it is thought, richer than any single member of the Rothschild family. The Duke of Westminster is said to be worth about 5200.000.000, but Mr. Vanderbilt was richer, because the Duke's money only brings him about two per cent., being" mainly in lands and houses. Mr. Vanderbilt had a much larger income. Last year he had $54,000,000 of 4 per cent, bonds and later he reduced the amount to $::5.000.000 of government 3}4 per cents. His government bonds were worth almost 575.000.000. At one time he owned 240. -000 shares of Michigan Central. 800.000 shares of Northwestern and 200.000 duties of Lake Shore. He is said to have sold con siderable Lake Shore lately. In addition he had 20.000 Chicago & Rock Island. 20.000 Delaware «fc Lacka wanna and about 20.000 shares in other railroads, making in ail about 800.000 shares if railroad stocks; also 520. 000.000 worth of railroad bonds. 53.2000.00 of state and city bonds and $2,000,000 in various manufacturing stocks and mortgages. He valued HIS HOUSE ON FIFTH AVENUE, with its art treasures, at 53. 000, 000. His ordinary household expenses were 5200.000 a year. In 18S4 he gave a ball that cost S lOO. OOO. He loved horses and was a good judge of horse flesh. He sold Maud S for SlOO.OOO. Mr. Vanderbilt was worth 5200, -000.000. His fortune shrank last year ma terially through a big decline in stocks and through business depression, but the "'bull movement" of the past few months brought it up again. His income was calculated as follows: Si. 373. 000 a year from government bonds. ST. 395. 000 from railway stocks. $576,695 from miscellaneous seenritities; total, over 5 10, 000, 000 a year, or $28.n00 a day, 81,200 an hour, or §19.75 a minute. BJ. PAUL, WEDNESDAY MOE^INQ DECEMBER 9, 1885— TEN PAGES. lie made no ostentatious display of his wealth. He was charitable, although in , this he had to be quiet, or he would have i been overrun with importers. He was ! shrewder in business than many supposed he was. He knew enough to sell 250,000 | shares of New York Central tive years ago j at Si. 2o and buy governments at par. The coroner went to the Vanderbilt 1 mansion about 9 o'clock to-night and viewed i the body. Testimony from Mr. Vander bilt's body servant, Lewis Maxwell, in .ref erence to the scenes at the time and imme '■ diately after, was in accordance with the I story already told. Dr. J. H. McLean was ; the only other witness. He said: "/."'Jj'i THE DOCTOR'S STATEMENT. & I have been the family physician of the decease! since 1880. Ho has had ill turns, but he lias never been seriously sick or un [ well for any length of time. He has had at - tacks of irregularity of the heart's action, I which was due to indigestion and which I would last generally only an hour or two and I then he would get over them. I saw him alive last on Sunday, Dec. 6, at noon, and ho was quite well then. I should say unusually so. His pulse oeat 72 per minute, In fact I have never known him to vary one pulsation or beat one minute in a month since I have . been his family physician. Hispnlse was full and regular. 1 called again yesterday morning 1 to see him ank learned he had gone to Ward's studio to sit for his bust. I learned that he was quite well then. I was sent for at 2:30 to-day and arrived ten minutes later. 1 found Mr. Van derbilt lying on the floor of his library on his left side. His faca was turned towards the fire and his head resting on a pillow. He was dead. His face was livid and his lips purple. 1 judge from his -history that he died from apoplexy or cerebral hemorrhage. I always thought ho would die from that cause. a The coroner signed the inquisition papers s follows: William Henry Vanderbilt, aged 64 years, 7 months, born in Richmond county, Staten Island: cause of death, syncope and cerebral hemorrhage. The coroner may decide to hold an au topsy. ' ; — * PUBLIC OVIJiIOTi. Jay Gould on the Dead. New York, Dec. B.— Jay Gould, in an nterview with a reporter of the Associated Press this evening," said: "Mr. Vanderbilt's death was certainly a sur prise to me, and a sad one, too. His death will be a great loss to the world of business an finance, for ha certainly was the foremost figure in many of the greatest enterprises that have been carried out in this country during the past twentv-flve years." '•You have been intimately acquainted with Mr. Vanderbilt for many years, have you not?" asked the reporter. "I first became acquainted with Mr. Van dorbilt in 1567. At that time I was president of the Erie railroad, and he was vice presi dent of the Hudson River railroad. I found him to be a man of wide resources and sound judgment. Afterwards he became vice pres ident of the New York Central, and figured extensively in the building up of the business of chat road. Our relat ons up to the time of his death had . always been of a pleasant character." '•What is your opinion of Mr. Vanderbilt as a financier?" ■•1 have for many years considered Mr. Vanderbilt as a in in of unusual ability in the management of large financial interests. When his father died and he came into pos session of his vast fortune, Mr. Vanderbilt was not long in demonstrating, his ability to manage the property which had been en trusted to bis care. Ho made no move upon the checker-board of finance until he was satisfied that his move was a safe one to make. He wouid not run a great risk unless he was absolutely- forced by circumstances, which, I assure you, was not very often. ,„_; t HIS 

JUDGMENT UPON VALUES was always sound. Few men have made so few mistakes in the handling of nominal in terests as Mr. Vanderbilt. He was not a bold adventurer or operator. He seemed to be satisfied with a small, at least a fair, return from his investments, so .long as they were sound." "Could you give me an estimate of Mr. Vanderbilt's wealth." "No. I do not think I am able to give any thing like a fair estimate, although I have known him in a business way for a long time. It is quite certain, however, that he was by far the wealthiest man, not only in New York, but in the entire country. He always maintained a reticence upon the value of bis own property. Boasting in that line was wholly beneath him. I never board him so much as intimate the extent of his fortune." "What effect will his death have upon the stock market, and especially upon the stock of the New York Central railroad?" "It will be safe to say that his death will have the effect of depressing the market, es pecially in those stocks in which he had largo holdings. These are tbe New York Central. Lake Shore, Michigan Central and the West Shore roads. Mr. Vaudcrbilt held only $5,000,000 out of the $90,000,000 of the stock of the New York Central. The most of the stock is held by capitalists la Europe. You can see that his holdings of this stock were smaller than was supposed by many. The death of the financier will not, I am quite certain, have other than a temporary effect in depressing these stocks. The property la all good and reliable as investments. If the market values of these stocks fall off a ie •■•■ points to-morrow they will go back again to their original value in a few weeks. Snould Mr. Vanderbilt's holdings be thrown upon the market, there are plenty of capitalists who would be glad to purchase them at a fair figure." OTHER OPINIONS. J. Pierrpont Morgan said that Mr. Van derbilt's death would have little or no ef fect on the market; that the West Shore negotiations would go on as before, and that a cablegram had been sent to London with the information of his death which no doubt would be received there with a great deal of regret. Pool Commissioner Fink said that Mr. Vanderbilt's death would have no effect on the pooling, as he had been out of the arrangement for some time. No doubt the death of such a prom inent man would be felt as a great loss by the mercantile world. Mr. Henry Clews said that Mr. Vanderbilt's death no doubt wouid have some effect on the market, as it would be used by those who always sought to make capital out of a calamity, but that this would be of a serious character there was nothing to fear. Among the Brokers. Xew York, Dec. 8. — There was a good deal of talk at the Windsor hotel, where brokers chiefly resor t during the early part of the evening, about large sales of the Yanderbilt stocks at heavy declines from the closing quotations on the stock ex change this afternoon. The reports when run dawn were found to be greatly magni fied. There were sales of a few hnndred shares of Lackawanna at 85 to 85££.bnt the price advanced before the crowd dispersed to 80 against S3 at the close this afternoon. This was the pivotal stock, but there were two or three small transactions in New York Central at 103@104. The immense crowd present, which far exceeded any thing witnessed at Windsor this season, was accepted as an cv. deuce of the wide spread interest taken by the public in the death of Mr. Vauderbilt and desire to as certain what the effect would probably be upon the market to- morrow. As friend met friend all the inquiries related to the subject, THE STOCK MARKET, and anxious listeners were constantly on the alert to catch a word that might give any indication as to what to-morrow was to give forth. The absence of any settled op aton was the conspicuous feature of the talk early in the evening, bat as time gave an opportunity for more exchange of views, the opinion became very prevalent that there would be a moderate break in the Yanderbilt stocks at the opening to-morrow, not. however, to exceed 2to 3 per cent., and that any support which might be found necessary to prevent a more serious decline would promptly make itself manifest. There was a conference outside of the Windsor among leading operators-, but it is under stood that an adjournmt nt was taken un til early to-morrow moraing. without com ing to any definite agreement as to what should be done. Atte ition was called to night to the fact that tie death of Mr. Yan derbiltfs father had no Liaterial effect upon prices, and that it has generally been un j derstood for the past two years that W. H. Yanderbilt had ceased to take a speculative Interest in the market. Views off Prominent Chicago men. Special to the Globe. Chicago, Dec. 8. — The news of the sudden death of William H. Vanderbilt caused a sensation in business circles this afternoon. The fact was telegraphed too late to affect stock speculation, but curb stone operators of the board of trade took occasion to bear wheat, and the market decliued half a cent upon the receipt of the news. A reporter for the Globe called upon Mr. P. D. Armour very shortly after the news was received. "The stock market will not be affected to any great extern by Mr. Vandorbilt's death," said Mr. Armour. "The stock market has become entirely too big for the death of any one man to affect rt, or in faot for any man to affect, dead or alive." air. W. G. McConnell, of the banking firm of McConnell & Kennett, said: "We anticipated a temporary decline in the general stock list, but nothing permanent or serious. The market has for some time been beyond the influence of any one man or set of men." Vice President McMullen of the Alton said brietiy: "It will create a ripple; no more. He could not avoid the common lot of mortals, and bis doath will unsettle nothing- in the railroad interests of the country." Commissioner Midgely thought the death of Mr. Vanderbilt would have no effect upon the carrying out of the trunk-line contract. It was perfected and agreed upon, and all of the details and negotiations closed. Vnnderbilthad lived to see the ab sorption of the West Shore into the New York Central system, and it was a coinci dence that his death should follow so soon after. He thought that in Chauncey M. Depew, the president, and H. J. Hayden, second vice president, of the New York Central, the Vanderbilt policy would be fully carried out, as to these two was prob ably due the successful pushing through of the negotiations that have resulted in the present improved condition of affairs among the trunk lines. Had the event oc curred six months ago, chaos might have followed, but the danger point had been passed. President Keep of the Chicago & North western railway said he was startled at the report of Vanderbilt's death, as ho visited him in New York la^l week and he then seemed in usual good health and spirits. "There is no reason," said he, "why his death should affect his railroad property at present, at least. He has probably left a will and until its provisions are known do one can say what probable effect his death will have. My impression is that he has made such arrangements BS will allow his bus iness interests to go on with as little inter ruption as possible." Mr. H. H. Porter, formerly president of the Omaha & St. Paul, said Mr. Vander bilt from what he had lizard had been in poor health for a long time and had been doing nothing but looki'g after his estate. "All his business cav3S have been dele gated to others," said Jir. Porter, "and at most bis death will cau^e but a temporary frustration in railroad or financial circles. The world is too big- for any one to bare any great effect on its business. Even if Van derhilt's property should be divided it could have no material effect on the country at the present time, when public confidence is so strong. Had his death occurred in a panicky time the people might have taken a scare." Sensational Stock Report. New York, Dec. 9.— The Sun this morning has the following: "It was gener ally understood, and careful inquiry rather corroborated the assumption, that a pool had been formed to biivJJOO.OO.Q of stock on a declining scnle= T<ie" purchasers are to be made up both in London and domestic markets. A conference of capitalists in terested in the trunk line deal was held in the offices of Drexel, Morgan & Co. as soon as Mr. Vanderbilt's death was known, and lasted into the evening. The conference resulted in the agreement referred to. 

ANOTHER REPORT. The best obtainable information to-night is that the stock market will be upheld through the efforts of a syndicate, headed byj. Pierrpont Morgan, the members of which have agreed to take 300,000 shares, if ottered, and also to take care of prices in the London stock market, which is to open strong and to close strong, with a view of favorably affecting the stock niarkel here. ' The News in Boston. Boston, Dec. 8. — Vanderbilt's death will not, in the opinion of Boston baukers, re sult in any serious trouble to-morrow. There was a large gathering of brokers in the cor ridors of the Vendome this evening and a large quantity of the Vanderbilt stocks, in cluding New York & New England, Lake Shore and Atchison, were disposed of amid much excitement. The prices at the outset were very weak, but at the close were gen erally within 2}^ points of the official clos ing. The evening closed with a hopefu! feeling. Advices of a reassuring nature were read from New York and London. The Effect in St. Paul. "Vanderbilt is dead," said Mr. George A. Hamilton of the Oinaha road. "I expect the bulls will take advantage of it in the stock markets. I should not te surprised to see the stocks drop three or tour poiuts to-mor row, but it will be a good tme to buy. The fact of Mr. Vanderbilt's connection with the Northwestern real will not affect tbe stock of that road more than it will others, and any effect that the speculators may be ablo to force on the market will not last more tl an three or four days. I wouldn't 6eil c dollar of the stock on account of his death." Mr. H. P. Uphain. president of the First National bank, said that Mr. VanderDilfs death, he thought, would have no effect on stocks or business of any kind. It might make a little flurry in certain lines of rail road stock, but that would soon be over and of no importance. "No," said Mr. Monfortof the Second Na tional bank, "Mr. Vanderbilt's death will have no effect on any stocks held in St. Paul, even if it does any where. It would have been different had Gould died. Hi; speculations were of a different nature II Vanderbilt bought anything he paid cash for it." A millionaire Miser Dead. Special to the Globe. Washington, Dec. 8. — Winthrop Wat son Gilman. a millionaire miser, who form erly owned a large share of the present city of Milwaukee, died at Frostberg Saturday. He lived in New York state, but when 27 years old started out to explore the great West from Cleveland. O. He traveled on horseback and on foot as far as Milwaukee, which at that time consisted of not more than half a dozen log houses. He believed that a prosperous future awaited that sec tion of country and bought large tracts of land at Milwaukee, Sheboygan and other neighboring points. Some of his invest ments proved veritable bonanzas. Prop erty that then cost him less than 52.000 is now estimated to be worth 81,000.000. He subsequently returned to New York. Mr. Gilman's penuriousness was a subject of comment and gossip wherever he was known. Even after he was able to count his wealth by millions he denied himself the plainest comforts of life. Singular Teiepbone Fire. New Orleans, Dec. 8. — A singular acci dent occurred last night. The roof of the Bell Telephone exchange was set on fire, it is so presumed, by one of the wires of the Brush Electric Light company in contact with a telephone wire. A heavy current ran in the telephone exchange and set on fire all the insulators connected with more than a thousand wires, so that in a few sec onds every telephone wire was out of the circuit. Burned Her Barn. Special to the Globe Afpleton, Wis., Dee. 8. — C. Debrum of Little Chute was bound over to the next term of the circuit court to-day for burning the barn of his divorced wife. The barn and contents were valued at 35,000. There was some live stock burned also. IN THE

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. What Cotiffressnieu Have to Say About the Document. Special to the Globe. Washington, Dec. 8. — Senator Vest said: "It is a very good message. Ido not agree with the president in regard to silver, but the message is a very good one." Sen ator Voorhees was hardly prepared to ex press an opinion regarding the message, in detail, but in a general way he thought highly of it. lie particularly liked the manner in which the president referred to the tariff. In regard to silver the senator said he was obliged to differ radically from the president. He appreciated the value of a common monetary unit for international commerce, but that was the only argument against silver that he could see any force in. He did not understand the description nf silver as a depreciated metal when he could buy as much with A 

SILVER DOLLAB as he could with a gold dollar, and it was out of the question for us to attempt to get alone without silver as a money. The sil ver was not objected to by the people. In his state nobody was complaining of silver or alarmed at the prospect of a silver cur rency. The only people who objected to silver were the bankers, who disliked the trouble of the taking of the bulkier coin. The silver in the treasury was virtually in circulation because certificates based upon it were in daily use. Senator Voorhees has a very high opinion of the president, and was impressed in a marked degree with the ability with which the president urged his views, and he was confident that he ex pressed the judgment of all the Demo cratic senators when he said they admired the president's ability and had confidence in his strength of character and honesty of purpose, but on some economic questions they did not think as he did, and notably in regard to silver most of the Democratic senators differed from him. The Press On the message. Washington, Dec. 8. — The Evening Star, commenting upon the president's message, says: The message throughout is characteristic of (Mr. Cleveland in the clear-cut, licit expression of his views, allowing no man to mistake them in any particular. ■ . . . ' The Critic says: . There are many wise and valuable sugges tions in the message. .. , 

ENGLISH OPINIONS. London, Dec 9. — The Daily News, editorially, says: . President Cleveland's message - seems to place him in true succession to the greater men, who have occupied the presidential chair, rather ' than to . the late Democratic line. . It. is ■ conceived in a just and friendly spirit towards all foreign powers, and : con tains no word to tickel the ears of American jingos. The message expresses a sentiment of international good will. It is equally wise and prudent on all domestic topics. ; : . ' Vv The Post says: '>';:; / : '.'-:'-\'' >a'.«l: .'-: Some of the , Old World . statesmen might ponder with benefit over some of Mr. Cleve land's reasons touching the Nicaraguan treaty. ■'-*!' The Standard says: . The message is temperate and dignified, and goes far to justify Mr. Cleveland's elec tion. The message contrasts very favorably with some of the wild dispatches of Mr. Frelinghuysen and Mr. Blame. Mr. Cleve land's policy, on the whole, la worthy of adoption. Austria's action in refusing to re ceive Mr. Keiley accords with well-understood precedents. If the right : to refuse an ex equater conflicts with the American constitu tion, the sooner the Republic's municipal laws are put in keeping with international law, the less difficulties will be likely to occur. The Times questions j whether the presi dent's message will occupy so large a space in the thoughts of the world as the death of Mr. Vanderbilt It says: m?rf. Thousands will speculate to-day upon the results of Mr. Vanderbilt's death with an eagerness which events of a larger place in history fall to exoite. The president's message reflects in tranquil and unexciting paragraphs the happy detachment from international jealousy and quarrels which it is the peculiar good fortune of Americans to enjoy. Cleveland Entertains Pulitzer. Special to the Globe. Washington. Dec. President Cleve land has been quoted as one who is callous to the criticisms of those who fear he may have strayed from the straight Democratic path. This can hardly be true. While the president may have no design to placate his critics, he is too sensible a man to let it be known that he is affected by adverse criti cism. These reflections are suggested be cause of the president's open hospitality ex tended to Editor Pulitzer of the New York World. This newspaper man has repeat edly pointed out to the president the shoals and rocks which his deflecting course may encounter. For all this the president last night sought Mr. Pulitzer out and had him as a guest at dinner. What the effect may be time can only tell. One of Pulitzer's friends said to-day: "The New York World will continue to tell President Cleveland the truth whenever he gets out of the D ?mocratic path." The Mississippi Prospects. Special to the GloDe. Washington, Dec. Friends of the Mississippi river and other river improve ments are somewhat discouraged by the small estimates in the books of the secre tary for river and harbor . improvements. The total estimate is only a trifle over §10, -000,000, and when it is remembered that it is the habit of congress to cut these esti mates down 20 to 50 per cent, it is easily seen that prospects for larger estimates are not reassuring. Will Oppose Tinkering . Special to the Globe. Washington, Dec. 8. — Robert P. Porter says, in a dispatch to the Philadelphia Press, that the Republican senators will oppose a general agitation of the tariff question and all reductions of duty at pres ent. It is probable that in a few days, at farthest, these views will be crystalized in some form or other for the purpose, -if possible, of putting an end to the evils aris ing from the apprehension of a reduction of customs duties, which, is little short of actual reduction so far as unsettling values and business is concerned.

YOUNG TO IHABBT. The Entertaining- Story of an Ohio Escapade* Special to the Globe. Ironton, 0.. Dec. 8. — About six months since there came to this place a sleek-look ing young fellow named Adam Ehrlich. Soon after his arrival here he was employed as a barber in Sells' barber shop. He had not been there long until he was quite a favorite with the Sells family, and espec ially with Miss Alma, a teen-year-old daughter, a pretty, vivacious girl, and re markably well developed for her age. She and Ehrlich were constant companions, but on account of her youthfulness the parents thought nothing of the intimacy, believing that this recent employe was too much of a gentleman to take any advantage of their daughter's childish fancy. But recent eveuts opened the eyes of the parents, and Mr. Sells remonstrated with Ehrlich, protesting that his daughter was too young to receive the attention of a . gen tleman, and forbade him pay ing any further attention to the girl. Ehrlich received his employer's or ders very sullenly, and in the evening no tified Mr. Sells that he was going to leave. He was paid off, but still remained in town, and in the evening managed to have an in terview with the little girl and induced her to promise to run off with him. At noon to-day he hired a horse and buggy, and the girl, instead of returning to school, met her lover and they drove down the river . pike, and it is supposed they went to Greenup, Ky., and are safely married by this time. The parents knew nothing of their daughter's absence until school was dismissed this evening, when the other children came home and said Alma had not been to school and that she had told her seatmate that she was going to Greenup with her fellow, and would not return to school. The parents are nearly wild with grief and have telegraphed the authorities in neighboring cities to be on the lookout for the runaway couple, but nothing as yet has been heard of them. Ehrlich is about 33 years old, of medium size and speaks English very brokenly. Federation of Labor. . Washington, Dec. 8. — The fifth annual session of the Federation of Organized Trade and Labor unions of the United States and Canada began in this city this morning. The twenty-five delegates pres ent are - said to represent a constituency of about 280,000 workmen. Martin A. Foran of Cleveland was present as a visitor, and made a speech in which he dwelt on the im portance to the laboring classes of organi zation. ■'.''• '■;::■} Atlanta's Contest Continued.
