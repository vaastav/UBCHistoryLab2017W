The surrender of 1,200 of Agulnaldo's fol lowers in one bunch Indicates that they fcave heard the result of the presidential lection. The opening of Congress presented no Incidents cf note. No contests are In eight, and no campaign requires that business hall be sacrificed for party tactics. If the St. Louis Centennial, for which an appropriation is asked of Congress, is to be controlled by the Lon Stephens regime in that city, the request should be refused. "When two thousand Filipinos desert the cause of Agulnaldo and take an oath of allegiance to the United States there is reason to believe that the Insurrection is near the end. Many men who left "Washington full of bope and fight when Congress adjourned last summer came back much sobered, but no one of them could have been as misera ble as Senator "Wellington, of Maryland, bad a right to be. Nebraska Populists, including those who are going out of office, propose to emigrate to the Indian Territory that they may not be In a State In which they are In the minority. They Imagine they can obtain a portion of the Indian Territory and keep It for those who hold the Populist faith. The reform bill of the Philippine com mission, among other things, closes up all aloons on Sunday, prohibits the sale of Intoxicants In the markets, booths and plazas, prohibits the sale of native wines to soldiers and removes the saloon from the principal streets. And yet some of us are not pleased. It appears that the shortage caused by the Ed-cent city tac levy la at least $150.000, .which, added to the cash in hand when the present year began, J100.SC1. makes a de ficit of over a quarter of a million dollars. I5Tet everybody but Mayor Taggart and his ergan knew that the result could not be different when he gave figures to prove that a E3-cent levy would carry the city through with economy. If those congressmen like Mr. Hay, of Virginia, In whose. State an easy license ystem prevails, are so anxious to try pro hibition, why do they not advocate the ap plication of the system to the District of Columbia, Instead of attaching an anti canteen amendment to the bill for the re organization of the army? As it has been demonstrated by the testimony of 00 per cent, of the officers in the army who come In contact with the enlisted men that the canteen promotes sobriety, it Is hoped that representatives will have the courage to .vote down the Hay amendment. It Is reported that Secretary Root has earned the staff In Washington not to in terfere with the feature of the army bill which breaks up the present staff organi sation and sends officers back to the line after four years of staff service. Hereto fore, by the use of social and other Influ ences, past attempts to make the staff a part of the real army have failed. Since the last effort we have had the Spanish war, which disclosed the inefficiency of a staff organization which had no real con nection with the army. It is predicted the staff feature will pas?, because no of ficer will care to offer opposition to a bill which the secretary of war so strenuously favors. The announcement of the officials of the experiment station in connection with Purdue? University that hereafter special attention will not be given to experiments with sugar beets, may be accepted as an Intimation that the officers have come to the conclusion th.it their efforts In that direction in the past eight or ten yers have not brought forth satisfactory re sults. Only the northern end of the State has soil adapted to the culture of sugar beits. .A few experiments have been mad;? in the State, but it has been evident for some time that Indiana farmers do not take to the sort of labor which Is necessary to successful beet culture. The statement of the officers should prevent those who asked lor a bounty of the lat legislature from repeating their request to the next.

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. To such an extent do the responsibilities and duties growing out of the Spanish war occupy the attention of the President and Congress that much more than half the message is devoted to those topics. In Mr. McKInley's first annual message all al lusions to the Cuban question could have been put into a single paragraph; now the results of the war with Spain are the lead ing topics of the message. The presenta tion of the facts and conditions. Including the Chinese affair, shows how far entirely new problems and policies for which there is no precedent have been forced upon the President and Congress by the logic of events. To-day, the Importance and the novelty of the questions which the Presi dent discusses at length force the problems of domestic policy Into the background. The President begins with the Chinese question, which just now attracts more at tention than others because more depends upon the answer than upon any other question. The issue regarding the Philip pines may be said to be settled. The United States will hold the Islands and give their population education, equal rights and security. To the setting forth of what has been done in those Islands and to the work that he has planned, much of the message is devoted. The President has given all the facts to the American people. He has been equally explicit in regard to the Chi nese troubles. The facts are stated and the policy of the President Is given for public consideration without argument, the President evidently assuming that there are no weak places in hl3 action or di plomacy. What he has to say of Cuba and Hawaii is equally clear. The pledge made to the world in regard to Cuba is to be carried out. The relation of the other possessions acquired by treaty to the United States Is not discussed. Present duties and responsibilities demand the en tire attention. For the rest the President considers briefly the favorable conditions of public affairs. Ho recommends the reduction of the war tax, while his statistics show the unparalleled strength of the public treasury. In a few lines he urges Congress "to pro vide whatever further legislation is neces sary to insure the continued parity under all conditions between our form3 of money." He repeats his recommendations regarding monopolistic and like combina tions and urges Congress to act. He urges an increase of the army and commends the proposition to have officers detailed from the line to fill vacancies In the various staffs. He approves the merit system in the public service by extending it, under rigid requirements, in the Philippines, and by urging Congress to make Adequate ap propriations to enable the Civil-service Commission to discharge Its important dutlds with promptness. No more timely warning or more concise statement of the Nation's true policy could" be made than is embraced In the final paragraph, as follows: In our great prosperity we must guard against the danger it l.ivltes of extrava gance in government expenditures and ap propriations; and the chostn repräsenta tives of the people will, I doubt not, fur nish an example in their legislation of that wise economy which In a season of plenty husbands for the future. In this era of great business activity and opportunity caution 13 not untimely. It will not abate, but strengthen, confidence. It will not re tard, but promote, legitimate Industrial and commercial expansion. Our growing1 power brings with It temptations and perils requiring constant vigilance to avoid. It must not be used to Invite conflicts, nor for oppression, but for the more effective maintenance of those principles of equality and Justice upon which our institutions and happiness depend. Let us keep always in mind that the foundation of our govern ment is liberty; its superstructure peace. In the closing sentences of this pregnant paragraph Is expressed the policy of the President and the portion of the American people whom he represents and who ex tended his period of usefulness another term. Our growing power must be used to extend the blessings of liberty and Justice through peace. The report of the superintendent of the railway mail service shows that during the last fiscal year 450.045.SG3 pounds of second-class mail matter were transported. This means that It would take 22,502 regu lation postal cars, used solely for this pur pose, to transport this class of matter. The second-class abuses grow every year, as a large part of the matter shipped as second-class, which was intended to em brace regularly Issued newspapers and periodicals sent to regular subscribers, and a percentage of sample copies, should be required to pay book or merchandise rates. For the transportation of such matter the department does not receive one-fifth of the cost to the government. But for this abuse the postal service would be self sustaining, about $13.000.000 being lost by the present construction of a loosely framed law.

WASHINGTON. Dec. 3. Following Is President McKInley's message, transmitted to Congress to-day: To the Senate and House of Representa tives: At the outgoing of the old and the in coming of the new century you begin the last session of the Fifty-sixth Congress with evidences on every hand of individual and national prosperity and with proof of the growing strength and Increasing power for good of republican Institutions. Your countrymen will Join with you in felicita tion that American liberty Is more firmly established than ever before, and that love for it and the determination to preserve It are more universal than at any former period of our history. Tht Republic was never so strong, be cause never so strongly intrenched In the heart3 of the people as now. The Con stitution, with few amendments, exists an It left the hands of Its authors. The ad ditions which have been made to It pro claim larger freedom and more extended citizenship. Popular government has dem onstrated in Its one hundred and twenty fcur years of trial here its stability and security, and its efficiency as the best in strument of national development and the best safeguard to human rights. When the Sixth Congress assembled in November, 1S00, the population of the United States, was 5,2uS.4S3. It is now 7Ö.C04.799. Then we had sixteen States; now we have forty-five. Then our territory consisted of 9y,0SO square miles; it is now 3.846.595 square miles. Education, religion and morality have kept pace with our ad vancement in other directions, and while extending Its power the government has adhered to Its foundation principles and abated none of them In dealing with our new peoples and possessions. A nation so preserved and blessed gives reverent thanks to God and Invokes His guidance and the continuance of his care and favor. OUR 

FOREIGN RELATIONS. CHINESE PROBLEM. IleTlew of the RIstnsr Aenlnnt For eignersPolicy of Administration. In our foreign intercourse the dominant question has been the treatment of the Chinese problem. Apart from this our re lations with the powers have been happy. The recent troubles in China spring from the anti-foreign agitation which for the past three years has gained strength in the northern provinces. Their origin lies deep in the character of th Chinese races and in the traditions of their government. The Tai-Ping rebellion and the opening of Chinese ports to for eign trade and settlement disturbed alike the homeogenelty and the seclusion of China. Meanwhile foreign activity mado Itself felt In all quarters, not alone on tho coast, but along the great river ar teries and In the remoter districts, car rying new ideas and introducing new as sociations among a primitive people, which had pursued for centuries a national pol icy of Isolation. The telegraph and the railway spreading over their land, the steamers plying on their waterways, tho merchant and the missionary penetrating year by year further to the Interior, be came to the Chinese mind types of an alien Invasion, changing the course of their national life and fraught with vague fore bodings of disaster to their beliefs and their self-control. For several years before the present trou bles all the resources of foreign diplomacy, backed by moral demonstrations of the physical force of fleets and arms, have been needed to secure due respect for the treaty rights of foreigners and to obtain satisfac tion from the responsible authorities for the sporadic outrages on the persons and property of unoffending sojourners, which, from time to time, occurred at widely separ ated points In the northern provinces, as in tho case of the outbreaks in Sze-Chuan and Shan-Tung. Posting of anti-foreign pla cards became a dally occurrence, which the repeated reprobation of the Imperial power failed to check or punish. These inflamma tory appeals to the Ignorance and supersti tion of the masses, mendacious and absurd in their accusations, and deeply hostile in their spirit, could not but work cumulative harm. They aimed at no particular class of foreigners; they were impartial in at tacking everything foreign. An outbreak in Shan-Tung, in which Ger man missionaries were slain, was the too natural result of these malevolent teach ings. The posting of seditious placards, ex horting to the utter destruction of foreign ers and of every foreign thing, continued unrebuked. Hostile demonstrations toward the stranger gained strength by organiza tion. The sect commonly styled the Boxers de veloped greatly In the provinces north of the Yang-Tse, and with the collusion of many notable officials, including some in the Immediate councils of the throne itself, became alarmingly aggressive. No for eigner's life, outside of the protected treaty ports, was safe. No foreign Interest was secure from spoliation. 

PROTESTS WERE IN VAIN. The diplomatic representatives of the powers in Peking strove in vain to check this movement. Protest was followed by demand and demand by renewed protest, to be met with perfunctory edicts from the palace and evasive and futile assurances from the Tsung-li-Yamen. The circle of the Eoxer influence narrowed about Peking, and while nominally stigmatized as seditious, it was felt that its spirit pervaded tho capital Itself, that the imperial forces were imbued with its doctrines, and that the im mediate counselors of the Empress dowager were in full sympathy with the anti-foreign movement. The increasing gravity of the conditions In China and the Imminence of peril to our own diversified interests In the empire, as well as to those of all the other treaty gov ernments, were soon appreciated by this government, causing it profound solicitude. The United States from the earliest of for eign intercourse with China had followed a policy of peace, omitting no occasions to testify good will, to further the extension of lawful trade, to respect the sovereignty of Its government, and to Insure by all legitimate and kindly, but earnest means the fullest measure of protection for the lives and property of our law-abiding citi zens and for the exercise of their beneficent calling among the Chinese people. Mindful of this, it was felt to be appro priate that our purposes should be pro nounced In favor of such course as would hasten united action of the powers at Peking to promote the administrative re forms fo greatly needed for strengthening tho Imperial government and maintaining tho integrity of China. In which we be lieved the whole western world to be alik concerned. To these ends, I caused to be addressed to the several powers occupying territory and maintaining spheres of in fluence in China the circular proposals of lyjO, Inviting from them declarations of thir Intentions and views as to the desir ability of the adoption of measures insuring the benefits cf equality of treament of all fcrelcn trade throughout China. With gratifying unanimity the responses coincided in this common policy, enabling me to see in the successful termination of these negotiations proof of the friendly spirit which nnimatcs the various powers interested in the untrammeled development of commerce and industry in the Chinese empire as a source of vast benefit to the whole commercial world. In this conclu sion, which I had the gratification to an nounce as a completed engagement to the Interested powers on March 20. 1900, I hope fully discerned a potential factor for the abatement of the distrust of foreign pur poses which for a year past had appeared to inspire the policy of the imperial gov ernment, and for the effective exertion by it of power and authority to quell the criti cal anti-foreign movement in the northern provinces most Immediately influenced by the Manchu sentiment. BOXERS GAINED CONTROL. Seeking to testify confidence in the will ingness and ability of the imperial admin istration to redress the wrongs and pre vent the evils we suffered and feared, the marine guard, which had been sent to Pe king in the autumn of 1S30 for the protec tion of the .egation, was withdrawn at the earliest practicable moment, and all pend McKInley's ing questions were remitted, as far as we were concerned, to the ordinary resorts of diplomatic Intercourse. The Chinese gov ernment proved, however, unable to check the rising strength of the Boxers, and ap peared to be a prey to internal dissensions. In the unequal contest the anti-foreign In fluences soon gained the ascendency under the leadership of Prince Tuan. Organized armies of Roxers, with which the imperial forces affiliated, held the country between Peking and the coast, penetrated into Man churia up to tho Russian border, and. through their emissaries threatened a like rising throughout northern China. Attacks upon foreigners, destruction of their property and slaughter of native con verts were reported from all sides. The Tsung-H-Yamen. already permeated with hostile sympathies, could make no effective response to the appeals of the legations. At this critical Juncture, In the early spring of this year, a proposal was made by the other powers that a combined fleet should be assembled in Chinese waters as a moral demonstration, under cover of which to exact of the Chinese government respect for foreign treaty rights and the suppres sion of the Boxers. The United States, while not participating In the Joint demonstration, promptly sent from the Philippines all ships that could be spared for service on the Chinese coast. A small force of marines was landed at Taku and sent to Peking for tho protection of the American legation. Other powers took similar action, until some 400 men were assembled in the capital as legation guards. Still the peril increased. The legations re ported the developmnt of the seditious movement in Peking and the need of In creased provision for defense against It. "While preparations were in progress for a larger expedition to strengthen the lega tion guards and keep the railway open, an attempt of the foreign ships to make a landing at Taku was met by a fire from the Chinese forts. The forts were thereupon shelled by the foreign vessels, the American admiral taking no part In the attack, on the ground that we were not at war with China and that a hostile demonstration might consolidate the anti-foreign elements and strengthen the Boxers to oppose the relieving column. Two days later the Taku forts were captured after a sanguinary conflict. Severance of communication with Teking followed, and a combined force of additional guards, which was advancing to Peking by the Pei-IIo. was checked at Lang-Fang. The Isolation of the legations was complete. The siege and the relief of the legations has passed into undying history. In all the stlrrirg chapter which record the heroism of the devoted Viand, clinging to here In the lace of derpoJr. and the un daunted spirit that led their relisvors through battle and suffering to tho goal, it li a memory of whicn my countrymen :na be justly proud that tn honor ot our flag was maintained alike In tho siege and the rescue and that stout American hearts havo again set high. In fervent emulation with true men of other race and language, the indomitable courage that ever strives for tho cause of right and Justice MURDER OF VON KETTET. ER. By Juno 19 the legations ware cut off. An Identical not from tho Yamen ordered each minister to have Peking, under a promlsel escort, within twenty-fou- hours To gain time they replied, asking proroga tion of the time, which was afterwards granted, and requesting an interviev with the Tsung-li-Yamen on the following day. No reply being received, cn the morning of the 20th the German minister. Baron von Ketteler, set out for tha Yamen to obtain a response, and on tho way was murdered. An attempt by the legatlor guard to recover his body was foiled by the Chinese. Armed forces turned out against the legations: 'Their quarters were surrounded and attacked. The mission compounds were abandoned, their Inmates taking refuge in the British legation, where all tho other legations and guards gathered for more effective defense. Four hundred persons were -crowded In its nar row compass. Two thousand native con verts were assembled In a near-by palace under protection of the foreigners. Lines of defense were strengthened, trenches dug, barricades raised and preparations made to stand a siege, which at once be gan. "From June 20 until July 37," writes Min ister Conger, "there was scarcely an hour during which there was not firing upon some part of our llnea and into some of the legations, varying from a tingle shot to a general and continuous attack along the whole line. Artillery was placed around the legations and on the overlooking palace walls, and thousands of three-inch shot and shell were fired, destroying some buildings and damaging all. So thickly did the balls rain that when tho ammunition of the besieged ran low. five quarts of Chi nese bullets were gathered in an hour In one compound and recast." Attempts were mado to burn the lega tions by setting neighboring houses on fire but the flames-were successfully fought off, although the Austrian, Belgian, Ital ian and Dutch legations were then and eubsequently burned. With the aid of tho native converts, directed by the mission aries, to whose helpful co-operation Mr. Conger awards unstinted praise, the Brit ish legation was made a veritable fortress. The British minister. Sir Claude MacDon- ald, was chosen general commander of the defense, with the secretary of the Ameri can legation, Mr. E. G. Squires, as chief of staff. To save life and ammunition the " be sieged sparingly returned the Incessant fire of tho Chinese soldiery, fighting only to repel attack or make an occasional successful sortie for strategic advantage, such as that of fifty-live American, Brit ish and Russian marines, led by Capt. Myers of the United States marine corps, which resulted in the capture of a formidable barricade on the wall that gravely men aced tho American position. It was held to the last, and proved an Invaluable ac quisition, because commanding the water gate through which the relief column en tered. During the siego the defenders lost sixty-five killed, 13 wounded and seven by disease the last all children. On July 14 the besieged had their first communication with the Tsung-li-Yamen, from whom a message came inviting a conference, which was declined. Corre spondence, however, ensued and a sort of armistice was agreed upon, which stopped the bombardment and lessened the rifle lire for a time. Even then no protection what ever was afforded nor any aid given, save to send to the legations a small supply of fruit and three sacks of flour. Indeed, the only communication had with the Chinese government related to the occasional de livery or dispatch of a telegram or to the demands of the Tsung-li-Yamen for the withdrawal of the legation to tho coast under escort. Not only are the protestations of the Chinese government that It protected and succored the legations positively contra dicted, but irresistible proof accumulates that the attacks were made upon them by imperial troops, regularly uniformed, armed and officered, belonging to the com mand of Jung Lu, the Imperial commander-in-chief. Decrees encouraging the Box ers, organizing them under prominent im perial officers, provisioning them and even granting them large sums in the name of the Empress dowager, are known to exist. Members of the Tsung-li-Yamen who coun seled protection for the foreigners were beheaded. Even in the distant provinces men suspected of foreign sympathy were put to death, prominent among the?e be ing Chanj? Yen Iloon, formerly Chinese minister in Washington. FIRST TIDINGS FROM CONGER. "With the negotiation of the partial armistice cf July 14. a proceeding which was doubtless promoted by the representa tions of the Chinese envoy at Washington, the way opened for the conveyance to Mr. Conger of attest message sent by the sec retary of state through the kind offices of Minister Wu Ting Fang. Mr. Conger's re ply, dispatched from Teklng on July . IS through the same channel, afforded the outside world the first tidings that the Inmates of the legations were still alive and hoping for succor. This news stimulated the preparations fcr a Joint relief expedition, in numbers sufficient to overcome the resistance which for a month had been organizing between Taku and the capital. Reinforce ments sent by all th co-operating govern ments were constantly arriving. The United States contingent, hastily as sembled from the PhlUrmlnes or dta. patched from this country, amounted to some 6,000 men, under the able command of the lamented Colonel Liscum and after wards of General Chaffee. Toward the end of July the movement began. A severe conflict followed at Tien tsin, in which Colonel Liscum was killed. The city was stormed and partly de stroyed. Its capture afforded the base of operations from which to make the final advance, which began in the first days of August, the expedition being made up cf Japanese, Russian, British and American troops at tho outset. Another battle was fought and won at Yang-Tsun. There after the disheartened Chinese troops of fered little show of resistance. A few days later the Important position of Ho-SI-Woo was taken. A rapid march brought the United States forces to the populous city of Tung-Chow, which capitulated without a contest. On Aug. 14 the capital was reached. After a brief conflict beneath the walls the relief column entered and the legations were saved. The United Stites soldiers, sailors and marines, officers and men alike, in those distant climes and unusual surround ings showed the same valor, discipline and good conduct and gave proof of the same high degree of Intelligence and efficiency which have distinguished them in every emergency. The Imperial family and the government had fled a few days before. The city was without visible control. The remaining imperial soldiery had made on the night of the 13th a last attempt to ex terminate the besieged, which was gallantly repelled. It fell to the occupying forces to restore order and organize a provisional administration. THE SOUTHERN PROVINCES. Happily the acute disturbances were con fined to the northern provinces. It Is a re lief to recall and a pleasure to record the loyal conduct of the viceroys and local authorities of the southern and eastern provinces. Their efforts were continuously directed to the pacific control of the vast populations under their rule and to the scrupulous observance of foreign treaty rights. At critical moments they , did not hesitate to memorialize the throne urging the protection of the legations, the restora tion of communication and the assertion o. the imperial authority against the sub versive elements. They maintained excel lent relations with the official representa tives of foreign powers. To their kindly disposition is largely due the success o"f the consuls in removing many of the mis sionaries from the interior to places of safety. In this relation the actions of the consuls should be highly commended. In Shan-Tung and eastern Chl-Li the task was difficult, but. thanks to their energy and the co-operation of American and for eign naval commanders, hundreds of for eigners, including those of other nationali ties than ours, were rescued from immi nent peril. The policy of the United States through all this trying period was clearly an nounced and scrupulously carried out. A circular note to the powers, dated July 3, proclaimed our attitude. Treating the con dition in tho north as one of virtual an archy in which the great provinces of the south and southeast had no sharo we re garded the local authorities in the latter quarters as representing the Chinese peo ple with whom we sought to remain in peace and friendship. Our declared alms involved no war against the Chinese na tion. We adhered to the legitimate office of rescuing the imperiled legation, obtain ing redress for wrongs already suffered, securing wherever possible the safety of American life and property In China and preventing a spread of the disorders or their recurrence. As was then said, "the policy of the government of the United States is to seek a solution which may brintr about permanent safety and peace to China, preserve Chinese territorial and administrative entity, protect all rights guaranteed to friendly powers by treaty and International law and safeguard for the world the principle of equal and im partial trade with all parts of the Chinese empire." Faithful to those professions which, as it proved, reflected the views and purposes ot the other co-operating governments, all our efforts have been directed toward end ing the anomalous situation in China by negotiations for a settlement at the earliest possible moment. As soon as the sacred duty of relieving our legation and its de pendents was accomplished we withdrew from active hostilities, leaving our legation under an adequate guard in- Peking as a channel of negotiation and settlements course adopted by others of the interested powers. Overtures of the empowered rep resentatives of the Chinese Emperor have ben considerately entertained. The Russian proposition looking to the restoration of the imperial power In Peking has been accepted as in full consonance with our own desires, for we have held, and hoid. that effective reparation for wrongs suffered and an enduring settle ment that will make their recurrence im possible can best be brought about under an authority which the Chinese nation reverences and obeys. While so doing we forego no Jot of our undoubted right to exact exemplary and deterrent punishment of the responsible authors and abettors of the criminal acts whereby we and other na tions have suffered grievous Injury. CULPRITS MUST BE PUNISHED. For the real culprits, the evil counselors who have misled the imperial Judgment and diverted the sovereign authority to their own guilty ends, full expiation becomes imperative within the rational limits of retributive Justice. Regarding this as the initial condition of an acceptable setllc- ment between China and the powers, I said In my message of Oct. 18 to the'Chl- nese Emperor: "I trust that negotiations may begin so soon as we and the other of fended governments shall be effectively satisfied of your Majesty's ability and power to treat with Just sternness the prin cipal offenders, who are doubly culpable, not alone toward the foreigner, but toward your Majesty, under whose rule the pur pose of China to dwell in concord with the world had hitherto found expression In the welcome and protection assured to strangers." Taking, as a point of departure, the Im perial edict appointing Earl Li Hung Chang and Prince Ching plenipotentiaries to ar range a settlement and the edict of Sept. 25, whereby certain high officials were designated for punishment, this govern ment has moved. In concert with the oth er powers, toward the opening of negotia tions, which Mr. Conger, assisted by Mr. Kockhill, has been authorized to conduct on behalf of the United States. General bases of negotiation formulated by the government of the French Repub lic have been accepted, with certain reser vations as to details, made necessary by our own circumstances, but, like similar reservations by other powers, open to dis cussion In the progress of the negotiations. The disposition of the Emperor's govern ment to admit liability for wrongs done to foreign governments and their nationals, and to act upon such additional designa tion of the guilty persons as the foreign ministers at Peking may be in a position tc make, gives hope of a complete settle ment of all questions involved, assuring foreign rights of residence and intercourse on terms of equality for all the world. I regard as one of the essential factors of a durable adjustment the securement ot adequate guarantees for liberty of faith, since Insecurity of those natives who may embrace alien creeds is a scarcely les effectual assault on the rights of foreign worship and teaching than would be the direct invasion thereof. The matter of indemnity for our wronged citizens is a question of grave concern. Measured in money also, a sufficient repar ation may prove to be beyond the ability of China to meet. All the powers concur In emphatic disclaimers of any purpose of aggrandizement through the dismember ment of the empire. I am disposed to think that due compensation may be made in part by increased guarantees of security for foreign rights and immunities, and. most important of all, by the opening of China to the equal commerce of all the world These views have been and will be earnestly advocated by our represent atives. The government of Russia has put for ward a suggestion that In the event of protracted divergence of views in regard to Indemnities the matter may bo relegated I favorably incline to this, believing that to the court of arbitration at The Hague, high ribunal could not fail to reach a so lution no less conducive to the stability and enlarged prosperity of China itself than immediately beneficial to the powers. 1VITII GREAT MRITAIX. IlclatioiiN Continue Friendly South Africnn War Alnakan Boundary. Our friendly relations with Great Britain continue. The war in southern Africa in troduced important questions. j. condition unusual in international wars was present ed in that while ono belligerent had control of the seas, the other had no ports, ship ping or direct trade, but was only accessible through the territory of a neutral. Vexa tious questions arose through Great Brit ain's action In respect to neutral cargoes, not contraband In their own nature, shipped to Portuguese South Africa, on the score of probable or suspected ultimate destina tion to the Boer states. 8uch consignments in British ships, by which alone direct trade Is kept up be tween our ports and southern Africa, were seized In application of a municipal law prohibiting British vessels from trading with the enemy without regard to any con traband character of the goods, while car goes shipped to Delagoa bay In neutral bottoms were arrested on the ground of alleged destination to an enemy's country. Appropriate representations on our part re sulted In tho British government agreeing to purchase outright all such goods shown to be the actual property of American citizens, thus closing the incident to the satisfaction cf the Immediately interested parties, although, unfortunately, without a broad settlement of the question of a neu tral's right to send goods not contraband per se to a neutral port adjacent to a bel ligerent area. The work of marking certain provisional boundary points, for convenience of admin istration, around the head of Lynn canal. In accordance with the temporary arrange ment of October, 1STC, was completed by a Joint survey in July last. The modus vi vendi haM so far worked without friction, and the Dominion government has provided rules and regulations for securing to our citizens the benefit of the reciprocal stipu lation that the citizens or subjects of either power found by that arrangement within the temporary Jurisdiction of the other shall suffer no diminution of the rights and grlvlleges they have hitherto enjoyed. But. owever necessary such an expedient might have been to tide over the grave emergen cies of the situation, it is at best but an unsatisfactory makeshift, which should not be suffered to delay the speedy and com plete establishment of the frontier line to which we are entitled under the Russo American treaty for the cession of Alaska.' In this relation I may refer again to the need of definite marking the ' Alaskan boundary where It follows the one hundred and forty-first meridian. A convention to that end has been before the Senate for some two years, but as no action has been taken I contemplate negotiating a new con vention for a joint determination of the meridian by telegraphic observations. These, it is believed, will give more accu rate and unquestionable results .than the Eidereal methods heretofore Independently followed, which, as is known, proved dis crepant at several points on the line, al though not varying at any place more than 700 feet. The pending claim of R. H. Miy against the Guatemalan government has been set tfcd by arbitration. Mr. George F. B. Jen ner, British minister at Guatemala, who was chosen as sole arbitrator, having awarded 514J.730.73 in gold to the claimant. THE 

PARIS EXPOSITION. Succrs of American Exhibitors Re lation vitli Frnnc Cordial. The year of the exposition has been fruit ful In occasions for displaying the good will that exists between this country and France. This great competition brought together from every nation the best in natural productions. Industry, science and the arts, submitted In generous rivalry to a Judgment made all the more searching because of that rivalry. The extraordinary Increase of exportatlons from this country during the past three years and the activ ity with which our inventions and wares had invaded new markets caused much In terest to center upon the American ex hibit, and every encouragement was of fered In the way of space and facilities to permit of its being comprehensive as a whole and complete in every part. It was, however, not an easy task to assemble ex hibits that could fitly illustrate our di versified resources and manufactures. Singularly enough, our national prosperity lessened the incentive to exhibit. The dealer in raw materials knew that the user must come to him; the great factories were contented with the phenomenal de mand for their output, not alone at home, but also abroad, where merit had already won a profitable trade. Appeals had to be made to the patriot ism of exhibitors to induce them to incur outlays promising no Immediate returns. This was especially the case whero it be came needful to complete an Industrial sequence or Illustrate a class of processes. One manufacturer after another had to be visited and importuned, and, at times, after a promise to exhibit in a particular section had been obtained, it would be withdrawn, .owing to pressure of trade or ders, and a new quest would have to be made. The installation of exhibits, too. en countered many obstacles and involved un expected cost. The exposition was far from ready at the date fixed for its open ing. The French transportation lines were congested with offered freight. Belated goods had to be hastily installed In un finished quarters with whatever labor cou'd be obtained in the prevailing con fusion. Nor was the task of the commis sion lightened by the fact that, owing to the scheme of classification adopted, it was impossible to have the entire exhibit of any one country in the samo building or more than one group of exhibits In the same part of any building. Our Installa tions were scattered on both sides of the Seine and In widely remote suburbs of Paris, so that additional assistants were needed for the work of supervision and arrangement. , Despite all these drawbacks the contribu tion of the United States was not only the largest foreign display, but was among the earliest In place and the most orderly in arrangement. Our exhibits were shown In 101 out of 121 classes, and more completely covored tho entire classification than those of any other nation. In total number they ranked next after those of France, and the attractive form In 'which they were pre sented secured general attention. A criterion of the extent and success of our participation and the thoroughness with which our exhibits were organized is seen in the awards granted to American exhibitors by the International Jury, name ly, grand prir.es. 240; gold medals. L'J7; silver medals, 776; bronze medals, 541. and honor able mentions, 3222,476 In all, being the greatest totp.l number given to the exhibit of any exhibiting nation as well as the largest number In each grade. This sig nificant recognition of merit in competition with the chosen exhibits of all other na tions and at the hands of juries almost wholly made up of representatives of France and other competing countries is not only most gratifying, but Is especially valuable since it sets us to the front In International questions of supply and de mand, while the large proportion of awards In the classes of art and artistic manu factures afforded unexpected proof of the stimulation of national culture by the prosperity that flows from natural pro ductiveness Joined to Industrial excellence. Apart from the exposition several occa sions for showing international good will occurred. The Inauguration In Parts of the Lafayette monument presented by the school children of the United States and the designing of a commemorative coin by our mint and the presentation of the first niece struck to the President of the republic were rnarVed bv anprooriate cere monies, and the Fourth of July was es pecially observed In the French capital. THE 

GERMAN EMPIRE. Settlement of Troublesome Questions) T!ie Ment Inspection Lair. Good will prevails in our relations with the German empire. An amicable adjust ment of the long pending question of the admission of our life inurance companies to do business In Prussia has been reached. One of the principal companies has al ready been readmitted and the was' Is opened for others to share the privilege. The settlement of the Samoan problem, to which I adverted in my last message, has accomplished good results. Peace arul contentment prevail in the Islands, espe cially in Tutulla, where a convenient ad ministration that has won the confidence nnd esteem of the kindly disposed natives has been organised under the direction of the commander of the United States naval station at Pago-Pago. An imperial meat inspection has been enacted for Germany. While it may sim plify the inspections, it prohibit certain products heretofore admitted. There is still a great uncertainty whether our well nigh extinguished German trade In meat products can revive under its new bur dens. Much will depend upon regulations not yet promulgated, which we confidently ho;e will be free from the discriminations which attended the enforcement of the old statutes. The remaining link In the new lines of direct telegraphic communication between the United States and the German empire has recently been completed, affording a gratifying occasion for exchan-cs cf friendly congratulations with the German Emperor. - . LYXCIIEVO OF ITALIANS. Recommendations of Lnt Year Re newedMob Law Deplored. The assassination of King Humbert called forth sincere expressions of sorrow from this government and people, and oc caflon was fitly taken to testify to the Italian nation the high regard here felt for tha memory of the lamented ruler. In my last message I referred at ccn slderable length to the lynching of five Italians at Tallulah. Notwithstanding ths efforts of the federal government, the pro duction of evidence tending to Inculpate the authors of this grievous effense against our civilization, and the repeated inquests set on foot by the authorities of the Stat of Louisiana, no punishments have fol lowed. Successive grand Juries have failed to indict. The representations of the Italian government In the face of this mis carriage have been most temperate and Just. Setting the principle at Issue high above all consideration of merely pecuniary in demnification, such as this government made In the three previous cases, Italy has solemnly Invoked the pledges of ex isting treaty and asked that tht Justice to which she Is entitled shall be meted In regard to her unfortunate countrymen In our territory with the same full measure she herself would give to any American, were his reciprocal treaty rights con temned. I renew the urgent recommendations I made last year that the Congress appro priately confer upon the federal courts Jurisdiction In this class of International cases where the ultimate responsibility of the federal government may bt Involved, and I Invite action upon the bills to ac ccrapllsh this which were Introduced In the Senate and House. It Is Incumbent on us to remedy the statutory omission which has led, nnd may again lead, to such untoward results. 1 have pointed out the necessity and the precedent for legis lation of this character. Its enactment is a simple measure of provisory Juctlcs toward the nations with which we as a sovereign equal make treaties requiring reciprocal observance. While the Italian government naturally regards such action as the rrlmary nd indeed the most essential element in the disposal of the Tallulah incident. I advlb that. In accordance with precedent, and in view cf the Improbability of that par ticular case being reached by the blU now pending. Congress make gracious provision for Indemnity to the Italian sufferers in the same form and proportion as heretofore. In my Inaugural address I referred to the general subject of lynching in these wordb: "Lynching must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States; courts, not mobs, must ex ecute the penalties of the law. The pres ervation of public order, the right of dis cussion, the integrity of courts, and th orderly administration of Justice must con tmue forever the rock of safety upon which our government courlty rests." This I most urgently reiterate and ugan Invite the attention of my countrymen to this reproach upon our civilization. e
