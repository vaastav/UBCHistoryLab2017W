Spanish infantry proceeded slowly to within thirty yards of the enemys position whereupon the latter retired General Valdez in full uniform and on a white horse rode up close behind the infantry He was a conspicuous target General Garcia Navarro com manding the advance exposed him self in a manner no commander is jus tified in doing The insurgents are bad shots I appeared to me that tons of lead

four hours there have been frequent cabinet councils at the palace and sev eral exchanges of communications with the representatives of the powers but no decision seems to have been arrived at by the porte on the subject of the firmans demanded by the powers fo the passage of extra guairdships through the Bosphorus The dilatory policy of the palace people is continued apparently in the hope that some hitch will occur which will put an end to the accord o the powers The ambas sadors do not attempt to deny that atemp the accord of Europe is liable to be dis turbed at any moment and it is to at I tain this end that the Turk is work ing assiduously night and day with all the skill and subtleness of eastern diplomacy The irritating rumors about the real designs of Great Britain are taken to the Russian embassy by the agents of the porte and annoying in sinuations concerning the ultimate aims of Russia find their way through the portes agents into the British em bassy In turn fhe French
