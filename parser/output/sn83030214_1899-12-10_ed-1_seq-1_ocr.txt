The most oheerlng news fron the theatre of war yesterday came from R?u;-''> aj :.? at Lourenco Marque?, where a dispatch had I" en received from the Boer headquarter? at Ladysmlth announcing that the Brltleh had itonned and carried Lom? bard's ? {'. \ '? lias been unjustly ?aid about Router's disant, bes from that quar? ter betel tainted with Boer Influence, precisely as'Pr-s. .? ; t Krllger's partisans may have sus? pected that the same agency's telegrams from the British headquarters were colored by the environment of the correspondents. Bui news favorable te the British sld? from Pretoria Is ao ? : "Ugh in London. This I^dy #mlth dispatch was dated Friday, when both Router ? Central News were reporting that General BuHer*? army was still centred about I ; hence It was a fair inference that General White'? fores had made a sortie. with the single exception that the British had capturad a Maxim gun and put ene hewltser and one big ?'reusot out of Earlier tidir.gs from t!. garrison through Brlt ?1 the success of the British gunners in silencing two big guns, but nothiag v>as sa:1. about the storming and cap? ture of Lombari Kop Loungers at the clubs last night were almost convinced that General White had dealt the enemy a severe blow, yet were at a loss to understand why he had not mirnautd the go d now? by heliograph to Fr?re, faapjcli m commentators suggested that the Boer commander might be maklnir use of Reuters agent lot purposes Of his own, but they were? also unable to explain how General Bulier could be deceived when the heliograph enabled him to communicate directly with Lady imith. The latest news from Ladysmlth by runner was dated Tuesday, when the garrison was re? ported t.y "Th. Standard" correspondent to be In excellent condition after silencing the heavy rur.s mounted by the Boers. CONFIRMED BY THE WAR OFFICE. The War Office after midnight settled all con? troversy by giving out a bulletin which General Bul'.er had received from General White fully confirming Router's dispatch. Whits had sent a force ef six hundred men to surprise a gun on the h;l!, and had destroyed two guns with gun Mtton and brought back a Maxim into camp, ? ly one man killed and one oflV'-r wound? ed- A detachment of th? 18th Hussars had circled around Pepworth Hill, burning kraals tnd cutting telegraph lines. It was a gallant ?d successful sortie, which proved that General White's men were full of fight and In admirable wniltlon for co-operating with General Bulier. It was a good omen, anyway, for the stirring ?vents during the next few days, with vlct ry M a crowning result. Otherwise, the news from both Frere and Hodder River was anything but startling. Both ener?is Bul'.er and Methuen were waiting, ap hrtntly, for the howitzer batteries which were ? the way.

The evidence is clear that the war has been conducted In the humane manner proclaimed by The H&Ruc Congress as indispensable to the In? terests of civilization, and such exceptions ns am noted in the cases of KnlKht and other wounded men of Lord Methuen's army only serve to prove the rule. Misuse of the white flag has been, however, a common form of outrage and trcach n.v on the Dutch side, and there are several well authenticated cases of improper use of Red Cross badges, with what seems a flagrant instance of Inhumanity in firing upon the hospital at Lady emit h. : CENSORSHIP OF THE MAILS. A war correspondent's letter published in to? day's "Globe" contains the remarkable statement i that not only disejjtches. but mall letters as well, are subjected to military censorship. This seems | incredible, but It has been a singular fact that ? few descriptions of the battles in Natal sent by mail have contained critical comments upon the ! tactics of the staff. The truth about Cenerai Whit?'? disastrous repulse has only been hinted ? at vaguely in two or three letters. The eensor j *hip Is operated on such drastic lines that the secret history of the campaign may be reserved for the war correspondents' books. I. N. F. <-f THE CAPTURE OF LOMBARDS KOP.

Besides foreshadowing General Buller's advance, the fact that he has ordered two hundred stretcher bearers from Pleterma rltzburg to assist the regular Ambulance Corps indicates that he anticipates sharp fighting.

There were only fourteen persons In the room at the time, and of thie number only two there aw spectators. There was no crowd around the building, and no Interest was manifested In the work, save by those engaged In it. The three Commissioners were all apparently in Kood humor, although Commissioners Ellis and Pryor, who had done Hie most work In prepar? ing th' Ir long and elaborate opinion, look??! worn and tired.

"This-? has been a hard thlnsr for me," he said, bis eyes inflamed by loss of sleep, and the heavy llnm In his face bearing witness to the truth of his statement. He added: It has beer, a hard thing- for all of un. 1 wish, ? however, 'hat the people of the country should know how nobly Judge 1'iyor has acted In this matter, and how conscientiously he has done j what he ? oitSidered his duty.

"When will you make ? contestf" "t have not decided yet; and I, of course, cannot discus.; what I do not ? know myself."

He will re ? turn oti Monday and prepare for the Inaugura? tion on Tuesday of W. S. Taylor, the second' Kepubycan Governor to be elected In Kentucky. Qoehel is still here, and seems to take his defeat philosophically. He had been advised by many friends, who supported him with vigor, to let the Republicans have the office without further contest, as thf? keeping allv ? of political feeling would do Infinite harm to the business Interest? ,,f th?

Then they hastened with him to the overcoat office, where they hid him, sur? rounding and guarding the place. Rosser was intoxicated at the time. It Is said. He was walking about In the Carden telling p> <> pie be would make bets on the next race. The six day raie had ended, and the sprint races Were going on. It was about 11 o'clock, while Bister and a party of friends were in a box not far removed from the finish on the Twenty? ?eventh-St. tide of the amphitheatre, when Ros? ser walked Up to the DOS and said he was ready to bet ,"> ?? 1 that Baton would win the next race. Baton was not in the next race, and Slater said he "would take a dollar's worth of the bet." He ! put up a dollar, and Roseer also put up a. dollar. Slater would have won. Rut Just as the finish of ? the race was exciting the big throng, some one near Blai ir shouted to him: "He*? ? it ? gun. Look out!" The men had quarrelled over the bet and Clinched. Then Rosser, who had drawn a revol? ver, aimed it at Slater, who was in the box. The man it la alleged Bred point blank at Butter The bullet .struck him in the left breast Just over the heart. FELL INTO A WOMAN'S ARMS. The crowd was shouting so loudly over the ra >? that comparatively few persons heard the shut. Perhaps six or seven hundred persons In the immediate neighborhood of the shooting heard it, and they saw Slater fall backward Into the arms of a stylishly dressed young woman who sat directly behind him. His head fell In her lap, and she held him for a few minutes. But the excitement and the sight ?G the blood, together with the cries of an angry mob already rushing at RoSSer to lynch him, unnerved her ? ompletetjr, and she had to let go. Sh?? was as? sis;, td out by friends, though she almost fainted The policemen In the Carden saw the determi? nation of the crowd and they rushed up to Rosser. Several persons tried to take hold of him, but two policemen were too quick for them and they held him away, with the aid of other policemen who pushed their way through th? crowd toward the entrance. By this time everybody In the Garden knew that a man had been shot. The cheering that had interfered with th? hearing of the shot had subsided and everybody's attention was directed to the great Jam near the scene of the shooting. The policemen in a great phalanx crowded around the medical student and forced him and ti mselvea through the mob. The crowd tried to break through several tlm^s. but the easy way the police kept them off made the attempts futile. Several men carried Slater to the coatroom. He was nearly unconscious, but he motioned for paper and pendi, Which was banded to him. He then erse braced up and Roseer was shown to l.im. It is alleged that Rosser, after looking at him, laid: "I'm a medical man, and I gues^ you're a dead one " Slater looked at him and then wrote: "This man shot me." BIQNBD TOT IDENTIFICATION.

CHAMBBBLATJTl ATTITlDE TOWARD AMERICA-GOLD PROBLEMS-ART NOTEt, [BT G???.? TO TUR TIlIBfNB.] London. Dec. ?.?England has renewed her faith In Tommy Atkins as hor best general, and bears with fortitude and patience the con? tinuous strain of war with Its flurries of ex? citement and its endless exaggeration of trivial details. If a campaign entered Into without pop? ular enthusiasm and mainly with a feeling of political fatalism as a conflict forced upon her by Krilger's ultimatum and extensive military preparations be watched with something like evidences of Mreerlnesa, it i? because there is an utter la k of proportion between the minor In? cidents which nn the columns of the newe 1 aper? and the magnitude of the British arma? ments nod efforts. John Bull suffers every day from the pin pricking procesa by whl'h skir? mishes are enlarged uto battle?, and momentary Interruptions of communications exaggerated Into crises and defects In the supply depart? ment, and military preparations paraded as slims of War Office BUasoanagesaent The effect of the undue importance attached to the trivial details and of the increasing criticism of the management Of the war Is to induce Irritability and nervous? ss. it is only when Englishmen think of the splen? did hearing of the private soldier that their faces light up with a fine glow of enthusiasm. Re is the true hero Of the war In South Africa? as he was In Cuba a year ago, and tho war charities >,'o on to Kipling's refrain, "Pay, pay, psy!" There Is one unfailing source of English serenity in war time; this is the complete calm prevailing In foreign affaira Lord Salisbury haa done his work BO well that there are safeguard? against foreign Intrigue and mischief making wi-.i p Bnglan ? la empi ?? Ing an army of one hun? do 1 thousand men In A.'ru a and a ?arge portion of her naval resources. John Bull has as little liking for entangling alliances as Brother Jona? than, but he knows In his heart the efficiency of that good understanding which Lord Salis? bury has established with Germany, and when the time comes will be ready In his turn to allow the Emperor liberty to carry out any de? signs, commercial or otherwise, which he may have formed for the expansion and development of his Interests In Asia Minor. The Bagdad railway scheme continues to ex? cite resentment in Russia and enthusiasm In Germany, and Is evidently the Kaiser's favorite t for enlarging t?erman trade and Influ? ence in the Near East. Re has England's beet wishes, although there Is no entangling alliance for baiting the Russian bear The only reference whl< h Mr. Chamberlain has made to the fusillade of crltidSBS which has been directed against him from various coun? tries was the quiet remark dropped last night at Birmingham, when he was distributing the prizes of the Muni, ?pal School of Ait. 11? bad, for him. the unusual espi rlenc? of hesitating for thrt choice of a word, and with a twinkling eye covered his embarrassment by explaining aside that It was necessary for him to he exceedingly careful lest some editor should misunderstand him. Probably nobody has been more aston? i-li? d than Mr. Chamberlain himself by the criti? cism which his speech, brimming o%er with good feeling for America, has excited In America; hft is, In reality, the last man In England who wants a formal alliance with the United States, for. as Secretary of State for the Colonies he has Canada to deal with, and his. own reputa? tion to maintain as the greatest English Im? perialist. He believes heartily In the closest possible fellowship between England and Amer? ica, and takes the statesmanlike view that both nations can admit Germany into the same sphere of good feeling and co-operation in com? mercial and maritime policies. This was the idea which he clearly expressed at Leicester, and Americans have no reaeon to hold him accountable for the inadvertent use of the word "'alliance." which was Immediately translated Into "understanding based on good feeling." Mr. chamberlain is a sincere and useful friend of America: probably there Is no other leading Englishman who is equally out? spoken In praising America or is so utterly in? different to a foreign alliance In any quarter, ?o long as England can count upon American good will. His diplomacy could probably be summed up In words like these: "With Americans with us in heart, It matters not who may be with us or against us." "The Spectator" is undoubtedly right when It says thai a ipontaneous exasBpts of good feeling like that <>l the equipment of the hospital ship Main- hi worth more than? diplomatic assur? ance? or Official acts of politeness in developing sympathy between the two branches of the Anglo-Saxon stock. The subscriptions to that enterprise have now reached $150,000, owing to the energy of Lady Randolph Churchill, Mra. Ronalds, Mrs. Blow and other American women in London. Tb? Hulling of tho .Main? has been delayed by th- work of refitting her; the vessel will be opened a week from to-day for inspec? tion by the Penerei Committee, and will sail with the most complete and scientific surgical and medical equipment ever known afloat. The do? tor? and nurses from America have received. much hospitality here, and the Maine la re? garded by the Army Ifedical <'orps as a model hospital ship. English discussion of President McKinley*? Messag?? and toe American financial policy, opened by the dally press In a kindly spirit, is continued this morning by the weekly Journale, which clearly recognize the fact that the Presi? dent is bent upon working with Congress rather than against It. as was Mr. Cleveland'? failing, and also that the Republicans, with a prosper? ous country behind them, have little to fear frona a revival of the silver agitation and Bryonlsm. The strong financial position of America at a time when England and every European coun? try needs gold and cannot draw It out of the United States Is regarded by economist? and bankers as the crowning opportunity for cur? rency legislation by which official paymenta shall be made In gold only and the fact shall be legally recognized that America has a single standard. The Indian government, under less favorable conditions. Is persevering In Its policy of estab? lishing the gold standard. Rupees are needed for currency purposes, but instead of buying a fresh stock of silver and coining It the Indian government Is supplying rupees out of It? own reserves against note circulation and replacing th-m with gold This gold must be Imported from England, where there I? none to spare and where money Is In great demand. The problem of the gold standard In India could be easily
