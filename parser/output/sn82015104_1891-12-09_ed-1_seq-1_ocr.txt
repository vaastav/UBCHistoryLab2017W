When McMillin came in many members who had not been with him in the fight rushed up io shake hands and tell him he made a good stand against the inevitable. •Springer had on his coat lapel a bright scarlet pink, which had been the emblem of his campaign. Having cast his vote and influence to Crisp, he was in high favor \\ ith the victors. When the nominations for Speaker wero made this morning that of Heed was the only one greeted with applause. Jerry Simpson, acting for the Farmers' Alliance party of nine, nominated Wat son of ('eorgia, and smiles spread over the House.

During the roll-call, Mills stood back behind the rail on the Democratic side, and when his name was called vol- d with his usual depth of voice and earnestness of manner. Hoar and Williams of Massa chusetts, who were Milis' most active workers, did not vote. Tho silence of the Democratic side re mained unbroken while the tellers counted the vote—Crisp 2385, Reed 83, Watson B—but8—but when the clerk announced that Crisp was elected Speaker a wild burst of applause tilled the House. As Mills and Reed conducted the speaker to the chair all the members stood up in their places clapping their hands and cheering. i

REPUBLICAN KEXATJS CAUCUS. Action Taken Concerning tho Repre <-oiit:'.t"oa on Committees. Washington Dec. B.—The Republican THE RECORD-UNION. Senate caucus to-day appointed a com mittee to reorganize the committees. The committee assumed a task of greater magnitude than is usual in such cases. Serious inroads have been made by death, resignation and failure of re election in the ranks of the Senate as it stood at the close of the Fifty-first Con gress. In the forty-two standing and thirteen select committees there are not less than seventy-two vacancies, including six chairmanships in the list of standing committees and one in the list of select committees. The Committee on Finance retains every one of its thirteen mem bers, while Senator Sherman's Commit tee on Foreign Relations has lost five of its nine Senators. The Committees on Judiciary, Education and Labor and District of Columbia each lost three members, including the chairman. Other committees have been depleted in a like manner. When the House Committee on Elec tions is appointed, and proceeds to con sider the contested election cases which will come before it, for the first time it will have as a basis a digest of reports of testimony and legal questions relative to the elections which came before previous Congresses. This digest is Intended by ClerK Rowcll to assist the members in reaching au impartial conclusion touch ing the law ami precedent applicable to any election contest. THE 

COMING MESSAGE. Tho Chile Matter Will be One of the Principal Topics Discussed. CHICAGO, Dec. 8. — A Washington special says: The President's coming message to Congress will have one sen sational feature. The Chilean chapter will be the most vigorous utterance that has been contained in an executive mes sage for a long while. It will show that the seriousness of the situation has at no time been underestimated by the Presi dent and Secretary of state Blame. There will be no hint of recalling Min ister Egan. If anything is to be said on that point it will be more likely a word of praise than anything else. The ques tion upon which the President wants to give Congress the fullest information re lates to the attack on tiie sailors of the Baltimore and the unsatisfactory action of the Chilean Government. The differ ence between that attack and the New Orleans lynching will be fully explained. And then a hint may be given that it may yet become necessary to present our ultimatum to the Chilean Government. Every naval commandant in the United States has received instructions to tit out and put in commission all the seagoing men-of-war lying in American waters, and the result is that two powerful flee now have their bows turned toward the south. President Harrison will probably hint to Congress the steps wiiich it may be necessary for tho United States to take in order to insure reparation, tiie meaning of which will be threefold—indemnity for outrage, punishment for offenders and apologies to the flag insulted. 

HOAR'S ACTION. Why lie Declined to Vote for Crisp for Speaker on Roll-Call. WAsiiiNfiTox, Dec. B.—Sherman Hoar of Massachusetts, when asked why he did not vote for Speaker on roll-call to day said: "Last fall I stated that in the coming contest for the Speakership I would vote for no candidate who would not promise to use his influence, if elected Speaker, against the consideration of bad financial legislation and the extension of silver coinage. When Crisp became the candidate ol the party I sent to him and him to give me this promise, which he declined to do. There was then noth ing for me to do but refrain from voting for him. In my judgment, however, he will do exactly what he refused to prom ise to do, namely, use his iidluence as Speaker against the consideration of measures looking to the extension of coinage of silver. 1 feel fairly sure such will be his action, but as I could not eet | his promise he could not get my vote." TIIK DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION". An Effort Reins: Made to Have It Held In San Francisco. Washington, Dec.

He reported that a grand fruit show is to be held th« re in W92 and he suggested that here was an opportunity for California to make a display which would be of lasting value to the State. Messrs. Mills, Chipman and others spoke favorably of such an exhibition and of the movement started at the last meeting of the board to organize an asso ciation, whose object should be to open up the English market for our fruits. A letter, was read from a gentleman who desired his name to be withheld at pres ent, applying for the position of manager i of the proposed fruit headquarters in London.

MYSTERY SOLVED. Perpetrators of a Double Murder in Chicago Recently. Chicago, Dec. B.—The mystery of the murder of Mrs. Leggenhagen and son a couple of weeks ago was partly cleared ap to-day, and Herman Kraatz is under arrest, accused with being one of the per petrators of the double murder. The police and Coroner have been at variance as to whether the mother and son sui cided after slaying the other, or whether both were murdered by a thief or desper ate debtor. To-day, when the inquest was about finished. Kraatz betrayed nervousness upon betagquestioned about his financial relations with Mrs. Leggenhagen, as well as to his movements at the time of her death. The problem of the method of the murder was brought to light by the dis covery of a robbery in the room where the bodies lay. and it is believed that the mother and son were smothered to death. Kraatz is the husband of the dead woman's stepdaughter. The police are investigating the whereabouts of his two brothers. The curious fact is that Kraatz's father and uncle years ago fought each other with knives after a quarrel. The uncle killed his man, went insane, and died in an asylum. What relation, if any, Kraat-S wife has to the murder of her stepmother and brother does not appear, but it is known that tho girl had bitterly complained of the dead woman's habits. Chicago Races.

Special to the Record-Union. Santiago, Dec. B.—A communication was sent to United States Minister Egan Saturday by the President of the Cham ber of Deputies, requesting permission to serve citations on the refugees now in the ! American Legation. Mr. Egan wrote to | Minister Matta, asking him by what j authority the President of the Chamber j of Deputies sent such a communication to him. He was, he said, accredited to Chile, and did not recognize the right of the President to officially communicate with him in any way except through the Foreign Cilice. Benor Matta apologized, but made a similar request to which Mr. Egan re plied that the request was not admissible unless he received specific instructions from the United States, as the refugees were in the legation under extra-terri torial rights. i Respite the efforts of the Government it transpires that 1,000 revolvers are miss ing from the artillery barracks at Santi ago, and it is (eared that some conspiracy is on foot. Tlie soldiers here are eon lined to their barracks, the marine artil lerymen at the forts of Valparaiso have been replaced by sailors from the fleet, and such soldiers of Balmaceda as are now in prison have been placed in soli tary confinement and are not permitted to hold any communication with the out si, Ie world. The persecutions and boycott of Balma ceda's army officers may result seriously soon. They say: "We cannot let our v.ives and children starve.'" Unless the restrictions are soon removed trouble is to be feared. 

HKNLRAL VALASQUEZ SURRENDERS HIM SKLF. Valparaiso, Dec. B.—General A'ap quez. who was Minister of War under the Balmaceda regime, and who upon the fall of Valparaiso sought temporary refuge in the German Legation, left that asylum some time ago and has since been in hiding. He surrendered himself to the military tribunal to-day, after having re ceived guarantees from Intendente Lira of Santiago that he would be dealt with fairly. It transpires that British Minister Ken nedy was not aware of the shipment of silver by Balmaceda on board the British vessel Espeizle after she had sailed from Talcahuano. ELerr Gatschmidt, the German Minis ter, it would seem, had entered into an intrigue with Thomson, correspondent of the London Times, whereby the latter was to use his paper a^ B CSttpsw to stir up ill-feeling through misrepresentations of the United States and its representa tives here. TnE WORLD'S FAIR. Views of French Exporters Concern ing: Their Participation. Paris, Bee. B.—An Associated Press correspondent has been making in quiries among a number of exporters concerning their participation, in tho Chicago World's Fair. Ernest Tourdclet, member of the Paris Chamber of Commerce, said though the McKinley bill discouraged them greatly, they could not abdicate from their hold on the American markets, and that the leading French exporters would make every effort to present excellent exhibits. A prominent Marseilles wool exporter, M. Hanerwein, said the principal manu facturers there did not yet show much interest in the undertaking, but this feel ing may change. Another Marseilles exporter said their Chamber Of Commerce had been re quested by the French Government to endeavor to attract exhibitors, and has done so, but up to the present no demand for space has been requested. This probably might change. A firm ot Lyons silk exporters said there was very little enthusiasm there, but some manufacturers have signified their intention of participating. The slowness is attributed to the effects of the American tariff. A firm of upholstery manufacturers of Roubaif said the tariff so interrupted their trade that there was no encourage ment to undergo the expense necessary to prepare an exhibit. They are con vinced, they said, that the manufacturers of North Prance wiil generally abstain from exhibiting. Similar expressions as to lack of ad vantage to French manufacturers and merchants in making exhibits at the Chi cago exposition were made by many other exporters and manufacturers. THE 

FRKNCH NAVY. Unabated Activity In the Building: of Warships. Paris, Dec. B.—ln a debate on the naval estimates in the Deputies to-day, Barbey, Minister of Marine, said tbe building of ships for the navy continued with una bated activity, and within ten years eighty-one ships would be built, includ ing six ironelaids and fifty swift cruisers. Next year the navy would have over 200 torpedo boats. France, he said, was the only nation that had solved the problem of submarine navigation, and wouhl soon possess a submarine navy that would give results as yet unaUained. New quick-firing guns, with effectiveness su perior to anything ever before achieved, have also been added to the armaments of the republic. In view of the extent of preparations and readiness for war, France ought to feel secure, he said. The speech was received with enthusiastic ap plause. Maybrick Insurance Case. London, Dec. B.—The Court of Appeals has decided in the Maybrick case that the insurance company must pay the amount of insurance to the executors of Mr. May brick. holding that the policy was only payable to them and not to the wife as assignee. Mrs. Maybrick is now* serving a life sentence for the murder of her hus band, so the money will be paid to the executors of the deceased, who must first pay the creditors of the estate and then devote the remainder to the children of tlie deceased. The wife as assignee, owing to her crime, could receive nothing. Switzerland's President Resigns. Bkrnk, Dee. B.—Dr. Welti, President of Switzerland, has resigned, owing to the plebiscite taken a few days ago, which re sulted in a majority of the electors voting against the Government's purchase of the .Swiss Central Railway Department. Dr. Welti also resigned his member ship in the Federal Council, of which j body he was President. When the other members of the Federal Council learned of his action, they unanimously asked him to reconsider it. Gloomy Outlook in Russia. Warsaw, Dec. 8. —It is learned on good authority that the failure of crops is not universal. In Caucasus the harvest is so abundant that grain is rotting at the sta tions for want of rolling stock to carry it away. There is much reason to suppose that there will be a famine next year also. Autumn wheat is seriously injured by rain, and very probably the spriug crops in many Eastern Governments will turn out no better than this year, indeed, the outlook in Russia is very gloomy, aiul everyone is preparing for a*sad winter. Situation ln Rfo Janeiro Critical. Rio Janeiro, Dec. B.—The situation in the State of Rio Janeiro is becoming criti cal. The opposing forces are arming themselves. Governor Partello holds Nictheroy. The insurgents have estab lished a provisional government and selected Parahoa as the capital. They are organizing for an attack on Nictheroy. The Government is apathetic. Tragedy In a French Consulate. Madrid, Dec. B.—A dispatch from San Sebastian, an important port in the pro vince of Guicuzcoa on the Bay of Biscay,, says the Chief Chancellery of the De partment of the French Consulate there shot and killed the French Consul, De St. Sauveur. He then shot himself to death. No reason is given for the double crime. British Bark Stranded. Liverpool, Dee.

BARNABY MURDER. Outline of the Prosecution Explained by tho District Attorney. Denver, Dec. B.—The trial of Dr. Graves, charged with the murder of Mrs. Barnaby, was resumed to-day. District Attorney Stevens made the opening ad dress. He gave a graphic account of Mrs. Barnaby's life from the time of her marriage, her friendship for Graves, the final misunderstanding, her unfortunate trip West and her death in this city. He then proceeded to show the jury upon what facts and circumstances he relied for tlie conviction of tho defendant. He said: "it is a fact which we will establish to your satisfaction that at the time Mrs. Barnaby reached Deuver on this last fatal trip it was her intention to take from Dr. Graves all the property and money in his control and invest it in business in this city, and that she was seriously thinking of changing her will and cutting off Graves, who was a bene ficiary to the extent of §_5,h00, and also drawing an annual salary from her of _v"»,<X)O. We are prepared: to prove the package, containing the fatal bottle, mailed in Boston, was stamped with stamps purchased in Providence, and it is evident this was done for the purpose of misleading the recipient. The ad dress and inscription on the package were in a disguised handwriting, which, we are satisfied, we will be able to prove to you is the handwriting of Graves." Stevens concluded: "We will show you, gentlemen, that Graves Is the only person iv the world who could have any motive for the destruction of this lady. We will show by circumstantial evidence that this bottle of Fowler's solution was prepared and mailed by the defendant. We propose that this prosecution shall stand upon its merits, without regard to what the defense has interposed." *. CRISP'S ELECTION. Editorial Comment by the Press of New Tor—. New York, Dec. B.—The editorial com ments of the morning papers in this city upon tho Speakership result are as fol lows : •The Herald says: It is all right. The object of the contestants has not been to elect a fitting and well-equipped Ciiair m;m simply, but to push the claims of Cleveland or Hill in the coming Presi dential campaign. The World says: The choice is signifi cant of the dpminence of b prudent spirit in the great Democratic majority. The Times: The election of Crisp by the coalition and demagogy of Hill, the spoilsmongering of Tammany, the pro tectionism of < 'orman and Brice, the half corrupt, hall fanatical free-silver move ment and the old South, must inevitably give pause to men who believed the Dem ocratic party to be the fit instrumentality for the accomplishment of tariff reform and for a clean and honest administration of the Government. The Trihur.e: The two wings of the Democratic party have been fighting each other with all the intensity of men who have rooted convictions, and whose con victions are, moreover, supplemented by personal interests of the gravest na ture. If the Western and Southern pol icy should bo adopted, Cleveland would have to stand aside for somebody else. No wonder there is intense feeling, and the result of the decision which the caucus finally has reached cannot yet be defi nitely anticipated, The Sum This result is a triumph for the conservative forces in the Democratic ranks, and a kick at the Mugwumps. It makes brighter the prospect for electing a Democratic President. — -o Wisconsin Town in Flames. St. Paul, Dec. B.—New Richland. Wis., i.s on fire, and help has been called for ! from St. Paul.
