Members and Senators who reside near Washington and have to bear the bur den of numerous attentions to visitors from home get less than their more favored brethren who reside farther away Their mileage of 20 cents a mil or 10 cents a mile going and coming amounts to but little It would hardly buy a good dinner at the swell restau rants where an expenditure of J20 a throw Is regarded as moderate On the other hand those who live farther away get more In mileage The Dele- sate from Hawaii Prince Jonah Kuhlo Kalanlanaole has a splendid mileage of about 1200 a year sufllclent to pay his hotel bills If he lives modestly But the visitors who come here from Ha waii are few and It Is rare that he has to entertain anyone from home The Fan Stringency The cutting off of railroad passes has aggravated the situation to a degree Now no Senators or Members unless they happen to be railroad officials can ride to Washington and back again free For some of them the railroad bills are not very large but for the Middle Western Members who f course want to bring their families to Washington in the Whiter It is a blaj Item For the Pacific Coast and Rocky Mountain State lawmakers it Is a very large item so large as a matter of fact that many of them are not bring ing their families hereat all this year They will do o at the next long session but not this Winter when they are to remain in Washington only three months While it 13 unlikely that Congres will enact a new salary grab It Is likely that some way will be found Indirectly to Increase the compensation It looks now as though the clerks to Congresd men will be paid hereafter 1500 a year instead of 1200 a year This looks philanthropic on the face but two thirds of the members pay but little for their clerical help -Those repre senting constltuenclesthat ask but few things from Washington the encles outside the cities and in the Ions settled portions of the country often liave some member of the family as secretary and the nav of 1100 a month Ihe year round now to be increased to 5125 represents about so much clean Velvet The extra J300 will about pay - for the railroad fare that was cut oft by the railroad rate regulation law As Congress has been Increasing many other salaries In recent years It Ss little wonder that many of its Mem bers want their own salaries increased The pay of Federal Judges has been Increased all along the line The salary n of an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the united States has been In i creased from 10000 a year to 12500 Circuit Court Judges are now getting 5T000 where until three years ago they were getting 6000 and so on The pay of various officials In the lar possessions Is quite twice as much as Is paid similar officials under the ad- ministration on the mainland Tho Philippine Commissioners for example receive 15000 a year for work that pays no more than 5000 here In Washington There has been no great -outcry against the Insular salaries be cause It is claimed that the large pay Isnecessary to remove temptations from these officials far away from home It Is the policy the British Government follows In its colonial possessions Other Want Increased Pay There are thousands and thousands of Government clerks groaning under the Increased burdens of living who would like their pay augmented Noth ing has yet been done nor is It likely to be done for their relief Ski mem bers of the Cabinet would liko more than 8000 a year Without doubt they ought to have more than thit It has become axiomatic that 8000 a year la hardly more than sufllclent to pay the house rent of a Cabinet officer living In Washington There has also been considerable agitation for Increasing the pay of the President from 50000 a year to 100000 a year gress last year did something In that direction when it voted the President 25000 a year for traveling expenses However the President Is now paying his railroad fare where until a few months ago he and his party always traveled deadhead whether they traveled In a special car or by 6peclal train Presi dent Roosevelts salary cannot now be Increased and neither can the Presi dential salary be Increased till after March 4 1909 because there Is a pro vision in the Constitution against It Mr Roosevelt Is known to have de sired that the last Congress increase his salary Had It done so he could have accepted the Increase for what ha calls his second term The constitu tional prohibition against any official authorizing an increase of his compen sation during his term of office would not have applied Of course the Presi dent did not llko to appear directly In the matter and the bill by which the raise was to have been effected was Introduced by a Virginia Democrat In the House Speaker Cannon did not like It because he was not consulted about the increase and therefore he would not allow the bill to be taken up till It was too late to do anything at the last session of the last Congress But there Is undoubtedly a sentiment in Congress friendly to an increased com pensation for the President and in dui season the salary will be raised from - 50000 to 75000 or perhaps to 100- O00 The whole Question of official salaries has been much agitated in Congress for the last three years ever since prices for the necessaries of life began to soar Scores of bills have been Intro duced to bring about a change but have received scant attention in Con gress because of fears they would be misinterpreted In the rural districts The most popular suggestion that has been made on the subject is to pay Congressmen 7500 fiat without any perquisites As it goes now the aver age pay of a Senator or a Member Is about 6000 a year There Is an extra compensation of about 1000 In tho various perquisites Fight With Gonptn - The rapidity with which Mr Gompers has been recognized in the House of Representatives has been one of the features of the session Speaker Can non was eager to join issue with him In the belief that he could put Mr Gompers out of business by defeating some of the labor measures with which Mr Gompers has been identified or which Mr Gompers has been fighting The Speaker was encouraged In this attitude by the recommendations the President made in his Annual Message with reference to labor legislation These recommendations agreed in the main with what Mr Cannon stood for and with the President at his back tho Speaker thought he was strong enough to put anything anccting iator tnru He realized his mistake the third day of the session when he threw into the House a bill to abolish compulsory pi lotage in ports of tho Southern States Representative Llttlefleld of Maine whom organized labor recognizes as its arch foe had introduced the bill at the last session of Congress and fought it thru the Committee on Merchant Ma rine where President Gompers of ths Federation of Labor contested every Inch of the ground There was a lively session of the House for nearly five hours during which the bill was under consideration and the session closed by a stunning defeat for the Speaker and for Mr Tlttlefield There were some othei causes but the labor men nevertheless herald the victory as one ior mem selves and instead of scurrying away from the Capitol as the Speaker and Ma lieutenants hoped the lanor agita tors would do the latter are now walk- fnir about very confidently ae Clare they arc stronger than ever and that the Speaker better not flaunt his defiance in their faces The Speaker Is naturally much provoked and Is watch ing for an opportunity to get a strangle on the iresiaent oi me roaeni Bold tO get IU behind Mr was evident when ho had the pilotage bill up They said to themselves that Mr Littlcflcld was personally identified with It He had bandied cuffs and blows with Mr Gom pers about it in the room of the Com mittee on Merchant Marine and Fish cries Ke and Mr Gompers had ex changed the fiercest kind of compli ments about It on the stump in the Sec ond Maine District A vote for the pilotage Wit was therefore a vote In dorsing Mr Llttlefleld and disapprov ing of Mr Gompers If they could have voted for Mr LltUefield without having their votes recorded they would hare given him a rousing majority but the Democrats would not permit that The ntlotasre bill is over 20 years old There was fierce fighting over It in the 51st Congress 16 years ago when Kecu was In the Speakers chair It had been before Congress prior to that and has been agitated before every Congress since And yet the pilotage bill Is meaningless to many sections of the country where It Is not known that It simply provides that sailing vessels go ing into Southern ports shall ne rxee to take on pilots or not according to their need and shall not be compelled to pay for pilots who now simply come aboard in nine cases out of 10 without tendering any service whatever Presi dent Gompers took up for the Southern allots chiefly because they had formnd an organization and Joined his Federa tion But Mr Llttlefleld and Mr Gompers are likely to meet again on this same issue for the friends of the pilotage bill after fighting for it 20 years are not going to surrender because of a defeat at the hands of Members who are afraid of organized labor They are already drawing a new measure and it will provide for the abolition of all pilotage fees on foreign as well as coastwise vessels It wouia rtcpnve tne Government of about 300000 collected from foreign vessels at Boston and of about 1000000 collected on toreign vessels at the port of -New York but It is argued that these taxes are really burdens upon the port and1 that then will- be plenty of support for tneir re Deal Of course Mr Gompers will be ready and smiling when the Merchant Marine Committee undertakes to consider such a bill and Mr Llttlefleld will be sitting at the long table ready to have anotner try with his foe THE 

JAPANESE TROUBLE The Thing Agitates Congress Regulation of Immigration by Ihe Japanese Gov ernmentLikelihood of a Temporary Settlement The little Jap continues to agitate Congress sharing attention In the leg islative halls with the negro soldiers once of Brownsville There is to be a Senatorial- debate- on- constitutional privileges which it is alleged the Presi dent encroached upon in his now fam ous threat to use the civil and military forces to prevent Injustice to the Jap anese In -California In the meantime the President Is going right ahead with his plans for handling the question TheCalifornlans continue to fume and fret the members of the California delegation In Congress continue to give out interviews but they are fully aware that the President will do all he can The story of a new treaty was put forth with much eclat The Calif or- nians to encourage the story Some believe they originated the story which gained such headway In some newspapers without means of obtaining inside information here that it led to an authoritative and explicit denial from -the White House The framing of a new treaty is out of the question Japan would not think of it and the matter It Is understood has never been suggested during the con ferences and negotiations over the San Francisco embrogllo It is expected that Japan will of her own motion restrict tho emigration of her coolies to the United States Just as she did for a time three or four years ago This teems to have been overlooked entirely In Washington although It s well remembered in Hawaii where the ebb and flow of the Japanese migra tions are watched in detail The Jnpnneae Itegulntr emigration It was this very agitation in Califor nia and Pacific Coast States said a prominent resident of Honolulu here today that led to the Imposition of restrictions on emigration by the Jap anese authorities We noticed It then because the restriction shut oft the supply of labor for the plantations and made It necessary for us to secure Por tuguese laborers They claim to have a constitutional form of Government over there with a legislative branch but It Is nevertheless a fact that the Japanese authorities can control tho movement of these laborers when they wish to do so People of Hawaii re member well how the number of Jap anese passengers on the steamers from the Orient was suddenly cut off and then how the number was gradually Increased months after the agitation in California had died away First they began to come by fifties on the big steamers Then each boat would bring 100 then 250 and so on till tho restrictions at Tokyo seemed to have been removed altogether The President and Secretary Root undoubtedly have assurance that Home- thlng very like this is to be repeated for the purpose of quieting the agita tion on the Pacific Coast It Is gen erally recognized here that that agita tion Is much deeper than appears on the surface even and that the problem Is a much graver one than provldln school facilities for the 80 Japanese children of school age in San Fran cisco A temporary solution of the Paclflo Coast troubles will apparently be found In these prospective restrictions altho tho Japanese Government Is not likely to act precipitately Public sentiment in Japan Is su aggressive that the Mln letry Is not likely to do anything which could now be interpreted as an Inten tion to accede to the demands of tho United States It is a pretty safe pre diction however that the steeragu quarters of the Pacific liners running from Japan to San Francisco and Scut tle will soon cease to be crowded with Japanese laborers The supply from Hawaii may continue for a while be cause of the large number of Japanese in Hawaii But the migration will grad ually dwindle All this will happen unless something happens in this coun try to inflame the Japanese people The program will surely not be announced from the White House or from the State Department but will be executed none the les steadily Only a Temporary Expedient There will probably be further trou ble because this is regarded as only i temporary expedient The protest of Callfornians and the exciting Incidents of the last two months with reference to the Japanese may be effective for a year or for two years No one can forecast how long or how short a time It will be before the migration Is re sumed Probably the Administration will try to defer it till after the next Presidential election lest tho wrath of the Callfornians turns that State over to the Democratic columns as polltl clans In Washington say would have happened last November had the knowledge of President Roosevelts Message prevailed up and down the big Pacific Coast State Possibly most of the Callfornians In Congress will not be as troubled If assured that the agi tation for exclusion will not flame forth again until after President Roosevelts successor Is chosen Their own tenure for another two years would not likely be affected providing of course they can command a renominauoa THE

Tribune has often remarked thcro seems to be all over the world a disposition to lcturn to the waterways as an accessory to the means of Internal transportation The Congress for the improvement of navi gable waterways which has been in session at Kansas City Mo is a strong indication of the way the feeling Is spreading in tho United States At that Congress Representative Ransdell made a speech which raises a banner to lead future progress His text was Make the Mississippi 16 feet deep from the Lakes to the Gulf Mnke the Missouri eight feet deep from Omaha to St Louis and five feet deep from Omaha to Fort Benton This will undoubted ly be taken up all over the West and it finds Its counterpart in the East In various plans for Improving the old canals and river channels and develop ing new ones With the development of the gas producer engine transporta tlon can be made so cheap upon the intornal waterways as to very sensibly affect freight rates on the railroads The expenditure of 101000000 by Nov- York for the deepening and widening of tho Erie Canal will sve an impetus la every State and will be -followed everywhere by a much more general use of water as a mea s of carrying freight to market The improvements on the Mississippi River have gone a long ways toward making that stream a safe and reliable highway for steam boats and a little more expenditure will restore much of its importance as a commercial highway for the products of the interior of the country the wonn AuteiaV There has been so much carelessness In the use of the word artesian that the Geological Survey has decided upon a definition Hereafter artesian will be applied to water which rises in any well or at any opening In obedience to the hydrostatic principle of water seek ing it3 level and

else where being higher Alabama at least is beginning to talk about something else than the eternal nigger The State is bigger than Pennsylvania with quite as much nat ural riches and encouraged by their remarkable success in making iron Alabamaians are beginning to talk about being the greatest manufacturers of textites from the proximity of cotton and the abundance of water power The Geological Survey has again cast up the area of tho United States ano finds some differences from the pre viously made estimates It now states that the area of the United States prop er Is 3026780

DIPLOMATIC KETTLE OF WRATH Continual from pafa on cither you or Mr Choate or Mr Porte for the purpose of giving Mr Storer either a Cabinet position or the Em bassy in England or Franco As Mr Storer In his pamphlet quotes a letter or Nov 2 irom me marked per sonal in which I told his wito that he should bo made Special Embassador at the marriage of the King of Spain al leging that this was a fresh mark of my approval of his conduct I may mention that the letter containing this statement on my part was In answer to one from Mrs Storer In which she begged for th appointment of her husband her letter running- in part as follows Please please send us to Madrid as special en voys to the wedding It would be very appropriate and I would love It Jt Is hard to ilnd the exact word In which to criticize Mr Storers effort to twist tho meaning of my granting such a request couched In such a style The President then declares that the statement that he sent any word of any kind to the Pope about anybody Is un true And my goodness but he does skin the two of them alive when he refers to the fact that while they weiv guests in Ids house the two of them conspiring together made memoranda of conversations with the President and Inter us il lr Till the President do diOiKiorable and nftrrwaid states that it was untrue be sides Wouldnt Stop the Mlaslc nnrlen On May 6 1900 tho President wrote a letter to Mrs Storer which lie him self quotes having kept a copy It be gins iMy Dear Mrs Storer Your letter of the 4th has just come to hand also that of the Cth I am very very fond ot you and that Is thi reason your letters put me in a iuan dary You want me to do all klndsof things that I cannot possibly do arid that I ought not to do and you say things which I do not want to contra dict and yet It makes me feel hypo critical If I seem to acquiesce In them And then he flatly refused lo do what she asked which was to stop Protestant missionaries from going into the Phil ippine Islands to work As you know I always treat Catho lic and Protestant exactly alike as 1 do Jew or Gentile as T do the man oi native American Gorman Irish or any other kind of parentage Any discrim ination for or against a man because of his creed or nativity strikes me a an infamy The IreslilentK Sumnilnc Up The President gives space to the same letters that Storer did but ho prints all of the letters and Storer didnt and it makes a difference It does Indeed and In the Presidents favor And the Pres ilont also make public a letter from Storer in which that gentleman abject ly bgs pardon for the things he had aaid ard done at a time when every body that had the Presidents confidence told him that Storer o ight to be fired at that time In 1304 but the Presi dent In his magnanimity permitted Storer to remain and assured him that lie believed that the things Storer had done were not Intentionully done and declared his confidence in tho man who even then It would seem was plotting to use the President to further thj schemes of himself and wifij The President sums up the whole dis graceful business In the following There could be no fuller confession of wrongdoing or more absolute throw ing hims elf upon the mercy of his su perior It was this letter which I an swered salng as he lias himself quot ed that I would treat the Incident as closed and would not accept his resig nation and that I was sure that John Hay felt as I did With peculiar per fidy Mr Storer now seeks to turn thi act o cordial and I think I may add generous friendship on my part into an attack upon me by treating my refusal to accept his resignation as an indorse ment of his position in the matter ot the Vatican to which there was abso lutely no allusion whatever of any kind or sort In his letter of resignation This bare recital of facts Is In itself the se verest possible condemnation of tr Storer disingenuousness IllHS
