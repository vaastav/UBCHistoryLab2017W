Tho plan i to clear one of the "Western Cniun wires and attach one end to the mo Uo power maeliinerv in tho exposition building and the other end to be connected with tho white hou-e, and at a lived moment everything will be in leadlncv- at New Or leans. The president surrounded by his cabinet, members of o digress, judges, and smcnimi'iit ollicial and foreign reprcenUi tives will pre tho button in the executive malison and simultaniously et tho vast machinery of tho exposition in motion. The president agreed to take this proposition un der consideration. The members of tho house have been formally invited to attend theopening of tho oxpo-ition in a bodv. Tho confirmation of ilcCulloch to be secretary was taken up in executive session and Senator lliddlebergcr inade a continued speech at sumo length opposing the confirm ation. He again culled tor the reading of tome of iIcCul!ocy' annual report-, where upon the senulo adjourned, first, hoivci er, postponing tiny further consideration ol Secretary .McCulloch'snomin ition until next Tuesday The national association of health board' met hero to-day in accordance, with a call which set forth" the danger to tlu3 country from cholera nnd the importance of adopt ing the nco-vsrv precuitions. J'rasius llrooks, of New Vork, called the convention ty order and delivered an addrc- in which he summarized the fact known about chol era, il character and method-, its p.-opiga-lion and spread. Delegates were ptccnt from ('auada and tho following s.ates: Louisiana, Indiana, Illinois, Georgia, Con necticut, Kentucky, .Michigan, Act Vii ginia, Wisconsin, Texas tissouri, I'cnnsyl vania, Ohio, 2'orth Carolina, Notili York. New .lersoy, New llampshiie. Maryland, .MaBsiiclmsctts, i?outh Carolina, Tciinpiee and Jlinnesola. Standing committees were appointed. A liumber of papers were re ported and rcfernd to the appropriate com mittees. Tho Nicaraugian eanaltreaty nnd Spanish reciprocity treaties were sent bv the pie-t-dcut to the senate to-day. Treaties with Hawaii and San Domingo have been signed, and terms withGautnniala and S.in S.-ihador have substauii.illy been agixi'd upon, and good progress has" been made upon that of the Tinted States and Columbia. 'J'he niii tication of these treaties will probably lead to thu negotiation of treaties with other American powers ami colonic. Indeed, a movement is already noted in the Hnlish West Indies to secure a reciprocity ttsitv with tho Tinted Slate. With the inception of the Nicaraugian treaty, which relates to the iutcr-occanic cinal, all are commercial treaties, and though differing considerably in detail they are all modeled upon the reci procity treaty with Mexico. Tho injunction of secrecv has formally been removed from the Sp.nfsh treatv, the text having already 1 bi-eu published, and it U not unlikely the pre 'ixieni win oe lonoweii 111 ivpeci im mo remainder of the series.

At a meeting of the house committee on coinage, weights ana measures io-aay, Jir. I Jiuekner gave his reasons for introducing a j bill to stop the coinage of silver. Uhairman jiiana was auseni, ueing ueuun tA t lmino in "Missouri br the. dangerous illness of his daughter. " I 3Ir. Buckner said: "The introduction of the bill was not a matter of sudden impulse. I talked with friends during the first session of congress about tho propriety of intro ducing iL They said something ought to be done. The present administration, if not hostile, is careless about the silver. There seems to be no hope of its doing anything. The new administration may take si more earnest interest. It is evident the time has come when this government ought to act decisively, a'ld tho question to decide is, whether wc are to "have bi-metalism or inono-metalism. Foreign countries have taken up tho question. Holland has a large portion of the silver, and it has gone into the market for gold. Italy requires her banks to keep two-thirds they receive in gold. We are interested in silver as a product. "We are still more in-tere-ted in having bi-mclalisui, whichvvas established by our forefathers. This bill is in the interest of bi-metalism. I believe that four-fifths of the pcoplo of tho United States want bi-metalism, and the only differ ence between us is as to the means to bring it about. There are only a few who nre mono-metahsts. Hy tho time this bill might pass wo will have $200,000,000 in silver under the terms of the Bland bill, coining 2,000,000 n month. One object of the Bland bill was to keep up the market value of silver. In Kngland a strong party of able men said bi-niLtalism must be established among all commercial nations or bad results will follow. "We ought to regard the opinions of men with us on this ques tion. You have the economic phenomenon of the fall and decline of all commodities, without exception. Some say this is created by over pi olfaction in our protective country, but it exists in free trade countries also. 1'rices aro declining because of tho new demand for gold and the diminished production and the increased use of this metal and manufactures, and I have but little doubt that this reliance on gold as a measure of values i 0110 of I110 potent causes of the decline in the vaiuc of Amci can commodities, and will continue to bo so long as gold is the sole standard of valuo of the great commercial counties of the world "We will have to go to mono-nietaj-Isiii in silver or gold, unless something is done to bring Kurope to realize the danger of reiving on that metal. If KngUind does nothing we mav have to relyon free-coinage and have silver mono-mctalism. Men in terested in the silver mines demand that wc have free coinage. It is between that and the coinage of gold alone. I believe it is bitter to jiave tree coinage. "What will be the effect of the passage of your bill? asked n member of the com mittee. It's immediate effect will cause some de cline in the relative price of Eilvcr. This will bo only temporary. If we can succeed in urging the nations of Kurope to join with us in Using both metals in Imde, and in Kngland, with its silver using colonies, it may produce sucli an embarassment as will induce her to increase her coinage ol silver, and other Kuropean nations will follow her example. Kepri'scntalive l'otter was also present, and coincided with tho ideas advanced by .Mr. Buckner. Mr. l'otter said ho was strong ly in favor of bi-metalism. The committeo will meet Monday to con sider the bill. Forty-Eighth Conftross. 

SKNATK. The chair laid before the senate an invita tion to that body from the commissioner of the New Orleans exposition to participate in the opening of the exposition on tho ICth iu-t. The communication was laid on the table, that being the usual formal disposition of such documents. Mr. Vest on behalf of the committee on commerce requested that the committee bo discharged from a consideration of tho inter-oceanic ship railway bill. Mr. Vest stated that hu had received a letter from Captain Kails saying that certain changes had been made in the concession from Mex ico, which made it necessary to withdraw the bill. The committeo was accordingly dis charged from a consideration of the bill, which was ordered to be withdrawn from tho files in the senate. Tile senate passed a bill nutlmrizinc the Commercial National bank, of Chicago, to merea-e its capital stock to $2,000,000. .Mr. McMillan introduced a bill increasing tho appropriation for the erection of a public building at Minneapolis to SoOO.000. The senate then took up tho Oregon Cen tral land forfeiture bill. Mr. Ve-t. addressed the senate, in opposi tion to the admission of Dakota. There was nothing partisan, he said, in 111 opposi tion. He did not pretend to be free Irom partisanship. He was devoted to tho princi ples of tho Democratic party, but lie was liere to discuss the question entirely on its merits. Very few territories, however, had been admitted to the union without party struggle and debate. Territories thcmsolvc. had alvvavs felt tho influence of the party domiiiatit'iu the nation. When national ad ministration was Democratic tho territories were Democratic. "When ltepublican, terri tories were ltepublican. Addressing himself to the merits of the question, Mr. Vest said the constitution had placed no limitation on tlio power of congress to admit new states. The action of congress as to tho admission of states in the pa-t was no criterion for the pro-cut. The men who framed our constitution had never dreamed of any period short of centurio would sec the A111ericr.11 wilderness penetrated by civ ilization. There was no need to-day for tho admission of new states in order to strengthen tho union and thero was no need to rush this territory into tho condition of a state. The population was not enough to entitle it to a representative in congressand it would to n certain extent bo disfranchizing the states already in tho union to givo tho prc-ent population of Dakota two repre sentatives in the I'nited States senate as well as representatives in the lower houe of con gress. The demand i said to have been made since 1S70 for admission of the terri tory. They had been the demands of ambi tious politicians. Men who were ready to cut each other's throats politically and physically had been urging these demands. Gen. Grant had been credited, Mr. Vest said, with the statement while president, that Dakota gave him more trouble than all the other territories put together; that tho trouble there was that thero were two streets in Yankton, and when one street did any thing or got tin thing done the other street rebelled, and it would requira almost all the civil and military power of the United Suites to keep the peace lietwi-en the faclion-. Mr. Vc-t sent to tho de-k and the secretary read a number of pe- titions itions opposing the admission of the terri orv. nnd nscribinfr tho desire for the admis- tory.

WICHITA, KANSAS. THURSDAY MORNING, DECEMBER U, GENERAL NEWS. THE BLAINE-CONKLING TROUBLE. General Sherman's Reply to Reporter About the Davis Matter. Seven Pullman Cars Filled With cursionists start from To peka for California. Ez- Other General News Items Gathered from off the Telegraph Wires. Blalne-Conkling Trouble. New Yokk, Dec, 10. A "Washington. special relates an interview with Mr. Blaine, by a gentleman who holds a high position at the capital, a staunch ltepublican and a warm admirer of the defeated candidate. Mr. Blaine confessed frankly, that his defeat was Mr. Conkling's victory, and gave the following narrative: "The coolness" Mr. Blaine said, "between Conkling and myself, is of longstanding, dating back to the timo we both were in tho houseof representatives. He has opposed iny political advancement ever since that time. Of course 1 retaliated but more in a defensive way than oth wise, until Mr. Conkling assumed an antagonistic attitude toward tho late President Garfield, when I took the offensive and opposed 3Ir. Conkling's return to the senate after he had resigned his scat therein. It is a mistake to say that Mr. Garfield op posed Mr. Conkling's return. He was en tirely careless concerning the matter. Ho said he cared nothing for annoyance that gentleman might attempt against the admin istration. The fact is that Mr. Garfield in tended that his administration should be such as to merit tho approval of tho coun try, and he did not believe that Conkling or any other ono man could successfully op pose il; but 1 could not bring myself to look upon it in that light, and 1 brought to bear what opposition I could to Mr. Conkling's; return to tho senate. As he had opposed my political advancement I had a perfect right to retal iate in kind. lie was defeated, .and thus matters stood until the approach of the na tional convention, when I was put in the field for tho nomination by my friends. I had doubts as to the propriety of my taking the position with so powerful an opponent at large, but I was assured that Mr. Conk ling had turned his back on politic, and that he would take no part in tho canvass for cither the nomination or tho election. In addition to this I was visited by committees and wiittcn to from all sections of the country urging me to consent to the tuo of mv name before the convention. I finally yielded and still the assurances came. Mean while I liau laKcn ino pains to icani me icei ings of Mr. Conkling. "At first," continued Mr. Blaine, "he was quite reticent, simply saying that ho wai at present devoted to his profession and was out of politics. Later on he expressed utter indifference as to the nomination, with the exception of saying that he hoped the con vention would nominate a man. This was interpreted as meaning that he would rather see me nominated than Presi dent Arthur. I confess that my native van ity was touched by this explanation and I felt some relief. The convention met and 1 was nominated. The campaign opened. The October result in Ohio elated us all. Still I had misgivings concerning New York. I went to Ohio and the west it i- true, but those who thought or still think I under-estimated the importance of New York are much mistaken. I was extremely de sirous of visiting New York state and so informed the national com mittee. Just then the iiniinouticcinent was made that Mr. Conkling would speak I was in Indiana when this announcement was made and you will recollect it was said I was broken down, was sick, or was becom ing unmanageable. Thc-e reports were not exactly true! but I will confess that the re port concerning Mr. Conkling broke me up considerably. The fir-t report concerning him did not state on which side he would speak, but I felt assured it would not be in behalf of mv election. 1 was bound east ward, but I halted to learn definitely what were Mr. Conkling's intention?. I was in formed that ho was willing to enter into a compact with me, tho Mib.-taneo of which was that I should stay out of New York state. If 1 would agree to that he said he would make no speeches, but if 1 went on tho stump in that state he would follow me and do all he could to defeat me. Ho said there was vet an unsettled nuestion between himself and me as to who was held in the highest osteem bv the Ucpublican party of tho state of New Vork. He was willing, he said, lo submit the question io the people now with out argument, but if I wanted to argue it he would willingly meet me. I was willing to argue the question, but agteed to abide tho decision of mv friends. After consulL-ition, it was decided to do nothing which would brine a new issue into tho campaign, and one which could not be dignified into any thing of greater magnitude than a personal family quarrel. This contented Mr. Conk ling and ho remained out of politics govern ed" by the necessity which compelled him "to devote himself to hi pro fession. The question went to the ltepub licans of New Vork state, as .Ml. Conkling wanted it to go, and he won the victory, and now I must frankly say." said Mr. lilaine, with animation, "Mr. t'onkling has had his revenge. I don't sav 1 kept him out of the senate, but I certainly did nil I could do to prevent his return and he has prevented my election to the presidency. I am gV.d I did not go into New York. "With .Mr. Conkling following me and with such n fire in the rear as ho was capable of delivering, the result I think could not have been otherwise tnan it has and wo have both been spared the cor templation of what wo would have -aid. I am content my election was not to be. L'ndcr the circumstances I came very near carrying cw iorK stale, nut i might ut as well have lot by 100,000. I feel sat- lsueu umi an tis uoiii- ma. twiuu uv uun.-, onlv-Mr. Conklin- could have iven lbe slstn tn mn and he would noL 1'erhar.s 1 could have secured his return to the senate, Imt I wnul.l not? but hu 1ms beaten me three time to mv once beatimr him. Honrevented , . .- my nomination in 1S70 and lSfO, and defeat- cd my election in 1S8J." Mr. Blaine evinced no particle of feeling during the entire relation. His demeanor was even more tnan usually iranw. ana inauer of fact. Striko Ended OiUMncs O- Dec. 10.
