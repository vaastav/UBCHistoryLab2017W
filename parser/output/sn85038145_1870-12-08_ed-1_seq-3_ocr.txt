The gentleman whose horse was taken near Petersburg, suspicioned this negro of both offenses, and unon information he was arrested bv the Marshal of Uillsboto and brought here Since his arrest he has oonfessed the whole matter. Three bovs. one named Belt and the othertwo named Juhnson, aged respective ly about 14, 16 and 18 yenrs, were arrested on Monday, lor robbing the money drawer of Vau Deman b Co's. dry goods store of about $62. . One of the Johnson boys had been noticed hanging around the store a good deal during the day, and was sus pected of the robbery as soon as the draw er was found empty. He was found soon after In company with the other two boys, and all three arrested and taken to Van Demon's store; here they were searched, and about $57 of the stolen money was found upon their persons. The balance they had spent for whisky and in other ways. They were sent to jail to await an examination. The boys live in tlie vicin ity of Marttiishurg, and one of them, at least, boars the reputation of being in the habit of pilfering. They have got them selves into a pretty serious scrape this time. On Monday or Tuesday night of last week, Dr. Rush left his horse and buggy standing hitched in front of the residence ofT. N. McElwain, near Good Hope, while he went into the house to attend a patient. Coming out about 10 o'clock he discovered that it was gone. Learning by the track of the buggy what course had been taken by the theives,tlie Doctor went in pursuit. accompanied by assistance from Mr McElwain's. At Good Hope they learned that two jneu has passed through therea short time before, in a buggy, driv ing at full speed. Following on the rond taken by the two men, tlieycame upon the stolen horse and buggy standin? iu a fence corner, about four utiles from Good Hope, where ithad evidently just been left by ihe thcives, who, finding themselves olose ly pursued, had abandoned itand taken to the woods. ' Some rascal took John D. Stuckey's horse, saddle and bridle, from the hitching post at Curran Millikan's residence, about 7 o'clock last Friday evening', rode him to Plymouth and turned him loose. The an imal was found in that vicinity the next day. The saddle had been taken off and was not recovered. The colored pojter at theKirk House narrowly escaped being slashed up with a huge butcher knife in the hands of another colored gentleman employed at the house, on Saturday night. A hasty exit down the back stairs was nil that saved him from annihilation. ' " , ' A pugilistic spirit seems to have pre vailed last Saturday night. We hear of a number of saloon tights and street knock downs.
