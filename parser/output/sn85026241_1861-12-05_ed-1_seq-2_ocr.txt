Itosidu block ading our extensive coast, squadrons lir than ever before a wouibled under our flag have been put afloat and performed deeds which have increased our naval renown, 1 wuuld call espeuial attention tn tho ro- eouiiiiFiidatinn ol the Secretary nf Ihn Navy foran o npcrfovo ga i iatirno tho Navy.ly introducing additional grades in the service.

I have no far forborne making nominations to those vacancies for reasons which I will now state. 1 wo ot the outgoing Judges resided within tho Stales now overrun by revolt, that if successors wore appointed in the same localities, they eould not servo upon their circuits, anil souieof tho mostaompetnt men tliere probably would not take the personal hasard of aooentiug to servo evtn here upon the Supreme Bench. I have been unwilling to throw all the ap pointments Northward, thus disabling uiy- a of It nf nn in so its of nf at I bo sr by fill so self from doing justice to the South on the return of peace ; although 1 may remark, that to transfer to the North nno which has heretofore been in the South, would not, with reference to territory and population, be unjust. During the long brilliant judicial careor of Judge McXionn, nit circuit grew into an em pire altogether too large for any one Judge to give the courts therein more than a nom inal attendance rising in pnpu'aiiiui from I.47imhm. in lo fi..il,4o:, i,t o. Bosides this, the coiltiti-.V has generally out grown our pmsetit judicial system, it uni formity wa.a! till intended. The -ytmn re quire that nil the States nltall It nowimmo dated with Circuit. Courts, attend' d by Su- Di-emu Judjei. whilo in fact. Wisconsin, Minnesota. Iowa. Kan-a'". Florida. Texa. Calirormu and Oregon have never had any such Courts. .Nor can this bo well rcmediod without a change nf the svsteni. Iiecaue tho adding of Justices to the .Supremo Court, cnoutth the rconiuinodaiion of all pai ts of tho i country with Circuit Couits, would create a Court altogether too dangerous for a judicial body of any sort, and tho evil nf it be one that will increase as new State conio into the I'nion. Circuit Court nro u ..d'u! or iheysra not usol'ul. If useful no State should be denied tlioni, if not useful no Stute should have them. Let tluun be provided for oil or abol ished, as to all three modifications occur to me here which I think would be an improve ment upon nur present sy -item. Iiot the ntinreine Lourt be ot convenient number in every event ; then, first, let the whole country be divided into circuits ot convenient sixo the nupreme Juugus to serve in a nnmbor of them cotrosponding to their own itumbor. and liidepeiKfent Circuit Judges lie provided for all thu ret ; or, sec ondly, tho Supreme Judges be relieved from circuit duties, nud Circuit Judges provided for all the circuits ; or, thirdly, dispense with Circuit Courts altogether, leaving tho U'licml functions wholly to the Inst net Courts nnd nn independent Supreme Court. 1 respectfully recommend to tho consid eration of Congress the present condition nf the statute laws with the hope that Congress will lie able to lind ar. easy remedy for the many incnnvonicncies and evils which con rtantly embarrass those engaged in the prac tical administration of theiii. Since the organization of the I lovumnicnt, CongresK Jms enacted some five thousand acts and joint resolutions, which fill more than hililll closely printed pages, nnd are scattered through uisny volumes. .Many ot these acts have boon drawn in . fiimtu and without su.Vciout caution, so that their pro visions are often obscure in themselves, or in conflict with each other, or at least so doubtlul as tn render it very difficult lor even the best informed uorsons to ascertain pre' ciselv what tho statute low really is. it seems tn mo very important that tho Statute Law should 1)0 made as iilain nnd intelligible as pnssiblu, und be reduced to ns small a coiuduss as may no consistent with .1. i .11 1 : : I' . i. .M, .1 t. - uic luuuess aim preciuinu oi me win or mo Legislature and tho perspicuity of its langu age, those well done would, 1 think, erimt a' tacilituto tho labors of those whose duties it is to assist in the administration of (he laws, and a lasting benefit to tho people, by placing boforo them, in a mora nceussiblu nnd intelligible form the laws which sn near ly concern tlieui in thir interests uud their duties. I ant informed by some whose opinions I respect that all thu acts of Congress now in force of a permanent and general nature, might bo revised and re-written, so as (o be embraced in one v iluine, or lit least two volumes of ordinary and convenient size, and 1 respectfully recommend to Congress to conaidor the siihient, und if my biiiruostion bo approved to devise such a plan as to their minds shall seem most proper lor tho attain ment of the end proposed. Duo of tho unfavorable consequences ol tho present insurrection, is llio entire sun pressionin many places of all ordinary means nf nduiiuistoring civil justice by the nlficer. and in llio forms ol existing law. This is the ease in whnlo or in part in nil tho iimii' Kent States, and its our armies advance upon to tako possession ol parts ol those Mates, tho practical evil becomes morn iiiuiarent.

Under theso circumstances, I havo been urgently solicited to establish hy military pownr, courts to administer siimm irv iustico in such cases. L hnvo thus far declined tn do it, not becauso 1 had any doubt that, tin end proposed (tho collection of the debt' was Just and right in itself, hut hoeause I havo been unwilling to go beyond tho ores sure nf necessity in the unusual exercise of power, but the powers nf Cnngross, I sup. pose, are equal io ino occasion, and t there fore refor the whole matter to Congress. with tho hopo that a plan may be devised tor tho nduunistrntinn nt Iustico in such parts of tho insurgent States nnd territories ns mny be uiulereontrol ot this Government. whether by a voluntary return to allegiance and oilier, or try tho rower ot our arms.

The investigation and silimli. oatinn of all claims in thoir nature belong to the .

It was intended by the organization of tho Court ot Claims mainly to rcmovo this branoh ot busino Irom tho hi s nf Con gross; but while the Court has proved to be nn otteetivo and valuable means ol mvesti. gallon, it in a groat degree fails tn cfioct the object of its oroation, fur want nf power to make its judgments final.

In such esse I rtoomraend that Congress provide for nccopting snch persons from such Stn'es neenrding to some mode of ualuition in lieu pro tautn of direct taxes, or upon some other plan to Imi agreed on with such States respectively. that such tiorsoin in snch acceptance by the General Government be si once deemed treo, nnd that III ouv event stotw be tnken for Coloniz ilimi with clnscs nr the nno first mentioned if tho nther shall not.be brought into expedience- in somo plseeor places in a climate conson nl tn hem It might be well to consider, too. whether the free colored people already in the Uni ted States could not so far as individuals mny desire bo included in such eoloni.ntion. To carry nut the plan ol colonization mnv involve the acquiring of loivitory nnj also the npprnpr'n'ion of money beyond thnt to ue i'Xiniiic in tut; ici i no. mi iii-qiiiniiiin,, H iving practical! the acquisition ot tern tory for nearly "0 years, the qucsiiou otcon siitutiou.il . power to do so is no lunger nn open one wfth us. I he power was first questioned by Mr. Jeffeinon, who, however, in the purchase of Louisiana, yielded his scruples on the plea nf great expediency. If it be said that the only legitimate object of acquiring territnry is to turnish homes for white men, this measure effects that object, for the emigration of the colored man leaves additional room I'or white men or remaining for coming hero. Mr. Jefferson, however, placed the importance of purchasing Louis iana more on political nnd coinuiercial grounds than in pro viding room for popula tion. Oi) this wholo proposition, including the appropriation of money with the ac quisition of territory, does not tho expedi ency amount to absolute necessity, that without which the Government cannot be perpetuated. lit considering che nolicv to be ndontod for stipprrtssins the insurrection. I hnve been nnxionsnnd careful that the inevitable eon Uict tor tins purimse shall n it degenerate into a violent and reinor.-eless revolutionary st niggle, 1 have therefore in every case thought it proper .to keep the integrity of the Union prominent as I he primary objoot nf the con test on our part, leaving all questions which are not of vital military iiupsrtance to tho more deliborato action of the- legislature. In the exercise of mv best discretion I hnve adhered to the blnckado nf the ports L-IIL-.l - .. ..." . nciu Dy tne insurgents, instead nt putting in force by proclamation the law of Congress. enacted by the Into session, for elosing those ports; also obeying the dictntes of prudence as well as tho obligations of law, instead of tradscending. 1 have adhered to the set of Congress tn ennhsonto property used for in sntToctionnry purposes.
