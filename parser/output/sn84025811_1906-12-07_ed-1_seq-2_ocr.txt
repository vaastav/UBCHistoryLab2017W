Congress is once more the real thing and the last session of the Fifty-ninth Congress promises to be the liveliest one of many years. The gavel of Vice President Fair banks had no more than fallen when Senator Penrose, of Pennsylvania, out of order, of fered a resolution calling on the President and the war department to transmit to the Senate a full review of the dismissal without honor of Companies B, D and C of the Twen ty-fifth Infantry, and he was no more than seated when Senator J. B. Foraker, of Ohio, offered a similar resolution, though more searching in its nature. Both of them went over. That dismissal proposition, first and Last, will cause some hot debates in Congress. It will cost President Roosevelt some of his popularity as a square dealer, for which he at one time was such a strong advocate. The President's message was a splendid THE

His recommendation that the Japanese be permitted to become naturalized citizens of the United States is wrong, unqualifiedly so, and on that issue he as a presidential candi date would lose every state west of the Mis souri river. The Jap is not only not a desir able foreigner to admit as a citizen, but the United States will be taking into her bosom a human serpent that will strike at her very vitals as soon as it is strong enough. The Huns, Italians and every other kind of Eu ropean emigrant are preferable to the Jap anese. Yea, even the heathen Chinaman in preference to the Japanese. The Japanese government has had no stronger ally in the past than the United States, she going so
