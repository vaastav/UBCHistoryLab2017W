Where the Spiders Are Waiting for Innocent Files—The Crocodiles that Crawl Slime to Crunch Calves, and the Anacondas With Loop Ready to Catch the Unwary—Sermon Delivered in the Brooklyn Tabernacle on Sunday, Nov. 30th. Brooklyn, Nov. SO.-Unusual interest was felt In the services al the Tabernacle to-day, from the fact that It was known that Wall Street would be the theme. The opening hymn was : "Rise, my soul, and stretch thy wings, Thy better portion trace ; Rise from transitory things To heaven, thy native place." The following Is a verbatim report of the ser mon : Title i" Recent Doings In Wall Street." a Trxt-Proverbs, xxill.,6: "Riches certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven Money Is a golden-breasted bird with silver beak, It alights In counting-room and on parlor center-table, and men and women stand admir ing It. But they do not notice It has wings as a raven's, as large as a flamingo's, as large as an eagle. At the first wave of misfortune It spreads its plumage and is gone. That verification of the Hying capacity of riches we have had recently In Wall Street. Taking advantage of the revival of trade, and far enough off from the Wall Street disasters of other years to have them forget them, the speculators have run up the stocks with a ve locity that made outsiders believe that they would always continue to ascend. Thank God I the crash came so soon, and before any more people were Involved In the flnanalal croze. We sympathize with the losers, and advise them to stay out of Wall Btreet. Let countrymen put out their money In first mortgages or In .United States bonds, and keep clear of the vortex where so many were last week swamped and swallow ed. What a healthful sign, that the recent agita tions or nan street rail to excite the markets throughout the country, Wall street's power to blast the nation has gone forever, Across the Island of New York In 1705 a wall of stone and earth, cannon-mounted, was erected to keep off the savage. A street was laid along by that wall, and as the street took the line of the wall It was appropriately called Wall street. It la short, narrow, unarchltectural, but unique in DlBtory; and excepting Lombard Btreet, in Lon don, the mightiest street In the world. There the Government of the United States was born; there Washington beld his levees; there Mrs. Adams and Caldwell and Knox and other brilliant wo men of the Revolution displayed their charms; there vvltherspoon and Jonathan Edwards and George Whitfield sometimes preached; there John Mason chlded Alexander Hamilton be cause the Constitution of the United States was written without any God in it; there negroes were Bold In the slave mart; there criminals were harnessed to wheelbarrows and made lo draw like beasts of burden, or were lashed through the streets behind carts to which they were fastened and there fortnnes have come to coronation or to burial, from the day when unscrupulous fin an ciers In powdered hair and silver shoe buckles dodged Dugau, the Governor-General of His Majesty, until clear on down to last week, when a good many fortunes smashed up. The fact Is the history of Wall street would be the larger part of the financial, agricultural, manufactur ing and religious history of this country. People talk of Its only being . a few blocks long, It reaches from the Canadas to the Gulf of Mexico; from Ban Franclseo to Bangor. It stands for the most emphatlo opposltes unswerving Integrity and tip-top scoundrellsm; heaven-born charity and bloodless Shy lock ism. The best men and and the worst men are found there. I would like to-day to put a plow In the curb stone of Old Trinity and drive it clear down to Wall street ferry; and so It shall go If the horses are Btrong enougn to draw the plow, In the first place, Wall Vreet stands for tried Integrity on the one hand, and the most out rageous villainy on the other. Among farmers who have only a few hundred dollars worth of produce every year to put upon the market, you cannot find out the character of men because they are not tried; but plunge a man Into the seven times heated excitements of Wall street and he will either come out a Bhadrack, with nair unsingea, or he win be turned Into a black. moral cinder. If I wanted to find integrity bomb-proof, I would seek It among the Wall street bankers and merchants. Such nefarious things, have some times been done there, that strangers have au idea that from one end to the other it is a scene of financial debauchery, and there are people who hardly dare pass through the street unless they have buttoned up their last pocket and had their life Insured, and al most religiously crossed themselves I Yet, If you start at either end of It and look at the names on the signs, you will find more upright men in the samo space on that street than ou any other busi ness doing street of all our cities. Fraud and lying and subterfuge and infernal recklessness do not hold uullm Ited sway. Added to all this Is the fact that when the Sanitary and Christian Commissions wanted to tend medleiuea and bandages to the wounded, and when this country wan tea to sena breadstuff) to famishing Ireland and when colleges were to be endowed and churches supported, and Missionary Sooietles were to send the people to all the earth, and de mand was made upon all cities, Wall street was the first to respond, But I have to say, also, that In that street there are the worst financial desperadoes this country has ever seen. Some of them got out of the Pen itentiary; others are on their way to Slni-Sing, These are the spiders that are waiting for in no' cent flies. These are the crooodtles that crawl up through the slime to cranch the calf. These are the anacondas with loop ready to catch the un wary, Th4ce are the maelstroms that Buck down the freighted ship. These were the wretches who stood on the beach praying for Caribbean whirl winds to swamp our American commerce, Blessed be God, the Infamy was defeated. God only knows what our merchants have suffered. and our working people, too; and I am glad to believe that their day of deliveranee 1b coming. Now, in passing, I want to make this subjeot practical, and I say to all you men whose prln olples are not thoroughly settled In business, keep out of Wall street. That is no place for man- who, when he Is overpaid 15 by mistake, does not know whether he bad better send It back or not, or for a man who has put trust funds In speculation; or for a man who does not know whether by the laws of the State usury Is right or wrong. That Is no place for a van whose principles quiver In the blast of temptation. Re member poor Ketohum-how quick the hoofs of ais iron greys clattered him down on the road to destruction. Remember poor Gay. br thlrtv years of age astonishing the whole land with bis fortunes, and also astonishing them with his for- gerles. Remember James Flsk, whose splendid steamboats and opera house could not atone for his adulterous rides through Central Park In the race or decent flew York, and who from Wall street by his example blasted tens of thousands of the young men of this generation, I hold up this polluted memory as a warning to all men whose principles are not thoroughly settled, to keep out of Wall street. , Yea, my word also la to me men wno in that street are engaged In legiti mate business; stand firm In Christian prinolplei be courageous In that commercial battle field, nememDer mere are heroos of the bank and ho roeiol the Stock Exohange. That Frennh Km. press who stood on a balcony in Paris and ad dressed a great mob until sho tllenocd them does not exolte my admiration so muoh as that old bank Piesldeut in Wall street, In 1869, who siooa on tne steps or hi moneyed Institution quieting the excitement of the depositors bid ding peace to the angry waves of commercial ex oltement, God Is going tq take care of you down amid the marts of business. The lions did not hurt Daniel, and the "bears" will not hurt you. Remember that the day Is coming on very soon wueu an cms will ne ended, lot will De beyond It all, and by the law of God's eternal right all the affairs of your business life will be at Indi cated. If you live Ib the country during the summer, some day after yon have returned from Business go out to tne nennery, and see tne un suc3esful Incubation in certain cases, or see the fright as the young flutter oB Into some unex pected element, and then bethink yourselves of my text. Again. I remark that Wall street stands for lo. gltimate speculation and for ruinous gambling.

That man who de nounces all stock business as iniquitous only dis plays his own Ignorance. Stop legitimate specu- alien in tnis country and vou ston the factories. stop the banks, and you stop the railroads; you stop all the great financial prosperity of the coun try. The stock broker Is only a commission merchant. He gets his commission on one kind of goods. You, the grocer, get your commission on another kind or goods. The dollar that he earns is as fair and bright and honest a dollar as mat earned ny tne r ay laborer, But here we must draw a very distinct line between lawful speculation and ruinous stock gambling, which nas orougm upon mis country tnree-iourtns or its commercial woes, and which Is now turning the heads of many people and filling tho laud with lunacy and Inebriation. You, the stock op erator, sell S100 worth of nothing and get paid for It. You steal from that man just.io much money. You say It Is a contract on time. You say you have no property, and do not expect to have. The man who buys does not want It. It Is sold at thirty days. You sell one hundred shares; you are to get for thorn 810,000. It is to be delivered In thirty days. If at the end of that time you nan get the scrip for !9,000 yon have maae fli.w; nut lr at tne end oi mat time you have to pay 811000, then you have lost 81,(J0O. Now, my brother, that Is trafficking on fiction, that Is betting on chances; that makes you as certainly a gambler as the man who makes or loses bis fortune In one of the gambling bells, Now, His agalnt tills kind of traffic in stocks that I warn the young men of my congregation. Almost every successful merchant during his life time wakes up and says, ' Here I have been successful in my regular line of merchandise, now I'll Just go down and consult with the bro kers and perhaps in three weeks I can double my fortune. What's the use of my being satisfied with 810,000 or 820,000 Income when that man next door lo me.

It Is not peculiar to the mercurial Americans.

BALTIMORE & CHICAGO R. R. The engineers are out npon the Pennsylvania part of this line, and have completed their trial line from the town of Beaver, or rather, the mouth of Brady Run, to the east fork of Little Beaver, in Columbiana conuty. They are now running a similar line between the same points, by the way of the north branch of Brady, crossing the summit at a different point. Which will prove the better route will depend npon a thorough comparison of the dis tance, gradients, curvature, and coat of grading. This Is a matter of exact mathematical calcula tion, from an exact "rule of equations " and not gum nork, as Is by many persons supposed. From the east fork of Beaver to New Lisbon there also exists two routes, so nearly alike as to require Instrumental dates for calculating the equaled difference, which Is the next work to be attended to. Meanwhile Mr. Miller of Wooster, Is actively engaged In working up Wayne and Ash land counties, where tho people generally hail the effort with increasing enthusiasm. It will be remembered, this ridge dividing tbe waters of the Big Beaver and the Little Beaver Is high one, and presents the most serious obsta cle upon this whole line, from Pittsburgh to Chi cago Junction, The ascending grade to this ridge Is to be the maximum for tbe entire road. This Is now definitely determined, and found that 85 feet per mile can be readily adopted ; and It may be made only 31 feet per mile at an addi tional cost, not too great to be acceptable.
