MEN FROM MANY LANDS ATTEND r i i (J. I ill. 1 VI 1 V is CONDITION OF THE CONSTABULARY Better Far rrorlded Oat and Hln-her Pension for Coffl a Makers of Work la Dablta. DUBLIN, Dec. 12. (Special.) Naturally the. one topic of conversation In -Ireland now la the new Irish land 'Mil which has just been Introduced In Parliament by Mr. Blrrcll, the chief -secretary for - Ireland, and I am bound to say, that while some people do not think It goes far enough the majority of Irishmen are disposed to accept It as a far larger measure of justice than they had any hopes of receiving from tlila government. Two features stand out In the new bill. One IS the resumption of land purchase and the Other Is that the consequent settling of men and women on the land that has been given over to the bullocks. One of the side Issues, which, perhaps, Is not less Impor tant than the main features, Is the expo sure of the pitiful Inadequacy of the Wynd ham measure of 1903 and . of the ' faulty finance of the lata unionist government. Mr. Wyndham estimated that to buy out the landlords of Ireland and restore the land to the people would cost about $560, 000,000, of which ICOO, 000,000 would be paid for the land Itself and W0, 000,000 would be paid as a bonus to Induce the landlords to sell, or, as It has been expressed In one of the debates, as a "bribe to the landlords to part wit their land for more than It was worth." Mr. Blrrell riddled these f!g ures In Introducing his bill and said that It was now clear that the total expenditure would be $900,000,000, exclusive of the bonus. In explaining his plan for finding this money he relieved the mind of the Irish taxpayers. Wyndham Art, ' Under the Wyndham act land purchase Was financed by an Issue of bonds which had to be sold considerably below par, the Issue of 1160,000,000 stock to date represent ing a loss of $17,600,000. This loss fell on the IrlBh taxpayers, but under the Blrrell bill the loss, If any, is to be borne by the im perial exchequer,' The ' other feature of the bill provides - for giving the congested districts commissioners compulsory powers for the pure has of land for distribution among the oocupylnf tenants, and for im proving uneconomic holdings, and gives them an Income of $1460,800 a year for the latter purpose. ' ..'.' Borne Interesting figures Knowing the ex tent to which the Wyndham act has worked 'are given by Mr. Blrrell.' Bo far the trans actions completedin which the money has been paid over to landlords represent $125, 000,000. Agreements to purchase have been signed to the amount of (266,000.000, but the transactions have not been completed for want of money, and It Is estimated that there is about $500,000,000 worth of land remaining to be dealt with.' The landlords have received an average of twenty-six years' purchase for their land, which no one can say Is not exceedingly generous, and when the bonus is added It works out at about twenty-eight and one-half years' purchase. This is a high price, but Ire land Is willing to pay if it la assured of being rid of landlordism. New Constabulary 3111. Another piece of legislation which will benefit a large number of Irishmen Is the new constabulary bill dealing with the pay and conditions of service of the royal Irish constabulary. It is fashionable, I know, to denounce the constabulary as a foreign force maintained for the oppres sion of Ireland, but 1t Is really one of the f.hest police fdrces In the world and does excellent police duty. It Is not Its fault that it Is occasionally used by the British government to enforce oppressive laws, and In the hands of an Irish government It would form the most popular body of men in the country. The men are wretchedly underpaid and the new bill provides for a slight increase pay and somewhat larger pensions. It also redresses other griev ances and offers larger opportunities for tho promotion 'of men from the ranks. Wh la tulklr.g of the constabulary I may mention that the K. I.

D., Dec. 12. (Special.) The last legislative session provided new build ings for practically every one of the state Institutions, and it was thought that there would be but little demand for such Im provements In the way of increased build ing room for the Institutions from the com ing session, and the Capitol commission felt the way was clear for them to ask tho necessary funds for the completion of that work, with the fitting up of the building and the grounds. For that purpose, they will ask for approximately $4Oj,0CO. This is o be secured by continuing the appropria tion of the last pension for $200,000, which has not been drawn upon, by the issuance cf $100,000 of capltol bonds, and authority to use $100,000 more from the sale of capitol lands. The first $300,000 can be cared for In the future by the sale of lands, and the only reason for asking for the ap propriations at the present time Is that most of the lands yet left lie at so great a distance from rail communication, that to attempt to sell them at the' present time would make a sacrifice of them. Up to the present there, has been realised from tho sale of lands $403,707.92. and of this $.-93,195 has been paid out, the balance of the fund being in mortgages and deferred payments. But the state institutions are not Intend ing to let the matter of new buildings rest, and the coming Bcssion will have to do sime paring on the desires of the heads of these ! Institutions. They will come to the legisla ture asking for approximately $1,000,000 for that purpose The state university will ask for $346,000, the Agricultural college wants $185,700, the Redfield Asylum for Feeble Minded Is willing 4o get-along with $127,000 and the rest of the Institutions think that from $100,000 down would about fit out their plans In a proper manner for the present..' The capitol la under construction,-and thu j state departments have entirely outgrown the old ramshackle building now used, and ,' the commission will insist that their claims come first,, and If the. legislature agrees with them, the other Institutions will have ' to wait for at least two years more before they get anything very expensive In the way of buildings. The question of 2-cent passenger fare will probably be pushed, as It Is a part of tho platforms of both parties In this state at the recent election. At present a suit is in progress in the United States court to pre vent the putting Into effect in the state of it 2',4-cent rate, which was ordered by the State Railway commission, under Instruc tions from the last legislative session. The securing of physical valuations of railway property for the purpose of .taxation and rate regulation is also under wsy In the state, and with this work only partly com pleted, and the test case In the court on a higher rate, just what action the legislature may take Is an open question. The Insurance men of the state will at tempt to secure the repeal of the valued policy clause of the state Insurance law. 

FINGER PRINTS ONLY CLEW New York Police Have Baffling Crime to Solve and Almost No Evidence. NEW YORK. Dec. 12. With only the bloody finger prints of the murderer to assist them, the police today are scouring the city for some trace or the man who committed what now appears to be one of the most baffling crimes in the city's criminal history. His victim, the young woman whose body was found last night In a padlocked and barricaded apartment at 137 East Eleventh street, has not yet been identified and a thorough search of the rooms has revealed nothing which will aid the police in their task. Evory dis tinguishing mark had been removed from the woman's clothing and pictures had been cut from their frames and burned to gether with several pieces of paper which may have borne addresses. On every hand there was to be found evidence of the crafty cars used by the murderer to baffle pursuit. The discovery of the crime came about through the anxiety of the Janltress of tha flat house to collect rent for the apart ment, nearly two weeks overdue. The man and woman who occupied the rooms more than two months had paid promptly up to the first of the present month, but since that time the apartment had been closed and the door locked with a padlock on the outside and neither the man nor the woman had been seen. Last night the anltress decided to enter the apartment to make sure the tenants had not removed their trunks without "her knowledge, and the police were called to assist her in open irg the door. When an entrance was forced, the woman's body, with the hesd almost severed, was lying on the blood soaked bed. The room was In confusion. Broken chairs were scattered about and wearing apparel which had been removed from an open trunk was strewn about the room. Under the woman's body lay a raxor. Its edge hacked and broken. The condition of the body Indicated that the woman had been dead 'not less than two weeks. On the door knob and on the sheets were the finger prints of the murderer. 

RUEFS SENTENCE DELAYED Jodare I.awlor Postpone Imposing; Penalty on Ban franclse Man Till Deeemher 1. SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 1.-Ths pro nouncing of sentence on Abraham Ruef, convicted of bribery, was postponed by Superior Judge Lawlor today until next Saturday, December IS KNOX FOR SECRETARY OF STATE Burton Likely to Take Treasury if He Does Not Land Senatorship. HITCHCOCK POSTMASTER GENERAL Wilson o Remain for a Time, bat Beyond These It Is Stated the President-elect Has Come to No Conclusions. (From a Staff Correspondent.) WASHINGTON, Dec. 12.-(8peclal Tele gram.) From many sources and with In terviews had with Preiryjent-elect William H. Taft, by friends of tnfe Incoming chief executive, it is believed that Judge Taft will select his cabinet completely from those not associated with administration affairs. By this It Is not meant to Insinu ate that the present cabinet officers are not to the liking of the incoming president, but that he wants to surround himself with men who come from the people and not through the clerical branches of the govern ment. Mr. Cortelyou, who has made a splendid secretary of the treasury and a most efficient postmaster general, . Is a product of clerical advancement. This Is true also ef several officials in the Post office department and throughout the gov ernmental scheme clerks have been ad vanced to occupy positions which they are wholly fitted . for from an administrative point of view, but who know little or noth ing of the wants of the people whom they represent. As a cabinet officer Mr. Taft has seen these things and now that ha 1s to be In augurated president It Is learned that he proposes to have about htm at the cabinet table men who represent the states and the nation, rather than mere bureaucrats. To this end Is Is seeking a man for secre tary of state who will fill the place mads vacant by Ellhu Root, and It 1s thought he will choose Senator Philander C. Knox of Pennsylvania, one of the very ablest law yers In the country. v Whltelaw Reld, ambassador to the court of St. James, It Is understood, would like to have the place, but "there Is nothing doing" in that connection. B or ton for ' Treasury. 1 Should the fate of .battle go against Rep resentative Burton, who represents the Cleveland district of uhlo In congress, It la pretty generally accepted that be will bo asked to tako the position of secretary of the treasury, a plaee for which hs is pre eminently fitted. Of course, Mr. Bur toll may win the senatorship as .the successor to Senator ForaXor, tor he occupies a strong position with the five people In the race Ctiarles P. Taft of Cincinnati, Qovernor-i Harris, Senator Foraker, Harry Daugherty and himself. Mr. Taft, editor of the Times-Star and brother of the president-elect, does not have at this time anywhere near votes enough to elect, although the. republicans have thirty or more majority In the Ohio legisla ture on Joint ballot. Burton will have a lot of votes In the caucus, as will Foraker, Harris and Daugherty, and It may be that Instead of Taft for senator. Burton may win out because of local conditions. That Is neither here nor there, however, for It Burton Is defeated President-elect Taft will ask him to take the treasury portfolio. As to the postmaster generalship, Mr. Hitchcock Is still the favorite, notwith standing the backfire which has ben started against him, and a good guess Is that he will land the position for which he Is both mentally equipped and peculiarly fitted. WlUon to Star Awhile. It Is generally accepted In Washington that James Wilson, secretary of agricul ture, will not hold the position beyond next July. It has been Mr. Wilson's ambition to serve the longest time of any other secre tary of agriculture, and "Tamer Jim" will be permitted to make that record and then will come a change. Mr. Pinchot of the forestry service has been very generally slated for the agricultural position, but from those who have had conferences with the president-elect, the Inference has gone out that Judge Taft believes that Mr. Pinchot would subordinate the great De partment of Agriculture to that of the for estry bureau. There will be a change in the Depart ment of the Interior and a change in the Department of Justice, but who are being considered rests completely in the mind of Judge Taft, who does not propose to make mistakes In those two great offices. Attorney General Charles J. Bonaparte today Indicated that . he would not be a member of President-elect Taft's cabinet when, in response to an Inquiry on the sub ject, he said that after March 4 next he positively would retire from public life. Although Mr. Taft has a wide knowledge of men, his mind is open to suggestions, tor he wants In his cabinet men of all geo graphical sections and not men of mere localities! Secretary Wright of the War department will remain, but the Navy de partment Is much In doubt. As for Com merce and Labor, Mr. Straus has proved himself extremely capable and the chances are that he will remain In his present posi tion. Dakotaas See Taft. Senator Gamble and Mr. Cook, chairman of the republican state central committee of South Dakota, had an interview by ap pointment with Judge Taft yesterday aft ernoon. Matters of Interest to the stats were discussed, but both the senator and Mr. Cook refused to mske public the re sult of tha conference. Senator Gamble was In consultation with officials of the Interior department today with reference to the states of ths preliminary work on the Staudlng Rock and Cheyenne River In dlsn reservations. He urged that the ut most expedition be exercised so that the work may be completed and the reservation opened tb settlement at the earliest pos sible date. It la the Judgment of the de partment that tha work of allotment alll be completed and the appraisement and clas sification of lands be concluded so that ths lands may be opened for settlement in the fall of 19U9. Senator Gamble also took up with the de partment the matter of two bills he recently Introduced looking to the opening of the surplus lands on the Pine Ridge and F. s-- I 1114 $$J, From The Woman's 'Home Companion.

First day 10,603 eoond day 11,037 Third day io,ai The success of the National Corn expo sition from every standpoint is now assured. From the first tho success of the educa tional and show features of the exposition were certain and the liberal attendance pf the first four days forecasts a great In flux of visitors for the last week of the show, and thus the financial success of the giant enterprise. Men of national and International repu tation have Visited the exposition during the last week and one and all have been un stinted In their praise. ' Ambassadors from foreign lands, ' members of Parliaments, governors of neighboring states, railroad magnates from a distance, all have been fulsome In praising the efforts of the man agement In assembling the largest and best exhibit of corn and products ever shown in the United States. v Saturday eclipsed all previous records In the matter of adult attendance of visitors, and the hotels are now taxed to handle the people who have come from afar. Fra ternal Society and Governors' day was voted by all as a great success, and even the ample room provided by the manage ment for. lectures and drills was packed. Now that the hurrah Incident to the open ing Is over the lecturers have gotten down to business! and all over the show may be seen groups of Interested listeners, hearing the gospel of Intensive farming preached by those schooled In the leading universities and agricultural colleges of the west. Over 200 persons gathered In the booth of the Iowa exhibit at one time Saturday after noon to learn the proper method of corn propagation', and this wsa but one of the many of such groups In tle different sec tions of the exposition. , Mrs. Sheldon Makes the Hit. Governor Brooks of Wyoming and Gov ernor Garst of Iowa mud able speeches at the National Coin exposition Saturday n orning, but 'all the laurels of the day were snatched from them by a woman. Mrs. George L. Sheldon, called on to apeak .In place of her husband without previous warning to her, made a five-minute address which moved the big autfene to tremen dous enthusiasm, and whon she had con cluded nobody cared a hang that pressure of official business had kept the governor of Nebraska from attending. Governor Sheldon did arrive' In Omaha, but too late for the exercises at the ex position. "If the Country Life commission will de vise some means of providing the farmer' wife with help sho will take car of ths social calendar herself," declare 1 Mrs. Shel don. "It is no light propos.tlen for a woman, often of eiel.cati health, by herself, to care for all that the management of the do mestic end of a farm Involves, and to go beyond this, to make a horn artistic as well as hygienic. Is something rather ardu ous. Personally, I enjoy :arm lit, but It Is difficult, you know, to get maid to stay on a farm.
