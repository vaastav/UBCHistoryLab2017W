From information receiveJ through a most authentic source, it has been as certained that R. R. Connolly, or his friends, actually tendered, on the day before Thanksgiving, fl,000,()00 cash to counsel for the people, on condition that he should be released from all prosecution in the suit upon which he was under arrest. Some of the counsel for the people were in favor of the acceptance of the money for and on account of the people, on the ground that Connolly had not acted so contu- ] maciously as Tweed and Hall, but had allowed an opportunity for the usurpa- j tion of the book* in the Comptroller's office; but others refused to agree to | any proposition that would lead to an abandonment of the suit pending. The offer was made jnst previous to Connol ly's removal to Ludlow street jail. Ask Permission to PhmcIc. The members of the International Society here have sent a telegram to tbo Governor as follows : "Can we parade ?" No answer has yet been received. In case the Governor refuses, the parade will take place. It was reported to-day that the In ternational society would attempt to parade to morrow despite the prohibit ing of the police. A meeting of the various lodges was held to night and adopted addresses to the people of tbe United States eetting forth the ob jects of the proposed parade, and stat ing that they considered Sunday a most proper day for such a solemn event as commemorating the execution of their brother members in France. They assert that there is nothing in the State or Federal Constitution to prevent their procession, and conclude by de nouncing the action of the police as despotic and oppressive. Another meet ing will be held on Monday night, when the day of the parade will be decided on. Fisk and Ooold Bribery Cnse. The testimony of the jurors who, it was alleged, had been approached by emissaries of Fisk and Gould in a gold contract 6uit, for transactions performed on Black Friday, was taken to-day. Two of the jurors testified that they had been accosted by a man with whom they were unacquainted, and that money had been offered to them. The parties in the suit, including Jay Gould, presented affidavits denying that they had ever asked any one to attempt to bribe the jury. The one juror who refused to agree with the others, testified that they had persecuted him in the jury room after they had retired. It was cold, no fire, and* the jury were out all night. Thev had threatened to hang him out I of the window, and do other things. The case was adjourned till Monday. Suicide. Mrs. Elizabeth Atkins, 23 ?

ST. LOUIS. National Board of Trade. St. Locis, December 9. ? In the thira days' session of the National Board of Trade, the committee appointed to con fer with the delegates from the Do minion Board of Trade presented a report recommending Congress for an appointment of a committee to negotiate the basis of a treaty for reciprocity trade relative with Canada. The com mittee submitted a series of resolutions looking to uniform Import andlnternal Revenue laws, and the consequence of an international railroad between the two countries. A resolution asking the State Legis latures to enact laws for the protection of the use of telegraph lines then came up. Mr. Barton Able, of St. Louis, offered an amendment memorializing Congress to take into consideration the propriety of securing the coutrol of all tlie telegraph lines in the United States and operating them at the lowest pos sible cost.

Able, of St. Louis; Wright, of Chicago; Ropes, of Boston; Wetherill, of Philadelphia; Bowner, of St. Louis; Taylor, of Cin cinhati; Peddic. of New York; Stryock, of St. Louis; Rowland, of Cincinnati ; McLaren, of Milwaukee, and others. The amendment was finally lost by a small majority and the original resolu tion adopted. W. S. Young, from the Baltimore Board ot Trade, offered a resolution de nouncing any inspection of articles of merchandise by State authority as un necessary and oppressive to the mercan tile interests of that State, and directing the Secretary to lay before the several Legislatures the opinion that such laws should be abrogated.

This morning's bulletin from Sandringham announces that the Prince has passed the night quietly, and though still suffering from great physical prostration is a trifle easier.

Jenner and the other physicians attend ing the Prince have just issued another bulletin, stating that His Royal High ness has been more tranquil this room-l ing, and that his condition is somewhat more satisfactory.

The physicians state I that the Prince has passed a very un ! quiet afternoon, and that the more dangerous symptoms have reappeared, j In view of the extreme weakness of the ; Prince, this bulletin is regarded with i the greatest concern, as it is the general j belief that a renewal of the violent 1 attack of Friday last must prove fatal.

Che Fcuiale SaflTragl?U-IIow They Propose to Do It ? Two More Defalcation*? The Prince of Wales -The Went Virginia Member*. Washington, December 9. Editor of the Register. What with the meeting of Congress, the President's message, the female suffragists, political wirepulling and our usual weekly defalcations, the past week has been a tolerably lively one in Washington City. The business of the Presidential session has begun in earnest, and although it is not very likely that much legislation will be done, yet political maneuvreing is ac tive, and will probably engross the time of the greater number of members during the greater portion of the win ter. Among the many rumors afloat to day is one that the Democratic mem bers of Cougress are contain plating the introduction of articled of impeachment against President Grant, based mainly upon his violations of law in connec tion with the San Domingo job. The chance of obtr.iuiug a majority in the House of Representatives to lavor the measure is not quite so hopeless as might be tir*t tiiougiit. The Democrats have now one hundred and four mem bers of the Ilou-e; the Republicans have only thirty-tive majority aud at least live* of these are bitterly opp<?*d ^ XiUan* tl.m ro.l?'oi?.f5 tKc majority lu twenty-five, and there is pretty good reason f >r believing that before the ses sion is over more than half of these may be arrayed against the administra tion. A goud de.il of anxiety is felt as to the course the anti-Grant Republi cans will pursue in the Presidential contest, and eome effort will probably be- made to bring lorward a sharp and distinct is-ue an<f thus compel them to show their hand. They seem to be waiting upon each other an I when one takes open and hold and defiant ground he wi.l probab.y be followed by a reg ular stampede. ... , Sumner is still nursing his wrath. The Senate wished to restore him to his former position as chairman of the committee on Foreign Allaire, but Sec retary Fish put itia toot upon the move ment" and declared for the five hundred and fourteenth time that he would leave the Cabinet if this were done. Where upon the sycophantic Senators dropped the classic Charles and continued the bly and subtle Simon at the head of the committee and then wrote a letter to tli c venerable whale begging him not to rcs'gn bui to stay io the Cabinet and continue to make war upon Mad ame Catacazy and give d'gnity to the administration. The Secretary smiled a gracious assent and remains in pos se.-siou oi the State Department lor the present, though it is very likely that the storv that he has at last concluded to resign will be telegraphed from this city at least three times during the coining week and soon until he finally flop* out of water. The "Boston wing"' of the female sufl'rag'sts arc holding a Convention here a"id formally opened their batteries last ninht at Masonic Hall. I regret to say that the suffrage sis'era are not at all harmonious among themselves and have as many petty squabbles as the rival leaders st a ward meeting. Mrs. Demosthenes Claflin, Woodhull, Blood, or whatever her name may We, is the pet aversion ot the "Boston wing, ' and makes things lively for the staid suf fragis's of the Hub. Last night she had :-ma;l bovs employed to stand at the duor and' give to each person^ at tending the Convention a copv of Woo<i hull it Clo flint Weekly, in which were some choice denunc ations ot the "Bos ton wing' and manv other very shock ing things. The following bill has been drawn up and is to be presented in the Huuse un Monday by Butler and in the Senate by Anthony cy Section 1. That ail citizens of the United States who are, or shall be otherwise qualified by law to vote at any election b* the people in any State, J Territory, district, county, city, parish, | township, school district, municipality | or other territorial sub-division, shall be : entitled and allowed to vote at all such J elections, without distinction of sex, any , constitution, law custom, usage or regu- 1 lation ot any State or Territory, or by | or under its authority, to the contrary notwithstanding. Section 2. Ail the provisions of an act entitled "An act to enforce the rights of citizen* of the States to vote in the several Stales of this Union, and for other purposes," passed May 31, 13?0, which are necessary and proper for the , turpose of enforcing the provisions of, this act, and wi ich are not inconsistent therewith, are hereby directed to be ap plicable to this act. ' Two defalcations are reported in the United States Treasurers office tlra week. Mr. Marden, Chief of the^ Di vision of Accounts, is accused of little "irregularities" to the amount of from twelve to fifteen thousand do.lars, and (Seib Johnson, the Interest Teller in I the same office, baa "myitified %0 counts to the extent of perhaps fifty thousand. Johnson was arrested v?? terday, and in de'ault of bail is still ia custody. It is the opinion of many lawyers here that General Spinner's bond ia liable for the peculations of these clerks, but Butler has been re tained by Spinner and will contest any attempt to collect the money. A great deal of interest is manifested this morning in the dispatches from London. The popular feeling that the Prince of Wales is not a very exem plary or praiseworthy scion of royalty is lost in the sympathy that is felt for his mother and wife now that he is reported to be dying, but there seems to be very little uneasiness here as to the political results that may flow from his death. The West Virginia members of Con gress are all on duty and some of them, especially Senator Davis, seem to have their hands full of committee work and other legislative business, In my next letter I will refer more at length to the part they are taking in the do ing* at the Capitol. Qcill. The Royal Family of England. Some Arconnt of the Life of Albert Edward? Speculations a* to (be Probable Resnlts of HI* Dcnth. The children of the Queen and of the Prince Consort are nine in number, all of whom, but one, are living. These are, in the order of their birth, 1st, the Princess Royal, Victoria Adelaide, born November 21, 1840, and married on the 25th of January to the Crown Prince, Frederick William of Prussia (the "Unzer Fritz" o: the late Franco-Prus sian war,) of which marriage six chil dren survive; 2d, his Royal Highness Albert Edward Prince of Wales, born November 9, 1841; 3d, her Royal Highness Alice Maud Mary, born April 25, 1S43, and married July 1, 1862, to Prince Frederick William of Hesse Darmxtadt, who have issue five chil dren; 4th, Prince Alfred, Duke of Edin burgh, Earl of Kent, and Earl of Ul ster, born August 6, 1844, and now a captain in the Royal navy; 5th, her Royal Highness Helena, born May 25. 1846, and married July 5th, 1866, to Prince Frederick Christian ol Schleswi^ Holstein Augustenborg, who have issue two children; 6th, her Royal Highness Louise, born March 18, 1848, who was married a few months ago to the Mar quis of Lome; 7th, Prince Arthur, (who visited this country several months ago,) born May 1, 1850, and who is now a lieutenant in the Rifle Brigade; 8th, Prince Leopold, born April 7, 1853; and, 9th, Princess Beatrice, born April 14tb, 1857. It will thus be seen that the Roval family of England is a large one, entailing ??*<>? ??***, tax-payers of the nation. But to come, now, to the central figure in this sketch ? the man about whose deathbed so many solemn responsibilities of the future gather, and who in his death at t!.is juncture may prove of vastly more importance than he ever was during his lifetime. 

ALBERT EDWARD, PUtNCB OF WALES, was born at Buckingham Palace, Lon don, on November 9th, 1841. It has been alleged against him that he was intellectually deficient ; but if this were so the fault must have lain with his native mental weakness, for every op portunity was provided in his youth to prepare and fit him for the exalted position which, as it seemed, he was destined to till in the future. He re ceived in his early boyhood a careful educational training under the care of competent masters. His instructor* at this period were the Rev. Henry M Birch, Rector of Prestwich, Mr. Gibbs, Barrister-at-law, and others. After studying for a session at Edinburgh he entered Christ Church, Oxford, where he attended the public lectures fur a year. He afterwards went to Cam bridge, where, still in pursnit of that knowledge which was never to come to him, he resided, following the usual university lectures for three or four terms. In theeummer of the year I860, during the Presidency of Mr. Buchanan, the prince visited tiik united states, an event which was attended with an enthusiastic reception by the people wherever he went. The occurrences connected with that visit are not so far distant in the past but that the memory of most of those who read these lines will vividly recall the flattering recep tion which met the beardless youth, who came to a Republican country with the prestige upon him of future sov ereignty over a great and frieudly na tion. Bat when the feastings and revelries ? the balls and junketungs ? the speeches and the servilities were over, bis Royal Highness, with the bloom of boyhood upon his face, and reminding men somewhat of his noble father in his lineaments, returned to England to enter upon the ? for him ? serious business of life. 

SEEING LIFE. The earlieet assumption of manhood by the Heir-Apparent to the English throne was of that kind which might have been expected in a man of his birth, of bis opportunities, and of the traditions of his class. In 1858 be had gazetted to a colonelcy in the army, and after bis return from this country, namely, in June, 1861, he joined his regiment in camp at the Curragh. The temporary life atcampover, the experi j mental colonel of Hussars doffed his gaudy uniform, and next ? still under i the inspiration of his thoughtful mother | ? turned his face to the East, and, ac- , companied by Dean Stanley, a compe tent guide and tutor, hs visited Jerusa lem in 1862. In the ensuing year, * another important, but barren and ? fruitless, step was taken in the Prince's life. As Duke of Cornwall he was en titled to the privilege of A SEAT AMONG THE PEERS of the United Kingdom in Parliament. In February, 1863, therefore, be ranged | himself among the members of that ' honorable body in the House of Lords. ! To his lofty title as Prince of Wales? i full of meaning in its asaociations ? he added, besides that af Duke of Corn , wall in the peerage of England, the un meaning ones of Dake of Rotbeaav, Baron of Renfrew, (under which desig nation he travelled in his journeying* in various lands,) and Lord of the Isles ia Scotland, and Sari of Dublin and Carrick in Ireland. As owner of the Duchy of Cornwall, which is an appan age ol the Prince of Wales, he enjoved the patronage of twenty-nine livings, 1 which, with the other revenues from the I Duchy, gave him an income of more | than f3O0,000 per annum. As Prince 1 of Wales his annuity on the civil list | amounted to $200, 000. As colonel and chief of the Rifle Brigade, (a position equivalent to General.) and as colonel of the Tenth Hussars, his income was probably increased ?15,000 additional. It will thus be seen that the total reve nuea of the Prince were enormous, and were in full keeping with his rank. BIS MARRIAGE. In 1S63, on March 10th, the Prince was married to the Princess Alexandra, (born December 1, 1 Ji44 ) eldest daughter of the King of Denmark. The marriage was attended with feastings and testi monials of popular joy which were al most without parallel. Tennyson cele brated the occasion in an epithalamiam; the bells of London were set to ringing, and the joyous populace strewed the way of the fair Danish bride with flow ers. "Welcome, Alexandra," was in scribed everywhere, and this preeting to the daughter of the ancient Norse Kings was depicted in the faces of all that vast multitude, which on t hat au spicious day filled the thoroughfares of the British Capital. From this marriage five children were born, who*-e names we give according to the order of their births: Albert Victor, born 8th January. 18t>4; George Frederick, born June 3d, 1865; Louise Victoria, born 20th of February, 1 867; Victoria Alexandra, born July 6th, 1868; and Maude Char lotte, born November 26th, 1S6'J. AFTER MARRIAGE. Since the time when, under the aus picious circumstances detailed above, the Prince of Wales entered the mar riage state, little of public interest at taches to his name or works. In 1S67 he became President of St. Bartholo mew's Hospital, in London ? a passive performance which was but a feeble im itation at uost of the politic course ot his excellent father. Occasionally he was seen on State occasious, a dull, listless young man who bore his Royalty and its cares like a heavy burden. II is form was familiar on Regent street as he walked with a vacant expression upon his face, mildly putling at hit cigar The old fatality of his ances tors sat heavily upon him ? the curse of imbecility. It is related of him that once he drew from the London canaille a temporary outburst of enthusiasm. At a lire in the public streets, a spark ol his English birth and breeding nerving him, he worked at the fire engines with the rest witU true British pluck; the noisy mob that today swears that he shall never never seat himself upon the tttrone ot tils ancestors cneer&J him as a true Briton; hut the material fire was extingnished and the irnntal spark of vigor died out with it. 

SPECULATION'S AS TO TIIK PROBABLE RE SULTS OK THE DEATH OF THE HEIR APPARENT TO THE THRONE. We have already at length discussed the most probable results o! the demise of the Prince of Wales, in so far as any deductions can be made from present appearances. It is, of course, wholly impossible to predict exactly what will take p'ace; but the chances are that no very violent outburst or manifesta tion ol the feelings and desires which have long lain dormant in the Briti-h people, will occur. Although the Prince was never popular and Itad but few friend-*, and scarcely any among the ranks of the people, yet there is in the English nation a deep, inherent regard tor ibe Queen and Iter household, and, despite the op|>ortunil'es wnicb the death of the heir-apparent to the Brit ish throne may offer, arid ti e tempta tions it may throw in the way of agitators an 1 demagogues like Mi-Mrs. Od^er, Bridlaugh, and their followers, the first and general feeling throughout Great Britain will be that of sorrow and commiserat on for the Queen, who still retains a place in the heart of every true Englishman, her feelings and errors as a ruler notwithstanding, wliich only will be effaced by her death, and be strengthened, rather that weakened, by her present sorrow "God save ihe Queen!" will be the firt-t and innermost feeling and prayer throughout England, in cabin and in castle; and for a time, at least, the people will he more loyal and attached to the royal household than ever they were helore since the death of l'riuce Albert. Many days will pass in quietude before the death of the Prince ol Wales will be forgotten, or the remembrance of the distress of the Queen be effaced Yet measures will have to betaken, and at once, to est*bii?h a regency, in case the Queen, ln>wed down by her j de?-p aifliction, should relinquish, at this juncture, the cares of .Stale, as she has so olten expre<-s*d her determination and desire to do. True, that we do not know if she will do this; she may retain the sceptre and occupy the throne herself until the probable heir-apparent, the young Prince Albert Victor Chriv tian Edward, now in his eighth year, shall reach manhood and become of age. But much may happen between now and tnen. To judge from the present aspect of affairs in England, thirteen years will produce maoy changes, mature roariy plans; and much may become a reality during that period which is now only hinted at, and which would, if real ized, forever pre clude the young Prnces chances ol ever becoming King ot England. We, for our part, do not believe that the child- Prince Albert Victor will ever wear Britannia a crown, to the Queen this may. perhaps, be granted until she dies; but she will doubtless be the last to wear that symbol of regal power in Great Britain. " When its kingly splen dor shall leave her brow, ita charm will be loot, and the people will proclaim, quietly, but none the less earne-tly : "No more of U??t, Hal, an thou lo-vest me!" The immediate consequence of the Queen s abdication, should this take place, would be, of course, the estab lishment ot a regency. Thi*. for ft child eight years old, would, in ita creation and its limitations, need, and will re ceive, the most thorough and statesman like consideration. If the wi<lowed Princess of Wales be disqualified by reason of ill health, rumor assigns it to the Duke of Cambridge, who is, at lattt, negatively popular. If not be, why not the Marquie of Lome, or, in deed, a Council of Regency, the power of Parliament over the subject Deiag unlimited ? - As we have already said, it ictmi to us that rush a regency at this time, so constituted, so far from weaktaing, will | rather have a tendency to strengthen existing institutions, at least tor the time being. A regency, with Prioee Allied at iia bead, can scarcely come in ques tion, owing to his unfitness for such a position and his well known and undis guised unpopularity. Prince George Frederic William Charles, Duke of Cambridge, who has, unquestionably, the beat chance as regent, next to the i "Princess Dowager," also enjoys the titles of Count of Tipperary and Baroo CluloJen, and Field Marabal aad Com mander-in-Chief of the British army. He is still in the prime of lift, about fifty-two years of age, born March 26, 1819. He is a cousin of Queen Victo ria, who is of nearly the same age. He is not a popular man, it is true; but young Alfred has not held an enviable position in the affections of the English people since hia visit to Australia and India, while the Duke of Cambridge, oa the other hand, has been so long associated with the present Koyal family, and is so closely connected with it that he has become a depositary of the traditions and spirit of British roy alty to an extent that would commend bim to the great mas* of Tories, who are the backbone of the English aris tocracy. To the Liberals, who ocoupy the ground between Mr. Bradlaughaud Lord John Manners, he would not be unacceptable, owing to a small reputa tion which he ha* acquired for moderate Liberalism. The fact that he has no recognized family, and that be is ad vanced in years, would doubdeea deprive him of all dynastic ambition, and this would be an immense addition to his qualifications for an office which insens ibly recalli' a Duke of Gloucester, the Tower, and two young princes murdered within its walls at his suggestion. It a regency should be established, it may, therefore, be considered almost certain that the Duke of Cambridge will be appointed regent, and, for a time, at leatt? so long as until the im mediate effect of the bereavement on the Queen shall be mill fresh in the re membrance of the British people ? the claims of Mr. Odger, or even Mr. Brad laugh, of "The People's William;" nat , even of the aspirant to the hand of Beatrice, our own "Fred." ? will have but very little consideration. But after that time shall have passed over, as if surely would pans; after the effects of the changed state of affair* and of the regency should have m*de themselves (fit, what wou'd then occur it is, indeed, difficult to predict. The Railroad MeeilNf nt CMIa. The meeting at tbe Court House Sat. nrday night was well attended. D. B. Welch presided and Samuel George acted as Secretary. Colonel Conwell stated that the object of the meeting wan to know wbetherjthe people of Cadi* wanted a railroad by the Harrisville and Cadiz route, or by their inactivity allow it to past by some other route. Henry Boyle* thought this meeting premature. We could do nothing until the report ol the aurvey now Iteing made by the II arrisville route was re ceived. Re*. Grimea waa in favor of agitat* ing the aubject. If the road waa built round ua it leit our town in an unenvia ble aituation The Ilarrinville and Cadiz was the moat preferable route. It the road waa built to Cadiz we would have cheaper freights, and it would ia creaae our population. If it pastes by another route the reverse will be the result ; it wonld be a dark day for Cadiz. lie had talked to Wheeling men and they thought tbe leading men here did not want a rail road to Cadiz, lie thought tbe Hope dale route too zig zag in ita course to be practicable. Her. Meloy said that everybody waa of the opinion that a road would be built over someone of tbe routes. If it paves around ua tbe opportunity for having a road paases from ua for all time. You go to Pittsburgh, and soma one *aya, "You are from Cadiz " "Yes." "That ia where the Doylej railroad is." We would have had no life, no business, if it had not been for this crooked road. Now what we want is a through route. Baltimore is one of the beat markets in the country. Let the Leg si at tire allow ua to vote a tax in favor of this road. Let ua ahow the people along this route that we want this road built. Let ua ascertain if ttie right of way for thie road can be had, and adjourn and bare a report at a larger meeting. A committee of three was appointed to correspond with parties who repre sent the Lake Shore route. The com mittee consists of W. S. Poulson, W. B. Iiearn and II. Royles. The meeting adjourned to meet on Saturday, December Ifl. at one o'clock P.M. The incorporators of the Wheel ing and Toledo railroad were author ized to cill said meeting. ? Cadit Sen It nt I The CmI TrssMsa Pbilhdelphia, Decenter 9.? The Mineri Journal, alluding to the report of the intended coal strike, say*: At this time of the year, and daring the present condition of affaire, such a strike would only be in tbe intereet of the operators, who would do nothing to pre vent it, as it would tend to leaeeo the supply. The miners cannot expect to get any advantage by a strike, as the companies have a large euppiy to raa on, and if such strike should become general, tbe inference would be that it I had been instigated in aa underhand way by the operatore themselves, who, if sucb were th* case, would not have manliness enough to come out boldly and stop tbe work with tbe expreaa ia tention of controlling tbe market.
