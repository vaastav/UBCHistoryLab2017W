Van Tets. the joung noble- man who recently fought a duel with Prince Henry, husband' ot QueMr-'Wllhel-r mlna, has caused general sorrow among the people, and has Increased tenfold the feel 'lng of resentment against the Trince Con tort. Van Tets died from a wound, according to the commonly accepted story, received from the Prince, because the former objected to the Prince's open and brutal treatment ot Wllhelmlna, The public who love their -Queen dearly, therefore, look upon Van Tets. as a martyr. ' Not a word of complaint came from the Major as to the cause of his Illness. This has helped to endear him to the people. The attempts of the Queen's mother and Kaiser WHhelm to reconcile Wllhelmlna and the Prince Consort, it is generally be lieved, will not prove successful. In the end a royal divorce seems sure. Prince Henry Cordially Hnted. There is little doubt that the Prince would be mobbed were he to oppear on the streets. He is so thoroughly hated that the thea ters throughout Holland have withdrawn his pictures from cinematograph exhibi tions. According to the story current in court circles, Alde-Ue-Canip Van Tet's Injury re sulted, not from the Prince's sword, but from a treacherous kick In the stomach by the Prince.

It is believed that, while tho Chlet has had knowledge of the girl'a movements for Several days past, he is moved to-day to give It out for the first time by the feeling against Wilcox, whom The girl herself has shown no inclination to exonerate. Captain Velllnes said to-day that he had sent a detective to Elixabeth City, and that the report of this man.

But no one has ever seen her cry in pub lic Her pride is truly queenly, and those who arc acquainted with her character and temperament are positive that she will never forgive her husband, and will not long endure a position Intolerable to any but the weakest of womankind. KGLAM1 DEEPLY INTERESTED. London, Dc ".The domestic Infelicities of European royalties have never come so prominently before the public as have to day the difficulties of Queen Wllhelmlna of tho Netherlands the dramatic circum stances of which form one of the chief topics of conversation. The romantic halo surrounding the young Queen end the keen Interest taken in her marriage only help to accentuate public curiosity and sympathy. Moreover, it is realized that Holland's scandal may have grave pol cal conse quences for Europe, and hence its develop ments are followed closely by statesmen. While those best fitted to Judge Incline to the belief that It will all blow over for the present, there are grave apprehensions for the future. From a personal point of view. England is more deeply concerned In the scandal going on in Hesse, where one of Queen Victoria's granddaughters is on the verge or separation from her husband. This youthful marriage the Grand Duch ess of Hesse was only 18 when she exchanged ner British for a British continental title l-a proved to be one of the mot unatls- f?ctof?' amf, he rf'a" matches; and the climax, it Is believed, would have been reached ere this had It not been for the ,ate Qtleen victoria's Imperious influence. The DuIce of Edinburgh's other daughter, the Crown Princess of Roumania, according to common report, also leads a none too happy marital existence, though recent ru- mors ot an open rupture are met with strenuous omciai aeniai. However, no one In England would be sur prised to hear that she is figuring In a role similar to that of her sister, the Grand Duchess of Hesse. Then there are scandalous goings on in the courts at Belgrade and Lisbon, but tbeso have been so long before the public as to need no comment. MRS. SNOW GETS LIFE INTEREST IN WELLS. Federal Judge Bryant Files His Opinion Granting Hen Claim of One-Eighteenth. REPUBLIC SPECIAL. Beaumont, Tex., Dec 7. Federal Judge Bryant filed a most Important opinion late this afternoon In the case of Sirs. Annie E. Snow vs. The HIgglns OH and Fuel Com pany et al., involving one-eighteenth life Interest In the Veatch 8urvey, on which Is situated all of the wells In this field, ex cept five or six. The opinion states that a difficult question arises in regard to the rights of a life tenant, as respects petroleum oil obtained from the land, and that there sems to be no decision in Texas courts on this point, and but very few in the Federal courts in fact, none directly In point. The court denies the correctness of the defendant's claim that the husband's min eral right did not pass to the wife, stating that the husband's property was either per sonal property or lands, and when con sHered In either light, the mineral right would pass to the wife. The court thinks that the complainant (Mrs. Snow) Is entitled to one-eighteenth of the pi! marketed, after the expenses of marketing hare been deducted.

' AIMS TO GUT DOWN THE REPRESENTATION Representative Crunipaeker Says South Has Too Many Congressmen.

Representative Crumpacker of Indiana i try determined In his intention to force the hou-- to take action looking tov.-nrd.the reduction uf the representation Iri Congress from certain Southern States hcre. it ! alleged by him that the negroes j0 not have a chance to vote. The Indiana man headed a similar movement Iat year, but nothing came of it. He believe-, tl-at he 'will have hefler suc cess at this session, and that a bill will be passed establishing a Bc.jy apportionment. Mr. Crumpacker talked of his plans to The Ripublic correspondent to-day as follovs: "Personally, my notion Is that the repre sentation of all State.tvought to be reduced where there has been! a sufficient disfran chisement of m.ile citiiens to warrant It un der the proisons oftthe Fourteenth con-r-tltutlonal nmendmenf. There are several propositions perding before Congress at the present time haing this for their object. One of them was Introduced by Representa tive Moudy of Massachusetts, one was pre sented by Representative Dick of Ohio, and jrrterday I introduced'a bill amending sec tions one and two of the apportionment liv.- that was passed last winter.

"My measure simply -provides fur a reduc tion of the membership from 35'J to 37.!, tak ing off three from Alabama, one from Flor ida, three from Louisiana, cwo from Missis sippi, three from North Carolina and two irom soum Carolina. I based this appor tionment on the percentage of male citi zens. 21 ears of npe anil upward, that are disfranchised by State election laws. "That there Is discrimination of this kind, and to the extent indicated In my bill, can be determined with mathematical certainty, because the census returns show the exact number of disfranchisements In nil th" States." In resporse to a question of whether or not he thought the movement to cut down representation from the South would cause sectional feeling similar to that product d by the Force bill of ten years ago. Mr. Crumpacker said: "I think not, becausW if action li takn alone? the lines T tirnr.ntw.1 It u Ill l. .1AnA ! in pursuance of an Imperative requirement i me -.unsiitutton. It 'is not a discretion ary matter with Congress, excepting, of course, that this is a political pow-er. and there Is no siipericrpov ex to coerce It.-tmt the Constitutlsn peremptorily requires this kind of action. Therefore, there can be no deep-seated and permanent feeling of hos tility on the part of the States to be af fected " i Does Xot Fear the Result. When nsked what would be the effect of such legislation upon the white men's par ty in the South. Mr. Crumpacker replied that he had little faith in an organization of this kirl. "I have not given that ques tion much consideration." he said, "because I have never had any faith in the white Re publican party, in the South or iin-wher-else. The Republican partv Is not I.ni!

It Is an Impossible thing that ir.cre snouiu ue a white Republican party anyw here. "I am very hopeful of some lclsive ac tion, but whether it will be along the lints that I think most expedient or some other is a matter that I am not sure about. In Iew- of the fact that there are several propositions of the same nature pendlsg. I concluded thit It would be better to have the whole question determined In a Repub lican caucus, and. therefore, have prepared and hnd signed a petition for the call of a caucus. Caucus Will Determine Matter. "The caucus will determine what r .inv. action will be taken upon the question of disfranch'sement. It is likely that the can- eus will not be called until after the holi days because a great many members wish to bo away during the next two weeks, and It Is desirable that there should be a full attendance. "I hae twice enough signatures to se cure a caucus and the only thin? that, re mains is to lix the date. Every man signed the petition who had an opportunity, ex cept one. and he was a Republican of one of tho Southern Slates, and probably feared he might be embarrassed if he signed.

YATES OFFENDED? It Is Said He Has Preferred Charges Against British Consul. REPUBLIC SPECIAL. Washington,. Dec. 7. Governor Yates of Illinois arrived here this morning and took luncheon with President Roosevelt. A great deal of Interest attended Sir. Ynies's .nm. Ing. owing to the published report that he had been summoned here by the President for the purpose of explaining why he issued the proclamation for the relief of t!i Boer's. Secretary Cortelyou, however, says that this is not the case. VAIl that Is known of Governor Yates's visit at the White House," he said. "Is tha fact that he asked the President If he would see him to-day. The President made an en gagement for the afternoon and then de cided to have the Illinois Chief Executive. Join the luncheon party. The Boer incident has nothing to do with the matter, so far as we know." As soon as Governor Yates appeared at the Arlington Hotel, another report began to make the rounds. It was to the effect that he had come to Washington to place a charge before the State Department that Captain William Wyndham, the British Consul at Chicago, nasi made remarks con cerning the Illinois Governor which could not be overlooked. Sir. Yates was very dignified under the storm of Inquiries which these reports caused and refused to discuss the matter.

An audience of about X0 had appeared when, 'alout ten minutes before the time for the curtain to rise, a messenger handed to Mr. Ucsegang, the director, a note from Mr. I.uckstene which read: "Gordon and I have decided not to sing to-night because we are tired out." Mr. L'esesang. Sir. Southwell. Sir. Janno poulo. the s:age manager and everybodv flse in authority did heroic things for about ten minutes In the effort to arrange some sort of satisfactory performance for the e enlng.

They un derstood the situation and gave me to un derstand that they would help all they could to make the season a success.

I am not yet able to say. We have spent about $4,3W more than we ha-e received since the season opened. Whether we shall no.v be able to carry out our original plans remains to be seen. "I do not believe the small audiences have been due to any lack of appreciation on the part of St. Louisans for the really excellent work of our company, but to the strong counter-attractions. With Ben Hur' out of the way, I am sure our sup port would have been satisfactory." After the audience had departed the sing ers, nearly seventy In all, and the members of the orchestra congregated In the dark ened fojer and on the steps of the great building and talked over the situation in gloomy tones.

Another week has closed with both factions in the Slissouri light claiming a victory, but with the sur- eorship at St. Louis still a deadlock, so far as any definite announcement, or even hint of his intentions, can be had from President Roosevelt. Charles Parsons; of St. Louis reached Washington this morning and had a private conference, with the 1'resMent nhoill the I Missouri situation. The President listened attentively to Sir. Parsons, tut gave co in formation as to who will be appointed Sur veyor. It is said that Mr. Parsons' was re quested to come here on behalf of the Akms side, and his talk with the President, It is understood, will make Smith's chances for reappointment even less, If possible, than they have been lately. It Is claimed now by all the Aklns men. as a point settled beyond all question, that Smith will not be reappointed. They say that, no matter what the final outcome may be. Smith is no longer under consideration at the White House. Where the President la Concerned. The question giving the President con cern Is whether he shall appoint Boyd, and give the Aklns men a clean-cut victory, or let Kerens down a little more softly by naming a third man, acceptable to Aklns. But there has been no third man yet men tioned who would be acceptable to that side, and late to-night Kerens's opponents say that they will take no one but Boyd; that suggestions of a compromise arc out of the question. Representatives Joy and Bartholdt have not weakened in their de mand for Boyd's appointment. The Kerens men have made no gains to day, and the most they hope for how is the defeat of Boyd. Whether they can accom plish this will depend upon how much long er they can have the matter held up. They are playing for delay, and claim that no decision will be reached before the end uf another week. Wenneker appears to be out of it. The suggestion of his name as a compromise was scoffed at by all "the anti-Kerens men. It seems, therefore, reasonably well set tled that Boyd, or a man not yet named, will be the next surveyor. The chances will continue to favor Boyd while the Aklns men remain unshaken In .their op position to any third man.
