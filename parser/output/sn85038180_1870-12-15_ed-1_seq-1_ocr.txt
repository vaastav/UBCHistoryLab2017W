To the Senate andllouge'nf Hepraientativet : A year of peace and general prosperity to this nation has passed since the last as sembling of Congress. We have, through a kind Providence, been blessed with abundant crops, and have been spared from complications and war with foreign nations. In our midst comparative har mony has been restored. It is to bo re gretted, however, that a free exercise of the elective franchise has by violence and intimidation been denied to citizens in exceptional cases in several of tho States lately in rebellion, and the verdict of the people has thereby been reversed. The States of Virginia, Mississippi and Texas have been restored to representation in our national councils. Georgia, the only State now without representation, may confidently be expected to take her place there also, at the beginning of the new year, and then, let us hone, will be com- pleted the work of reconstruction, with an acquiescence, on the part of the whole peopie, m me national obligation to pay mo puonc ueoi created as the price of our Union, the pensions to our disabled sol diers and sailors, and their widows and orphans, and in the chances to tho Con stitution, which have been made necessa ry by a great rebellion. There is no rea son why we should not advance in mate rial prosperity and happiness as no other soon alter the existing war hrnkn nut. in Europe, the protection of the United States Minister in Paris was invoked in favor of the North Germans domiciled in r rench territory, Instructions were issued to grant the protection. This has been followed by an extension of American protection to citizens of Saxony, Hesse and Saxe Coburg Gotha, Columbia, Port ugal, Uruguay, the Dominican Republic, Jicuador, Chili, Paraguay, and Venezuela, in Paris. The change was an onerous one. requiring constant and severe labor as well as the exercise of patience, prudence and good judgment. It has been per formed to the entire satisfaction of this government, and as 1 am officially inform ed, equally so to the satisfaction of the government of North Germany. As soon as I learned that a republic had been De claimed at Paris, and that people of Franco nau acquiesced in the change, the Minis ter of the United States was ordered bv telegraph to recognize it and tender mv congratulations and those of the people of me, united states, mere-establishment in t ranee of a system of government dis connected with the dynastic traditions of Europe appeared to bo a proper subject ior tne icncitation oi Americans. Should the present struggle result in attaching tne nearts oi tne French to our sunnier iorms oi representative government, l will be a subject of still further satisfac tion to our people. While wo make no effort to impose our institutions upon the miiuuiuiius oi oiner countries, ana while we adhere to our traditional neutrality in civil contests elsewhere, wo can not be lndiilercnt to the spread of American po litical ideas in a great and highly civilized country like France. We were asked by the new government to use our good of- nces jointly witn tnose ot the European powers in the interest of peace. Answer was "muo uml Lno established policies ami the true interests of tho United States forbado them to interf'ero in the European questions jointly with European powers. I ascertained informally and un officially that tho government of North Germany was not then disposed to listen to such representations lroni any powers and though earnestly wishing to see tho blessings of peace restored to the bellig erents, wiin an oi wnom tne united states are on terms of friendship, I declined on the part of this government to take a step which could only result in injury to our true interests, without advane inn t ie oh. ject for which our intervention was in yoked. Should the time come when the action of the United States can hasten the return of peace by a single hour, that ac tion will be heartily taken. I deemed it prudent, in view of the number of persons of German and French birth living in the united Mates, to issue, soon alter the of ficial notice ot a state of war had been received from both belligerents, a procla mation defining tho duties of the United States as a neutral, and the obligations of persons residing within tho territory to observe their laws and the laws ot nations, The proclamation was followed by others, as circumstances seemed to call ior them The people thus acquainted, in advance. ot their duties and obligations, have as- sisted m preventinu violations of the neutrality of the United States. It is not understood that the condition of the insurrection in Cuba has materially changed since the closo of the last session of Congress. In an early stage of tho contest the authorities of Spain iniuigur ated a system of arbitrary arrests, of close confinement, ot military trial and execu tion of persons suspected of complicity witn tne insurgents, and oi summary ein: bargo of their properties and requisition ot their revenues by executive warrant, Such proceedings, as far as they effected the persons or property of citizens of tho United States, were in violation of tho treaty of 17U5 between the United States and Spain. Representations of injuries resulting to several persons claiming to becitizensot the United States, by reason ot such violation, were made to the Span ish government, from April, lnh'.i, to June last, the Spanish Minister at Wash ington had been clothed with a limited ower to aid in redressing such wrongs. That power was found to be withdrawn in view, as it was said, of the favorable situ ation in which tho island of Cuba was then, which, however, did not lead to a revolution or suspension of the extraordi nary and arbitrary functions exercised by the executive power in (juba, and we were obliged to make our complaint at Madrid In the negotiatn gotiations thus opened, andstill pending there, tho United States only claimed that for the future the rights se cured to their citizens by treaty should be respected in Cuba, and that as to the past a joint tribunal should bo established in the United htates with lull jurisdiction over all such claims. Before such an im partial tribunal each claimant would be cquired to prove his case. Un the other hand, Spain would bo at liberty to traverse every material lact, and thus complete equity would be done. A case which at one time threatened seriously to affect the relations between the United States and (Spain has already been disposed of in this way. 1 ho claim ot Lloyd Aspin wall, for the illegal seizure and detention 

OHIO, THURSDAY, of that vessel, was referred to arbitration, by mutuul consent, and ha resulted in an award to the United States, for the owners of the same, of $19,702 50 in gold. Another and long pending claim of like nature, that oi the whaleslnp Canada, has been disposed of by friendly arbitration during the present year. It was referred, by tho joint consent of Brazil and the United States, to the decision of Sir Ed ward Thornton, her Britannic Majesty's Minister at Washington, who kindly un dertook tho laborious task of examining the voluminous mass of correspondence and testimony submitted by the two gov ernments, and showed there was due to the United States the sum of one hundred thousand seven hundred and forty dol lars and nine cents, in gold, which has since been paid by the Imperial govern ment. These recent examples show that the mode which the United States have proposed to Spain for adjusting the pend ing claims is just and feasible, und that it may be agreed to by either nation without dishonor. It is to be hoped that this moderate demand may be acceded to by Spain without further delay. Should the pending negotiations unfortunately und unexpectedly be without result, it will then become my duty to communicate that fact to Congress and invite its action on the subject. The long deferred peace conference be tween Spain and the allied South Ameri can republics has been inaugurated in Washington under the auspices of tho United States. Pursuant to the recom mendations contained in the resolution of the House of Representatives of tho 17th oi iecemter, 18ob, the Executive Depart ment uie goverment ottered its friendly unices ior tne promotion ot peace and harmony between Spain and the allied repumic. Hesitations and obstacles oc curred to the acceptance of the otter. - it Ultimately, however, a conference was arranged, and was opened in this city on the 2(Jth of October last, at which I au thorized the Secretary ot State to preside. It was attended by the Ministers of Spain, Peru, Chili and Ecuador. Inconseouenco oi tho aosenco oi a representative from Bolivia, the conference was adiourned until the attendance of a plenipotentiary from that republic could bo secured or inner measures coma De adopted toward compassing its object, .'iiio allied and other republics of Spanish origin on this continent may see in this fact a new proof ot our sincere interest m their welfare; to see them blessed witli good govern ments, capauio ot maintaining order and preserving their respective territorial in tegrity, and of our sincere wish to extend our own commercial and social relations with them. The time is probably not far distant, when, in the natural course of events, the European political connection with this continent will cease. Our poli cy should be shaped in view of this prob ability, so as to ally tho commercial inter ests of the Spanish American States more closely to our own, and thus give the United States all the pre-eminence and all the advantago which Mr. Monroe. Mr, Adams, and Mr. Clay contemplated when they proposed to join to tho Congress of I anama. curing tne nisi session ol congress a treaty for the annexation of the republic ot San Domingo to the United States failed to receive the requisite two-thirds vote ot the henate. 1 was thoroughly convinced then that the best interests of the country, commercially and materially, demanded its ratification. Time has only confirmed mo in this view. I now firmly believe that the moment it is known that tho United States have entirely abandon ed the project ot accepting as a part Of its territory the island of San Domingo, a free jjuii, m im nrguuiueii ior uy 1.U- .. A! T- Al It P CI luijean imuons. in tne nay oi oamana a large commercial city will spring up, to which wo will bo tributary without re ceiving corresponding benefits. The folly ot our rejections has aggrieved the gov ernment ot San Domingo, which volun tarily sought this annexation. It is a weak power, numbering probably less than ono hundred and twenty thousand souls, and yet possessing one of the rich est localities under the sun, cajiablo of j supporting a population of ten millions of people in luxury. The people of San Domingo are not capable of maintaining themselves in their present condition, and must look for outside support. Thev yearn ior the protection ot our tree insti tutions nnd laws,, our progress and civili zation. Shall we refuse them? ' The acquisition ot San Domingo is desirabl because of its" geographical position. It command the entrance to tho (Jaribbean Sea and the Isthmus transit of commerce. It possesses the richest soil, best and most capacious harbors, mostsalulirious climato and tho most valuable products of the forest, mine and soil of any of the West India islands. Its possession bv the Unit ed Mates will, in a lew years, build up a coastwise commerce ot immense magni tude which will go far toward restoring to us our merchant marine. It will give to us those articles winch we consume greatly and do not produce, thus equalizing our exports and imports. In case of foreign war it will give us command of the islands eferred to, and thus prevent an enemy irom again possessing a rendezvous on our coast. It protects our coast trade between the States bordering on tho Atlantic and those bordering on the Gulf of Mexico, Now, as to the Bahamas and the Antilles, twice we must, as it were, have passed through foreign countries to get from Georgia to tho west coast of Florida. San Domingo, with a stable government uniler which her immense resources can be developed, .will give remunerative wages to ten thousand of laborers not now upon the island. This labor will take advantago of every available means of transportation to abandon the adjacent islands and Beek the blessings of freedom and its sequence, each inhabitant reeeiv- ng the rewards ot his own labor. I'orto Rico and Cuba will have to abolish slavery as a measure of self-preservation to retain their labor, San Domingo will become a large consumer of tho products of North ern farms and manufactories. The cheap ate at vhich her citizens can be furnished ith food to the Island, and. machinery, ill mako it necessary that contiguous islands should have the Same advantage in order to compete with the produotion of sugar, coli'eo, tobacco, tropical fruit, Ac. This will open to us a wider market for our products. The production of our own supply of these articles will cut off more than ono hundred millions of our annual imports, besides increasing our exports. With such a picture it is easy to see how our largo debt abroad is ultimately to be xtinguished. With a balance ot . trade gainst us, including the interest of tho 

DECEMBER 15, i 1 . i.. i.i i p uviiua uki'x uy loreigncrM, and money miijHui.-iiin tn our citizens traveling in foreign lands, equal to the entire vield of precious metals in this country, it is not so easy to sec how this result is to be oth erwise accomplished. The acquisition of rmn Domingo is an adhesion to the Mon roe doctrine. It is a measure of national protection. It is asserting our justclaiin to a controlling mlluence over the great commercial iramc soon to How from the West to tho Eat, by way of the Isthmus of Darien. It is to build our merchant marine. It is to furnish new markets for the products of our farms, shops and manufactories. It is to make slavery in supportable in Cuba and Porto Itico at once, and ultimately so in Brazil. It is to settle the unhappy condition of Cuba, and end an exterminating conflict. It is to provide honest means of paying our hon est debts without taxing the people. It is to furnish our citizens with the neces saries of every day life at cheaper rates than ever before; and it is, in (ine.a rapid stride toward that greatness which the intelligence, industry and enterprise of the citizens of the United States entitle the country to assume among the nations. In view of the importance of this question, I earnestly urge upon Congress early ac tion expressive of its views as to the" best means of acquiring San Domingo. My suggestion is that by a joint resolution of the two Houses of Congress the Executive be authorized to appoint a commission to negotiate for a treaty with the authorities of San Domingo for the acquisition of that island, and that an appropriation be made to defray the expenses of such commission. Tho question may then be determi the action of the two Houses of Congress upon a resolution of annexation, as in the case of the acquisition of Texas. So con vinced am I of the advantages to flow from tho acquisition of San Domingo, and , vi mui viiiiii;,ini of the great disadvantages, I might almost say calamities, to How lroni non-acquisition, that I believe the subject lias only to be investigated to be approved. It is to be regretted that our represent ations in regard to the. injurious elfects, especially upon the revenues of the United States, of the policy of the Mexican gov- viuuivuo in I'At'iupLiiigirom import unties a large tract ot ders, have not only been fruitless but that it is even proposed in proposed in that country to extend tho limits within which the privilege adverted to has hitherto been enjoyed, me expediency ot taking into your serious consideration proper means for countervailing the policy referred to will, it is presumed, engage your earnest attention.

The government at rekin. however, seem tn i' . . . . ' . . .... have been disposed to fulfill its treatv oh- ligations so far as it was able to do so. Unfortunately the war between the Ger man Mates and f ranee reached China soon after the massacre. It would appear that the popular mind became nossessod with the idea that this contest, extending to Chineso waters, would neutralize the Christian influence and power, and that tious mass might expel all foreigners and uie time was coming when tho supersti restore mandariun mlluence. Anticipating trouble from this cause, 1 invited France and iNorth dermanv to make an author zed suspension ot hostilities m the East. Where they were temporarily suspended by act of the commanders, to act together 1'.,,. !. i.: .. ,, ui wiu miure iiruiucuun in i nina oi the lives and property of Americans and Eu- opeans. Sinco the adjournment of Congress the ratifications of the treatv with Great Britain, for abolishing the mixed Courts lor the suppression of the slave trad have been recognized. It is believed that tho slave trade is now confined to the eastern coast of Africa, where the slaves are taken to Arabian markets. 1 he ratifications of the naturalization convention between Great Britain and the United States huvo been exchanged during tho recess, and thus a long stand ing dispute between the governments has been settled in accordance with the prin ciples contended ior nv tne united states. In -April last, when engaged m locating a military reservation near IVmhimi, a corps ot engineers discovered that tho commonly received boundary line between the United States and the British pos sessions at that place is about fifty-seven hundred leet south ot the true position ol tho zenith parallel, nnd that the lm when run on what is now supposed to be the true position ot that parallel, would leave the fort of t lie Hudson Bay Com pany at rembina within the territory of United States. 11ns information being communicated to the British government, 1 was requested to consent, and 1 did consent, that tho British occupation of tho fort of tho Hudson Bav Company should continue for the present. I deem it important, however, that this part of the boundary line should be definitely fixed by a joint commission of the gov ernments, and submit therewith estimates of the expense of such a commission on the part of tho United States, and recom mend an appropriation for that purpose. I ho land boundary is already fixed and marked from tho summit of tin Rocky Mountains to the Georgian Bay. It should now be in a like manner marked from the Lake of the Woods to the summit of tho Rocky Mountains. I regret to say that no conclusion has been reached for the adjustment of tho claims against Great Britain growing out of the course adopted by that government during tho rebellion. Tho Cabinet of London, so far as its views have been ex pressed, does not appear to bo willing to concede that her Majesty's government was guilty of negligence, or did or per- 1870. mitted any act during the war by which the United States lias just causo of com plaint. Our firm and unalterable con victions are directly the reverse, and therefore I recommend to Congress to authorize the appointment of a commis sion to take proof of the amounts and the ownership of their claims on notice to the representatives of her Majesty ut Wash ington, and that authority be given for the purchase of these claims by the Unit ed States, so that the government shall have the ownership of the private claims, as well as the responsible control of all the claims against Great Britain. It can not be necessary to add that whenever her Majesty's government shall entertain a desire for a full and friendly adjustment of these claims, the United States will enter upon their consideration with an earnest desire for a conclusion consistent with the honor and dignity of both na tions. The course pursued by the Canadian authorities toward the fisherman of the United States during the past season has not been marked by a friendly feeling. By the first article of the convention of 181 , between Great Britain and the Uni ted States, it was agreed that the inhabit ants of the United States should have forever, in common with British subjects, the right of taking fish in certain waters therein defined. In the waters not in cluded in the limits named in the con vention were those within three 'miles of ports of the British coast. It has been the custom for many years to give to in truding fishermen of the United States a reasonable warning of their violation of tho technical rights of Great Britain. The Imperial government is understood to have delegated the whole or a share of its jurisdiction or control of these inshore fishery grounds to the Colonial authoritv, known as the Dominion of Canada, and this semi-independent but irresponsible agent has exercised its delegated powers in an unfriendly way. Vessels have been seized without notice or warning, in vio lation of the custom previously prevail ing, and have been taken into the colon ial ports, their vova"ns broken tin. and the vessels condemned. There is no reason to believe that this unfriendly and vexa tious treatment was desi" was desiL'ned to hem- harshly upon the fishermen ofthn I'tntcrl States, with a view to political effect upon the government. 1 he officers of the Do minion of Canada assume a still broader and more untenable jurisdiction over the vessels of the United States. They author ize orlicers or persons to bring vessels hov ering three marine miles of any of tho coasts, boys, creeks or harbors of Canada into port to search the cargo, and examine the master, on oath, touching tli onv.m i : ... . . . ... . . . . t voyage, ana to millet upon him heavv . 1 y.-i;uiiuu-y penalty ii tne true answer were not given; and it such a vessel is found IiM-p.irijig to nsn wniiin three marine miles oi any such coasts, bays, creeks or harbors, without a license, "or after the period named in the last license granted to i t, they provide that the vessel with her tackle, 4c, tc, shall be forfeited. It is not known that any condemnations n ive been mr.di under this statue. Should the authorities in Canada attempt to en- i'. : -..'u , . . . . force it, it will become mv dutv to take such steps as may become necessary to protect the citizen ofthe United States. It has been claimed by her Majesty's offi cers that the fishing vessels of the United States have no right to enter the open ports of the British possessions in North America, except for the purpose of shel ter and repairing damages, purchasing wood and obtaining water ; that they have, no right to enter at the British Cus- toil! llniisou nr tr tr.wln ...... n. chaseof wood and water ml tt,t ti,J must denart w t i n fimnir.f,. t . -I- ter not ce to leave.

So far as the ciaim is loumied in an alleged construc tion ot the convention of 1H1S. it, rnnnnr be acquiesced m by the United States it is hoped that it will not bo insisted on by her Majesty's government. Duriii"tl conf'erence which preceded the, negotia tion oi ino convention of ISbS the British Commissioners nronosed to expressly exclude the fishermen of the United States from the m-ivilese of carrying on trade with any of her Brit anic Majesty's subjects residing within the limits assigned for their use, and al so that it should not be lawful for the vessels of the United States, engaged in such fishing, to have on bourd anv uoodi. wares or merchandize whatever, except such as may be necessary for the prosecu tion of their voyages to and from said fishing grounds, and any vessel of the United States, which shall contravene this regulation, mav be seized, condemn ed and confiscated, with their cargoes. This proposition, which is identical with the construction now put upon the lan guage ot tho convention, was emphatical ly rejected by the American commission- and thereupon was abandoned bv the British plenipotentiaries, and Article J as it stands m tho convention, was sul stituted. If, however, it be said that this claim is founded on provincial or colonial statistics, and not upon the convention,' this government, can not but regard them as unfriendly, and in contravention of the laithtul execution ot which the Im perial government is alone responsible. Anticipating that an attempt mav nossi-. bly be made by the Canadian authorities in the coining season to repent these tui- ncighborly acts toward our fishermen, I recommend you to confer upon the Exe cutive the power to spend by proclama tion the operations ot the laws authoriz ing tne transit m goods, wares and mer chandise m uond across me territory of tho United States to Canada; and fur ther, should such an extreme measure become necessary, to suspend the opera tions of any laws whereby the vessels of the Dominion of Canada are permitted to enter the waters ot tho United States. , like unfriendly disposition has been manifested on tho part of Canada in the maintainance of a claim of a right to ex clude the citizens of the United States from the navigation of tho St. Lawrence. The river constitutes a natural outlet of the hikes to the ocean, with an aggregate population of about 17,(100,000 inhabitants, and with an aggregate tonnage of Gi)l,iJti7 tons upon the waters which discharge in to it. The foreign commerce of our ports on these waters is open to Jintish compe tition, ami the mahir part of it is done in British bottoms. It the American sea men be excluded trom tins natural ave nue to the ocean,'tho monopoly of tho di rect commerce of tho lake ports with the Atlantic would bo in foreign hands, their vessels on trans-Atlantic vovages having WHOLE NO. 1232. an access to our lake ports, which would be denied to American vessels on similar voyages. To state such a proposition is to refute its justice. During the adminis tration of Mr. John Qnincy Adams, Mr. Clay unquestionably demonstrates the natural right of the citizens of the United States to the navigation of this river, claiming that the act of the congress of Vienna, in opening the Rhine and other rivers to all nations, showed the judge ment of European jurists and statesmen that the inhabitants of a country through which a navigable river passed havo a natural right to enjoy the navigation of that river to and into thesea, even though passing through the territory of another T,Aurf. Ti.:a .1 L t m i, j uh riiib uura uui inciuae tne coequal right of the soverein possessing the territory through which the river de bouches in the sea to make such regula tions relative to the policy of the naviga tion as may be really necessary, but these regulations should be framed in a liberal spirit of comity, and should not impose needles, burdenss upon tho commerce which has the transit. It Jias these re quirements by mutual agreement. The United States are ready to mako any reasonable arrangement as to the po lice of the St. Lawrence which may bo suggested by Great Britain. If tho claim by Mr. Clay was just, when the popula tion of the States bordering on the shores of the lakes was only 3,400,000, it now de rives greater force and equity from the increased population, wealth, production and tonnage of the States on the Cana dian frontier. Since Mr. Clay advanced his argument in behalf of our rights, tho principle for which he contended has been frequently and by various nations recognized by law or by treaty, has, been extended to several other great rivers. By the treaty concluded at Mayence, in 1831, the Rhine was declared free from the point where it is first navigable into the sea. By the convention between Spain and Portugal, concluded in 1835, the navigation of the Dour throughout its whole extent was made free for tho subject of both crowns. In 1853 the Ar gentine cofederation by treaty threw open the free navigation of the Parana, and Uruguay to the merchant vessels of all nations. In 1850 the Crimean war was closed by a treaty which provided for the tree navigation ot the Danube. In 1858 Bolivia, by treaty, declared that it regarded the rivers Amazon and La Plata, in accordance with the fixed principles of natural law, as highways or channels opened by nature for the commerce of all nations. In 1850 the Paraguay was marie free by treaty, and in December, 1800, the Emperor of Brazil, by Imperial decree, declared the Amazon to bo open to all the frontier of Brazil to tho merchant ships at" all nations. The greatest living British authority on the subject; while asserting the abstract right of the British claims, says it seems difficult to deny that Great Britain may ground her refusal on strict law, but it is equally difficult to deny, first, that in so doing she exercises harshly an extreme and hard law; secondly, that her conduct with respect to the navigation of the St. Lawrence is in glaring ami discreditable in consistency with her conduct with respect to the navigation of the Mississippi. On the ground that she possessed a small do main in which the Mississippi took its rise, she insisted on this right to navigate the entire volume of its waters. On tho ground that she possessed both banks of the St. Lawrence where it disemliotiges into the sea, she denies to the United States the right of navigation through about one half of the waters of the lakes. Ontario, Erie, Huron, and Superior, and the whole of Lake Michigan through which the river flows, are the property of the United States. The whole nation is interested in secur ing cheap transportation from the agri-"" cultural States of the West to tho Atlan tic seabord. To the citizens of those States it secures a greater return for their labor; tothe inhabitants of the seal ward it offers cheaper food, and to the nation an increase in the annual surplus of wealth. It is hoped that the government of Great Britain will see 'the justice of abandoning the narrow and inconsistent claims to which her Canadian i rovinees have urged her adherence. Our depressed commerce is a subject to which I called your special attention at the last session. I suggest that we will, in the future, have to look more to the countries south of us, and to China and Japan, for its revival. Our representa tives to all these governments have exert ed their influence to encourage trade be tween the United States and the coun tries to which they have been accredited, but the fact exists that tho carrying is done almost entirely in foreign bottoms, and, while this state of affairs exists, wo can not control our due share ofthe com merce of tho world. That between the Pacific States and China and Japan is about all the carrying trade now conduct ed in American vessels. I would recom mend a liberal policy toward that line of American steamers, one that will insure its success and even increase its usefulness. The cost of building iron vessels, the only ones that compete with foreign shi-i in the carrying trade, is so much greater in the United States than in foreign coun tries, that without some assistance from the government they can not successfully be built here. There will be several prop ositions laid before Congress in the course of the present session, looking to a reme dy for this evil. Even if it should be at some cost to the National Treasury, I hope such encouragement will be. given as will secure American shipping on the high seas, and American ship buildingat home. The condition of .the archives at tho Department of State calls for the early action of Congress. The building now rented by that department is a frail struc ture, at an inconvenient distance from tho Executive Mansion and from the other departments. It is ill adapted to the pur pose for which it is used, has not capacity to accommodate tho archives and is not fireproof. Its remote situation, its slen der construction and the alisenceof a sup ply of water in the neighborhood, leave but little hope of safety for either tho building or its contents in case of the ac cident of a fire. Itsdcstruetion would in volve the loss of the rolls containing the original acts and resolutions of Congress and the historic records of the Revolu tion, nnd of tho confederation of the wholo series of diplomatic and consular archives since the adoption of the Constitution, and ofthe many valuable papers left with that department when it was the princi pal depository ofthe government archives. 1 recommend an appropriation tor tho construction of a building for the Dei' mcnt of State.
