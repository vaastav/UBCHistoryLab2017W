A corre s|M>ndenl writes Iroin New Orleans on the lid, that on that morning, in the United States Court. Judge Durell, presiding, United States District Attorney J. R. Bretwith called up the. case of Perry Fuller, ex-Collector of New Orleans, against w hom nineteen indictments had been found by the Grand Jury for fraud ul? nt entries of sugar andcofl'ee during bis term of office, the civil cases tried last year resulting in every case in a verdict of confiscation against the con signees, August E. Contourie Jt .Co. Tne -whole amount involved was some millions of dollars. The caies have been compromised in Washington by tbe pavmeut of the duties, but criminal charges hgainst the officers of customs, through whose active connivance the frauds were perpetrated, remained on the docket. The United States District Attorney endeavored to bring these to an issue. The result is seen. Perry Fuller was called twice on his bond to appear. His sureties, Alexander M. ' McDonald, United States Senator from Arkansas, and E. G. Ross, United States Senator from Kansas, were then called upon to bring the body of Fuller into court. They waited to make au ?wer. District Attorney Beckwith moved for an a'ias capias, stating that the bonds were taken to Washington and I seemed to be very imperfect, if not ! worthless. The order was made. Wad- j dv Thompson, against whom charges of a similar character had been found, was then called on and also failed to appear. District Attorney Beckwith stated that tbe bond of the accused had been stolen at Memphis. Thompson bad been several times arrested at Memphis, near which city he owns a magnificent plantation, but has always been released by obliging the courts on a writ of habeas corpus. The correspondent after the citing of thir teen cases found against Fuller and his associate, to illustrate the heoious na ture of the charges, says : The prosecu tion ol these cases in the civil courts will cost the government at least $100 <KK), and after confiscation had been de creet!, in%every ease, a compromise has been effected by the simple payment of duties, which the party is willing to pay j from tbe first. The main argument on trial was that it was the officers of the United States Custom House who were really the guilty offenders. These have been : released on straw bail or at least upon informal recognizances and thus this ! much vaunted vindication of the integ- J rity of the revenue laws ends in a costly 1 tizzle There is a big mouse in tbe meal tub somewhere, and more than two Uaited States Senators together with a distinguished Congressman from Indiana could probably give informa tion on tbe subject, t*-C?DK? iMWtet Malliiift Kiiklii* Ins lu Tennenaee?

It was reported here last night that the Ptew dent and Admiral Porter had been re conciled, and that General Sherman has been acting as peacemaker, It is argued by Admiral Porter's friends that as General Sherman wa a promised be fore the rank of General of the army was abolished, so Admiral Porter should be allowed to succeed to the office made vacant by the death of Farragut before any action is taken oo General Logan's joint reeolation. Much curiosity has been evinced in regard to the original manuscript of Porter's let ter to Welles. It is how on file inifce N*vy Department, but it is assuraTthat it has been recently put there.
