Seveml years ago I was walking np Third etrva; with 'Pet' Strahan. She was superbly dressed and was the pic ture of health, beauty and contentment. I well remember that Bhe attracted the attention of every paseetby. As we passed the corner of Yamhill street I noticed standing there leaning against the wall of the building a most abject fellow.

"The effect was electrical. The young fellow braced himself up, stood erect and a smile bespeaking that there was still kindnwa in the world spread over his featnres. "Then she dived into her purse, placed a coin in his band and returned to me My curiosity was aroused, and in spite of an effort to control it, I said : ' 'Pet,' who is jour disreputable look lag friend:' " 'Oh,' she replied, I have known him always. From earliest childhood, be was an orphan. We attended the tame school, and at that time my heart went out many days to him. He was not quick in his studies, was sick and weak ly, nnfit for the struggle of life from the beginning. Today, as we passed, I thought I recognised him, and God put in thought into my bead to go back to him. fie knew me; said he bad seen me several times before in my visit to Portland. I could see the hue of con sumption in bis face, that despairing yet hopeful look that none can describe. Then I did something that I hope yon will not be harsh with me for Laving done. I said to myself, this boy thai the world disowns, that was born to poverty, that has filt the pangs of hun ger, upon whom death has set bis grasp, shall know one happy dav, if it is in m power, and in bis hand I placed a twenty-dollar piece. "There was a sadness in her tone and 1 her eye bespoke that the tear was nigh, when she continued : " 'Sometime, oh so often, I think that there may come a time when I now favored and petted of all may be as abject and forlorn, may be as hopeless a wreck as the poor boy I have jnst left. But outwardly none will ever know, but if that time ever does coo-e, may God send a friend even for a passing moment. Someone who recalls old day and old mem oriee.' "1 could hardly believe what I bad seen and heard," continued the gentle man.
