In the antagonism of parties there is always a variety of questions upon which there are di versified opioions, and upon these minor points it is teldtm that either party can tnmmaad uni ted action. But it it essential lo all parties claim ing to bt national in their aims, their policy and their influence, that upon ths leading questions of the day, there shsll be that nnity which it es sential to success snd; permanency. No pattv can ever maintain tbe ascendency by merely lio'Jisg to a negative.pnlicy. Of this we bavt familiar illustration in the present divided d -feated ceti'lition of the Democracy, To luccessf'jl, parties must sssert something affirm ai;e and resolutely and persistently, sus tain it. On thai leading question, there can no equivocation. This rule was demonstrated in the case of African slavery.

Parties had previously Ihe question of slavery in the back ground, when it forced itself to tbe front, they had lo sides upon it or .perish. By this force of Hit old Whig party became defunct and br this same process of dissolution, the Democratic party is slowly but surety passing to its political grave, there to await its resurrec tion in a pu rilled state. Tbt affirmative position occupied by the publican narty in refermee to tlovery, hat suited after ten years of eventful conflict in CO nptete overthrow of that infamous institution Tnat being ended, what is tht next question tv'td its place in public discussions sod for t ion on which tbe Ki iuiMican party must a clear and unequivocal position, or givt ultimately to some other party which shall m tre aggresaire f ll is this : shall the working m -n of this nation enjoy the fruits of their bur, or shall tht monopolists and speculators take the lion's share of itss they are now Uader the head of monopolists we include r iad sharpers, high tariff pluoJarers, public grabbers, Tammany Hall Ibieves in short, t lose who prosper by what they filch f runs public.
