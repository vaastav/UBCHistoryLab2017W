Address iffg DAILY GLOBE, St. Paul, Minn. sobsgbiptM PRICrT" eeduced, Tin- "Globe" Hereafter to be Fur* nished at Lower Kates and the Qual ity as Well as Quantity Improved. Readers of the Globe have been frankly advised of the tendency among the leading papers to reduce their rates to the public. This course, for some time, has been inevitable. The price of news papers had not, until recently, been reduced since the. advance which took place during the war. Nearly ever} - thing else has suffered a decline, but news papers have stood at one dollar per month, the same as in 1865. There was some reason for the retention of "war prices," as labor has increased rather than a runaway accident a few days ago, is con valescent. ;';:_. The Globe has, however, decided to meet the popular demand for cheaper newspa pers, without impairing the quality of the paper. In fact, it will be greatly im proved in every respect, no labor or ex pense being spared to make it still more complete as a news paper than it his been. With the intro duction of its new perfecting press the ' Globe will be increased in size to an ex- . tent equal to the addition of five of its J present columns. The plans for addi- j tional news service, which cannot be fully - developed until our new quarters and new < press facilities are available, are simply ' immense, far surpassing anything ' heretofore attempted in this locality. ' All of this we hope to . have , duly inaugurated early in January, when - our new thirty thousand dollar press, with t a capacity of producing fifteen thousand c newspapers per hour, is set in operation. t To reduce the price of a newspaper and a correspondingly cheapen the subject mat- c ter it affords, would by no means be ap- E predated, but when coupled with the re- B duction, improvement in every department takes place, we feel sure the movement will f ' be welcomed. a The publishers of the Globe have, ac- 8 cordingly decided, notwithstanding the c increase in size aud quality proposed, to *« make the price of the paper, on and after 6 December 1,1883, 

EIGHT DOLLARS w PER YEAR, for seven issues per week | a delivered by carrier.?, and SIX DOL- •■' LARS PER YEAR for six isnnes per week, ' (Sunday's issue omitted) sent by mail. t i As a first class newspaper is thus placed M within the reach of all, it is trusted that b, the circulation of the Globe will only be limited by the population within its geographical radius.

LOADED"^ 3TAYOR. When that celebrated knight errant, Don Quixote, was traveling in search of adven ■ ture.his vivid imagination was always con juring up imaginary foes who were anx ious to test the prowess of his lanco. In all of his visionary, engagements he was ably seconded by his companion and servant, Sancho Panza, who invariably saw the same sights and recognized the • same per ils as those which confronted his master. .The Mayor of St. Paul is evidently "de sirous of playing the part of Don Quixote to a coterie of Sancho Fanzas. Having set himself up as, par excellence, the great moral reformer of this community, he has impudently assumed that all. other offi cials, and especially the city council, are in favor of vice, and his own personal deadly foes on account of his distinguished virtue. The wonderful contest which he is waging—in his mind's eye—has so' wrought upon him that he re cently announced, at an official meeting, that he had armed himself in self defense, and proposed to valiantly defend his re form principles at the mouth of the revol ver. The special apprehension of the Mayor seemed to be Mr. P. T. Kavanagh, one of our prominent and reputable bujiness men, whose alleged opposition to the moral reforms of the Mayor render ed the hip pocket arsenal a necessity. The windmills which Don Quixote imag ined were desperate and deadly foes, have their counterpart in the morbid retina of oar reform Mayor. Instead of Mr. Kavanagh beia_; an opponent of the Mayor's on the moral reform question, he administered a very just and fitting re buke to Mr. O'Brien, by refusing his (O'Brien's) urgent reqnest to go upon the bail bond of a disreputable woman who was being defended in the courts, by the present Mayor, for the violation of the famous ordinance No. 10. Col. Allen, the president of the council, is another, imaginary foeman of the Mayor, who seeing in him a contestant of dire dimensions, requested a gentleman to notify the pastors of the leading churches last Sunday, that their congregations must be on the alert to repel the coining on slaught of Col. Allen and his fellow coun cilmen, upon the bulwark of onr liberties— known as ordinanoe No. 10. The male members of the respective congregations were accordingly called into secret council last Sunday evening and requested to ap pear, for the purpose of moral effect, at the council meeting last evening. A goodly number responded' to the note of alarm sounded by our "loaded" Mayor, only to find out that the city council have Dot the slightest idea of coming to the rescue of our modern Don Quixote by placing him in the cate gory of a martyr to moral reform. It was simply a gratuitous and impudent insult which the "loaded" Mayor accorded the council when he sent. his appeal for help to the churches. He is neither in danger personally or otherwise, and his public announcement that he is "loaded," is simply a ridiculous reflection upon him self. He need give himself no uneasiness ' about his personal safety or his "moral" '• reform. The council is composed of a ] body of honorable men, who, to put it ' mildly, have got as much interest in the , welfare of the city and its good name j as the pastors who were bamboozled < into firing their alarm guns last Sunday 1 night. The honor and morals of the city ' san be a good deal more safely trusted in ' their hands than in thos3 of our "loaded," and pompous Mayor, because they are ] jool headed, intelligent, sensible gentle- t nen, to whom the public interests can be » iafely intrusted. i The sooner our "loaded" Mayor asoer- * sains that the movements of the plane- v ;ary system do not depend upon his nod 8 md wink, and that he is not _ uperior to the combined wisdom of r leeturies, the sooner will he cease to erect I vindmihs on which to shiver his lance, c Jood people lived before he was born, and £ re might modestly express the belief, even .t the risk of mortally offending his ma estic Mayorship, thai there are at least a t _ ew of cotemporary existence who are c ; qually as earnest in genuine morality, as S( he attorney who .broke friendship with n. Ir. Kavanagh because he would not go a! ail for Kittle Smith. hi •■ ■ oi 

DOMINION HOMESTEADS. A The Canadian minister of the interior la anoauced last week an important change b: f policy regarding the distribution of mds in the northwestern portion cf the ominion. The "southern reserve," the ex- ** msivo region between the Canadian Pa- pi fio belt and the United States line, com- _ rising some four million acres, whioh was ci ithdrawn from settlement in 1882, is to wt > opened for homestead and pre-emption ■tries after the : first of next muary. This region is ', in- tel rseoted by a branoh of the Canadian ° icifio railroad, and for some distance by _" o Manitoba & Southwestern railway^ and C is believed that it will be rapidly taken W° > by settlers. Another extensive tract about to be chi rown open for settlement is the "mile m It,— that is, the even numbered sections *'■< ong and on both sides of the . Canadian J; icifio railway. This was withdrawn in *■**•* arch of last year, but is announced to be opened January Ist, 1884, for the bene- y< _ of aotual settlers who will reside en g *{ sir claims, and on the condition that the cupants will reduce at least one-fourth J each quarter section to cultivation Tw thin the period of three years after *° iking entry. The large reserve connect with the Regina town site, about 350 -_/ ties west from Winnipeg, will likewise be . _ eedily offered for sale at $5 per acre, to . na fide settlers, only, and in quantities >t to exceed one quarter section to each irehaser. With this privilege of par- - ase are coupled also the same condi- aI >ns of residence and culti tion as. in the case of homsteads jos the mile belt, and after the expiration dai three years the settler who has con- ere rmed to these requirements will be enti- cult >d to a rebate of half the original par- son ase money, and to the patent for his "**** -3 d. Should he fail, however, the gov iment reserves the - right to cancel the - le and return the purchase "money to the rec yer without interest. \ ges The rapid extension of settlement on the cot lie lands in Dakota and Montana ■ has pre pellsd the x Dominion gov- leg intent to make unprecedented th« orts to secure to its own domain as large w*t hare "as possible of - the foreign i immi- I*>ai itibrTto America}- and under the stimu- an^ of^the mdjiuements^ aboveJn - « •tb^MeXt&aiJLtij'K^^ j^j THE ST. PAUL DAILY GLOBE, WEDEJSTSDAT MORNIIHG DECEMBER 5.1883. Canadian Pacific railroad will be rapidlj peopled. The condition of the soil enc the climate are claimed to be in most re spectsas' favorable to * agriculture, anc stock raising as they are on this side o: the line, and the inducements offered art fully as liberal as those accompanying th< privilege of occupying the public lands belonging to the United States'. CURRENT COMMENT. The organic law of the territories provide) for each having three United States judges, oni of whom is' designated as chief justice. Thi system works badly in the fact that the threi justices in general term form the ; territoria court of appeals, and each member is ' accord' ingly caused to sit in review upon appeals fron his own decisions. To obviate this the peopli of Dakota are petitioning for the appointmen of a fourth district judge, which is the numbei congress . has bestowed upon- Wyoming. It Montana the public interest is worse off thai elsewhere, as there are only two district judge! in that territory. Last April the president war induced to suspend Judge Conger, of the Firsi district, on charges which apparently have nol been maintained, but the clique who secured his suspension have hud sufficient interest in Wash ington to prevent its removal. Senator Conge st Michigan, a brother of the judge, has taker the outfit in hand, and those who know him art of the opinion that there will be hair flying ir Washington before the judge is officially decap itated. Meanwhile, there has not been a^civi case tried in eastern Montana^einceiihe fall ci 1882, and no criminal trials nave been held ir Custer county since last May, nor can "there bo any, from present appearances, before the spring of 1884. The propriety of reducing, the number oi p^rts of entry in the United States is made mani fest by some of the figures in the report of the secretary of the treasury. There are useless easterns districts sustained only to cater to local pride or interest. There are twenty-two ports of entry at which it has happened that not a dollar of duties has been collected for years. There are thirty-two ports of entry in which the year's collections from all sources have ' not equalled the year's expenses. These' had; ; im portance when foreign trade was carried on in sailing vessels, and before the concentration of importations at large ports from regular lines of steamers, and the present system of rapid inland transportation. The custom houses in these districts are, however, kept up, with all the formalities of activity, with deputies, inspectors and clirks, whose sole duty is to draw their emoluments, and to make official returns to the accounting .officesJ of the j treasury and the bureau of statistics. The sinecuris'ts must go. The navy department is anxious to send the United States ship-of-war Shenandoah, now lying im Boston harbor, around "the Horn" to California, but great difficnlty is experienced in securing officers and men to conduct her. It is complained of her that she is an unseaworthy tub. One officer who was on her on her last long cruise declares that she is likely to go down at any time in a heavy blow at sea. She is too heavily sparred and armed, and is noto rious in the navy for rolling more than any other vessel in the service. In addition to these serious disadvantages, her accommodations are said to be inferior and uncomfortable. Ween we have so few naval vessels it seems a pity that any of them shoal ■ be unfit to send to sea. Ix view of the fearful prevalence of late of murders and outrages in rural districts, where, through the incompetence of the local police, the perpetrators frequently escape detection, a proposition has been made that in each state there should be a central detective corps at tho disposal of th? attorney general. They will be available for securing evidence in civil cases coming under the jurisdiction of that official, and would furnish for the solving of criminal problems a staff of cool-headed, capable detec tives, free from local prejudice, and expert in ferreting out malefactors. Some system should certainly be adopted for bringing to justice the host of murdering fiends, whose misdeeds. fill such space in the columns of the daily press of the country. The sound Democratic objection to Mr. Blame's fair sounding proposition to divide the ax on spirituous and malt ligaors among the ■tates in the basis of population, is that it would nake the people of the states dependent upon he national government for their revenue, and vould substitute national for state agencies to upport local institutions. It would tend to lostpone indefinitely the much desired revenue oform. The states can well provide their ewn evenue, and are amply possessed of machinery or its collection, and no real saving cou'd be ffected in this respect by a bid of that kind rom the federal government. Visiting the National park is rot wholly de oid of inconvenience.

GREAT POOL. THE RUMORED COMBINATION BE TWEEN THE AT. . PAUL AND 9 UNION PACIFIC. ' " ' 3 i The Story Neither Denied nor Affirmed— A General Belief in Its Truth—The Terms of the Arrangement.. s •• "■!'•> ■ 8 1 Special Telegram to the Globe. J B Chicago, Deo. 4.The announcement c that a traffic agreement ; had been entered 1 into between the Union Pacific, Rock Is land and Milwaukee roads, caused consid -1 erable excitement, and still forms the prin i cipal topic of : discussion in railroad cir r cles. Although it has been rumored for j some time • past, that a movement was on i foot by which these three roads were to i form an offensive and defeneive alliance 9 as far as the Nebraska and Colorado busi t ness is . concerned, still there t were few who . believed that 3 the consummation of such an . arrangement was really contemplated. c The general opinion was that the rumors i were rather started for the purpose of 3 securing concessions from the Chicago, x Burlington & Quicoy. The Union Pacific . has for some • time been trying to secure 1 allies east of the Mississippi river, bat did E not succeed until now on account of the , reluctance of the lowa lines to break up , their pooling agreement. By a system of , discrimination in favor of the St. Paul and Rock Island the Union Pacifio at last succeeded in gain ! ihg its end, when the St. Paul . gave its notice of withdrawal from the , lowa peol about two weeks ago. The . Union Pacific general manager and gen l eral freight agent at once appearod upon , the scene and labored assiduously , with the St. Paul and Rock Island officials for several days to prevent them from , changing their position. The St. Paul, it . appears, was only too willing to accede to ■ the wishes of the Union Pacific, and conse quently the Rock Island, although re luctuantly, also decided to cast its lot with the same road. Ever since these roads have been figuring on the new traffic agreement and have finally come to an understanding. The agreement entered into last Saturday will have yet to be approved by the direc tors of the three roads, and for this reason hopes are entertained that the directors of one or the other of them may put a veto on the arrangement. The officers of the Rock Island and Union Pacifio left for New York Saturday evening for the principal purpose, it is claimed, of bringing the natter before the directors of their roads and having them act upon it at once. Whether the Northwestern is to be admitted into the new combination or not is still an op9n question. General Manager Marvin Hoghitt had a long conference Saturday afternoon with the general managers of I the Union Pacific and Rook Island regard ing the matter, and it is stated the latter j showed a willingness to admit the North-! western tnto the combination provided that road would make come concessions to the other liae^ regarding the Sioux City & Pacific busi- \ ness west of the Missouri Pacifio. No definite information could be gained at the Northwestern offices yesterday regard ing the matter, Mr. Hughitt being out of ' town. It was stated at the office that Mr. ! • Hugnitt had gone to Wisconsin, but it is j 1 rumored New York. A prominent officer < of the Northwestern said the road had ' entered into no arrangements as yet with ' the Union Pacific and the other roads, but ' admitted the matter had been under ' consideration. He said the North- < western was for maintaining < peace among the lowa lines and would « use its best efforts to that end. But if war ' came the Northwestern was prepared for it and would protect its own interests. It was evident from his remarks that the t Northwestern is not disinclined to join the Union Pacifio, St. Paul and Rock Island * combination, if a reasonable arrangement _ with those roads can be made. The rea son that the combination is willing to ad mit the Northwestern is said to be a de- f sire on the part of the St. Paul and _ the Rock Island to prevent "a _ war of rat', on Northwestern _ business. With the Northwestern road in i the combination the Northwestern rates _ cannot be disturbed, as neither the Chi cago, Burlington & Qaincy nor . the Wa- _ bash can get to St. Paul and beyond ex- a cept over the lines controlled by the Rock _ Island, St. Paul or Northwestern. If the f agreement is consummated the Chicago, f Burlington & Qaincy, Northwest- „ era, Pacific and Wabash will be compelled to fight the combination, and one of the most bitter wars ever fought n among western roads will result. As stated S above, if the Northwestern comes into the p combination the Northwestern business B cannot be affected by such a war, but it in- ci solves the Southern Railroad association d and the Colorado Traffics association, a3 p well as the lowa Trunk Line association. t< What steps the Chicago, Burlington &, $ Qnincy, Missouri Pacific and Wabash roads ul frill take to meet the forces of $'. he . Union Pacific and its allies M is yet a matter of speculation. Pc General Manager Potter of the Chicago, $; 3urlington & Qnincy, is at Bnrlington cvi- t* lently discussing with President Perkins $1 That course to pursue, g The other officials F< if the Chioago, Burlington & Qnincy claim $1 o know but little regarding the matter, an >ut they say if the war does come off they Ft rill be well prepared for it, and that their ta oad will be able to inflict more. damage ta: pon the Union Pacific combination than he latter can upon their line. To Extend to Bismarck. I Special Telegram to the Glebe.'] A Chicago, Dec. 4.—President R. R. Cable, f the Rock Island, left for New York on ist Saturday evening, accompanied by Ir .H. H. Porter, a director of his road, to on ttend the meeting of the board of direct- in< rs in that city. The fact that Mr. Porter do ocompanied Mr. Cable on this trip mdi- gls ites that the directors of the Rock Island ga itend to take action regarding the pro- ho osed line from Albert Lea to Bismarck, > »ak. It is understood that the Rock Island an ill push the new line from Worthington, be; linn., to Ordway through Moody, p _ like, Kingsbury, Clarke and Brown conn- ___ es, Dakota, connecting at Ordway with a rJrt iad to be bnilt by a syndicate, headed by by :. H. Porter, through MoPherson, Mcln- & ( >sh, Logan, Emerson and Burieigh conn- xh es to Bismarck. This bold strike for the an , orthwestern territory has been contem- ma lated for some time, bnt the Rock Island P o is not taken definite form till now.
