It is under the supervision of A. E. Hoffman, a famous butter expert, who for 30 years has made butter, judged butter and taught butter making in leading dairy schools. Famous in the butter world Mr. Hoffman was famous for the peculiarly sweet, delicate flavor of his butter. He puts this same sweet, delicate flavor into Troco. The white, nutritious coconut fat which replaces butter fat must meet an exacting laboratory test. All milk used comes from selected herds and is twice pasteurized. What you can't expect Troco is the fancy brand of nut margarin, with quality standardized. You can count on fresh, appetizing deliciousness. What you can't expect is price cutting to compete with other brands. Troco may always cost a few cents more., Ask your dealer. If yours hasn't it In Btock tell him to order it.
