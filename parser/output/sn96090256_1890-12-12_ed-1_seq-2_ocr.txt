FIRESTONE & ULTON, LIME SOUTH DAKOTA The Huron papers say that there is considerable interest manifested there in the official canvass of the votes cast in South Dakota, at the late election, had in Pierre,Dec. 4. We have had no news of tho result of the canvass, but there is little probability that any ac tion will be taken that will change re suits already announced. A Sioux City Journal special of Dec. 3, says:—All the members of the state canvassing board, which meets at Pierre to-morrow to canvass the result of the late election, have arrived. The board will be composed of Gov. Mellette, Judge Corson. Sucvetary Bingsrudaud Auditor Taylor, who will make the canvass in the presence of Attorney Gen. Pollard and Lieut.-Gov. Fletch- er. Indians rannot vote. The recent amendment was mi necessary. In vol ume 112 of tli'! United Slates report, page 94, the .Supreme Court of the United St Hits hold* that an Indian born a member of oho of the lndiiin tribes within the United States, which tribe still exists and is recognized by the government of the United States, is not a citizen of the United States.— Yunhton I'IVSS and Dakoian. The Westing ton Springs True Re publican, remarks that "Or. Clougli managed the campaign admirably." This is the first intimation the STAR has had of the admirable management of the campaign. Not one public state republican speaker visited this county. The democrats sent Bartlett Tripp here, while the independents had three slate speakers in the county dur ing the campaign. The mission of the Iri.sh envoys in America has suddenly come to an end. After reading the result of the test vote in the Parnellite meeting in Lon don, O'Brien and Dillon decided that their presence was urgently needed in Ireland, and have cancelled their en gagements for Kansas City, St. Louis, Omaha and other points, and will leave for Paris immediately. The remain der of the party will sail, Saturday, for Liverpool. Old Ireland stands by Par nell, and repudiates the Chicago man ifesto of the envoys. The following ordinance will be presented to the Lead council at the very next meeting: "Be it ordained, etc: Sec. 1. That any person wrong fully appropriating any newspaper left in the doorway of a business house or dwelling shall lie deemed guilty of misdemeanor. Sec. 2, Any person guilty of such misdemeanor shall upon conviction thereof be fined for the first offense one hundred dollars and one month in the county jail. For the sec ond offense he shall be hung by the neck until dead."—Deadwood Tintes. The Pierre Capital of Dec. 2, in an editorial way, thus expresses himself in regard to Elder Cressey's mission to this state. It seems his mission was not beneficial to Mr. Moodv as it was intended to be. E. T. Cressy, who has been in this state some weeks laboring in the interests of the re-election of Moody to the United States senate showed poor judgement and a lack of good political sense by expressing bis opinion so freely on the capital ele& tion. Had he confined himself to facts it would have done Moody's cause Ie:s harm, but even then it would have been a mistake. When Cressy stated that 12,000 fraudulent votes had been cast for Pierre he knew that the state ment was a falsehood. He knew—if he has any political sense whatever— that the friends of Pierre would resent such scurrilous statements. Neither Cressy's former reputation nor his present campaign will materi illy in crease Moody's chances for re-election. The Sioux City Journal of yesterday morning, Dec. 4, prints an excellent letter from the pen of Col. E. E. Clough, which tells of the efforts put forth to build 'he home, and the benefits to be derived from it ft will be remember ed by our citizens that Col. Clough was elected president of the board of com missioners at their list meeting in this city, and in choosing the Sioux City Journal for the publication of bis let ter he exhibited praisworthy discern ment. Tbe Journal during the Indian fiasco has shown that it appreciates the position in which South Dakota has been placed by the slanderous stories of "warlike" correspondents written for easten. papers, The-Journal has been rather conservative and is in elined to allay rather than promote the excitement of settlers and their eastern friends. Its reports have been the most reliable, if not the most blood curdling, and tbe people of South Da kota should appreciatotbu and always have a warm place in weir hearts for the Sioux City Journf 

TIIE MESSAGE. Congress having duly assembled and the President having submitted his annual message, it is presumed that it is generally read by the masses of people. The following comment* of the Pierre Capital concisely sums up the contents, and voices the general opinion of the public on the im portant'document "The president's message is an able document, though conservative. It is republican to the core and treats in a sensible common sense way all the important questions that concern the g. vrntiietit. He pives a careful resume of our relations with foreign countries. Evidentlv reports about our national treasury lie ing empty were false. The message sets forth the fact that the revenues of the government from all source* exceed the expenditures by $105,000,000. There is a surplus in the treasury, partially estimated, is 152,000,000. The wilt* department gets but slight at tention. The beet sugar industry is deemed worth of attention. The Mc Kinley bill is in(liiv«ed, and reciprocity is earnestly recommended. The president urges t'.:e passage of several important laws by the fifty first congress. The election law* get. more attention than nnv other subject. His remarks ave so opportune on this all important question that no one should fail to read them. Altogether the president's message is just such a document as we would expect from such a careful painstaking president as President Harrison. Every sentence bears the mark of thoughtful, consideration."
