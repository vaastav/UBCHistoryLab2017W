Kits of sailors lost at sea are sold regularly at auction at the Albert docks In London. Tre sale provides many a, pitiful sight. Most of the lots are con tained in the regular sailor's sea chests, all marked with the name of the ship from which they come. Ono sea chest which came up for auction recently was that of an unfortunate Chinese cook who was eaten by c.an nnibals. Among other contents the! box contained two choppers, a large knife and the picture of an English, woman in a frame. It is not unusual for those who have lost friends or rel atives at sea to attend these auctions, and there are times when the first news of such a loss comes through the Tecognltion of familiar objects.

UNCLE SAM SHORT OF PUBLIC LANDS FOR HIS CITIZENS Standing Rock and Cheyenne Last Chances in Former Great American Desert. Washington, Dec. 14. I'ncle Sam is ho longer rich enough tu give us all a farm, but last session of congress he mailo preliminary arrangements to give farms to over 16,000 of UP. and the peo ple of South Dakota want them Just as soon as possible. Tiwy will be carved out of the Stand ing- Hock and ('hey en no river reserva tions In that Mate, and 2,GOO,000 acres of Rood land will be given away Just ns soon as the preliminaries can be at tended to. They will not be actually donated the land must be appraised and sold but in fact it will amount to almost a donation. The opening of this immense tract— said to lj• the last great area which the government will have at its dis posal for homesteading purposes—illus trates the sad fate of the Great Amer ican Dese rt. Two generation ago ev erything west of the Mississippi was the desert. Then it moved along, and everything west of the Missouri as l'ar as the Cascade mountains was desert. Then states grew up in the desert, and great cities flourished, and the desert was driven into colse quarters. Finally the bad lands of South Dakota became a sort of last stronghold of the theory that a Great American Desert really existed. J'a reel by parcel these wero taken up and turned into thrifty farms. SUM. the Standing Iloclt and Chey enne reservations, inhabited by some thousands of Indians, were regarded as hopeless. One day the Chicago, Mil waukee & St. Paul road announced that it would build to the Pacific, coast, and that its line would pass squarely through these lands. Thereupon people he an wondering if they were worth while. The result was that it was sud denly discovered that they, too, were good lands, and that they needed noth ing but attention. ILast se congress passed an act for openiii: .••(•0.000 acres of these res ervations! t" :eitlement. The govern ment must buy them from the Indians, and then in turn sell them to settlers. As soon us the law passed the desert begun to gain popularity with home steaders. It developed that these were excellent agricultural lands, lying along splendid streams. It was an unex plored region, with a bad reputation because it had long been set off as an Indian reservation. With about 500,000 people, the state of South Dakota has for a number of years been credited with producing a larger per capita of wealth than any other state in the union, its lands have been coming into corresponding de mand, and when it was announced that this big domun was to be opened, in quiries came from all sections. It is now expected that the lands will he opened for the registration of would be homesteaders in the autumn of 1909, and for entry of the lucky ones in the spring of Jinn. The opening will be by the accepted process of registration and lottery drawing the man with the first number having first choice of plats. The best tracts will be wortl/ from $10,000 downward.

COMPANIES MOST NVFST MONEY IN ROTA ?hree-Fourths of Reserve Fund Gathered Within State to Be Invested Locally. Sioux i'aiis. S. D., Doc. 12.—With in fliiinriai supf.ort behind it. a bill will bo introduced in the approaching ses sion of the south Dakota legislature, requiring non-resident life insurance compardes to Invest in South Dakota securities 75 per cent, of their reserve l'und on Sojtu Dakota policies. It is estimated tnat in the lasv 18 years tho life insurance companies have received about 1.000.COO in premiums from South Dakota, and now their annual nceijits from South TXvkota are near the million mark. It is estimated that a law of this kind would mean the in vestment of about half a million dol lars in South Dakota every year. It is argued t'tal the West needs life insurance funds for its development, more than the East for speculative \cntures. In South Dakota it is nec t-Ksury to pay froAi to 10 per cent on farm mortgages, and is asserted that if the life insurant" companies gave South Dakota a banco to burrow their funds under such a law, tho interest rate would fall. Such a law has been in force in Texas and the insurance i.mmiss-oner of that state, in response to hiquiry from Soutii Dakota, stated the law has proved very satisfactory to Texas.

PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT SENDS MESSAGE ON BROWNSVILLE AFFAIR Would Empower Secretary of War to Reinstate the In nocent Negroes. MESSAGE IN BRIEF. Washington, Dee. 16.—In a special Washington, Dec. 16.—Senator For aker today introduced an amendment to the bill providing for the re-enlist ment of negro troops discharged with out honor because of alleged partici pation in the affray at Brownsville, Tex., and addressed the Senate con cerning the amendment. Tho measure is so drawn as to practically take out of tlie hands of the executive and give to a tribunal appointed by congress full authority to consider the. Brownsville question, and by its findings to provide for the re-enlistment of the discharged negroes. Upon the conclusion of Senator For aker's remarks. Senator Culberson asked that the president's message on the Brownsville affair be read. Vice President Fairbanks directed that it le done, all senators present listening attentively lo Hie reading'. The President's Message. The president's message follows: I inclose herewith a letter from the sec retary of war transmitting a report of the investigation made by Mr. Herbert J. Browne, employed by the department in conjunction with Captain W. G. Baldwin to investigate as far as pos sible what happened at Brownsville on the 13th and 14th of August, 1006. The port and documents contain sonic in formation. of great value, and some statements that are obviously worth less. but I submit them in Iheir en tirety. Tho report enables us to fix with tolerable definiteness at least son of the criminals who took the lead in the murderous shooting of private citizens at Brownsville. It establishes clearly the fact that the colored soldiers did the shooting: but upon this point fur ther record was unnecessary, as the fact that the colored soldiers did the shooting has already been established beyond all possibility of doubt. Tho investigation has not gone far enough to enable us to detcrmfne all the facts, ahd we will proceed with it but it has gone far enough to determine with suf ficient accuracy certain facts of enough importance to make it advisable that I place the report before you. It appears that almost all the members of Com pany must have been actively con cerned in the shooting, either "to the extent of being participants or to tho extent of virtually encouraging those who were participants. Plans Reinstatement. "I feel, therefore, that the guilt of the men who, after the event, thus shielded the perpetrators of the wrong by refusing to tell ,the truth about them, though serious, was in part due to the unwise and Improper attitude of oth-. ers, and that some measure of allow-' ance should be made for the miscon duct. In other words, I believe we can afford to reinstate any of these men who now truthfully tell what has hap-" pened, give all the aid they can to fix the responsibility upon those who are really guilty, and show that they them- selves had no guilty knowledge before hand and were in no way implicated in the affair, save by having knowledge of it afterwards and failing and refus ing to divulge it. Under the circum-1 stances, and in view of the length of time they have been out of the service and their loss of the benefit that would have 'accrued to them by continuous long-time service, we can afford to treat the men who meet the require-' ments given above as having been suf ficiently punished by the consequences they brought upon themselves when they rendered necessary the exercise of the disciplinary power. I recommend that a law be passed allowing the secretary of war, within a fixed period of time, say a year, to reinstate any of these soldiers whom he, after careful examination, finds to have been innocent and whom he finds to have done all in his power to help bring to justice the guilty. 4- message to the Senate today I'resl- 4 Ient Roosevelt urged that a law be -t [assed giving the secretary of war power to reinstate any negro sol tliers of the Twenty-fifth infantry who shall be found innocent of coin pliclty in "shooting up" Browns ville, Tex., August 13 and 14, 11KIC. Rvery member of the companies concerned in the raid was dis charged without honor, anil many of them were veterans with excellent records. To secure reinstatement they must tell the truth about the raid, informing on their comrades, -f The president appends to his tnes sage a great number of documents showing negro soldiers guilty of murder committed in the raid on the white inhabitants of the Texas town. As to Companies and D. there can be no question that practically every man in them must have had knowledge that the shooting was done by some of the soldiers of troop, and possibly by one or two others in one of tlie other troops. This concealment was itself a grave offense, which was greatly ag gravated by their testifying before the Senate committoe that they were igno rant of what they must have known. I Nevertheless, it is to be said in partial extenuation that they were probably cowed by threats, made by the more desperate of the men who had actuallv been engaged in the shooting, as to what would happen to any man who failed to protect the wrongdoers. More over, there are circumstances tending to show that these misguided men were encouarged by outsiders to persist in their course of concealment" and de nial. Meanwhile the investigation will be continued. The results have made it obvious that only*, by carrying on the investigation as the war *_opartment has actually carried it on is there the, slightest chance of bringing the offend-' ers to justice or of separating not the innocent, for there were doubtless hardly any innocent, but the less guilty from those whose guilt was heinous.
