Both uouscs of congress expect to eoncludo tho ante-Christmas holidav work of tho session during the present; week. The date of tho adjournment, for the holi days has not yet bcon definitely deter mined, but most probably it will fall on the 21st instant, a week from to morrow. In that event, it is uot ex pected that any business would, be dono on Monday week, because when the dato becomes known members will be leaving for their homes in such num bers that it will bo impossible to main tain a quorum. Tho senate will take another adjourn ment from Thursday until tho follow ing Monday wiihoiit the expectation of doing any business on Moudav be yond providing definitely for the Christ mas recess. Tho house will continue its work until Friday or Saturday, but will thm adjourn until Monday, unless an other plan of adjournment is pursued. Some members who reside in far-distant states are urging that tho adjournment should begin on Saturday, and the lead ers aro disposed to hood". When taken, the holiday adjournment will be until January 1. j Will Deal With Teddy. It is expected that both houses will .rteal during tho week with the question of the paragraph in the president's message relating to the secret, service. The Perkius committee probably will , present its report to the houso early, and in case a resolution dealing with ! the subject is recommended, it will bo acted upon before tho dispersal of the bouso for the holida3's. Tho programme in the senate is to j have introduced a resolution similar io that passed by the house, which author ized a committee to deal with the ques tion and roport back. "Who shall intro duce the resolution aud what committee shall bo designated to perform the serv ice are not yet absolutely determined. It is not anticipated that the question will be discussed to any extent in cither bod.Vj.as all .tXeJLthat ss they. are-deal' ing witli the president a dignified course should bo pursnod. If, however, a cou troversy should be started, it probably would tako a wido Tange and result in much political debate. Somo Houtiuo Work. The house will begin the routine business of the vc-ek tomorrow with the consideration of business pertaining to the District of Columbia, and on Tuesday will continue the consideration of tho bill codifying the penal laws which received much attention during the last session. Thursday and Fridav will be given over to pension bills arfd other private measures, unless there is another appropriation bill ready for consideration. Strenuous effort is be ing made to get reported early in the week the bill making appropriations for the District of Columbia, and if this effort should bo successful the bill should bo paBped bofore the holidavs. In the senate an effort will bo made by Senator Carter to procure the pass age of the bill providing for the estab lishment of postal savings banks, and on Wednesdaj that measure will givo way to the Forakor bill authorizing the re-enlistment of tho negro soldiers who wero discharged without honor becatiso of their supposed participation in tho Brownsville riots of T006. Senator Lodge will talk at ength in opposition to tho Forakor measure, and no incon siderable debate may bo anticipated. If. is not probable that action will be taken on either the Carter or tho Foraker bill during tho week. Tho senate will do voto a part of Tuesday to eulogies on the lifo of the late lioproseutativo George W. Smith of Illinois. The senate census committee will be gin work early in the week on the bi 1 providing for the thirteenth ccubiis. but probably will not be ablo to report, until after the holidaj's. No effort will bo inado in tho sonato to act uron any of tho appropriation bills until in January. NEW

COLISEUM B18 I Mysterious Explosion Destroys ' Adjoining Buildings and j Causes Panic. v,GHiCpO,ADec- ,13: Two buildings wore- wrecked and windows were, shot Cored for a block around by ibo terrilic explosiou of a bomb in an alley in Wabash avenue, uoar Sixteenth street, tonight. Jhe wrecked 1nilding adjoins the Coliseum, where tho first ward ball, the annual revel against the holding of which much opposition has been made, is scheduled to bo held tomorrow night. Tho rgport of the explosion was heard for a mile. The congregation of Grace Episcopal and Wabash Avenue Meth odist Episcopal churches and guests of nearb3 hotels rushed to the streots in a panic. A two-story framo building at 1513 Wabash avenue, which adjoins the 6outh wall of the Coliseum annex, immediately collapsed and took fire. The lire leaped across an areaway and spread to another framo building, also wrecked. Properties of the Coliseum stored in the two buildings added fuel to the flames. Crowds 01 excited peo plo, believing that tho Coliseum had been blown up, rushed to tho sceno. The police and firemen began search ing among the debris in the belief that tho peoplo wero in the building. It was reported that two men had entered one of the buildings a short time be fore. Intendod for Colisoum. Thai the bomb was intended for tho Coliseum the police express little doubt. One theory is that the bomb was thrown as another caper of tho "gamb lers' war" which has been marked bv 1 tho throwing of a series of bombs in 1 the vicinity of tho alleged gambliug I resorts. Tho twenty-sevontliexplosion in that series occurred a few weeks ago. The first ward ball has long boon a ! source of contention. Last week Rev. W. O. Waters, rector of tho Episcopal church which joins tho Coliseum on tho north, sought and failed to socuro an injunction to prevent tho holding of tho ball on the ground that it was prejudicial to tho morals of the com munity. Tho ball is supported by "First Warders, " who are represented in tho city council by Michael Kenna and John Coughlin. Tho proceeds of the ball, estimated at from $15,000 to $25, 000 annually, aro used for the cam paign expenses of tho aldermen whoso term expires the following spring.

CASTRO ONCE MORE EETSjm PIT Statement Now Made That Pres ident of Venezuela Is Really Sick Man. LEAVES PARIS TO MEET PHYSICIANS AT COLOGNE Earnestly Desires Settlement of Diplomatic Difficulties That Confront His Country. PARIS, Dec. 13. President Castro of Venezuela and his party left hero to da' for Cologne, where a consultation of physicians will be held to determine upon tho advisability of an operation on the president. If an operation is fonnd necessary Dr. Israel probably will perform it at Berlin. Castro kept himself closely confined to his hotel here, refusing to giv out any statement to newspaper men, ex cept through some members of his suite. Ou the train today, however, he ac corded an interview to a representa tive of the Temps, saying that as he was leaving Franco he felt at liberty to receive a journalist. The interview, while guarded, fully confirms the repre sentations made by Castro at Santaudcr to the effoct that he wanted to settle Venezuela's diplomatic differences and so far as Franco is concerned had al readj' made the first steps in that direc tion. He said, however, that every thing for the moment must be sub ordinated to tho restoration of his health. Ground of Contention. While avoiding a direct question as to what he expected to do toward set tling Venezuela's foreign quarrels, he made it clear that the resumption of diplomatic relations with France de pends entirely upon the settlement of the French Cable company controversy. "It is incontestable, " he said, "that the French Cable company was against my government in the Matos revolu tion." "But that did not justify the ex pulsion of M. Taigny, tho charge d'affaires."' said the interviewer. "In this, a in other differences with tho powers, r' replied President .Castro, J "Venezuela only.dofondcd,'.herficJf.r j" "But there is also the matter of-the French subjects at Carupabo," con tinued tho interviewer. "I took occasion when I touched there." said the president, "to au thorise their return. That is sufficient ovidencc of mv desire for reconcilia tion. ' ' Keeping up Payments. "And the payment of the diplomatic debt under The Hague award?" "The payment has not ceased." re marked Castro. "In default of a French representative at Caracas, the monthly payments have been deposited with tho State bank of Venezuela." Asked why he had refused to allow the Brazilian legation to act for France, President Castro replied: "Because Brazil has chargo of the interests of the United States and in the interest of the good relatious and solidarity of the American republic it was deemed inadvisable to permit a neighboring republic to look after the affairs of an European power." President Castro assorted that Vene zuela desired peace and harmony with Franco and tho other powers, but de clared such a condition was dependent upon others as well Venezuola. HOW 

"NIGHT RIDERS" VIEW THEIR CASE UNION CITY, Tenn., Dec. 33. Clad in rough homespuu and alwavs with the inevitable long-barrolcd rifle or big pistol in view, the denizens of the Reel foot lake district assembled in this qunint littlo town today for the open ing sceno of the night rider trials. They aro friends and relatives of the men held under guard awaiting trial for tho murder of Captain Qucntin Rankin. Thoy feel keenly this trouble and the' believo that they are being perse cuted. Old Tom Johnson, who, tho state says, wa6 the first leader of tho band, but who was deposed because his immense stature and mutilated hand made him easy to identify, expresses tho belief of all when he says: "It's like this heah. stranger. God IIo put them rod hills' up thcah. An' Ho put some of us pooah folks that Ilo did uot have room for nowah else up thcah, too. An' then Ho saw that wo couldn't make a livin' fnrmiii', so IIo ordored an earthquake, an' the enrth quako left a big hole. Next He filled the hole with watah an ' put fish in it.
