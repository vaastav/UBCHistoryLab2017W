''*'chlcago has entertained a greater crowd of farmers, cattlemen and ranch men this week than has been seen on lier streeta for years, the occasion being the two great live stock shows, the In tematlonal Live Stock Exposition and the National Live Stock Exposition. Thousand* of farmere and cattlemen, ranchmen with broad sombreros and high top boots, whose homes are where they hang their hats, and m»n who have grown rich and own large tracts of land and great herds of cattle, have been enjoying the opportunities offered. Dele gates and visitors have been so numer ous that Secretary Wilaon Bpoke of them as acres of people. In the big exposition buildings speci mens. of the finest cattle, hogs, horses Mid other animals have been seen at their best. Their owners have been striving for honors and prizes, and for the lion's share of attention from the 4 gaping crowds of city folk. 3 What surprises many of the city folk Is that then who, by their dresfe, would stteta to be In need of th« price for food or drink will step up to the auction stool and bid 16,000 and more for a single bullock, then dig down Into their boots or generous pockets and produce a bank roll which "can spare the thousands without losing Its size. The exposition has been declared by com* judges to be the largest and finest of its kind in the history of the live stock industry, and incidentally it ha* traded to show that Chicago is the great cattle center of the world, and that it Is the financial And shipping heart of the Industry. tCOROHY IN LI8HT AND FUEL The economies that are constantly be ing effected Hi the use of fuel and light are noteworthy and satisfactory fea turss of the present progressive era. The other djfty reference was made to a new ly Invented soft coal stove that will con sume smoke and revolutionise heating in this direction. New ligtrtlng plants with gas from gasoline are supplanting the old coal gas fixtures. In town a cin gle house or an entire block may be vPeaply heated *nd lighted from one plant. The recent development of many oil elis has led to the use of this oil as a fuel tn new direction* It Is announced that the Santa Fe railway has. ill .Its -engines in California equipped with oil burners and Is consuming at present about 600,000 barrels of oil a year. The Southern Pacific by the end of this year .. .will have 932 engines in service, and all «.wlll be using oil as fast as they can be converted into oil burners. When com pleted these engines will consume near ly 5,000,000 barrels a year. It is possible that newer methods may even effect economy in the amount consumed. It would seem from the present out look that the supply of ihis fuel oil is .assured for many years. The Texas field i-.y Ufa* Bfcauraont still shows surprising results. 9- F. Close, who. has Just re turned from that section of the state, is quoted by the Algona Upper Des Moines as stating that up to date about 10* wells have struck olL They are all in a tract a mile square, called Spindle Top r- Hill, about four mllea out of Beaumont. These will average 1,060 feet in depth. The main pipe is twelve inches, but the last few )iundre4 feet are drilled in solid '.' rock and the hole Is on Of tlx inches across "Whin oil is ttruclrlt comfcs but with terrific force. It is thought the oil would without any plplnfcs above the (VsurtSoe of the ground go 200 feet high. The first gusher opened still flows with undiminished velocity, yielding 100,000 barrel's a day. Ifcta Texas oil is used for ftiel'now, al tfco the Standard Oil Company tests Show it contains SO per cent of illuml nattngotfland 15 per cent,if asphalt. It will be. worth 9# cents a barrel to make Illuminating oil of, and sells now at 30 cents a barrel. It to used' in factories and similar institutions. Furnaces have fceeh arranged by which it Is forced into 'a generator by steam and then turned Into a gaa that burns without smoke or smell. All who use it are saving over two-thirds on their fuel bill besides haV ing a clean and pleasant fuel to handle. The poifats which commend these new departures in lighting and heating are first ^f all cheapness, and then cleanll ness sad ease in handling. Such deslra Me features are bound to effect ft revo lution. lAVINfl, DIP(HlT8 AND 

BANKING IN. A CREASE, The banking statistics of the United States and of the European-nations are such ts to show great increases in the amount of money and deposits, here and abroad. The report of the comptroller of lcfa£rfehcy shows tbit" the various state, national, savings and private ,i banks and trust companies have over |8,G0t,000,000 on deposit, a sum So enor- jhitai that it is hard to grasp." Comparing the volume of business of the savings banks of the United States wlth those of the Shiropean countries, the report shows that In the matter of deposita the UnHed State^ as for years j*stt«aad»at the head, with 2,810, W0, W. Iki «wntry With the next largest sunewt of savings deposits Is Germany, with $1,900,000,000. Auatrla-Hungary follows, With $l,i!01,240,000. The savings deposits In the banks of Francc and the Ubited Kingdom are $864,220 000 and 5829,020,000, respectively. The unly oth er countries with savings deposits of $200,000,000 or over are^ Russia, Belgium and Switzerland. ft1 The average amount to the credit of depositors In savings banks is greatest in the United States, namely, $406.23. The average in Canada is $340.24 In Austria-Hungary, $221.59 Denmark, $168.80 in Switzerland and Australia, $153.84 and $153.30, respectively Servia and Greece, $150.64 and $150.32, respect ively Spain, $142.13 Norway, $124.96, and Russia, $100.!!4. In no other country doasi the average deposit exceed $100. The greatest average deposit per In habitant is shown in Denmark, the amount being $77.88. In Switzerland the average is $65.06 Germany, $37.^4 Nor way, $37.16 Australia, $36.60 Belgium, $31.76 United States, $31.22 Austria Hungary, $27.08 Sweden, $25.36 France, $22.18 Great Britain, $20.62. While the average amount hell by de positors is greater In our nation, the fig ures show that In the average amount per inhabitant there are six European nations ahead of us—a fact which shows there is great need of educating ur peo ple in the mattter of savings. ... Relative to the banking powerJof the world, the comptroller uses as a -baals for his estimates the figures for 3.890 giv en in the 1898 edition of the late M. G. Mulhall's Dictionary of Statistic?, which volume states the amounc Is approxi mating £3,197,000.000. The banking pow er of the United States has been aug-r mented since 1890 by £1,249,00-),000, art increase of 121 per cent. Aggregating the banking power of the United King dom and the Unlr.ed States with the es» timated power of continental Europe and other countries, an increase since 1890 is shown of £1,926,000,000, or 60 per cent. In other words, the world's bank ing power increased from £3,1)7,000,000 In 1890, to £5,128,000,000 in 1901. In noticing these statistics one can not help recalling the predictions cf Bryan and the silver! tea, that the record would be the other way, because of the reign of the gold standard* on which theBe fig ures are baaed. *''-k SUCCESSFUL MAN'S OPINION. The. life of an editor is a strenuous one at best. From morning till night he Is beset by special interests, largely per sonal, peeking favors, and when he has the courage to publish the truth as he sees it he is sure of more strenuosity on the following day when the complaints are made. But often therfe comes float ing into his office from sources least ex pected brief words of encouw-gement, such as the following, which drive away all clouds and m«ke the life "oorth liv ing. Mr, B. Plersol, a very successful merchant and banker and an old resi deflt of Rockwell, Iowa, remits $5 to the T.-It with the following brief expres sions of his vie we: Rockwell, Iowa, Dec. 6, 1901.—Times Republican—My Dear Editors: Here with enclosed find draft for $5, the amount of your demands on me. Many thupiMt to you and your untiring efforts to give the public: a good, clean, newsy paper. I am one of your earliest sub scribers. I have known the paper under its various managements and, if you will pardon me for the flattery, I must say that It is fully up to, and In some respects excels past publications. So thanking you, gentlemen, for the brave, fearless and Impartial way you have handled all political, social, economical ah^i commercial questions (corporate commercial) I am, truly yours, J. B. PIERSOIi. IOWA OPINIONS AND NOTES. •fhe Falrflefd ]dger puts it in this way: "There will be agitation this win ter for the abolition of the petition fea ture of the mulct law and the substitu tion of the secret ballot. Why? In or der that men who are afraid to go on record on the saloon question may sneak in ufcder the canvas." THfe Carroll Herald notices that "the county fair in Iowa is beginning to be an extinct animal. It survives in some quarters where the conditions are help ful to a debilitated system. But it Is gradually passing away and the chances are,that it will be known in the future only in the fossilized form." In revising Jt® criticisms of education al institutions the Nevada Representa tive Is of the opinion that "the board of control has come out of this scrimmage with a very lame apology for grossly unfair conduct." The Newton Journal is of the opinion, as it reads the glowing accounts of foot ball games, that "when parents send their children to college these days they itiay expect them, if they become popu lar, to receive honors for muscle and not fer^thelr brains." "The foot ball game' and the cigaret are pretty good friends of the under taker," declares the Waterloo Reporter. In its estimate of the president's mes sage the 81oux City Journal says: "Thruout the paper there is a high mor al tone, evincing a Just estimate of the responsibilities tlbat fall to the lot of an exalted public position. It would be well if congress could imbibe this spirit and give it dominance in legislative work." According to the Cedar Rapids Ga sette, ''after reading the message care fully the reda and trusts of New Jersey will be able to arrive at the conclusion that their rendcizcoUs is likely to be raided." The Eldora Herald observes that "the republican party put the Chinese exclu sion law on the (Statute books and there has at no time been any reason to doubt that the present .republican congress would re-enact the law, notwithstand ing the shouting' In certain quarters." In noticing thut there will be a num- ber of pardon cases before the Iowa leg islature, the Clarion Monitor expresses the belief that "as a rule It is a good plan to go slow in granting freedom to men who have been' convicted of serious crimes, l^aws are passed for protection of the public, and if men will violate them they should pay the penalty." Tho Burlington Gazette declares: "The Chinese question Is not a new and untried one. The country understands It thoroughly from the experience of the people of the Pacific coast. There are already too many Chinese in the United States."
