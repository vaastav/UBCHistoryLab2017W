It will prove a distinct dioapp ihitmenl to those who expected that it would fully outline the policy of the Ad? ministration in regard to territorial acquisition and other important issues connected with the war with Spain. The President makes no recom? mendations in regard to the future oi our new poaseaaiona or the form of gove nrneiit to be established therein. Discussion of thia subject, the Presi? dent says, will be appropriate after the treaty of peace shall he ratified.

The reoommi ndut.oua made by t Secretaey of War for the increase the regular standing army has t President's hearty approval. "The cm le no question," ho ?lu-lan -thai at this time and probably t some time in the future 100,00(1 ne will I e none too many to meet il u c --iiies of the situation.

The President also gives his in dorse ment lothe recommends! iona? lie-Secretary of the Navy ulativ to the increase ef the navy. Seen tary Long recommends that the cm ?traction of the following warships b authorised: Three battle ships t Tl,."tl() tins displacement, to col 13,600,000 each; tluce armored cruii ?is of 12,000 tons displacement,at a: estimated cost of 14,000,000 -act three protected cruiser?of 6,000 ton displacement, to rort$2J~ri),000cael and six cruisers ot' 2,500 toil*, at cost of $1,141,800 each. Th) malts do not include the ims| of ai mor and armament. President McKinley also join Secretary Long in reeommendinj that the grades of admiral and vice admiral be temporarily revived, "u bo filled by officer? who have special ly 'listingiii-hed tlicmselves in th? war with Spaia." The President urges upon Congreai the importance of c".rly legislntioi providing tor the taking of the twelfth census. Ho points out that during tin- fiscal year a total of $1I8,082,8M waa ' Upended in the payment ofpen sions. The total receipts of the pat? ent office were 11,258,948, and the receipts from the sale of public lands $i,277,09ft. He recommends nn ap? propriation to celebrate the onc-hun? dredtfa anniversary of the founding of the city of Washington for the per? manent capital of the government of t.'.e United States. The alien contract law, he say s is shown by eiperience to need some nmemdment; a measure providing bet? ter protection tor acumen is proposed, and "the rightful application of the eight-hour law for the benefit of labor, and the application of the principle of arbitiation, are suggested for consid? eration." The annexation of Hawaii and the changed relations of the United States to Cuba, Porto Rico and the Philippines render il necessary, in tie President's opinion, for the United States io adopt a maritime policy. "There should Le established," he says, '-regular ami frequent steamship communication, encouraged by the United States, under the American rlic. with the newlv acouircd col- ' oiiies," The President renew- hil recommendation that Congres* nu thorite the nppointment of a commis sioii tor the purpose of making a sys tnatic investigation with reference to the cau^e and prevention ot yellow fever. The sanitary problems con? nected with the islands are of no less importance, he says, than those relat? ing to finance,commerce and admin? istration, In commenting upon the develop? ments of the postal service the Presi? dent remarks that ''within twenty years both the revenue* and the ex? penditures of the Post office Depart? ment have multiplied three-fold." Discussing our foreign relations, the President states that the United St.-it.s minister at Constantinople has been instructed to "press for a just ret t lenient of our claims of indemnity by fi asmi of tbe destruction of the property of American citizens resident in that country during the Armenian trouble of leX">, as well as for the recognition of older claims of eqnal ?is ice.'' The arbitral tribunal ap? pointed under the treaty of February ".', l^'.l?, between Great Britain and Venezuela, to determine the bound ?iry line between the latter and Ilriiisli Guiann,will meet in Pari* this month. Tin: President states that "it is a SOnrce of much gratification to this government to see the friendly re? sort of arbitration applied to the settlement of this conl rovci -?y."' The interpr?tation of certain provisions lof the extradition treaty of Deeciu I her II, 1*01, with .Mexico has been ?it varioo* times the occasinii ,,f eou itroversy between tbe\p?ven.tnt of Mexico and the United St.-itos.

WASHINGTON LETTER i From oui insular I'orrcspcndont.) Washington, Dec. .">?Theimpor ano? of the subjects dealt with ?san pic excuse for the unusual length < President McKinley'e annual mrassg to Congres*, the greater portion ? \ which is abonl the war, the event leading up to it, coiinectcd with an fellowmg it, up to the acceptance i o,r terms ot' Peace. The genera lone of the mesaege ?s highly coir mended; also the handling of th more or less delicate Question con un ted with (our scqum-ment ofth Philippine*. Ii is free from raneo and bombaat,although fully recogniz mg the unpraoedented achievement of the country in the war with Spain Ik dominant notcjs patriotism of tin highest order--patriotism such a every good American fee's, regardiez of political affiiiatioii and can endorse It the sentiment in Congress is repre j seiilative of that of the country, tun it uaunlly i> the message will be gen , orally commended. While the legislation of the sessioi of Congress, which opened today 1 will have little direct connection will ? the newly acquired territory of th< country, several of the regular ap propriation bills, notably those foi tic army and for the Navy, as wel as the bill for the increase of the reg, ular army, will furnish texts loi many speeches on that subject, ami the talk of Senat ors and Representa tives indicated an intention to take full advantage of those texts. CotUM quently the debates of the present ?cs?ioil are expected to be unusually lively and interesting. Secretary Alger says, in his annual report, in favor of his recommends? thin that it be provided in the legisla lion for increasing the regular army t" leii,0(Hl nun, thai natives ot islands occupied by our troops may be en? listed:" These men are .acclimated, understand the language and habits of their countrymen, and their enlist? ment m ill not only give them employ? ment, but also have the tendency to enable the irovemment to get into closer touch with their people than it would otherwise lie able to do. This would also relieve our own men from serving in those climates to a large extent, and would, moreover, ('liable the Volunteer? to he mustered out of the service and return to the avocation'?" of civil life." That last sentence will do mote to hurry army legislation than any other one thing. Every Senator and Representative is besieged with requests to get this or lbal regiment of volunteers mustered out, ami they all know that no con sidorabV number of the volunteers will be ordered mustered out until Col greM provides for the enlistment of regulars to take their places. It is believed that this peculiar situation will keep men ouiet who otherwise would bitterly oppose the bill provid? ing for the increase of the regular army. lor Hale sees nothing but trouble and expense m the annexa lion of the Philippines, and declares his intention to figbj th* ratification of tbe treaty of pesos to the full ex? tent of his ability, regardless of what otber Senators may do. Mr. Hale'a picture? of the calamities likely to follow the ratification of the treaty of peace would be truly awful if he could make everybody see through his eyes. B'it it has not been forgotten lhat Mr. Hale drew some very weird pic lures of what would happen to this country if it dared to make war on Spain, which were ;i long ways from what actually did happen; there? fore his doleful talk isn't fetching any tears of alarm. The probability of Nicaragua Canal legislation is going to he a good thing for W: shington hotel kecjiers, this winter, and it maybe that some ?npecunconi statesmen who will be dropped from Uncle Sam's pay roll at the close of the present Congress, will also handle some of the Panama Canal Company's money, which it is understood will he liberally spent to block Nicaragua Canal legislation. Tin. House ?g the doubtful body; the Senate is known to be overwhelming? ly favorable to the ?'onstrucioti of the Nicaragua Canal by this govern? ment. There are signs that the ad? ministration will use its influence up? on the House in favor of canal legis? lation. Mr Hardln Norrlt, clerk ,,f the drue ?lor ? of B. Shoemaker, Perry.
