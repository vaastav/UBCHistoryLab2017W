Washimitox, Dec. ft, 1871. Scene*. Incidents and Kxfitctneiit Over tbe Proceedings of the THr* Houses. The lutensely cold weather of to-day, which has net been equalled witnln the recollection of the oldest Inhabitant, had a visible effect upon the galleries. Ladies In tnis latitude arc morbidly sen sitive to oold. The excitement consequent upon the opening being over, there was little to attract spectators of either sex, and tho lobby is not yet organized so as to be aggressively active. The In terest, consequently, cenlered wholly upon the pro ceedings of tho two .rouses. Congress is assuming a thoroughly business air at the very beginning, and If tbe work in neither Douse was very earnest to-<lay the gossip about the Capitol showed an undercur rent of earnest ncss that was scarcely to bo expected at this early stage. Among the Senators much In terest is manifested In Mr. Sumner's bill tor getting the national currency on a specie-paying basis. What shape it will take belorc it is reported back from the Finance Committee it Is impossible to pre dict. All the lluauclal measures introduced into C'ongrc.-s nave come up for action in a shape that fails to reveal their parentage, and Mr. Sumner's bills have been no exception to the rule. In the present case the distinguished Senator Irom Massa chusetts wiU endeavor to preserve its identity, and as it embodies the views of the mercantile classes of tne countryt even more fully than his own, ho will press it vigorously. The bill Is the result of many conversations with the leading merchants of New Hngland; bnt while all are agreed upon the necessity of a return to specie payments every body has a nostrum of his own; and what Mr. Sumner, in a conversation to day, characteristically called the "attrition of thought" makes every specific only n bundle of ill asaortcd herbs. Ue will endeavor to press his bill lor ward to-iuorrow, and intends reaching some iimcly action very soon, if such a result is possible. Among the Representatives the morning and even Ing talk does not take a direction so purely busi ness like, nor is it of so legislative a character, 'i ho alleged differences between the President and Sec retary Boutweii In regard to a reduction of luxa tion, Id the political aspects of the question, are the chief topics, while the irlumph of Grant's policy and his re-election are conceded. Mr. Boutweii has also his partisans, wno are load in his praises. These claim that the chlcr glory of tho administra tion?the rapid payment of ihe national debt?is due entirely to the Fccretarv of the Treasury, and assert mat defeat Is certain If after a reduction of taxation there should be any failtug off hi the balances which have been characteristic of the monthly debt ?laremont. in spite of tho Secretary's recommends trans a reduction to uw extent of Sao.ooo,ooo will be instated npon, and a very refreshing little row may bo got np on short no* toe. Nearly every Secretary of the Treasury, from Hamilton ?own, has Presidential aspirations during the first term of Ills chief, and Mr. Bontwcll Is 110 exception to the rule. This promises to lie a new disintegra tion of the republican party; bnt there Is sucli an evident dlapoaltlon among the majority in Conrress to stand by the President that tc can only result In the retirement of Mr. Bontwcll from the Cabinet if tils friends choose to make a contest. In Conrress To. liny, the proceedings showed the political element tn sn extreme degree and the were eagerly watched to see how the recalcitrant republicans were going. Mr. Farnsworth rought and lost an antl-?dminlstration battle in the Uouse, and In the Senate the contest was over the Ku Kinx procla mation. Senator Biatr called np his resolution of yesterday, which was characterised by Mr. Conk ling, on behalf of tho administration, as fun of in sinuations and Intimations, and tried to make a speech, bnt wms choked off without mcrcv. The interest in the matter lay in the way which Rnmner, Trnmbnll and Fenlon should vote on the motion to take up the resolution: but as they voted ??no" without any apparent effort no spitt in tne republican party was vislolc. This was, la fact, the only measure of national Importance or political interest berore tho Senate to-day, and to-morrow the session will probably be a very short one also, as a caucus wBl be held In tbe evening to agree upon tbe reorganisation of the oommlttoos. No radical changes nro anticipated, and tho Senate has shown trseir so much In harmony with the administration that even an effort to reinstate Mr. suinner In his old plaoc at the head of the Com mlttee on Foreign Relations would not produce anything like a lively effect. Mr. Cameron Intro duced a resolution In regard to the Cntacazy affair, calling for ihe correspondence In the case, hot this has no significance apart, from the indication that he intends holding on to the place he now occupies. Soon alter the morning hour the House went lulo Committee of tne Whole on tho President's Mes sage. Mr. Dawes led off with the usual resolutions distributing the different parte of the message to tho appropriate committees, that part relating to tho establishment hr the government of a postal telegraph system bolog referred to a special com mittee. The first skirmish of the session wns fought upon the objection made by Mr. Randall, of Pennsylvania, to this special committee! The postal telegraph being an administration measure, Mr. Randall was backed by General Farnsworth, Chairman or Committee on Post Offices and I'ost Roads, who insisted that that part of the Message should l?o referred to Ills committee. Ue thus placed himself squarelv In opposition to the Executive policy, as m his speech supporting his motion or reference be announced himself strongly opposed to the measure. Messrs. Beck, of Kentucky; Eld ridge, of Wisconsin, nnd other democrats came vigorously to tho sup port of Messrs. Randall nnd Farnsworth, opposing the measure mainly upon the ground that if would swell to appalling proportions the vast patronage of tne Executive, and that the measure came with a bad grace from an ndmlnstrniion which was taking such pulns to make liscll the champion of civil service reform. "Thcro are now.'' said .Mr. Beck, "five thousand telegraph stations and seven thousand employes In tne Hinted suites, which would i>c swelled 10 twenty thousand stations aud three hundred and twenty-five thousand employes if this corrupt, administration assumed control of the teic grnoh system. Mr. Dawes, against whom tlie op position as Die distinguished leader of the minimis nation parry or the Rouse was directed, received their brisk tire, ns also ihe fire in the rear from the gallant Western brigadier with the self possession vl a veteran sure if in* reserves. During the fight a motion wa* made, evidently a compromise, to refer the subject, to the Committee on Appropriations. Mr. <;or(.eld, chairman of that committee, opposed the motion, and sustained Mr. Dawes' original motion for a select committee. The matter whs finally disposed ?(f by seadiug it to lbs Commute* ?11 Appropriations, when the committee rose aud reported to the llousc. The friends of the administration, not at all aatle Beu with this fcaoiutiou, renewed me original mo tlon for* special committee. The arcs aud noes : were called for by Mr. kurn.swortli. When taken | it was lound the relerence first called lor waa , carried by ten majority, the vote being 1 106 lor a special committee to BO against it. This ia considered a decisive victory by the admlnistra- | tlon men, because a tuajorny of tUc committee will : be favorable to the measure. j The Hgbt waa a aidrited affair from flr*t to last. ! The drums heat and the sa Ores flashed along the ' whole line. Outsiders were seen auxiotuly watch- j lug the fray, evidently jubilant when (he bulletin announced tue victory assured, I Mr. Cox, of New York, opened lire on the Syndl- , cate by attempting to obtain action on bla resolu- > tlon of Monday. Be aaid he did not oak for a J apeciai committee, but strongly objected to the ; resolution being ie. erred to one whioh wonld alio# ! it to "Bleep the sleep that knows no waking." j Mr. Cox waa oa usual entertaining, lor even 1 in hia wrath he g'ves out something to smile ! over. The Bouse adjourned in an evident ' spirit of good nature on both aides, in , spite of the fact that the campaign is opened and | tjiprejs inusio in the air. Thus it will he observed , that the second day's proceedings in congress were not less important than the first and that the shift lag of parties and positions yesterday is having its full effect. The Beuate, more conservative than the House, left the first battle to be fought by the younger and more ardent of the Rorelieads, and it Is something in the favor of tnc administration that it drew the first blood. (ieoernl ffheraian's Report of the Arm)*. The report of General Sherman is very brief. He savs:? A review of the division annual reports will, I feel assured, satisfy the Secretary o> War mat lit what I over sphere of labor our troops have ueen employod, I whether in maintaining good laith with our ncign burs on tne North or on the Mexican border, or re pressing Indian Invasions and outbreaks; in pro 1 tcciutg the weiKIMposed inhabitants ol the South ' or the sparsely settled frontiers of the West: In aitl 1 mg the revenue officers tu the discharge of their un > pleasant duties, and In sustaining the United Stales i Marshals and Courts?every where they have dls i played a zeal an* intelligence worthy of their good | lame established In the past As General Halleck recommends, however, it ib eminently to bo desired I that the sphere of action or tho army, In the quasi I civil cases, should be better defined by statute; but ; iu the absence of such statute we can only rely upon . the intelligence and good sense or the officers 1 specially engaged, 'I bus far lew mistakes, II any, | have been made, end tne conduct or tne troops has I met the hearty approval of the courts, the civil offl . ccra and even of the inhabitants against whom they have been compelled to act. In order to maintain the military establishment wuhiu the limbs. prescribed in the act of Joiv 16, lH7o, each company must be kept below its propor tionate standard, and tire consequeucc is tnat many of the companies at distant and inaccessible posts tall below a number fit for efficient mtuiury ! service; and It is simply an impossibility to 1 guard against this result, aud I do hope ' Congress will remove the restriction ana give tue President the discretionary power to i keep the companies up to a standard ranging be tween sixty and one hundred privates, according to i the uatnre of the service required ol the troops, i buoh a measure would add very much to the effi ciency, and would rarely, If ever, carry the aggregate strength of the aeuve army above tue standard ol 30,doo jiicu, now fixed by law. General Sherman again earnestly recommends "the great necessity that new regulations be pro vided for the government ol the army, and- that some uniform system of tactics be adopted, em bracing common principles tor handling all the arms of the service when brought tinder a common commander. Tho whole theory of army move ments is based ou the fact that oue responsible head I should control masses of men, aud this cannot 1 efficiently be done where one set of tactics is used ? lor inlantry, auotner for cavalry and still another for i artillery, lam convinced from experience that tnists i perieciiy practicable and easy of execution, and care I little whoso particular system is adopted as a basis, ; l?ecause other changes will occur In the progress or time, Aud the beginning ts all that.ts asked for, on i some intelligent plan likely to result in ultimate good." RttMrc awl Consolidating the Stat ate*. The Commissioners appointed to revise and con solidate the statutes of the United States met in May, 1870, and began their work by a joint exami nation of the whole body oi the statutes at large, in order to classify every provision under Its appropri ate title, and to arrange the matter of revision in such a way thai tne reviser of each title should be assured of haviug before Mm an the provisions belonging to It, and none which did not. Accord ingly they adopted certain provisional titles, with modifications. The greater part or title 14?tne judiciary?is now printed, and, after it shall be far ther revised and reprinted, will soon be distributed to members of Amgram. This title will have dis posed of about 2,"02 secttonsi The Commissioners submit it to the legislative power in the form of a separate statute, so that It may be acted on, should Congress deem tnat course con sistent, without awaiting the completion of the re vision. None of its provisions depend upon the adoption or other titles, and it ts accompanied by a precise repealing act. The same method may, if such is tho wish of Congress, be pursued with most of the titles under which the revision is arranged. The reports are slgnod by Cnarlea P. James, Ben jamin Vaughau Abbott and Victor C. Barringer. The Annual VUit of Distillers and Tobacco D?al?n to (he Capital. Among tne pilgrims who annually visit the politi cal Mecca of the nation tew are more conspicuous man those Interested in the distillation of spirits and the manufacture of tobacco. The distillers are always accompanied by influential dealers In spirits, whose object is to impress on the Committee ol Ways and Means and the Finance Committee the importance of promptly heeding their suggestions and shaping taxation to please them. The recom mendation of the President, that internal taxation be hereafter confined to the revenue derived from stamps, spirits, tobacco and malt llauors, strength ens the hope of those interested In distilleries that Congress will at this session grant them the desired relier and consolidate all the taxes to be collected at the distilleries. Tne representatives of the National Tobacco Association, who are to meet in convontlon to-mor row for the purpose of arranging their argument for the reduction of the tax on the "weed," are not sanguine of success, and received but very Utile en couragement at the Treasury Department to-day, or assistance from the officials of the luternai Revenue Bureau. The specific manner In which the Presi dent and secretary Bontwell point out the sources from which the revenue may be profitably derived and most c heaply collected, will not be disregarded by the committee on Ways and Means, and u Is more likely that the recommeudation of Commis sioner Douglass, that the tax on tobacco on con solidated at ihlrty-lwo cents per pound, will be car ried out. Hut It appears, from statements made to day, that the tobacco men had anticipated ooid com fort from Treasury officials, and openly doclared that If congress did not reduce the tax the association was pledged to Jolu issue with the sntl* Grant men and support the party opposing nts re election. This Is the first threat of any Importance and is not likely to assume larger proportions than high-sound lug words. All the arguments and reso lutions gatherel by Mr. 1. Kunoail, enter or the to bacco division, during his recent visit to tne princi pal Southern and Western cities, will be turned over to Mr. Dawes, chairman of the Ways aad Means Committee, ror the enlightenment ol the members of that committee. They admirably illus trate the difference ol opinion existing In different parts of the country, and the lack of unanimity ninong the manufacturers In agreeing upon sugges tions to be made to the committee.

Treaties widi the Indians. senator Morrill, of Maine, has introduced in the Senate a resolution wblcn is calculated to have an important bearing on the discussion ana settlement of several Intercs'ing questions connected with the Indian policy or the government, probably during the present session. Tlio resolution instructs tne committee on Indian Afistrs to Inqnlre whether any, and If so, what, further or additional legislation is ?ces'uay to carry into effect the several treaties made and tne acts and rcfom mendations of the Peace Commissioners, so called, in pursuance of an act of Congress approved July 20, 1807, entitled "An act to establish peace with certain hostile ludlau tribes and to report by bill or otherwise." The treaties above referred to contemplated the setting aside of reservations on which the Indians were to be collected and kept permanently. The Com missioners accordingly selected two reservations one in Indian Territory and the other on the Upper Platie, in Dakota Terri ory?which are supposed to be large enough to coutain all the Indiana east of the Rocky Mountaius. Their action was only re ported to Congress several years ago, and large numbers of Indians irom time to time have been placed upon these reservations. Rut up to the present date Congress has never ratitied and con firmed the reservations to tne Indians, and there is consequently no assurance that they will not be despoiled of the lands and driven irom their new homes by tne encroachments of unprincipled whiles? a danger now considered imminent, notwithstand ing the faith of the government has been pledged that tney should never again be disturbed so long as they remain peaceable. The resolution now lies npon the table of the Senate pending the rorination of tne committee. (leorse Wilkes In Washington. Tne arrival of George Wilkes in this city and the announcement that tie propoaed to take the initia tive in a matured movement against tho rcnomlna tton ol President Grant, or, failing in this, to lead the way for his defeat at tho next Presi dential election, has been the subject of considerable conversation and comment among the politicians temporarily abiding in Wash ington. During the session of Congress to-day be was at the Capitol, and most of the time was on the floor of the Senate. Subsequently he received a large number of callers at his rooms at the Arling ton, and was engaged nntii midnight in explaining to those who called the plan or opera'ion marked out lor the rganizatlon of an antl-Uraut party, lie is sanguine of the result. General Clark's Election frcm the Third Dis trict of Texas Contest?:'. The House Committee on Elections will to-morrow take up tne case of ueueral William T. ciark, for- ! mcrly of General Sherman's staff, whose certificate of election from the Third district of Texas was re ferred to the committee yesterday. General Clark has been here for tne past two weeks, preparing his case in anticipation cither of the action taken yester day or of a lively contest by the democratic candi date, Giddlngs, who claims to have oeeu elected by a large majority. Much Interest is lelt in the deter mination of this contest, as u is generally ad mitted that if Clark gets in?ana he ex presses no doubt of it nin:seif?it will have to be at some sacrifice of principle to party feeling. There is some talk on the democratic side of summoning General Joe Reynolds, of the army, before the committee and making him ten what be knows about "counting in," as managed down in Texas. The Board of MesnbsU Inspector*. There has been mncb surprise and a great deal of comment among Congressmen at the emission of secretary Boutwell in not reierring to the action of the Board of Bteamboat Inspectors at their sessions in this city, especialy as, Bince the new law was passed there have been some of the mast dreadful casualties on steamboats. It was expected that some mention wonld be made of as important an adjunct 0f the Treasury Department as the Board is elnlmod to be. Hiesissost owners are clamorous all over the country on account of cne additional expense Imposed by the provisions of the law in requiring more apparatus for greater protection of life and property. A delega tion appointed at the convention of steamboat men in Louisville a few weeks ago is expected here this week for the purpose of urging Congress to grant them relief from what they term oppressive legisla tion, and as Secretary Boutwell lias not even men tioned the subject in bis report the advocates of the relief measure claim that the b 11 is objection able to mm, and in this view they are sustameu by the Treasury officials. Attorney Ucorral Akrrnmn on Railroad Laid Grant*. The following letter from the Department of Jus tice to the (secretary of War, In reference to railroad grants, has Just been given out ror publication:? 

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, 1 Washington, Nov. 21.1871. J To Uon. Wm. W. Delknap, Secretary of war:? Your letter or the r.th instant presents this ques tion?To what oxteut a railroad, to aid In the con struction of which Congress nas donated portions of the public domain, can be considered public highway for the free use of the government of the United states In the transportation of lis troops and property?whether the wnole road should be con sidered or only that portion along which the oom pituy have actually selected lauds.' The question uow arises, under the act of September 20, I860, granting laud in aid of the construction of a railroad from Chicago to Mobile, which in the seventh section provided that the said railroad shall be and rcmnln a public highway for the use of the government of the United states, irce from toll or other charges upon the transportation of any property or troops oi the United States. I am oi oplulon that a road which receives any aid under such a grant becomes a public highway, for the purposes aforesaid, for Its whole leugui. There is nothing in the language of the act to routine tnc character of a public highway to that portion ol life road along which the grunted lands may happen to tie. The law does not require that the proceeds of the lauds ?hall be particularly applied to the construction of the ndjaccnt pans of the road, but ikeygointo the general innds or the road and are applied indis criminately to the whole work. The road Is a unit, and any aid to it. by grant subjects the wnole of it to the condition which accompanies tlio grant. Under any otucr rule It might happen that a road would be broken up into short and Irregular divisions, alternately open and close to the tree use of tne government, and uorning would oe more useless than a right to transports! on subject to such interruptions, where there is no essential va riation in the terms or the grant irotn the provision above quoted. The rule which 1 havo here given Is applicable, and this anrwers with as much expiicunc.ss as is possible iu so general a statement your request for a > rule widen -nail enable your department properly | to tlx the teriniul of the land grant roads or land graut portion* or roads, subject to the condition of iree use for transportation.

THB UABBAS CORPUS 1M SOUTH CAROLINA?MR. BLAIR'S SFRKUH. Mr. Blair. idem.) of Mo., moved to tune up his resolution, introduced yesterday, asking the Presi dent to Inform the .senate by whar authority ho has suspended the constitution and laws of tho United States and of South Carolina in several counties or that state, and said:? This resolution contemplates obtaining from the President a detailed account of the manner in which ? he has exercised the extraordinary authority con ferred npon htm by Congress, l understand that large numbers of citizens have been arrested for alleged crimes In South C'aruilnu, in the counties designated, and that of those arrested nine-tenths were arrested for alleged crimes committed before the passage ol the act of April -20, giving the Presi dent this authority. 1 have seeu tu the papers state ments of the names of the parties arrested and the crimes alleged to have been committed oy them, aad they appear to be the same Incident* or circum stances in regard to which the committee on Out rages in the southern States have examined wit nesses. These circumstances all occurred prior to the passage or the act under which the 1'reskient pro claimed martial law, aud these arrests appear to have been nuule tor oircnces or alleged offences committed anterior to tho time that the federal courts had anv jurisdiction whatever, and anterior to the time wnen the authority was conferred upon the President. Mr. Edmunds, (rep.) of Vt. (Interrupting), asked the chair whether discussion or the merits ot the resolution was In order on a motion to take up. ine chair declared that It was not. Mr. Morton, (rep.) ol Ind.? It occurs to me that the substance oi tms resolution was pretty well answered yesterday by the President's Message; but, aside Irom that, this resolution can lie much better discussed after we snail have received the re port or the Investigating Committee. For ibis reason 1 shall vote against taking it no. Mr. Blair? the President's Message does not give us any Informational all in reicrence to the matter about which this resolution asks information. This resolution asks for the names of tho parties ar rested, the crimes alleged to have been committed by them and the times at which ihcv are alleged to have been committed, aud none oi t hese are gtveu in the President's Message. The Pre-ldeot states ttiat the testimony taken by the committeo on bouthern Affairs amply snstalus hlni in his procla mation of martial law. 1 do not know how be got mat information; certainly not by any report from the committee. No one was authorized by tbc com mittee to make anv such report to the President, and as a member or it 1 can give my opinion that the facis elicited by the committee do not justify rue proclamation of innitlal law, and 1 suspect Mutt 1 know more about those lacts than tne President himself. While I am not astonished that the Presi dent should have exercised the extraordinary powers coniered upon him?ids education and his genius being arbitrary make him lavor arbitrary measures?I am astonished nt the servility or con gress in submitting the rights ol citizens to his dis cretion, and I ociievu that it becomes us. having given uim such authority, to ask him to tell us how he has exercised it. ML Conblino, (rep.)ot N. Y.?1 think the reason assigned oy the nenalor iroui Indiana (Mr. Morton) against taking up this resolution uow a good one, and I lieg to add h riot her. A resolution calling tor inhumation ui?on anv appropriate subject is always untitled to consideration and indulgence, and par ticularly when good lalth in a'l respects is a part of o( it. But this resolution, among other things, is full of assertion and Intimation which may fall short ol assertion. Although 1 no uot propose now to discuss the verity or errorof the resolution in that regard, It Is enough that It contain* so much ot that kind oi matter that it does not in mv estimation fall fairly wmnn the category oi resolution, seek ing information: and therefore I should vote against taking it up now or at any time, unless this matter were eliminated; unless it were reduced to a real resolution ol inquiry, in which case theie might peruaps be no obieeiion to It, at least none oi the kuid that I now specify.

The minority or the com.nli'ee hssi stated in Its icpori last Congress the great ob jection 10 the project was that tne government telegraph would be used for political puri"?es through an army of officeholders. The facHi e* lor tons using the wires would bo a temptation "o strong and would be so difficult to detect that it might well be doubted whether the adaiioistcatlnn would refrsin from such use of them.

Mr. KANPAi.n?I relerred to it simply as an in stance of select committees. Mr. Dawes dm not see why the Impartiality of the Speaker should lie questioned in the selection or a special committee more than of a standing com mittee. Mr. Kmikidok, (dem.t of wis., inquired whether it was not the parliamentary rule to appoint on special committees a majority of the friends 01 the measure. Mr. Dawks understood It to be a parliamentary rule, when a matter is nubmitted to a se.eci com mittee, that a majority of the oommittee shall be in favor of so submitting It. Mr. Kmiridue Inquired whether the rule did not go farther, aud require a majority to be iq favor ol the project. Mr. Dawks did not uuderstnmt that there was any project recommended here. The statement, i>v Mr. Randall, that the telegraph company asked Congress to purchase its property at an cuormotis rate, showed that that genueinun did nor understaud the rela tions of the mutter auy more tiian a baby. (Laugn ter.) The Western Union Telegraph Company was arraying Itself with ail its power and uitlueme against any such proposition. Mr. Buck remarked mat while the Western Union Telegraph Company had opposed the project last Congress he understood it to have changed its post 11 >n and to be now anxious lor it. Mr. Dawks said mat that (act would not com mend the matter to tils approval, but this was not the tunc to enter into the inert! a of the whole sub ject. The only question was as to its reference.
