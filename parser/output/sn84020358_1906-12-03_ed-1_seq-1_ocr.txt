;VOL LXX. NO 290 FIFTY-NINTH CONGRESS . OPENS AT NOON TO-DftY WILL DEVOTE TIME BEFORE IIOLIVAYS TO APPROPRIA TION JB1LLS. These Will Probably Aggregate a Blll . Ion Dollars and it is the Opinion That Congress Cannot Do Better Than Give All Its Time to These Measures Friends o Ship Subsidy Never More InsistentPresident's Message Will be Read To-morrow. Washington, Deo. 2. The passage of the appropriation bills and as little oth er general legislation as possible. Such in brief is the forecast for the chort session of the 59th session of coneress, which will begin at high noon to-morrow. The president's message will be read to-morrow. There has. not yet been time for as general an exchange of viewis among members as Is ordinarily desired by leaders before expressing their views, but all seem to regard the present sit uation as so simple as to need compar atively little intercourse to arrive at an understanding. It is evident that for various reasons it will not be possi ble to do much on the appropriation bills before the holidays, and this cir cumstance will practically have the effect of condensing the consideration of the fourteen large supply measures Into two months. Considering that the aggregate of the appropriations to be made will approximate $1,000,000,000, some senators and members express the opinion that congress cannot de bet ter than clve all of its time to these measures. The ship subsidy bill probably will ibe an exception to the rule for no general legislation. The friends of that meas ure have never been more insistent than now. They are extremely hopeful and yet very apprehensive. The bill has passed the senate and is In com mittee of the house. Speaker Cannon has given no positive assurance as to his attitude, but the bills supporers find encouragement in his silence. One lrcldent that is very materially helping the subsidy Is the recent speech of Sec retary 'Root In support of It. There - have been some significant conferences on the bill among the most Influential members of the two houses, Tha senate has on its calendar two important house bills, the immigration bill and the Philippine tariff bill, but there are snags In the paths of bath. There lis still intense opposition to the Philippine bill, especially, and it is n6t beleved that It can possibly receivo serious consideration during a short j session. , Not a few members of both houses J are anxious to meet the demands of m the bankers and others for an elastic currency and it is quite certain that c there will be efforts made to supply the want, but there 'are so many plans tl,that even the nrost sincere believers Wirt the necessity almost despair of ac d. ccmpllshing. anything during a short hssession. The recommendation of the president In the interest of a national inheritance tax 1s awaited with fvaupr interest by many, and there is no doubt 'that a large following could be secured for a measure of the character he will outline, but as in the matter of curren cy reform, tha few weeku of the ses sion will not suffice for adenuate con sideration. It Is also recognized that the present plethoric condition of the treasury would furnish strong argu ment against the proposed innovation. 'Suggestions looking toward amending the railroad rate law are not expected to bear fruit this session. All those matters and many others are certain to receive attention in debate. Among the questions slated for a lib eral share of discussion, the tariff stands at the head of the list, but no lone 1ms the least Idea that any serious leffort will now be made to secure the modifications which even many repub licans think desirable. The -president !who himself desires some changes has recently promised his congressional callers that he will not ask to have the subject taken up at this time. The Japanese question, the discharge of the negro soldiers, the desirability of any lincome tax law, the result of the late elections and the trusts are also down or discussion. The senate will give early attention Ito the case of IReed Smoot. Senator Burrows will set the ball rolling De- joember 10 in a speech, in which he will review the entire case; ana he will doubtless be followed by other mem bers for and against the Utah senator. The resolution before the senate mere- ily declares that Mr. Smoot to be not ientitled to his seat, 'but unlike a dec laration for expulsion in expillct lan teuaee, It does not require a two-thirds I vote to pass it. Mr. Smoot's friends will not yieia this advantage without a struggle. The question is a privileged ine and Senator Burrows, who Is chair man of the committee on privileges ind elections, has expressed his deten--nination to utilize all his rights in .aeping it to the front. Much interest attaches to the presi lrnt's forthcoming recommendations 'oncernins the Panama canal. It irs lot expected that he will ask much egislation beyond the necessary ap iropriations, and there is a general lisposition to gr.mt these. The in rease of the navy will receive much consideration, but there is still o?posi ion to the proposed ship of the Dread- ni ught class. . Dr. Lapponi Wo' Rome, Dec. 2.

Parlshoncrs Protest Against the Trans ferring of Father Wlreinskt to Buffalo Father Tunskt, the. Pastor, Repeatedly Hissed During the Morn ing Services Disturbance at the Hectory. Bridgeport, Dec. 2 Masses were said to-day at St. Michael's Roman Catho lic church oa the east side under strong police protection, and to-night the rec tory of the church is guarded by police to forestall a recrudescence of a dis turbance which began yesterday as a result of a change in the pastorate, and when the former pastor, Rev. Stefan Wircinski, took his departure. . During the services this morning Father Tun ski, the new pastor, was repeatedly hissed. Recently orders were issued trans ferring Father Wirclnski to a church in Buffalo and replacing him with an other Franciscan father, Tunskl. Father Hyacinth, of Buffalo, superior of the Franciscan fathers, came here last Thursday in o'-der to be present when the new pastor took up his du ties. Father Wircinski was to take his de parture yesterday afternoon, and shorLly before the time for him to leave about 1,000 Polish men and women, composing a part of the congregation, went to the rectory and made a dem onstration for the purpose of showing their disapproval of Father Wirclnskl's going. They attacked the expressman who was taking away the priest's goods, and two policemen who., were sent to the scene were roughly handled. Reinforcements were called and the police charged the crowd, striking right and left and knocking about twelve persons senseless. Only one ar rest wes made, howr vr, that of An thony Bachey, who was held in $500 for a hearing. When Father Hyacinth, who was at the rectory, attempted to quell the dis turbance before the arrival of the po lice the rioters invaded the house, seiz ed the superior and threw him bodily into the street. As Father Wircinski was leaving many of the women parishioners clung to him, declaring that they would not let him go. He finally made his de parture under police escort. When Father Tunski appeared a demonstra tion against him was made. It is claimed by Catholics here that the disturbances were due to a faction of socialistic Poles. Following the masses to-day a secret meeting of the disaffected portion of the congregation was held.

NEW HAVEN, PRESIDENT HURLS MB INTO CUBAN CIG1SS SEATS OF MEMBERS OF S1COSD SERIES TO BE DECLARED VACANT, Announcement Made by Governor Ma goon .Meets Strung Dissatisfaction . Leaders Declare Such Action Unfair General Rivera Snys Plan Ultimate ly Will Lead to Another Insurrection and Extinction of Cuban Independ ence. Havana, Dec. 2. By a decree to be issue! soon under specific authority of the president of the United States, the seats of all members of the second se ries of the Cuban congress elected in 1905 will be declared vacant." This was the announcement made by Governor iJlagoon this morning 'to twenty-five senators anil members of the house of representatives, whom he had invited to attend a conference at the palace After reviewing all the facts de veloped by the peace com mission sen'c to Cuba by President Roosevelt in re sponse to President Palma's appeal for intervention, and with special reference to the negotiations relating to the stat us and final disposition of the Cuban congress, Governor Magoon called the attention of the members to the fact that the determination as to the status of tho congress had been reserved ' by 'the peace commission for consideration at Washington. He then communicated to them the final determination cf Pres ident Roosevelt that the seats of all senators and representatives elected in 1903 shall be considered 'vacant from October 12, 1903, the vacancies thereby created being filled by an election un der the provisional government In ac cordance with the proclamation of Gov ernor Taft September 29. The first series of senators and rep resentatives elected in 1904 will be con tinued In office if moral peace, tranquil lity, and public confidence be restored to such an extent that an election for the vacated seats may be held during 1907, and that there way be at the same time an election of the successors of the representatives whose terms expire December 31, 1907, without shortening these terms, thus avoiding 'the necessity of two elections. The salaries of tho ousted members will be pad to October 12, tho date fixed by tho peace commis sion. - Governor' IMngoon-explained to the members of congress that he considered i't only fair and cour'tenus to submit to them the terms of -the decree prior to the formal promulgation, so that they might decide, what attitude they desir ed 'to assume. - After all the facts had been placed before them. Senators Dolz and Tamayo spake In behalf of their colleagues, and the conference then ad journed. Tho decree will probably be promul gated to-morrow. It will not declare the last election to have been Illegal, but will say that it Is annulled In ac cordance with the terms of comprom ise arranged by the peace commission, under which the rebels were Induced to , lay down their arms. After the conference former Minister' of the Treasury IFonts Sterling, Senator ; Dolz and other moderates expressed strong dissatisfaction with the terms of the decree, which they declared was itn- j fair, but they said they recognized the futility of any protest. General Ruis Rivera said to-night to the Associated Press that he realized the decree mere ly carried out an obligation of Interest to the peace commissioners, but he greatly deplored it, believing its effects would be disastrous. iHe said he was firm In the belief that the only means of establishing peaceful conditions con sist in 'the selection of an entirely new congress, whereas the proposed election, which would result In turning over the government to liberal control, would surely result in a new insurrection the moment the American troops were withdrawn from the island. The fact was, said General Rivera, that the United 'States had ignored this, which was patent to all Cubans, and pointed irresistibly to the conclusion that if the United States withdrew it would be with the full recognition of the necessi ty, for a speedy return, and the con sequent extinction of Cuban independ encn.

CRAPSEY PREACHES HIS FAREWELL SERM JESVS NO MORE A KING THAN A AT OTHER MAN. This to All External Appearances Just Such n Man to the Outward Seeming as Are the bullions of Working Men Who With Dinner Pulls In Hand Go Forth Every Morning to Their Duty His Kingship in Himself Alone. Rochester, N. Y Dec. 2. Dr. Alger non S. Crapsey preached his farewell sermon at St. iAndrews' church to-day. His text was taken from Matthew xxl, 5. He said that to all external appear ai.ces Jesus Is no more a king than we are. He was just such a man to the outward seeming ais are the :nll- lkns of working men who with dinner pails. in hand so forth every morning to their duty. For thirty years he liv ed as child and lad and youth and man with others of his age and station and there was nithlng to distinguish him from his neighbon-. At the age of thirty he entered upon a public career a.i a rabbi or teacher in Israel. Still there was no thins to indicate that he was a king. And yet men seeing this life In the perspective of history agree with the children of Jerusalem and de clare It to be the only kingly life ever lived in the world. To account for this strange phenomenon we shall have to divest the kingly conception of every outward symbol bv which it has '-aen known and find if we can Itn inward spiritual meaning. Continuing Dr. Crapsey said: "The kingship of Jesus was in Jesus Himself In the .sight and the majesty of his soul. H exercised his royal power In isubdu ins every power of his soul into obe dience to hln will. Ho, not his passions, reigned supreme in his nature. He ex el eised dominion over every foul lust and every base' fear. He put to death every unholy desire and every unclean thought. He did what no other king has ever done "And then having himnelf, by exper ience, mastered the royal law and found it the way of life, he gave tho law to the people. He did not hesitate to repeal all ancient law and enact his own. Surely nj king on earth has ever put forth such claims as this and had them seriously considered. But the law which Jesus gave has been the law by which countlesw 'millions have striv en to order their lives and though countess .millions fail they, do not cease to see in the keeping of that law tha salvati.in of the world. ; "By the simple majesty' of hisv own righteousness, by the simple power of his own law of love, he has subdued counties souls to his will and the world waits for its peace until the kingdom of this world became the kingdom of the Lord and his Christ. And 'as Jesus reigned and relsns, so munt every man. Each man must be a true law unto hims!f. "To find Christ is to find salvation for one's self; to fallow Jesus is to win salvation for others. Let those who will find Christ, let us follow Josuh; let us despise any salvation that does not come to us by way -f the cross. We will not enter into the king dom of heaven except we may take it b:' violence." OILLHrt. CASI. Judt;e Will Hold Night Session to Get It to Jury To-dny. Herkimer, N. Y., Dec. 2. The jury which Is to determine whether Chester Gillette murdered Grace Brown, his youthful sweetheart, expects to receive the case to-morrow. Judge Devendorf has said that he will, if necessary, hold a night session in order to dispose of the case, which has occupied the at tention of the court for three weeks of a special term. The murder case will be resumed promptly at 9 o'clock, and the attor neys promise to close up any incom plete evidence in the first half houn, The summing up of District Attorney Ward for the state and of former Sen ator A. M. Mills for the defense will follow. The arguments are not expect-i ed to be brief, but the court proposes to charge the Jury before final ad journment for the day is taken. The prosecution will allege that Gillette murdered his companion when her con dition was such that only a speedy marriage sought by the girl, but unde slred by Gillette, could prevent a pub lic scandal. On behalf of the boy pris oner, who, in the absence of his fam ily, has faced his accusers alone, Sen ator Mills will argue that, realizing her condition and her lover's attitude to ward her, Grace Brown determined to end her troubles by suicide. Whatever opinion may have been formed as to the guilt or Innocence of Gillette, none of the spectators at the trial pretends to understand him. To night In his prison cell he was reported to be In good spirits. In his cell he Is said at times to sing and dance. South orwfllk House Burned. South Norwalk, Dec. 2. A house owned by Frank H.
