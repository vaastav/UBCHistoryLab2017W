Senator Cummins, progiesslve Republi can of Iowa, Eald he would Ignore State lines and nominate and elect Presidents b direct tote of the people, allowing etch vote to count as cast, regardless of State lines. Senator Cummins avowed himself in favor of a constitutional amendment for the direct election of the President Senator Town$en4. of Michigan, a conservative Republican, admitted thay ne was xavoraDie 10 me primary election plan, and he expressed the opinion that the country was rapidly approaching- the adoption of that method. Senator Clapp, who followed the for tunes of CoL Roosevelt in the last Presi dential campaign, and who Is still third party man, said that he welcomed Wilson Into the ranks of those who are seeking to restore the rule of the peo ple You ask me what I think of It The President has come In. I haven't. He is advocating exactly what I have been advocating for some time and what th new Progressive party stands for. Of course, he, fs right. As to the method he suggests for nominating conventions and platform making, those are details which will be worked by experience. IBs Important part is that the President is right on the fundamental matter Senator Galllnger of New Hampshire spoke approvingly of the matter general I do not approve of the Prcsldentlay primary, but If we are to have one, the) President s Idea for carrying out the will of the people in convention by having the candidates sit as delegates Is Xns correct idea This plan Is In ogue in New Hampshire in our nomination of State officers, and It has worked well " Senator La Follette asked to be excused from commenting for publication on the message, because he had not heard it read But he said that he had alwavs advocated the popular method of nomi nating a President and that he agreeM with the President that the candidates for office who were to administer the platform and carry out party pledges ought to have a part In framing the plat form. 

HFCEPTION OF PKESIDENT MORE CORDIAL THAN ON PREVIOUS APPEARANCES The President recelved-a cordial greet ing from Congress. The applause was spontaneous and continued In marked contrast to the stiffness and formality of the scenes that marked his appearance on previous occasions. It indicated that Congress was becoming accustomed to this method of delivering the Presidential message and also that Mr 'vA Ilson has gained in popularity with the legislative branch The President was pleased over the demonstration, and showed it. The galleries of the House chamber were luled Mrs. A ilson and her two daughters Eleanor and Margaret, were in one of the galleries. All of the members of the Cabinet except Secretary of State Bryan, occupied seats on the floor Mr Brjan sat in the diplomatic gallery The President s references to changing the method of nominating candidates for Chief Fxecutiv e caused the greatest dem onstration. It took the President only about thirty minutes to deliver his message. It was the first annual address that Mr Wilson had delivered before Congress, and in more vravs than one It was an innova tion In recent j ears the annual ines sages have been growing longer and longer because the Presidents undertook to review in them the work of each de partment President Taft broke away from this handicap to a certain extent by dividing his message into several in stallments President 'Wilson, however, omitted altogether any attempt to summarize the work cf the executive departments, and contented himself with the statement that he would submit the reports of the Cab inet officers to Congress.

MINE OUTLAW UNCAPTURED. Fnte at Slnvcr of Six 3Ien Is Still Undecided. Bingham, Utah, Dec. 2. The fato of Ralph Lopez, slayer of six men. today remained a question which only the re moval of the bulkheads and a search of the Utah-Apex mine, where ne took ref uge, would answer. All night sulphur smudges poured deadly gases Into the tunnels, and deputies watcnea eacn exit to shoot the desperado on signt The failure of Lopez to attempt dash from the mine led some to the belief that the resourceful Mexican has found a secure retreat from the gases and would live to fight another under ground battle.

I suggest that these conventions should consist of delegates chosen not for this single purpos, but of the nominees fur Congress the nominees for vacant eeats in the Senate, the Senators whose terms hav e not yet closed, the national commit tees, and the candidates for the Presi dency themselves. In order that plat fiTM ma) be framed by those responsi ble to the people for carrying them into effect This desire to fix responsibility before the people on their public servants ex empllfles a strong conviction of the Presi dent Tho direct primaries declaration evoked almost tumultuus applause, which was general among members of the House and scattered In the Senate con tingent A complete surprise, the pro nouncement left politicians gasping is realized that Presidential primaries will be an Important Issue at this session. and It Is confidently" predicted that the next two vears will witness the enact ments urged by the President In urging the earl enactment of ' a fair and effectivo employers" liability act the President took a little more wind from Progressive sails. 'We ought to devote ourselves to meet ing pressing demands of plain Justice like this as earnestly as to the ac complishment of political and economic reforms. he declared Social Justice comes Act Law is the machinery for Its realization and Is vital onl) as It ex presses and embodies It" The President s antl trust utterances were consrvative and. to manj, reas suring hile declaring that this should be " the central subject of our deliber ations during the present session " the President did not discuss the subject at length promising a special message later In the session This coure was fol lowed to avoid distracting the attention of the country from the currency bill. the Immediate enactment of which Mr Ilson urged In the brief discussion of the anti trust program however the President made his general views perfectly clear, asking for legislation, supplementary to the Sherman law which will as. much as possible reduce the area of that debate- able ground (around the present law) by further and more explicit legislation and which will 'not only clarify It but also facilitate Its administration, and make it fairer to all concerned. ' this with a view to relieving bus'ness men of all uncertainties of law with regard to their enterprises and investments. Iturul Credits Discussed. Discussing rural credits, the President sld What they (the farmers) need and should obtain, is legislation, which will make their own abundant and substan tial credit resources available as a foun dation for Joint concerted local action In their own behalf in getting the cap ital they must use.' Depicting the credit conditions, which the farmer now must meet, he continued He Is the servant of the seasons. Nature determines how long he must wait for his crop's and will not be hurried In her processes. He may give his note, but the season of its roa turitj depends upon the season when his crop matures and the secur ity he gives is of a character not known in the broker's office, or as familiarly as it might be on the counter of the banker " Our future attitude toward the Huerta regime in Mexico may be summed up In one sentence ' W e shall not I be lleve, be obliged to alter our policy of watchful waiting " Treatment of the Philippines ques tion was careful, conservative and op tlinistlc We must hold steadily in view their ultimate Independence.' he said "and we must move toward tho time of that Independence as steadily as the way can be cleared and the foundations thoughtfully and perma nently laid By their counsel and experience, rather than by our own, we shall learn hov best to serve them and how soon it will be possible and wise to withdraw our supervision. In connection with a frank request for government owned railroads In Alaska, the President touched cau tiously upon conservation .generally, reaognlzing the present conflict be tween State and national conservation theories. We have a freer hand In working out the problem In Alaska than in the States or the Union," h said, 'and yet the principle and ob Ject are the same, wherever we touch It There need be no conflict or Jeal ousy, as between State and Federal authorities, for there can be no essen tlal differences of purpose between them. The resources In question must be used, but not destroyed or wasted and it can be done on lines of regulation which need be no less acceptable to tne people ana govern ments of the States concerned than to the people and government of the na tion at large, whose heritage these re sources are" Extreme States' rfghts conservation ists found little of promise In the ref erence to our natural resources as the heritage" of "the people and govern ment of the nation."
