Coatrarj to expectations we are without the President's Message this morning: A dispatch from the Agent of the Associated Press in -\e?;Vork, yesterday, informed u= that it bad been determined not to tele graph it to the papers West, owing, as it was said, to the bad condition of the lines. We are not at all satisfied witb this ex 8aM' M we had made onr arrangements to furnish it this morning. So macb delin quency U laid to the account of the lines thaw times that the excuse is about played | oot. We shall publish it at the earliest moment after its reception from Washing ton. P. 3.?Since writing the foregoing we hare receired a co?.*iderabI* synopsis of the Message, which will at least appease In a tolerable degree the public anxiety to know what the document contains. Words that ought to be Remembered by the People or Western Virginia. Those men who so nobly stood by us it, the V. 8. Senate last summer, when the prospectsof West Virginia were all orer cast, by the sudden nod unanticipated treachery of Mr. Carlile, will deserve im mortal honor and remembranre from our people when the new State becomes one of th<- Union, Chief among them vrjll for ever stand brare old Ben. Wade of Ohio, whose indignant rebuke of our betrayer is a master piece of tcatbiog eloquence. His words ought to be published and republish ed in erery loyal paper throughout West Virginia, until they become as familiar as the hills tbemselres to our people. On that memorable 14th of July, when Mr. Car lile was straining every effort, in company with Powell and S.iul?bury and others, to accomplish tbe defeat ot tbe new State, to which np to that hour be had professed friendship, Old Ben Wade, a stranger,up on whom we had no claims, rose and said: "1 certainly did not intend to take any time in debating this bill; but the rery extraordinary course tbe Senator from Virginia has seen tit to take has so entirely disappointed me that I almost owe an apology to the Senate itself for urging this roe?sore with tbe xeal that I did upon its consideration this morning. I did so at the request of some of the beat meu of that State, not only one bot raauy, almost sup plicating that we should lake it up and get through with it to day. When I saw a Senator from the State Itself rise, so evi dently with no other purpose than to talk against time, and tbus defeat tbe bill, I was disappointed beyond measure. We hare bad a new proposition, a long argu ment, and a recurrence to old speeches that bad been made on former occasions, that must be read here, all coming from h man pretending to be a friend of this prop, osition. Any man knnwi that if anything was calculated under these circumstances to defeat tbe measure, it was precisely tbe course he has seen fit to take witb it. lie tells us that be still is some shape a friend to it; bnt what haa been the purport of his speech, except to shake the eonfl. dence of the Senate, itself in the Constitu tional Convention that framed the Consti tution which we have been asked to ratify? He has gone back of their appointment;*be has not only undertaken to fiod fault witb what they bare done, tut he has undertaken to lay that they were not really organized to do anything! and it is the first I have beard of any such thing. We hare eat in committee with that gentleman; we have heard hie arguments and illuitratione on the subjectwe hare had many men of the pro posed State before as, in council witb us npon It; and here for the first time [mark this] to-day tee hear that the Convention who framed Ihu Constitution really did not represent the people whom they professed to represent. Alter all tbe discussions In com mittee and oat of committee, and in (be Senate, to-day, for tbe first time, we bear a oklibkhati, rasNXDlTATSD attack npon the convention that framed this constitution. I do not believe that the people of Western Virginia expected any such arguments from that quarter. I do not believe they would have Implored me almost to use what iuBu ?sea I might have to bring this matter be fore Congress at this late period of the ses sion, if they believed that one of their owu representatives waa to riae here and talk by tbe hour to endeavor to shake tbe confi dence of the Senate In the competency of the convention that had framed their con. stitntion. Sir, thus is souithixo wroxq sm this hatter. I do not profess to know -where it is, but it is unnsual; it Is not what we have heard before. It takes us all by surprise, and it jeopardises the measure. 1 hope from the perversity of any man, tbe people of Western Virginia, who ?r? worthy of our favor, will not cease to re ceive it because one of their own number takes a very different view of this subject from wbat It was expected be would take I hops w? shall view it as we always have before, that tbe people of Western Virginia wars sincere and are sincere, and when they have aeted in- tbeir Convention upon this subject, that it Tu a Convention that met the approbation of tbe people, that they have been entirely satisfied with iff sctiooi tbat the people are even more earnest than the Convention thai what the/ have done ?ball be carried out. Of all this there is oo doubt or qaestion, and here we are with-* the ability to-day to trive tbem what they anxiously demand, unlets we are prevented by the interposition of new and unheard of questions by one of their own represents- | Uvea."

One great obstacle in the way of a com plete success is the toleration in our midst ! of the publication and circclation of treas- j ouable Xewpapera, which, not daring in j the loyal States, to advocate open Treasou ? and War against the General Government, are covertly seeking the same end by fo menting party prejudice against the Gov ernment; endeavoring the excite alarm abciUt a great National Debt and ruinous taxation: to bring the Government paper curreocy DOW In circulation into discredit and disrepute; advocating Peace upon any terms by a disgraceful compromise, and in various ways exciting opposition to the War and stealthily spreading a spirit of disaf fection among the people and in the army, and poiaoning the minds of both against the Government; endeavoring to distract, di | vide and weaken its efforts for the vigor ous and united prosecution of th* War to a successful termination. A corrupt au?l dis loyal press or party may be tolerated in time of peace with impunity, while reason is left free to combat error, but, in time of War, wLeo the voice of reason is drowned amid the clangor of arms, when men form 'their opinions, however erroneous, and rush to arms to maintain and enforce them; no newspaper, or party should be tolerat ed which dissimioates error and cultivates hostility to the Government. No newspaper circulated in Western Vir ginia, has a more balefal intiu?-nce in this respect, than the Wheeling Pre**, which is generally taken by the Secessionists, feeds and fans their prejudice and opposition to the beat Government upon earth. Besides this the poison and treasou which it stealth ily aud ceaselessly disse ..inates, it has re cently been endeavoring to excite and stir up dissatisfaction, disobedience, aud mu tiny in the army, by inveigLiog against army orders, and endeavoring to excite prejudice against them and their authors, and to bring both into odium with the sol diery. It it therefore Ordered, That the Wheeling Preen shall not anywhere be circulated or brought within the lines of this commaud, and all officers and soldiers of this com tnaod are hereby ordered to immediately arrest any aud all persons bringing said paper within our lines or attempting to cir culate the same therein, and to deliver all peraous ao arrested to Copt.

A subscriber at Weston writing under d?te of the 26th nit., says: Siuce the Kanawha Division passed through this section we have felt more se curity in relatiou to guerrilla warfare tbun we have since the war began. A great many who left this coumj to avoid the draft are returning. One fellow who was with Jenkins eight weeks, told me they paid nothing, and that he got nothing to wear and not half enough to eat.

Uaibo, Nov. 29.?The Grand Army of the South is all in motion. General Sherman, with his forces, left Memphis on Wednes day. Gen. Grant's army struck tents at dawn yesterday and marched off on the Holly Springs road. Seveu days' rations were prepared. Oaly one tent Is allowed each twenty men, one to the officers of each company, and six wagons to each re giment. The rebels are falling back towards Gre nada, tearing up the track, carrying off rail*, and burning bridges as they retire. It is reported they are even moving heavi er valuables from Jackson, Miss.

Information Direct from Rlcbmoad, Panic Prevailing there. (Special to the PfciUdeipfcia Inquirer.] Wxiwkotov, Nov. 30, '62. The people of Richmond bare been bar- ( iog iooiberpaoic for the last two weeks. The removal of Gen. McCtelUn and tbe rapid movement of Gen. Buroside were ibe first cause.-. At tbe time of Geo. Barn aide's movement, Longitree* was in Rich mond, on r is war to North Carolina, tbe . campaign in Virginia being supposed to be over for tbe winter. Part of bis corps = were with him. They were pal io Ibe works aroand Richmond at once, while he took the cars for Fredericksburg, to bold tbe Rappahannock line if possible, and if not, to retard ourmorement til! Lee came op There are now from twentj to twenty-fire thousand men in the works around Rich mond, and but eight thousand north of that Cirj, including Lee's and Jackson's forces. Jackson has been recalled with Hill aod Stuart trom the Shenan doah Vallejr to form the left wing of Lee's array. Jackson was opposed to i coming, and wanted to keep up a divi sion of our forces by raids into Maryland and Pennsylvania. but was overruled by Lee and Davis. Tbe Cabinet at Richmond bare ordered Lee to throw bis whole army on tbe Rappahannock, and dispute every foot of the ground from thence to tbe rebel Capital. Tbey bare plenty of raw provi sions, and millions of pounds of beef, pork and floor are accumulating at Richmond. Vessels with clothing are running the blockade erery week, but their army is still suffering terribly. Numerous recent events serve to infUme the Richmond panic, such us Lee suddenly changing from the offen sive to tbe defensive, bis telegraphing daily for more men to save the capital, tbe pite ous appeals of their army for clothes, Geo. Dix'a capture of their pickets on tbe Chick abominy, tbe discovery that they lost from sixty to one hundred thousand men within tbe last ninety days io battle and by sick ness and desertion, and tbe indications of a stave insurrection at the botlidays. Gen. Uurnside aud tbe government are believed to have full acquaintance with there facts Gen. Bornside regards hi* present force ample for tbe work before bim. 8 peclal Washington Dispatches. 

FROM FKEDBRICKSBCKG. A dispatch trom tbe headquarters of Gen. Sumner, dated Friday, November 20tb, says, tbe ladies from the North who were visiting friends in Fredericksburg come over the river yesterday under a flag of truce. Tbey were taken to the head quarters of Gen. Snmner, when they stated their desire to be to return to their fami lies iu 'the North. After remaining nepr headquarters all night under guard aod receiving a full examination of their cases they were this morning given passes to Washington. They represvnttbe feeling in Fredericks burg to be of tbe most hostile charac ter ; tbe ladies especially are bitter and malignant bevood expression. Upon the approach of the National army they or ganized meetings and appointed Commit tees, who were instructed to visit the Kebel Commanding General to implore bim, upon their knees if necessary, not to surrender the city. Tbey preferred having their dwellings burned to tbe ground to having them again occupied by Northern troops. Tbe Rebel force now opposed to General Bornside, they represent to be very large, and say that General Bragg has beyond donbt nuited bis army with that of General Lee. They state also that General Jack son will remain in the rear and continue to menace Washington during the Winter. More intrenchments on the bight* of Fredericksburg have been biought to light to-day by tbe Sigoal Corps. The entire number which can now be seen with tbe aid of the best glasses is nearly fifty. Ma ny of tbem, however, are quite small, and protect but one gnu. Our own Topograph ical Engineers are very busy, and a thor ough knowledge of all the approaches to the river and the fords will soon be attain ed. Our left intrenchments are being thrown up similar to those of tbe rebels.? Gen. Burntfide, apparently, is quite indif morning, "Let them work, poor fellows! it will keep thc-m warm." Two or three re bel brigades were seen drilling this morn ing in hd open field, in full sight to the naked eye. The railroad from Acquia Creek will be completed by the close of this week. THE FAILURE OP THE ARMY TO ADVAXCR. Very general disposition is manifested here to cast upon Gen. Meigs the responsi bility for the failure of the Army of the Potomac to tnake ?n advance. It is now stated that when Gens. Halleck and Meigs visited Gen. Buraside, it was promised that certain ueceseary articles should be at Falmouth on tbe arrival of the ttriny, and tbat the want of these prevented tbe cross ing of the river before the reinforcemeut of the enemy. It is further stated, on good authority, tbat, notwithstanding an nbun. dance of supplies at Acquia Cieek, the army is actually suffering for food, from want of transportation for its conveyance. For some reasons, many divisions are again destitute of shoes and clothing. TUB HEALTH OF THE AHMY. The health of tlie army is remarkably good. Contrary as it may be to the opin ion generally entertained, there is much | less sickness on the march than when the troops are encamped. Tbe excitement consequeut upon seeing new sights, and participating in new scenes, dispels those j camp ills (real or imaginary) so common! among soldiers in a period of inaction. TUE WHEREABOUTS OF JECKSO.H AXD STUART* , The information above referred to came | from Gen. Sigel's scouts. Tbey report I that Jackson has taken up his'beadquar- | ters at Upperville, a little village between Middleburg and Paris, on the road leading to Asbty's Gap, and beiweeu forty and fif ty miles from this place. The nnmber of men with him or within supporting dis tance, is not now known, but the bulk of his force is doubtless near Ashby's Gap.-? The return of Jacksoa to this vicinity is no evidence whatever tbat the rebels intend to attack this position, or to make an attempt npon Washington, but rather that they haYe not yei got over their bewilderment at *he retrograde movement of this corps, and did not dare to leave entirely exposed the rear of tbe rebel army in its progress toward Richmond. THE WHEREABOUTS OP BTUAET. From the same source we have informa tion to the effect that Gen. 8tnart yester day took np bis headquarters at Salem? the little village or bamlet bearing tbat name, three or tour miles west of Thorough fare Gap. No more is known about his force than there is of Jackson's. As for that matter, Jackson's and Stuart's name adopted by any two persons, with numer our pickets, a reconnoitering party of 100 picked seen, and a reserve force of one man, would be all-sufficient to keep tbe Annt Pollys and all the quidnuncs at the Capital under a constant excitement for an indefinite period of time. The Generals named, with tbe bulk of the troops at their disposal, might as well and probably will be?If they are not now?near Richmond, in a position to aid Lfe in repelling Gen. Buraside. Gould the press or any other institution adopt some means to arouse the authorities at Washington to aconsct- J ousncss that our troops are expeeted to do | some other duty than simply to protect the . Capital by waiting to be attacked, this | would not be so Tbe rotnmaaditg officer | of this corps, I am toid, bas asked in Tain i for permission to unme the offensive, and, j as a"consequence of this refusal, the rebels are still in oar front^and there is no cer tain way of ascertaining in what force, on less the'present policy is cbaoged. THE IVDIAX COMTICTS. Botb the Senators and Representatires ; from Mionesota are urgent in requesting tbe President to approve the sentence of death upon tbe Indians in that State guilty of the late outrages there. The President, ; however, as well as the Commissioner of Indian affairs, is opposed to the iofiiction j ot punishment of such sereritv. (From the X. Y. Timee.) The Pre J tide of Battle. There if SO amazing degree of apathy : on tbe part of tbe public in regard to the present face to ;ace antagonism of the Na \ tional aad rebel armies, on tbe Rappahan j nock. We cannot account for it on tbe ? ground of unconsciousness of the position. I Every citizen of the loyal North who reads [ know *hat Gen. Burnside bas led bis grand ! army, by a sadden oblique movement. I from tbe line of the Bine Ridge toward Fredericksburgb, and that Gen. Lee, not at all blinded by the strategy, immediately began to concentrate bis whole army at Fredericksburgb to oppose him. For ten days tbe two armies have been confronting each otber in force, only a narrow stream dividing them,and tbe pickets indulging in colloquies, not unfrequently within fifty yards of each other. Two such bodies cannot remain as these i two are now situated, almest in actual con I tact, without tbe early and inevitable con sequence ot deadly conflict. Each army is | charged to the muzzle with wrath, and the j otber knows it. Burnside bolds command of tbe National troops because McClellan was too dilatory in offeriog fight. His very presence at tbe bead of the army is tanta mount to immediate wager of battle. Gen. Lee's inclination for a decisive struggle is the result equally ,of policy and necessity. His army is larger than be can ever hope to have it again, and bis men suffer more than it is safe to make them suffer, from tbe lack of suitable protection against tbe winter's cold. Every consideration of policy, pres sure, and duty is urgiug each bide to the attack. And there they stand, face to fac*, with only tbe uarrow river between.? Burnside ought to have 150,000 meu. Lee is believed by his Baltimore friends, who keep communication with bim, to have 130.000, including Stonewall Jackson's corps. Vet, with the campaign in Virginia brought to this imminent verge, there is no emotion, uo excitement locatch tbe first booming of canuon in the fight. There was never so sereat a degree of popular uncon cern on tbe eve of a gigantic battle. If there were a universal superstition that tbe converging of tbe two armies toward Fred ericksburg were all n gbam. there could hardly be a quieter lookout on their mena cing positions in front of that venerable town. We will not attempt to explain tbe singular phenomenon we have described. But certain Iy*a deeper public interest would be more becoming at such a critical mo. rnent. Buttles do not always nor oftenest begin by premeditation. They frequently commence most unexpectedly to botb com batants. A stray shot?a misunderstood movement?an erroneous order bf a subor dinate?any trifling error, may precipitate a conflict when opposing host* are placed as tbe two armies are at Fredericksburg. Any moment we may hear that blood is flowing in torrents and tbe fate of tbe Union hanging on tbe issue of the most sanguinary battle of the war. No potriot has excuse to forget the prayer, "God save the Republic!" Tike Coal Digger*' Strike?Letter Trora John Kolau. Editor4 Intelligencer : Some evil disposed persons hare been for several days past industriously circu lating & malicious report, to the effect that I was the occasion of originating the late strike among the coal diggers, and a cor respondent, who signs himself "One in ueed of Coal," endeavors in to?day*a issue of your paper to confirm the falsehood, by usserling that a promiuent coal merchant had urged hi? men to stand by their com rades. and that no coal should be dug in bis bank until their demands were satisfied. It Is true thnt your correspondent does not directly allude to me, as the prominent mercbont who is said to have urged bis men to strike, but bis remarks taken in connection with rumors circulated on the streets, induces me to be believe that I may assume that I am the one to whom he has reference. Now I assert, without fear of contradiction, that I had uot the slightest intimatioo that my men had any intention of striking until they had laid down their tools and come out on the platform, having been persuaded to pursue that course by a gang of miners tbat came from Fulton.? When I discovered that they were deter mined to strike, f advised and urged them, as the following certificate will abundantly testify, to resume their work, aod I would pay them whatever price other merchants cousented to pay. Johh ^?olav. Whkblisu, Dec. 1st, 18&2. We, the undersigned Miner* lately em ployed in John Nolan's Coal Bank, do cer tify thai Mr. Nolan was not cognizant of our intention to strike for higher wages j until the strike was actually accomplished. We further aver that ho has never told us to stand by our comrades?that no coal should be dog in his bank until we got j what we demanded?on the contrary be I urged us to contiuue at our work, but we | did not heed bis exhortation, as we consid ered we were old enough to judge what was best for our own interest. j A.
