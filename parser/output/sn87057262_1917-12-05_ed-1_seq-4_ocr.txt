TODAY'S BIT OF VERSE ITALY. Hum art Weeding, Italy! Rubies burn thy belting sea, Dripping nsbiee from thy breast And afar we pale, and start As ira first had felt a blow, Though a thousand scars we bear. Little of oar world we know. Little of her ways can read Lies her head we know not where Or her shifting hands and feet But her heart we know is set (Like a song within a deed. Like a jewel all may see.

They have flooded the country with their catalogues, and will reap a harvest in proportion. Vast amounts of money are sent away during the holiday season for pur chases that could be as satisfactorily, and far more profitably, made at home. Purchases made through the drawing power of mail order catalogues are on a cash basis, and no part of this cash will ever return for circulation in the community from which it is sent. The catalogue buyer is attracted largely by his curiosity to see what he will get for his money. Ic is owing to this instinct that the mail order house flourishes.

It is folly for this country to persist in non-recognition of a state of war as sumed as a fact by Austria-Hungary even as Germany assume.I that fact by acts committed before this country took cognizance. Austria-Hungary is Germany's, vassal, says Mr. Wilson. The dual monarchy is as much re sponsible for frightfulness as the empire which she serves.
