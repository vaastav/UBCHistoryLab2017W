The creation of this department was for the more immediate beuctlt ot a largo c as ot our most valuable citizens. and I trust that the liberal bat-is upon which it has been organized will uot only meet your ap- prooatiou, but taut il win realize at no aislaut Oiiy ull the fondest autluipallouaof its most sau- guiuo fileudi, and bccomi the lruiUul source of udvautage to all our people. Ou the '2 2d day of September last a proclama tlou was issued by the Executive, a copy of wnicn is Herewith submitted, in accordance with thu purpose expressed lu the secoud pan graph olu 'at paper, 1 now recpetll'uily recall your attention to what may be called " Com peusated Emancipation." A nation may be said to cousist of its territory, its people and its laws. The territory is the only part, which is of certain durability, "Ouegcueraliou passelU away aud another generation coiueth, but the eurlii abldclh forever." Il is of thu hrst lmporlauce U duly consider and estimate this ever endur ing part, that portion of the earth's surface which is owned aud luhablted by tho people of the United States is well adapted to be the home of oae national family, aud it is not well adaptvd for two or more, its vast exteuc aud It variety f climate aud productions are of ad vantage iu the age of oue people, whatever Ihey might have bees iu former ages. Steam aud telegraphs nud lutclligeuco have brought these to bo an advantageous combination for oue united people. In the Iuaugural Address I briefly pointed out the total inadequacy of disunion us a reme dy for dill'erences between the people of the two sections. I did so in language which 1 canuot improve, and which, iLereloro, 1 beg to rciwat. Oue section of our country believes slavery is right, and ought to bo extended, while the other believes it is wrong, and ought uot to be extended. This is tho only substantial dispute. The fugitive slave clause of tho Constitution aud thu law for suppression of the African slave trade arc each as well enforced perhaps as any law can ever be lu a community where the moral sense of the people Imperfectly supports tho law itself. The great body of the people abide by tho legal obligations iu both cases, and a tew break over in each. This I think canuot bo iierfcctly cured, aud it would be worso in both iustauocs after separation of the sections thau lelore. The foreign slavo trade, now imperfectly sup pressed, would bo ultimately revived without restriction in one sectiou, while fugitives, now ouiy partially sum udered, would not be sur rendered at all by the others l'hyslcally speak ing we caunot separate, we cannot remove our respective section from each other, nor build an impassable wall between them. A husband aud wife may be divorced and go out of the presonce and beyond tbo reach of each other, but tho different parts of tho country caunot do UiU. They cannot but remain face to face, aud In tercourse, either amicable or hostile, must con tinue between them. Is it possible then to make til it intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory after reparation thau beforo ? Can aliens make tieutli s ea-der than frionds can make laws t Cau treaties be more faithfully en enforced bo more faithfully cuforoed among lorcea oetwecn aliens man laws can among rlends r Suppose you go to lows, to wit: Tho Prealdent of the United States shall deliver to every audi Sut. bonds of the United States, bearing interest at the rule of , for each slave shown to have U'en therein by the eighth census of the Lull ed States: said bonds to be delivered to such Sute by lnstal'ments or in one parcel at tho completion or the anolUhment, accordingly ai the same shall have been graiual or at oue t rue within such State; aud interest shall bo ghi to run upon any such bond only from the proper lime or its tieiivery, as aroresaid, am: afterwards any State having receive ! bonds as aforesaid, aud afterwards introducing or tole rating slavery therein shall refund to the Unit ed Slates the bonds so received or the value thereof and all interest tald thereon. Article. All slaves who shall have enjoyed nctu 1 freedom by the chances of the war at any time before tbe end of the rebellion shall lie forever free, but all owners of such who shall not have been dltdoyul shall be compensated tor inem at tne same rate as is provided for States adopting abolishment of slavery, but in such a way mat no slave shall be twice accounted for. Article. -Congas-i may appropriate money ana otherwise provide lor colonizing Iree col oied persons with their owu content at any place or places without the Unite t Stales. I beg Indulgence to dl-cuts these proposed artl 'les at soino length. Without slavery tho rebellion should uever have exhled. Wilhonl slavery it could uot continue' Among the friends of the Union theiu is ic real diversity of sentiment and policy in regard to slavery and the African race amongst us. Some would abolish it suddenly and without compensation. Some would abolish it gradually and with com pensation. Some would remove the free eo ple from us, aud some would retalu them with u; and there are yet other minor diversities. Because f thebo diversities we waste much slrenifth in struggles amougst ourselves. By mutud concession we should harmonize aud act together. This would be a compromise among the friends and not with the enemies of the Union. These articles are Intended to embody a plan of such mutual concession. If tho plan shall be adopted, it Is assumed that emancipation will follow, at least in several of tho Slates. In the first article the mala points are ; tlrst, the etunuoipatlon i second, the length of lime for consummating 37 years; and, ;bird, tho com pensation. The emancipation will be uusatis taclory to tho advocates of perpetual slavery, but the length of tlmu should greatly mitigate their dissatisfaction. The Umu saves both races from the evils of sudden derangement ; lu fact, from the necessity of any deraugemeut ; while most of thoso whoso habitual course of thought will be disturbed by the meas ure will have passed away before lis consummation. They will never see lL Another class will hall the prospect of eman cipation, but will depreciate the length of time. They will feci that It given too little to lbe now living slaves, but It really gives them much. It saves them from tho vagraut desti tution which must largely attend immediate emancipation lu localities where their num bers are very great, aud it gives the inspiriting aanurauce that their posterity shall be free forever. The plan leaves to eazh State, choos ing to act under it, to abolish slavery now or at tbe end ot tho century, or at any Intermed iate time, or by degrees, extending over the whole or auy part of that period, aud it obliges no two States to proceed alike. It also pro vides for compensation, and generally the mode of making It. This, It would seem, must further mitigate tho dissatisfaction of those who favor per petual slavery, aud especially those who are to receive compensation. Doubtless some ot those who are to piy. and not to receive, w'll object. Yet that the measure Is both just aud economical, is certain. The liberation of the slaves is the destruction of property acquit ed by descent and by purchase, the same as any other protieriy. It Is no less true lor having ueen oiten said, that tbe people ot tho Nuth are no more responsible for tho introduction of this properly than are the people of the North, and when It is remembered how unhesitatingly we an nave useu cotton ana sugar, ana share tbe profits of dealing In them, it mav not be quite safe to say that tho South Las been more responsible than the North for its contiun tuce. If. then, for a common object this orouertv Is to be sacrificed, is It not just that it be done at a common charger And If, with leas money, or money more easily paid, we can preccrvo the benefits of the Uuion by I his means thun we can by war aloue, Is It not economical to do it? Let us consider it then. Let us ascertain the sura we have expended in tho war since com pensated emancipation was proposed last March and consider whether il that measure had been promptly accepted by even some of much harder to pay for tho war than a dollar for emancipation by the prooed plan ; aud then the litter would cost no blood-no precious life. It would be a saving of both. As to the sesond article, I think it would bo impracticable to return to bondage the class of pttrtous therein contemplated. Some of them,- doubtlesi", In the property sense, belon to loyni owuers, ana neuce provision is made iu tlil article for compensating such. The third article relates the future of the freed iieople. Il doe uot oblige, but merely authorises Cougrc to aid in colonizing such as may con sent, i Thisouuht not to be regarded as ob jcclionable on tho one hand or on the other. Inasmuch as it comes to naught unions by mu tual couM'tit of tho people to bedeorted, and the American voters ihroagu their Kepreseu tatives In Congress. I canuot make il setter known thau it alreadv U, that I strong ly lavor colonization, and yet 1 wish to say that there is an objection agaluat the colored persons remaining lu the country which is largely imaginary, if not sometimes mallclotu. it Is lutlslcd that their presence would injure aud die pi ace white labor and white laborers. If there ever could be a pro. per time lor more arguments, mat time Is surely nut uow. Iu limes like the present. men shoild utter nothing for which they wculJ not bo willingly responsible through time and eternity. 1 it true then, that colored people can displace anv more white labor by being free thun remaining slaves? If they s:ay In their own places, they jostle no w hile laborers. If they leave their old places, they leave them open to white laborers. Logically, there is neiuier more nor lea or it. emancipation. even witnoui ueportaiiou, would prooabiy eu hance the wages of white labor, and very sure ly would uot reduce them. Thus, the customary amount oi lanor woui'i still nave to be perform ed. ibe freed eople would surely not do more man tneir old proproruon or it, and very probably for a itnie would do less, leaving au Incr ased part to white laborers, bringing th ir moor into greater demand, and consequently euuauciug i.no wages oi it. With deportation even to a limited extent. enhancing wages to whits labor is malhemuu lcally ceriaiu. Labor la liko auy other com munity in tne market, i nemos tne demand lor it, and you iacrcaso the price of it. Keduco mo supply oi mack; labor by coloulziuir the black laborer out of the country, and bv pre cisely so uiucu you win increase me demand lor, and wages tor white labor. But it Is dreaded that tbe freed people will swarm lortu and cover the whole laud. Will lib eration make them any more numerous? ualy distributed among the bites of the wnoie country, ana there would be but one colored to seven whites, could the ouo in auy way greatly disturb the seven? There are many communities now having more than ouo free colored persou to seven whites, aud this without any apparent consciousness of evil from it. Tho District of Columbia and the Suites of Maryland and Delaware are In this c u Jltiou. Tne District has more than ouo free colored t six whites, aud yet In its frequent pe titions to Congress, 1 believe il has never pre sented the presence of free colored persons as one of its grievances. But why should emancipation South Bend the frood people North? feoole of anv color seldom run unit as there is something to ruu from. Heretofore colored people have fled North, tOBome extent, from bondare. and now perhaps from both bondage and destitution ; but 11 gradual emancipation and deportation be adopted, they will have n ither to flee from. tneir own musters will Klve tbem wages, at least, till Mew laborers can lie procured, and the treed men. in turn, will ifladlt civ their labor for wages till new homes can be found for them iu cougenlul climes aud with people of their own blood aud i ace. This proponitlou can bo trmsted on the mo. tual Interests Involved, and In anv event cannot the North decide for itself whether to receive them? Again, as practice proves more than theory in auy case, has there been anv lrruntion northward Ucau.ie ot the abolishment of slave ry iu the District of Columbia lant spring? What I have said of the proportion of fiee co lored persons to the whites in tne District of Columbia is Irotn thu census of 1800, having no reference to persons called contrabands, nor to those made tree by the act of Conirreaa abol. Lining slavery here i. e piun consisting or these article Is recom mended, uot but that a restoration of the na tional authority would be accepted without its adoption, nor will the war or proceedings un der the proclamation of September Kind, 1802, be stayed because of the recommendation of this plan. lis timely adoption, I doubt not, would bring restoration, aud thereby stay both.

The va.-t expenditure lucUent to tho military and naval operauous required Tor the suppression or tin rebellion, have hitherto been met with a proiup Utude aud certainty unlveisal lu t-liullar circum stances, and Uie public credit has been fully maintained.. The continuance of the war, however, and the iuereustd disbursements made neocssary by the augmented forces now la the neld, demand your best reflection as to the best inmles of providing the ucceMary revenue without injury to business, aud wiiu the least possible burdens upon labor. Tbe suspension of specie paymeul by tho btuks soon after the commencement of your last ses sion, made large Issues of United Slates notes unavoidable. In no other way could the pay msut Uie troops and Uie saUslaclioa of wiher several preceding years.

The deficiency in tne department for the previous year, was 4, 55i,(S U8. Foi the lust fiscal year it waa re duced to 2,112,814 57. These favorable re sults are lu part owing to the cessation of mail couvcyunci lu tho insurrectionary Stales, and in part to a casual review of all expenditures in that department in tho Interest of ccouomy.

The Secretary of tho Interior reports as fol lows in regard to public lands: The public lauds have ceased to be a source ol reveuue From the 1st of July 1801 to the 30th Sspiem ber, 1802 the entire cash receipts trom the sale of public lauds were f lJ7,4i7.vlb, a sum much less thau the exp nfo of our land system during the same period. The homestead law which will take effect on Uie 1st of Jauuary next offers such Inducements to settlers that tales fur cask canuot be expected to au extent sufficient to meet the cxpeuecs of the general land office audcokl ol surveying ana briuging the laud Into market. The disc repancy between the sum hire stated as arising from the sales ot public lauds und the sum derived from the same uourcc as reported from th Treasury Deiart meni arises, us I understand, from the fact that the periods of lime, though apparently, were not really coincident at the begiuning point, Die Treasury report, including a considerable sum uow, vv! ich had previously beeu reported iioui thu Interior sufficiently large to greatly overreach tho sum derived from the three uiou hs now reported upen by tho Iuterior and uot by the i reuaury. The Indian tribes upon our frontiers have. during the past year, manifested a spirit of In- subordluftiloii, aud, at several point, engaged in open hosUlities agalust the wnito settlers in their vlciniiv.

Tho chief of tho Chero kee s has visited this city for the purposo of roe tonug Uie loruicr relations ol the tribe with tbe Lulled States. Ho alleges Uiat they were constrained by superior force to enter into treaties with the insurgents, and that me uni ted States ucgkclod lo furnish the protection which their treaty stipulations required, lu the mouth of August last, the Sioux Indians in Minnesota attacked the settlers lu their vicinity with extreme ferocity, killing Indiscriminately men, women and children. This attack was wholly unexpected and there fore uo defense had been provided. It is esti mated that not less thau 800 persons were kill ed by tho Indians and a largo amount of prop erly was desiroyod. Uow this outbreak was induced Is not detluilcly knows aud suspicious which may U) unjust, need not be stated. In formitlou was received by tho Indian bureau f.om dilleretit sources about tho Umu hostilities were commenced mat a simultaneous attack was to be made upon the white settlements by all the tribes between tbe Mississippi river and the Rocky Mountains. Ti e State of Minnesota has tutiervd great injury irotn mu ludiau war. A large portion ot her territory has been do tiopulaicd aud a severe loss has been sustained by the destruction ol property.

Mmy wise and good men have been impressed wiiu the belief that this can bo pro tiiuoly done. 1 futmiit a statement of the proceedings of tne wOUimiMiouer wmca shows the progress that has been made In the cntsrprl-e of con structing the Pacific Railroad, and this sug gest the earliest comnleUon of the road and also Uie favorable aeUon of Congress upon Uie when after much loss on both sides and no gain on either, you cease fighting, the ldenll cut old questions as to terms cf Intercourse are again upou you. There la do line, straight or crooked, suitaDio ror a nauouai pounaury upon which to divide. Truee through from east to west upon the line between tho free aud slave country, and we shall find a little more than ono third of its length are river. , easy to be crossed, aud popu lated, or soon to be populated thickly upon both sides, whllo in nearly all its remaluing length are surveyor's lines, over which people may walk Pock aua lortu wituouiuuy coucious uess of their presence No part of this Hue can be roado auy more aimcull to pass by writing It down on paper or parchment as a national boundary. 1 he laet ol separation, u it comes, gives up on the part of the eeoedlng section the fugitive slave clause, ulong with all other constitutional obligations upon the section seceded, rroui which 1 snouid expect no treaty stipulation would ever bo made to take Ita place But there is another difficulty. The great interior regious nouuaea oust uy me ai leganies, north by tho British dominions, west by the uouay Mountains, ana soutn oy me line long which tho cultivation of corn and cotton meets, uud which includes part of Virginia, part of Tennes see, all of Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, VV tji.inuln lllO.nla Vfl.aMirl Van. 1.VUIIU, I9WU31.U, AIIIUWW. A.WVUtl, . sus, Iowa, Minnesota, aud the territories of Dacotah, liebraska. aud a part or coioraao, have above ten millions of people, and will have fifty milllous within fifty years, If not pre. vented y any political folly or mistake. It cmilulne more thau one-third of the couutry owued by the revolted States, certainly more thun oue milliou of surface miles. One-half as populous as Massachusetts already Is, it would. have seventy-five minions o: people. A glance at lbe map shows that, territorially speaking, it Is the great body of the Republic. Ti e other parts are but marginal borders to it, the mag nificent rcglou sloping West from tho Rocky Mountains to the Pacific, U-iug the deepest aud also the richest in tha undeveloped resources, in the production of provisions, grains, grasses, aud ail which pro ceed from them. This great interior region is naturally one of the most impor tant in the world. Ascertain lrom the statis tics the small proportion of the region which has as yet beeu brought luto cultivation, an I also the large and rapidly increasing amount of its products, and we shall bo overwhelmed Willi the magnitude of the prospect presented and yet this region has no sea coast, touches no ocean anywhere. As part of one natiou, iu people now find and may forever find their way lo Lnrope by New York, to South America aud Africa by New Orleans, und lo Asia by San Fraucisco. But separate our common counlty into two nation, as designed by the present re bellion, and every man in this great interior region is thereby cutoff from some one or wore ot these eutleu, uot, perhaps, by a physical bar rier. but by embarrassing and ouerous trade regulations: nd this is true wherever a dividing and boundary lino may be fixed. Hlaua It but ween tbe uow free and slave coun try or place it south of Kentucky or uorlb ot Ohio, and still the truth remains that nouo south of it cau trade to any port or place north of it, and nono north of it, trade to auy port or place south of It, except upon terms nictated by a Government foreign to them. These out lets east, w st, and south, are indispensable to the well-being of the people inhabiting aud to Inhabit this vast interior region. v nicu oi tne three maybe the best isuo proper question ; all are bettor than either and all of right belong to that jKXJple and to their successors forever. True to themselves they will uot ask where a line of separation shall be, but will vow rather that there shall bo no such line. Nor are ihe marginal regions less interested in these communications to and through them to Uie grout outside world. They do and each ot them mast have access to their bgypl of the West without paying toll at the crossing of any national boundary. Our national strlle springs not from our permanent part, not from the lauds we inh .bit. not from our national homestead. There is no possible severing of this, but would multiply aud not mitigate eviis among ui. In all lu adaptations and aptitudes It demands Uuion aud abhors separation. In fact, it would ero long force ro-unlon, however much of blood and treasure Uio separation nibrht have cost- Our 8trtn--rtarn8 to our selves, to thu passing gencnlS. of men, and ltcaauot without convulson be bushed for ever, with the Dossil) g of one generation. In this view. I recommend the adoption of Uie follow ing resolution and articles, am.nd itory to Uie Constitution oi uiv uuiki oki Resolved. By the Senate and house of Rep e.ntatlves of tho United States of Amer ica In Congress assembled, two-thirds of both Houses concurring, that tho fol lowing articles be proposed to Uie Legisla tures, or conventions oi tne several niaies, as amendments to Uie Consiliullon of the Uulted States, all or any of which articles when rati lied by three-fourths of the said Legislatures or conventions, to bs valid as p .ri or paru of the -aid Constitution, namely i Article. -Every Stato wherein slavery now exisu, which shall abolish the same therein at any Ume or times before the first day of Janu ary, In the year of our Lord 1900, shall receive compensaUon frem the Uulted States as fol- .11 0 if Uiaaia ) IlliuU done more to close the war tbau has been oth erwise doue. It so the measure would save money, and In that view would be a prudent aud economical measure certainly. Il Is not so a,y to pay something as It is to pay uolhlug, but it Is easier to pay a large sum thau it is lo pay a larger one, and it is easier to pay any sum when we are awe man to ty it belore we are able. The war requires them at ouce. Tbo aggregate sum necessary for com- pu-usaieU etuiucipauou or course would ie large, but il wouil require no ready caih nor boudsman any faster lhau the emancl nation progress, lhls might not and probably would uoi close oeiore tne end oi the e. years. At thut lime we shall probably have 100, (M), 000 people to share the burden instead of ai.ow 000 us uow t aud not oulv so but tho Increase of our population may Lo expected to continue for a long time alter the period as rapidly as be fore, because our territories will uot Lave be come full. -1 do not stato this lucousldorate.lv. At the same raUo of Increase which we have maintained ou an average from our first nation al census in 1790 until that of 1800 we should In lVuO have a population of 103,208,415, aud why may we not couunnc that ratio tar beyond that period ? Our abundant room, oar broad national homestead, is au ample resource. Were our territory as limited as are the British Isles, cer tainly our population could not expand as slat ed. Iusteod of recelvlug tho foreign born as now, we should be compelled to scud part of thu native born away, out such is uot our condlUon. we have 2,903,000 square miles. Europe has 3, 800,000, with a popubuiou averag ing persons lo the square mile. Why may uot our country, at some time, average as many ? Is it loss fertile ? Una It mora waste surlace by mountains, rivers, lakes, deserta or other causes? Is It inferior to Europe lu auy uaiurul advantage? if, then, wo are at some Ume to be as populous as Europe, how soon ?
