The errors inseparable from transmission by telegraph Seem in this instance to have been aggra vated beyond the usual measure, and both documents, as printed, contained errors in* numerable, to the marring, and in some cases to the utter destruction of sense and meaning. As we shall reprint it, it will be correct, and for its reading under such as* surancc, we arc aware that many ore waiting. The President bas ordered* Gen. Scho field, of Missouri, to make up bis baggage for Washington, and be goes, not to return to bis command, as it is to be hoped. Men who believe in Schofield arc, unfortunately for him, not the men who are doing the most to bring this war to a successful issue by crippling the rebellion in cveiy way. Missouri will be helped the earlier tq realize her brighter day, by the removal of all such instrumentalities as Schofield bas made himself since be ftßgnmf>d com* mand. Poor drunken Bob Letcher staggers through a characterifitic rhodemontade, by way of a message to the rebel Legislature of Virginia, in ■which he vapors and bel lows in a manner that quite recalls old times which all can remember when, next to her trade in milk-and-molasscs-colored babies, the chief staple of the Old Domin ion was just such talk as this, and it is even cheaper now than then. A variety of highly important matter has been brought before Congress thus early in the session, and there is no prospect that these important and vital topics will he postponed for lesser measures. Congress is in earnest, has the power to give effect to its earnestness, and will make this ses sion memorable. The attention of capitalists and men of enterprise can hut be elicited by the state ments in our Milwaukee dispatch else where-, relative to the opportunity now offered for the leasing of plantations in the South. A Loyal Paper In Utah. The officers and enlisted men of the Cali fornia volunteers have commenced the publi cation at Camp Douglas, Utah territory, of a paper called the Union TxdetU, Camp Doug las is near Great Salt Lake City. The Videtts speaks out In strong terns against the dis loyal course of many of the Mormon leaders, and plainly declares that the military power will be employed to crash any overt acts of hostility to the government Wc quote a paragraph from its leading article: “ While it is not the mission of the Califor nia column in Utah to insult, oppress, or per secute the’people ot these valleys, it must not he forgotten that the nation—our own native or adopted,homo—is to-day straggling with a gigantic, unholy rebellion, and the dnty of every good citizen to sustain by word and thought and deed our common country is as plain as it is imperative. We say this—as we have- begun our -enterprise —in the best of feeling, trusting and believing that our lan guage will not be distorted into aught that savors of threat or nnkindnees, but as the friendly voice of those who seek the good and the prosperity of erciy man, woman and child in Utah, who have not voluntarily plac ed themselves beyond the pale of charity and friendship. Oar first duty is to the nation, whose pre servation and advancement every good clti- Kcn holds next his heart. Oar second, to Utah, the happiness, freedom and progress of whose people we know to be the desire of the General commanding, and those united with him in the discharge of public duty.” Andrew’s majority in Massa chnsctis, according to the official returns of the late election, is 41,270.

He was formerly from Somoimnk, DeKalb county. Ho cause is as signed for the act. Verdict of the Coroner accordingly. message ofdov. Letcher. New York, Dec. 14* —Gov. Letcher's mes sage to the rebel Legislature of Virginia con cludes as follows: Look at the picture on all sides and it pre sents hopeful and encouraging features. If wc arc only true to ourselves, to the cause and to the country wc cannot be overthrown. Is there a man who doubts the result of the struggle ? If there be such a one, he Is a traitor at heart who deserves to be anathe matized and cast out from among us. Ko State has been more loyal, more faithful,* more devoted; none has contributed more liberally in means' and men; none has baml their breast more boldly or defi antly to the storm, and none has sent her reapers to the harvest of death with more sacrificing devotion than the Commonwealth of Virginia. She enlisted for the War utter foil consideration and a just appreciation of all the consequences which were to follow the separation, and she will be true to the end. She will never sue for peace because she did not bring on this war. She will never propose for compromise for she Finales only lor her rights, for liberty and : Independence. Sin- will, :.s becomes the mother • of states. Kland up boldly and hurl her scorn and defiance in the face of her foes until they come to our terms. She will never consent to a treaty of peace which dismembers her own territory, nor will she consent to a treaty which does not r' coirnlze fullv tbe Southern Confederacy. She knows what is due to her own dignity and character, and she knows what is due to the Confederacy, and her duty will be per formed with scrupulous fidelity. Kneeling around the altar of their country, her sons will swear allegiance to her and fidelity to the Confederate * Government, and their pravers will ascend to Heaven for blessing ■on her and the Southern Confederacy.

The President never visited the army without do ing injury, never that it was no£ followed by disaster. He was Instrumental in tbe Gettys burg affair. He instructed Bragg at Murfrees boro and opened Georgia to 15,000 of the cue mv's troops and laid south Carolina liable to -destruction. He charged Jeff D.ivis with having almost ruined the country, and de clared that be would meet Ids champion any where to discuss it Would to God he would never visit the army again.

[Special Dispatch to the Chicago Tribune.] Washington, Dec. 14,1863. SCHOFIELD HAULED OVER TITE COALS. Within a few days after Gen. Rosecrans had been removed from tho command of the Army of the Cumberland, Secretary Chase, Gov. Dennison, and other prominent men, mainly from Ohio, mged upon the President the policy of removing Gen. Schofield from the command of the Department of Missouri, and appoint Gen. Rosecrans in his stead, and represented the importance of doing tht« be fore the Missouri election. The President, however, refused to listen to appeals for the removal of Schofield, and decided to Ignore the demands of the Missouri Radicals and retain him. The matter stood thus until the recent meeting of the Loyal League National Council. This body appointed a committee, consisting of John Covodc, Jas. M. Ashley and cx-Govcmor Boutwell to present to the President objections to *bis course, to urge upon him the speedy removal of Hallcck, Blair and Bates here, and of Schofield in Mis souri, and to represent that the loyal senti ment of the country considered he had made a grave mistake in not sustaining the /Mis souri Radicals. This representation produced a marked effect. It was easy for the Presi dent to maintain the position he had chosen to take against the delegation from a single state, and representing os he considered, a faction in that State, bnt this Committee had a more potential voice and spoke with an authority to which Mr. Lincoln in his plescnt circumstances deemed it better policy to yield. Senator Gratz Brown was speedily sent for, and as the result of the interview with iblm and the Loyal League Commit tee, the order was at once transmitted di rectly to Gen. Schofield to report in Washing ton in person. Meantime the President asked Missoni! how they would like Gen. Bosecrons as Com mander of the Department, if a change were made, and the reply-was made that the ap pointment wonld be entlrdy satis factory. The ofioir, of course, remains in this shape until Gen. Schofidd comes. Complaints have been made from Kansas against Gen. Schofield, which amount to charges. When he comes here, the President will confront him with his accusers. If Gen. Schofield should be removed and Gen. Bosccnms made his successor, the ap pointment of the latter officer will .be by the President direct, and in spite of the deter mined hostility of the War Department and Gcncral-in-CbicC This hostility is, however, beginning to be somewhat less bitter than a month or two ago. The statement that the Radicals in Mis souri, or their representatives here, for any ground favored the confirmation of Gen. Schofidd is unfounded. A paragraph to that effect was interpolated In these dispatches without the personal knowledge of the reg ular correspondent. THE 

CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES. There is a general expression of satisfac tion at the cast of the committees, and In fie House, while they are of unusual strength, it Is noticed in most cases that there is a peculiar aptitude In the men ap pointed for the respective places. Thus, tbe Military Committee contains two Major and two Brigadier Generals, all of whom have seen much active service in the field. The Committee on Agriculture,-headed by Brutus J. Clay, perhaps the most noted practical fanner in the West. The Committee on Pa tents is headed by a noted Philadelphia land patent lawyer. The Committee on Manufac tures is headed by Gen. Morehead, for many years a practical civil engineer. Many simi lar Illustrations might be selected. The Democrats make no complaint ot their treat ment Pendleton was last year on the Judi ciary Committee, and was raised to the Com mittee on Ways and Means, the most impor tantplace any Democrat In the House could have under an Administration organization/ Little Cox retains his old place. TEE SEW GOSPEL OF PEACE. Some surprise is expressed at. Fernando Wood's bring able to muster fifty-nine votes for his resolution for commissioners to go to Richmond and beg for peace. Fifty-nine Democrats thus place themselves 9n peaco-at eny-terms ground, under Fernando Wood’s lead. Some pressure is being brought to bear for the reappointment of Fremont to the command of the Department of Mis souri. TIIE mnox LEAGUE. More authentic information of the de mands of the committee of the loyal league,’ at present indicates that they confined them selves to asking for the removal of Scho-’ field. Efforts were made in the league to in clude Blair, Bates and Hallcck, bat the mem bers of that body voted, these propositions down THE 

ILLINOIS AND SCCEIG AN CANAL. The entire delegation froinlllinoiß, Union and Democratic, arc united in pressing for ward the Ship CancL Both committees be fore which it comes are constituted in a manner fevorahlc to it It will be passed this session with great earnestness and zeal. eecipeocut treaty. Tbe reference of Mr. Morrill’s joint resolu tion giving notice of the abrogation of the Canadian Reciprocity Treaty, to the Commit tee on Commerce, Is understood to indicate the mydification, not the abrogation of the treaty. CONGRESSIONAL. Mr. Arnold got through a resolution in structing the Committee on Commerce to in quire into the practical workings of the treaty, and to sec what amendments arc needed to moke it more advantageous to both parties. HEALTH OB TUB PRESIDENT. The President's health is re-established. While he has been recovering from the laic attack of variloid, be has been saying that since be b&s been President be bas always bad a crowd of people asking him to give them something, hut that now Tie ha* something he can give them oft. 

BELLICOSE. Senator McDongall is going to start off on his old hobby of presenting a resolution forcing a war with Franco by declaring the invasion of Mexico an unfriendly act on the part of France, and calling for an inquiry into the expediency of onr declaring war against that power. It will be voted down almost without a count as soon as the Senate gets a chance to vote on it. UNION LEAGUE. The National Connell of the Loyal League has adjourned. SENATE. Gratz Brown was sworn in to-day. This completes the roll of the Senate. Mr. Wil son moved resolutions of thanks, to-day, inclnding one to. Hooker, thus giving Con gressional recognition of the valne of Ms services In organizing a victory at Gettys burg. NAVAL MATTERS. Admiral Wilkes feels very much aggrieved at the imputation cast upon Mm by Secreta ry Welles, in Me report, in the statement that Ms detention of the Vanderbilt prevent ed the capture of the Alabama. Ho is pre paring a letter to Secretary Welles, and in which he will vindicate Mmself and place the TcsponsibUily on the Navy Department. reconstruction. A bill is now prepared, and is shortly to be introduced from the Committee on Territo ries, intended to give shape and practical effect to the President’s recommendations about reconstruction. Highly important letters were received here yesterday by prominent gentlemen, from conservative members of the rebel Congress, asking, unofficially, on what terms they could be permitted to return to the Union. They intimate that there is on earnest desire to abandon the rebellion and return, and that the question of reconstruction will be boldly presented this winter at Richmond. THE

It Is averred that the soldiers would have come overtons in bodies long since if they could have been satisfied that they would not at once have been impressed into the Union service.
