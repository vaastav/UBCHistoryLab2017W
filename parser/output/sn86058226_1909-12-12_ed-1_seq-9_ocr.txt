I - (American News Service) . New York. Deec. 11. One of the most thrilling mid-air rescues ever ef fected by New. York firemen, was made by three men of Truck 2, in the course of a f 20.000 fire in the seven-story loft and office building at 148 Broadway today. ' Mrs. Caroline Richmond was seen in the window of her manicuring parlor on the fourth floor, -wringine her j hands and apparently making ready to jump with clouds of smoke and an oc casional tongue of flame showing be hind her. Fireman Robert ..Nelson ran up the extension ladder, which was seen to be several feet short, car rying a light scaling ladder. Hooking this in the sill of the window above he mounted to where the woman had fallen unconscious across the sill. . - By this time a sheet of flame had burst below. With the unconscious woman over his .. shoulder Nelson climbed half way down the scaling lad der to a point between the two floors. Rescue the Rescuer. In the meantime a longer extension ladder had been run up to the fourth floor, enough ! aside to escape the flames from the window below. Fire men Edward Keegan and Patrick Kir win mounted until thev were but a foot away from Nelson and ' his helpless j burden. But apparently that foot could not be bridged and Nelson and the woman were doomed. Then came the almost miraculous rescue, i "Hold her - tight,? said Kerwin. Keegan encircled both him and the ladder 'with his arms, while Kerwin, bending over until he could grasp the book of the scaling ladder, swung It and Its two occupants clear of the wlndowsill and with herculean strength swung it, pendulum-wise un til Its sweep was sufficiently wide to permit the lower" end to be grappled to the ladder on which he and Keegan stood. f The rest was easy and the three 51 men bearing the still unconscious ' wnm a n di!npnrbil ta rprlv nnn nf the greatest ovations that even a New York crowd hasT given Its heroic fire fi tars. -' A PROPOSED NATIONAL AIRSHIP FUND HAS BEEN KILLED IN THE BUD BY OFFICIALS SOME INCIDENTS. VCMfml TrthMi That Savesl Jtpn From Chinese Invasion. About 600 years ago Japan was threatened with an Invasion from con tinental Asia, much as England was threatened with Invasion by the Span lards. The beaten Spanish armada was dispersed by a storm, and Japan was delivered In much the same way, but without an engagement A Jap anese writer, Okakura Yoshisabura, says: "The mighty Kublal, grandson of the great Genghis Khan, haughty with bis resistless army, whose devas tating intrepidity taught even Europe to tremble at the mention of his name, , PRDMIRITPn RY TUC Dftl IOC fllafMtftlMl lln omKaaatr tr. tCk lonanana IIW I VklUU court to demand the subjection of the country. The message was indignant ly dismissed. Enraged at this, Kublai equipped a large, number of vessels with the choicest soldiers China could furnish. The invading force was suc cessful at first and committed massa cres in Ikl and Tsushima, islands lying between Korea and Japan. The posi tion was menacing. Even the steel nerves of the trained samurai felt that strange thrill a patriot knows. Shinto priests and Buddhist monks were busy at their prayers. "A tremendous Chinese fleet gath ered in the boisterous bay of Genkai In the summer of 1281. At last the evening came with the ominous glow on the horizon that foretells an ap-1 proaching storm. It was the plan of the conquering army victoriously to land the next morning on the holy soli of Kyushu. But during this critical night a fearful typhoon, known to this day as the 'divine storm,' arose, break ing the jet black sky with its tremen dous roar of thunder and bathing the glittering armor of our soldiers guard ing the coast line In white flashes of dazzling light The very heaven and earth shook before the mighty anger of nature. "Dawn of the next morning saw the whole fleet of the proud Yuan that had darkened the water for miles swept completely away Into the bottomless sea of Genkai, to the great relief of the horror stricken populace and to the unspeakable disappointment of our de termined soldiers. Out of the 100.000 warriors wbo manned the Invading ahlps only three are recorded to have ! survived the destruction to tell the dismal tale to their crestfallen great khan."

Orders were given that a formidable wall should (American News Service) St. Petersburg, Dec. 11. That avia tion is extremely backward is not to be wondered at, when the official atti tude towards flying men and all their work is explained. All attempts at aviation in or near St. Petersburg are prohibited by the police, and there are many other places in Russia under the same official ban for example, in the neighborhood of all fortifications any airship or areo plane seen within the prohibited areas will be shot at without warning. Guyot Is Squelched. The aviator Guyot was recently for bidden to make experiments with his aeroplane, a Bleriot. He will take his machine to Moscow, where he is likely to' meet with as little encouragement as here. A proposed national airship fund has been officially, killed. It was started by a promlnept and respected publisher who has since become the object of po lice suspicions, as if he were a danger ous revolutionary vor anarchist He has been compelled to abandon the sci ence and return all subscriptions to the donors. The police warned him that his action rendered him liable ta i suspicion, because airships might bo used by revolutionaries and other ma lignants for their nefarious plans.

Neither the president's message nor the opening of congress created any disturbance In the security markets. On the contra ry President Taft's views were In many respects received with special satisfac tion. The emphasis which he placed upon the necessity of public economv moderation in regard to the use of the maximum tariff and his rational atti tude regarding railroad and corpora tion problems show his determination to carry out necessary reform move ments with as little disturbance to bus iness as possible. This is naturally, reassuring. Congress as yet, shows no signs of breaking out with antago nistic legislation, although it is quite apparent that the radicals were disap pointed at the conservative tenor of President Taft's message. Political ly speaking, the situation is hopeful, for while it Is evident that large cor porations must prepare themselves for more or less government regulation. and enforcement of the Sherman Anti Trust Law, in Its present drastic form, may cause ' disquiet. Btfll the outlook in these directions is less threatening than during the sometimes unwisely aggressive policy of the previous ad ministration. As the year draws to a close the stock market finds itself In a more hopeful condition. It is undeniable that a strikingly optimistic spirit pre vails, based upon exceptional business activity in the United States and aid ed by decided Improvement of Indus trial and political affairs abroad. The favorable conditions are many, the chief drawback being that the business of the country and values generally are alreadv nnon snr-h a hih ivii na to prevent the return of complete con fidence. It Is quite evident that the countr is passing through a period of inflation, the causes of which cannot here be discussed, but which are a very positive element in the situation. The most unsatisfactory feature is that val ues are not noon a stable basis, hav ing fully discounted all favorable con ditions. Investors are consequently shy and discriminating. The better class of railroad securities are aJreadv upon a prohibitive level, and made more so by the firm rates now -demanded for money. " Our railroad situation is not with out serious perplexities. Traffic is heavy and earnings show correspond ing improvement, but expenses nave grown seriously, and net results are very often unequal to those of two years ago. That the companies should have to face a demand for higher wages at this time is unfortu nate for they have scarcely more than recovered from the effects of the Dan- ic Wages were not reduced at that period and labor suffered little from that disaster. It is true that the cost of living has risen. So too have wages; and many, of the railroads. If obliged to concede to latest demands will have no other alternative than advancing the rates and compelling shippers to pay the bills. The latter will as usual pass on the increase in expenses to the consumer. For reas ons such as these railroad stocks and bonds have been comparatively neg lected by both investors and specu lators, and the large owners of these properties are still finding it diffi cult to distribute their surplus hold ings. Attention is consequently be ing turned to the better class of in dustrials, especially preferred issues which have not been advanced to such' an extent as railroad lsues and which are benefiting by trade ac tivity quite as much as the railroads. Hitherto this section of the. market has generally been upon a lower plane than the railroads; but as many of the concerns become seasoned and prove their steady earning capacity the effect is to raise the standing of such issues, especially while the rail road section stands so much in dan ger of reaction.
