annual message to the Congress is absolute ly free i from the preaching that has filled so many of his previous State V papers Its a plain straight for ward statement of facts filled with Highly < important recommendations for action by the House and Senate The policies advocated are most of a them favored by the Democratic par = ty and by the progressive wing of the tYRepublican Republican party Ifany of the measuers are passed at this session iiwwil have to be with the aid of Democratic votes i Roosevelt again reiterates his lies H lief that the great corporations en gaged in interstate business and es pecially the railroads can only be r effectually controlled by the national government The Sherman antitrust law should be amended or a new law substituted which should not forbid alt combinations good or bad but L should permit combinations which vare in the interest of the public but I should at the same time give to some agencY o I the national i government fullpQwerfof control and supervision overr them Entire publicity should be secured in all matters which the 1 public has a right to know The railways should be put com I S pletely under the interstate commerce j comtiiissioh which should have the S right rjto supervise and control the is suance + of securities as well as over the raising and lowering of rates Asr r 9 gard rates this power should be gummary The interests of the shatfeholcletfs employees and of the shippers should all be guarded as against one another t Corporate finances must be super ° vised so as to make it far snfer than r at present for theman ofsmall meansio invest his money in stocks c Stock b should be prohibited v and stock gambling so far as is pos sibl6 discouraged A proper employers liability law should be passed The Judges of the t i United States beginning with the Su preme Court should have their salar ies doubled Provision should be made that no injunction or temporary restraining order issue from the courts otherwise than on notice except where irrepar r able injury would otherwise result and in such case a hearing on the merits ° of the order should be had within a short fixed period and if not < then continued after hearing it s i should forthwith lapse < i The forests of the country must be saved for they constitute the first > and most important element in the conservation of the natural resources of the country 55 5 Our inland waterways should be looked after not in the present slip shod way but by a comprehensive and farseeing plan y A permanent 5 conunission authorized to co rdmate 5 t 4 et t r 4 r t S > i H > J n I w f thQ work of all the government de partments relating to waterways and to frame and supervise the execution ofa compiehensive plan should be provided f Postal savings banks are now in operation inpractically all the great civilized countries and should be adopted bV the United States The parcel post should be extended on the rural routes The establishment of a local parcel post on rural routes would be to the mutual benefit of the farmer and the country store keeper and it is desirable that the routes serving more than 15000 000000 people should be utilized xto the fullest practiable extent < The v ciyil service law should he extended to the census bu reams g Statehood should be granted Arizona arid New Mexico The ocean mail act should be amended so that satisfactory American ocean mail lines to South America Asia the Philippines and Australasia may be extended Four battleships should be provided for and the general board of the Navy should be by law turned into a general staff so that the Navy should be as efficiently governed as is the Army under the present law These are in the main the chief recommendations of the President In passing he charges the Congress with crippling the secret service The President says that an amendment I passed by it which provided that there should be no detail from the secret service and no transfer there from was of benefit to no one except to criminals It seriously hampers the government in the detection of crime and the sec justicea He continues the chief argument in favor of the provision was that the Congressmen did not themselves wish to be investigated by secret ser vice men Very little of such investi gation has been done in the past but it is true that the work of the secret service agents was partly responsible I for the indictment and ponviction ofi a Senator and a Congressman for land fraud in Oreeon Ido not be lieve that it is in the public interest to protect riminals in any branch of the government service and exact ly as we have again and yearsb prosecuted and convicted such cram inals who were in the executive branch of the government we should be given ample means to prosecute them if found in the legislative branch branchThis is straight from the shoulder and ought to make some Congress men situ p and take notice In foreign affairs President Roose velt says We have behaved and are behaving toward other nations as in private life an honorable man would behave toward his fellows He commends the work on the Panama Canal which is a model for all work of the kind No task of such magnitude has ever before been undertaken by any Nation and no task of the kind has ever been better performed Real J ogress toward selfgovern men has been made jh the Philippine Islands but no one can prophesy the exact date when it will be wise to consider independence as a fixed and I definite policy policyFOR FOR
