The straight-out Democrats are absolutely in love with it. We copy a few opinions : Congressman Breckenridge-I in? dorse the message. It is an excellent document, and is very strong. Congressman Springer-It is a great document. It is the most concise and the most instructive message that was ever sent to Congress by any President. Congressman Mills-Good, elegant!

WASHINGTON, December L-One of the prominent new members is Elliott, of South Carolina, who has sprung inio notoriety because of his having de??ated the colored member, -Gen: Smalls, for re election in what is known as the 'Black District.' Smalls is contesting for the seat, though up to the present time it does not appear that he has been able to make ont a very strong case. Elliott comes to Congress with the reputation of hav? ing more power and influence over .the colored people than any other person in the State. The fact that a white person in a district which is so overwhelmingly composed of colored people could have defeated a colored man like Smalls, v. ho himself is re? garded popular, is a question which has been thc subject of much com? ment. Smalls does not attempt to show in his brief that there was in timidation or anything of that nature, but alleges irregularities in the man? ner in which the votes were cast. Mr. Elliott is in appearance quiet, dignified and exceptionally reserved in his manner. Ile is said to be con? siderable of an orator, and sways the colored people by the power of his eloquence. Mr. Elliott, 6ince his ar? rival, has been very much amused, and possibly embarrased, at the anx iety of a great many people to see him. Strange as it may appear, Laif of tliose who have heard of him made the mistake of thinking him a colored rc an. The confusion of names is made out of the fact that in the Forty third Congress the same South Caro? lina district was represented by Rob? ert Brown Elliott, a very noted col? ored orator who made a national rep? utation in a speech made in reply to Fernando Wood upon the subject of alleged Southern outrages The col? ored Elliott served but two terms in Congress. Shortly after his Congres? sional career closed lie died, and those who do not remember that fact have mistaken the present Elliott for the great colored orator. Elliott is said to have done aft Governor Bob Taj'lor j (?f Tennessee did, when he was elect ed to Congress by'virtue of his pow ! ers to captivate the mountaineers j with the melody of a fiddle. - Louis- j ville Courter Journal.

GRAVES ? We must eat or wo cannot lire. This we all know. But do we all know that we- die bj eating % It fe said we dig 'our graxea> with our teeth. How^?db?i?t this sounds: Yet it is f?&rfr.lly true. We are ter? rified at the approach ox the cholera and yellow fever, yet there is a dis? ease constantly at oui' doors and in our houses far more dangerous and destructive. Most people have in their own stomachs a poison, more slow, but quite as fatal as the germs of those maladies which sweep men into eternity by thousands without warning in the times of great epi? demics. But it is a mercy that, if we are watchful, we can tell when weare threatened. The following are among the symptoms, yet- they do not always necessarily appear in tile same order,, nor"?rja theyajways, the same in different cases! ^The?r is a dull and "sleepy feeling; a bad taste in the month, especially in the morning; the appetite is change? able, sometimes poor and again it seems as though the patient could not eat enough, and occasionally no appetite at all ; dullness and slug? gishness of the mind; no ambition to sturry OT%ork; more or less head? ache and heaviness in the head; dizziness on rising to the feet or moving suddenly ; furred and coat? ed tongue; a sense of a load on the stomach that nothing removes ; hot and dry skin at times; yellow tinge hrthe eyes; scanty and high-colored urine; sour taste in the mouth, fre? quently attended by palpitation of the heart; impaired visionj with, spots that seem to.f b?^win^ninjgin the air before the eyesr aeongh^ with a greenish-colored expecto? ration; poor nights'rest; a sticky slime about the teeth and gums; hands a&d feet cold and clammy; irritable temper and bowels bound up and costive.y'-Thir ..disease has puzzled ikephysicians and still puz- : zles them, it isthe commonest of"" ailments and yet tho most compli? cated and mysterious. Sometimes it is treated as consumption, some? times as liver complaint, and then again as malaria, and-' evenheailndiiF^ ease. But its real naturels that of" constipation and dyspepsia. It arises in the digestive organs and soon affects all the others through the corrupted and- poisoned blood. Often tho whole body-mcluding - the nervous system-is literally starved, even when there is no emaciation to tell the sad story. Experience has shown that there is put one -remedy that can certainly cure this disease in all its stages, namely, Shaker Extract of Boots or Mother Seigels Curative Syrup. ?% \ never fails but, nevertheless, no time should be lost in trying other so called remedies, for they will do no good. Get this great vegetable preparation, (discovered by ^.vener? able nurse whose name is a' house? hold word in Germany) and be sure to get the genuine article. GIVEN rp BY SEVEN DOCTORS.

He began to use Shaker Extract of Roots or Sei gel's Syrup about the 1st of Jan. 1887, and was so much better in three weeks that he considered him? self practically a ' well man. He adds: "I have at this time one bot? tle on hand, and if I could not get any more I would not take a ten dollar bill for it.1* All druggists, or Address A. J. White, limited, 54 Warren St N.

I cannot find words to express my confidence in the Glenn Springs warer, as a remedy for the Liver, when functionally deranged. Dyspepsia, Dropsy, certain skin diseases, troubles in the Kidneys and Spleen, if produced by the Liver, have all, au I know, disappeared at the Springs." DR.
