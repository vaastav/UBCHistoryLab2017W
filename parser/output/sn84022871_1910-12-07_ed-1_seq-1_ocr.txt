VERMONT IN FIRST RANK Growth of Asbestos Mining in This State Lowell Company Develop ing It. In a pamphlet on the .production of asbestos in 1)9, written for the inter ior department by J. S. Diller, refer ence is made to this gi owing Vermont industry. Mr. Diller says : "The fact that the great belt of an cient crystalline rocks, which contain the extensive deposits of asnestos so profitably mined in Canada, stretches southwestward from the Province of Quebec with many variations through New England, the middle, and the south Atlantic states into Alabama, naturally leads to the expectation of finding similiar deposits in the Unit ed States. They have been sought for all along the line, but as yet, with the exception of one locality in Georg ia and another in Vermont, the success ful mining of asbestos is confined to Canada. Asbestos has been found and prospected at many localities from Massachusetts to Georgia, inclusive, bat in quality it is generally of the amphibole type and in quantity so ir regularly distributed so far as known as to afford but little promise of a sue cessful basis for the development of an industry. The search should con tinue. The better grade of material, chrysotile, is associated with serpen tine derived from peridotite, a rock of which olivine was originally the chief constituent. "West of the Great Appalachian belt in the United States similar rocks containing more or less asbestos reap pear in portions of the Rocky Moun tains in Wyoming and Idaho and in the ranges along the Pacific coast.

The legislature of 1910 has had a most profitable week since its Thanks giving recess and the members are all back in Montpelier full of wishbones and full of hope. Many people thought the time of meeting was fixed at 7:30 on Monday evening so the members could draw pay for that day, but the amount of business done the tirst eve ning after the recess was proof that the members are willing to work and are willing to permit matters of im portance to come along fast enough to suit the most fastidious. After cleaning up routine business on Monday evening the report from the judiciary committee recommending the passage of Mr. Amey's capital punishment bill was taken. Mr. Am ey spoke interestingly and feelingly for the bill and in a very logical argu ment showed wherein the passage of the bill would be a step forward in the administration of justice. Bills of this nature have been introduced .at nearly every session of the legislature, but it has remained for Mr. Amey of Brighton to bring about its pasages. CONTINUED ON PAGE EIGHT Goodwin. Rev.
