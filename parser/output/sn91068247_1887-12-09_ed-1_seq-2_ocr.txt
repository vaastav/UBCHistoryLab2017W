Charlotte Democrat. CHARLOTTE. N. C. The President's Message. We give below a pretty full synopsis of President Cleveland' Message submitted toCoogress on Monday last, omitting only the lengthy argument on the Tariff question and most of that part about the surplus in the Treasury and its effect on the country. The President begins by saying: You are confronted at the threshold of your legislative duties with a condition of the national finances which imperatively demands immediate and careful considera tion. The amount of money annually ex acted through the operation of the present laws from the industries and necessities of the people largely exceeds the sum neces sary to meet the expenses of the govern ment. When we consider that the theory of our institutions guarantees to every citizen the full enjoyment of all the lruits of his industry and enterprise with only such deduction aB may be his eh are to wards the careful and economical main tenance of the government which protects him, it is plain that the exaction of more than this is indefensible extortion and a culpable betrayal of American fairness and justice. This wrong inflicted upon those who bear the burden of national taxation, like other wrongs, multiplies a brood of evil consequences. On the 30th day of June, 1885, the ex cess of revenues over public expenditures, after complying with the annual require ment of the sinking fund, was $17,859, 735.84; during the year ended June 30, 1886, such an excess amounted to $40, 405,545.20, and during the year ended June 30, 1887, it reached the sum of $55, 567,849.54. The annual contribution to the sinking fund during the three years above specified, amounting in the aggre gate to $138,058,320.94 and deducted from the surplus as slated, was made by calling in for that purpose outstanding three per cent bonds of the government. During the six months prior to June 30, 1887, the surplus had grown so large by repeated accumulations that it was feared the withdrawal of this great sum of money needed by the people would so effect the business of the country that the sum of $79,864,100 ol such surplus was applied to the payment of the principal and interest of the 3 per cent bonds still outstanding and which wee then payable at the op tion of the government. After discussing the financial question at length, the President says: I have deemed it my duty to thus bring to the knowledge of my countrymen, as well as to the attention of their representatives charged with the responsibility of legisla tive relief, the gravity of our financial sit uation. The failure ol the Congress here tofore to provide against the dangers which it was quite evident the very nature ol the difficulty must necessarily produce caused a condition of financial stress and apprehension since your last ad journment which taxed to the utmost all the authority and expedients within ex ecutive control, and these appear now to be exhausted. If disaster results from the continued inaction of Congress the re sponsibility must rest where it belongs. Though the situation thus far considered is fraught with danger which should be fully realized, and though it presents fea tures wrong to the people as well as to the country, it is but a result growing out of a perfectly palpable and apparent cause constantly reproducing the same alarm ing circumstances a congested national treasury and a depleted monetary condi tion in the business of the country. It need hardly be stated that while the present situation demands a remedy we can only be saved from a like predica ment in the future by the removal of its cause. As to the Tariff and Internal Revenue we copy the following, and regret, ex ceedingly, to see the position the Presi dent takes about the internal revenue laws : "Our scheme of taxation by means of which this needless surplus is taken from the people and put into the public treas ury, consists of a tariff or duty levied upon importations from abroad and inter nal revenue taxes levied on the consump tion of tobacco, and spirituous and malt liquors. It must be conceded that none of the things subjected to internal revenue tax are striotly speaking necessaries. There appears to be no just complaint of this taxation by the consumers of these arti cles and there seems to be nothing so well able to bear the burden without hardship to any portion of the people. But our present tariff laws, the vicious, inequita ble and illogical source of unnecessary taxation, ought to be at once revised and amended. These laws as their primary j . u auu ptaiu ciicuii laieo iuu puue iu uuu Burners of all articles imported and sub jeot to duty by precisely the sum paid tor such duties. Ihus the amount of the duty measures the tax paid by those who purchase lor use these imported articles Many of these things, however, are raised or manufactured in our own country, and the duties now levied upon foreign goods and products are called protection to these home manufactures, because they render it possible for those of our people who are manufacturers to make these taxed articles and.sell them on a demand for imported goods that have paid cus toms duty, bo it happens that while comparatively a few use the imported arti cles, most of our people who never use and never saw any of the foreign pro ducts purchase and use things of the same kind made in this country and pay there for nearly or quite the same enhanced price which the duty adds to the im ported articles. Those who buy imports pay the duty charged thereon into the public treasury, but the great majority of our citizens who buy domestic artioles of the same class pay a sum at least approxi mately equal to this duty to the borne manufacturers. This reference to the operation of our tariff laws is not made by way of instruction, but in order that we may be constantly reminded of the manner in which they impose a burden upon those who consume domestio pro ducts as well as those who consume im ported articles, and thus create a tax upon all our people. It is not proposed to entirely relieve the oountry of this taxation. It must be ex tensively oontinued as the source of the government e income; and in a readjust ment of our tariff the interests of Ameri can labor engaged in manufacture should be carefully considered, as well as the preservation of our manufactures. It may be called protection or by any other oame but relief lrom the hardships and dangers of our present tariff laws should be devised with especial precaution against imperiling the existence ol oar manufacturing interests. But this should not mean a condition which, without re gard to the publio welfare or a national exigency, must always insure the realiza tion ot immense profits instead of moder ate returns. As the volume and diversi ty of our national activities increase, new recruits are added to those who desire a continuation of the advantages which they conceive the present system of tariff tax ation directly affords them. So stubborn ly have all efforts to reform the present condition been resisted by those of our fellow-citizens thus engaged that they can hardly complain of the suspicion entertain ed, to a certain extent, that there exists an organized combination all alon,j the line to maintain their advantages. The President then goes on to discuss the Tariff question with its hearings on American labor in fact most of the mes sage is devoted to Tariff matters. He con cludes by saying: "The difficulty attend ing a wise and fair revision of our tariff law is not underestimated. It will require on the part of the Congress great labor and care and especially a broad and na tional contemplation ot the subject and a patriotio disregard of such local and sel fish claims as are unreasonable and reck less of the welfare of the entire country. Under our present laws more than four thousand articles are subject to duty. Many of these do not in any way compete with our own manufactures and many are hardly worth attention as subjects of rev enue. A considerable reduction can be made in the aggregate by adding them to the free list. The taxation of luxuries presents no feature of hardship, but the necessaries of life, used and consumed by all the people, the duty upon which adds to the cost of living iu every home, should be greatly cheapened. The question of free trade is absolutely irrelevant and the persistant claim made in certain quarters that all efforts to relieve the people from unjust and unnecessary taxation are schemes of so-called free traders is mischievous and far removed from any consideration for the publio good. The simple and plain duty which we owe the people is to reduce taxation to the necessary expenses of an economi cal operation ot the government and to restore to the business of the country the money which we bold in the treasury through the presevation of governmental powers, lhese things can and should be done with safety to all our industries, without danger to the opportunity for re munerative labor which our workingmen need and with benefit to them and all our people by cheapening their means of sub sistence and increasing the measure of their comforts. The President rather apologizes for oc cupying the most of his Message with financial and tariff matters, and says: "I am so much impressed with the para mount importance of the subject to which this communication has thus far been de voted that I shall forego the addition of any other topic and only urge upon your immediate consideration the "stale of the Union" as shown in the present condition of our treasury and our general financial situation, upon which every element of our safety and prosperity depends. lhe reports of the heads of the depart ments which will be submitted contain full and explicit infoimation touching the transactions of the business intrusted to them and such recomendations relating to legislation in the public interest as they deem advisable There are other subjects not embraced in the departmental reports, demanding legislative consideration and which I should be glad to submit. Some of them, however, have been earnestly presented in previous messages, and as to them I beg leave to repeat prior recomendations. FOB THE 

CHARLOTTE DEMOCRAT. Society for the Study of N. G. History. Chapel Hill, Dec. 5, 1887. The Society which has been in process of organization here for the study of North Carolina History uad its second meeting on Thursday night last. A paper, read by Mr b. 13. Weeks, gave a complete list of the Duels fought in North Carolina, with the circumstances and names of the actors. This is a mat ter of interest, especially as detailed in formation on this line is not within the reach of many. Twenty-two encounters were cited, in which eleven men were killed. This extended over a period (speaking broadly) from the time of the war of the Revolution to that of the war between the States. Dr. Battle gave a sketch of the ad ministration just preceding that ot Gov. Gabriel Johnston in colonial North Caro lina which introduced Prof. Winston's theme, namely: the administration of Gov. Johnston. Prof. Winston gave a graphic repre sentation of the relation between the peo ple and their Governor, who was then ap pointed under the Crown. The Legislature was elected by the people but the Governor had the power to discharge the Assembly and call a new election when he saw fit. The Assembly then consisted of the House of Burgesses, which was the lower body, and a Council, which was the higher house. All of the actions of the Assembly, especially in protecting the people's rights, showed them to be manly, honest, and possessed of a high order of common sense and judgment. Gov. Johnston himself was a man of strong mind, but was mofe fond, ap parently, of discharging bis duty toward the King than toward the people of the province. U. - The Mecklenburg Presbytery. Mecklenburg Presbytery met in the Second Presbyterian Church in Charlotte on Monday last, and was called to order by the Moderator, Rev. J. M. McClean. The following miuisters were present: J. M. McLean, J. Y. Fair, W. O. Cochrane, U. W. Kobinson, K. A. Miller, G. D. Parks, E. W. Davis, W. E. Mcllwaine. R. B. Morrow, R. A. Fair, W. R. Atkinson and P. R. Law. And the following Rul ing Elders were present: Dr. J. T. Kell, C. H. Wolfe, W. A. Jamison, N. Gibbon, L. W. Uates and J. Hi. Brown. The pastoral relations between Rev. Mr Kobinson and Sugar Creek Church were dissolved, and he was permitted to labor within the bounds of Monroe Church. The pastoral relations between Rev. J L. McLees and Providence Church were dissolved, and Mr McLees was given per mission to labor as a city evangelist in Charlotte in connection with the Second Presbyterian Church. Rev. John R. McAlpine was received into the Presbytery on a certificate from Bethel Presbytery and granted permis sion to labor within the bounds of the Presbytery. Political Complexion of the U. S. Senate. . The value of some Senators. When the United States Senate con venes in December the Republicans will find themselves still in the majority, but by such an exceedingly small margin that they will be compelled to move very slowly on political questions. They will be able to retain control of the organiza tion, but merely by a scratch. The roll of the Senate, as now finally made up, shows that there are thirty-eight Repub lican Senators, thirty-seven Democratic ones, and one Independent. - This latter gentleman, who will hold the balano of power and be able, by his single vote, to checkmate any plan of the Republicans, is the erratio II. H. Riddleberger of Vir ginia. He is ostensibly a Republican, and at the time of his election to the Senate was Mahoue's candidate for Ser-geant-at-Arms of that body. The Senate happened to be evenly divided at that time, however, and David Davis, as Presi dent pro tem, had the privilege of casting the deciding vote. The Democrats had control of the organization, including the committees and the officers. Davis re fused to vote with the Republicans, or in fact to vote at all. The Republicans were, therefore, for two years unable to overthrow the organization. Mahone in the meantime secured the election of bis protege, Riddleberger, as his own col league in the Senate. To-day Maboue is in private life, and Riddleberger, who is at present his bitter persoual enemy, has the whip hand of the Senate, as David Davis had it in-1879. ' The Republicans are very solicitous as to the course Riddleberger will pursue. He can do no more than tie the Senate, it is true, but even that result might be em barrassing. Should he vote with the Re publicans they would have two majority; should he vote with the Democrats the Senate would be a tie, and should he not vote at all, the Republicans would fclill have a majority of one. All during last session Riddleberger refused to go iuto caucus, was entirely independent in de bate, and on several occasions made al most direct personal attacks on some of the leading Republican Senators, es pecially the then presiding officer, John Sherman, whom he accused of refusing to recognize him, and of various other petty offences. The Republicans have already din played their anxiety to placate the Vir ginian. About the time Congress ad journed a proinineut office ol the Seuate became vacant. lbere were numerous applicants for it. The man backed by Riddleberger secured the p ize, and soon after died. Riddleberger was promptly on hand with a second candidate, who was at once appointed. It is now said by the knowing ones that if Riddleberger wants anything further of the Republicans he has only to ask for it. Since his falling out with Mahone it hat been whispered that Riddleberger has made overtures to the Democrats to take him agaiu into the fold, but his old colleagues, badly as they need votes, have relused to listen to him. Fifteen new Senators were sworn in on December 5th. Seven are Republicans and eight Democrats. The new men are Chandler of New Hampshire, Quay ot Pennsylvania, Stockbridge of Michigau, Hiscock of New York, Steward of Nevada, Paddock of Nebraska, Davis ot Minnesota, Pasco of 1? lorida, Faulkner of West Vir ginia, Reagan of Texas, Bate of lea- nessee, lurpie ot Indiana, Blodgelt ot New Jersey, Daniel of Virginia, and Hearst of California. Ihree of thee men have been 'United States Senators once before. Paddock held a seat from 1875 to 1881, and was succeeded by Chan. H. Van Wyck, "Crazy Horse," as he has often been irreverently called. Paddock, after leaviog the Senate, became a mem ber of the Utah commission. He kept a sharp eye on political matters in Nebraska while with the Mormons, and just before the Senatorial battle opened he resigned bis office and went home. He engineered a still bunt for the Seuatorship, and when it became apparent that Republicans were bound to secure Van Wyck s defeat Pad dock appeared as a candidate. After i long and bitter fight he was elected over the man by whom he was defeated six years before. Stewart, of Nevada, was in the Senate more than a dozen years ago. He was theu one of the most prominent of the "bonanza kings" of the Pacific slope. He and bis wife entertained lavishly, and erected the first really fine house in the northwestern part ot Washington, now the most fashionable locality in the city. lhe place was and is yet know as "Stew art Castle," and is at present oooupied by the Chinese embassy. Stewart lofit all of his wealth about the time of the panic in 1873, and at the end of bis Senatorial term went West again to recuperate his for tunes. Having succeeded, he comes to the (Senate a second time as the successor of Uncle Jimmy Fair. Hearst, of California, was hardly oat of the Senate before be was in again. He was, in 1886, appointed by the Governor to fill the vacancy oaut-ed by the death of Gen. Miller. When the Republican Leg islature met they sent lieorge Williams to nil out Miller s term. Ibis expired on March 4 last, and Hearst was then elected for a full term. Three of the new Senators were mem bers of the lower House iu the last Con gress. These are: Hiscock of New York. Reagan of Texas, and Daniel of Virginia, the latter having been elected two years ago to succeed Mahone. The United Stales Senators from the Southern States are a very different class of men from their Northern colleagues, not only in the matter of their political conduct, but in their personal appearance and habits and manner of living. Much of this difference is accounted for by the fact that, as a general thing, the Southern Senators are poor in purse, though proud in heart. Out of eighteen Southern Senators but five are owners of a horse and carriage, and two of these possess animals that would hardly take a premium at a country fair. The five who drive their owu teams are Eustio, Gibson, Kenna, Vest and Vance. Eustis, Gibson and Vance have fairly good turnouts, but those of Kenna and Vest are mere coun try hacks. Kenna has a high, old-fashioned closed carriage, drawn by a pair of ill-kept bays, and the driver, who does duty as hostler and gardener, and in other capacities, is hardly np to the standard. Vest has an open top phaeton, puuea about by a lean, frowzy brown horse that eoe with his head haneine in a dej-cted way. and a look that says he is ready to top at the slightest command. But fix of these Southern Senators own homes in Washington. Call. Cockrell and Vest have recently erected small, modest homes, and Uiboon, Euslur and Vance have more pretentious ones. The two former gentlemen are wealthy and the latter has a wealthy wife, which is much the same thing. Eustis and Walthall of Mississippi, are the. only Southern Sena tors who live in anything? like laxurious or even comfortable style. .They are both men who enjoy good living and oan afford to indulge themselves. Eustis is a club man and somewhat of a boo vivant. He is cultured, educated and a lover of good company. He is a relative of W. W. Corcoran, the millionaire philanthro pist of Washington, and his face is well known in club circles and in general society. Walthall has many of the char acteristics of Eustis, and when in Wash ington generally lives at one of the best of the up-town hotels Jones, and,Berry of Arkansas, Brown and Colquitt of Georgia, Harris of Tennessee, Hampton of South Carolina, Coke of Texas. George of Mississippi, and Morgan and Pugh of Alabama, live in modest lodgings or at down town hotels, and rarely, if ever, ap pear in society. Many of these men live as they do be cause compelled to, but this is not the case of Senator Joe Brown of Georgia. He is the wealthiest man in the South in publio life, and one of the richest in the United States Senate. Yet he has plain rooms in a down-town hotel, and when be desires a carriage, which is seldom in deed, he hires it at a stable around the corner. Another peculiarity of many of the Southern Senators is their strong indis position to remain "at their homes after having once lived in Washington. Five of these Senators Call of Florida, Pugh and Morgan of Alabama, Cockrell of Mis souri,, and Jones of, Arkansas have scarcely been absent from the city a day since Congreso adjourned. Some of them make up all sorts of excuses lor remain ing while others simply stay because they want to. - Let ns be Consistent. From the Raleigh Chronicle. The chronicle endorsed, heartily and without reservation, the resolution of the Democratic Slate Executive Committee declaring for a repeal of the Internal Rev enue laws. We based our endorsement on the fact that the committee was but reit erating the demand made again and again by the great Democratic party in conven tion assembled. The committee started on no new line. It raised no new issue. It committed the party to no novel scheme. Blatant and false political enemiet, and unwise and imprudent political friends had sought to convey the impression that it is in power, is not so much in favor ol the rrpeaf of these laws as formerly, tor that reason, and to urge our Congressmen to renewed diligence in their efforts of re peal, the committee re-stated and empha sized the position of the party on the ques tion. It was wise to make the declaration and it was a wise declaration. Those who have been severest and most uncharitable in their criticisms are open to th same criticism. For example: The papers that have discussed and dissented from the attitude of the committee daily call upon all. their readers to remain loyal iu support ot a low tariff, and to fight for the present county government system. Whai right have they to do thi.- r Can one editor, or a dozen commit the party to a lw tariff? or to any system ot local government? Not at all, but in national politics the Democratic conventions have uniformly declared for a low tariff,, and in Siate politics the declaration in (avor of a system of county government that will protect the H.ast has been uniform. These editors know what the attitude of the party is on these questions, and they have the right, aud it is their duty as well, to emphasize the importance of these two Democratic principles, lbe newspaper is not "usurping power," or "arrogating to itself the' right to speak for thousands of Democrats." It is merely giving pro mi nence to accepted Democratic measures. The Democratic State, Executive Com mittees does the same thing. No man is ignorant enough not to know that the Democratic party in North Carolina is committed to a repeal of the Internal Revenue laws. The fact that the commit tee calls attention to this accepted policy of the party, and urges Democratic repre sentatives to nse all possible efforts to ful fil the pledges repeatedly made, is but do ing what political editors do every day. The committee knows the policy of the Democratic party, and it seeks to carry it into effect. They would not be wise com mitteemen if they did less. Instead of the committee's trying to "usurp power" and "dictate to the great Democratic party," it appears to ns that some few of our contemporaries are open to that charge. The committee stands by the declarations of the party; the dissent ing editors are against these declarations. Which is trying to be "arrogant," and, to use the idiom of an old farmer, "nsurperi ous?" Which? Brethren: Let ns be consistent. N. G. State Bonds. Twelve thousand dollars of N. C. State tour per cent bonds were sold in this city last week at 95. - There is a tumor afloat to the effect that both the ready sale of State bonds and their market value are ad? versely affected on acoount of the recent decision in the State , drummers' license case, whiob, if not reversed by the Su preme Court ot the United States, will cut off a revenue to the. State of something over (80,000, and in., connection, with . the rumor, it is said, there is a' statement to the effect that if this revenue is cut off the State cannot pay the interest on the bonds. It is not known from whence such a false and thoroughly unreasonable report sprung. It was doubtless originated by some speculator who was anxious to make a haul and who undertook to do it with out regard to fair dealing or the credit of the State, rhe interest on the bonds will be promptly paid on presentation of cou pons at proper places oa and after January first regardless of whatever shortage may arise from the cessation of the drummers' license tax, and will continue to be paid promptly in future. The increase in the tax valuation of property in this State this year over last year will be about $7, 000,000, aud if not another cent be real ized from the sale ot drummers' lioenses the State will scarcely feel the loss; and it is by no means certain that the drummers' tax revenue will be lost. The Chief Jos tioe of the Supreme Court with two other judges are ot the opinion that a State has clearly a constitutional right to tax drum mers. The same opinion is held by some ot the best and strongest lawyers in this city and State, and one or two features in the North Carolina law not existing in other laws of a similar character, indicate that the State has the advantage in the drummers' license case now pending. nowever me case may go, the interest on the Stale bonds will be paid whenever it is due and of this fact bondholders and bond purchasers may be assured. Raleigh Observer. - Percussion arms were used in the Uni ted States army in 1830. Digest of N. C. Supreme Court Decisions. Vr, ilaU Term 1887. Reported for the Raleigh Observer. ' Hassey vs. The N. S. Rtilroad Co., and King. Held, Corporations are liable civi liter for torts committed by their servants or agents, precisely as natural persons are, and it is so liable for acts of its agents done by its authority, express or implied, though there be neither a written appoint ment under seal nor a vote of the corpora tion Constituting the agency or authorizing the act. The corporation and its servants bywhwct the injury was dooe may be joined in an action of tort. , The allegations ol tne complaint in this case are sufficiently plain to make the cor poration understand the nature of the tort with which it is charged and tne demur rer is overruled. Stout vs. McNeill. Held. It is improp er in suits for injunctive relief to make the sheriff a party. Notice oi the order of injunction is sufficient as to officers of the court. While one of several partners cannot .as a right have his personal property exemp tion oat of the partnership effeots, yet it may be done with the consent of all the partners; but this assent must be positive and voluntary and must remain at least until the allotment is actually made. State vs. Morgan. To support an in dictment under oar. '6. sec. 985 of the Code as amended chap, 66, 'aots 1885, it must be charged that the defendant did "wantonly and wilfully set fire, &c A charge that the defendant did "wilfully, feloniously, 'maliciously and wantonly" set fire, &o., will not desoribe the offence. "Wautonly" is a technical word in de scribing crimes. Where the statute uses the word "shop," and the indictment charges thatlhe defendant "set fire to a certain bouse uied as a shop and store," the description is sufficient. S.iate vs. Ty lues. ffirceny is both a felony and an infamous crime, and an in diotmeut under sections 996 and 997 charging "the intent to commit the crime of larceny" is sufficient. It has often b-en said, ho wever, that it is better to describe statutory offonces in the words of the statute. There niy be uuited in one count crimes of a cognate character. here sufficient mailer appears to eu- able the court to proceed to judgmeut. objection io form that would support a motion to quash are too late atter ver dict. Grissom vs. Pickett. Held, The liens given by sections 1781 aud 1782 of the Code are confined to debts contracted for work done or in aerials furnished and the lieu is on the property on which the labor expended or to which the materials have been contributed, lheretore where two persons agree to farm ou certain condi tions aud alter the pi) ment of the debts there was to be an equal division ol the crops, aud outs has a causa ot aotion against the other for a breach of the contract, no lien arises uu ier those sections. Irwin vs. Clark. An objection lo an answer that it is uot sufficiently specified in regard to the ooutents of destroyed pa pers comes too late, when the case is call ed for trial and there have been continu ances after it was filed. . Where ihe recitals iu a deed and de cretal orders fouud on the docket appear to relate to a single equitable suit they may be admitted as fragmentary tacts tbereol. When a devise ia made to those chil dren living at the death ot their mother, a contingent and not a vested interest is created which cannot be sold by a court of equity. But where the gift is general, uot being confined to survivors when to lake effect, it is otherwise; and, by representation, those who may afterwards come into be ing aie controlled by the aotion of the court upon those whose interests are vested but whose . possession is in the future. Dodd'a case, Phillips Eq , 97 approved. Tucker vs. Bellamy. While slavery prevailed in this State the laws regulating descent of estates of inheritance did not ap ply to slaves who could neither inherit nor own property. The statute enabling them to inherit, sec. 1,281 of the Code, does not extend be yond parents and children and the estates of such parents; and where persons were born slaves; there is no statute enabling them to inherit from their father who died in 1860, when all were slave, or from an aunt who has since died. State vs. Morgan. To support au in diotmeut under par. 6, sec 985 ot the Code as amended chap. 66, acts 1885, it must be charged that the defendant did "wantonly and wilfully set fire, fcc. A charge that the defendant did "wilfully, feloniously, maliciously and wickedly" set fire, c., will not describe the offenoe. "Wantonly" is a technioal word in de scribing crimes. Where the statute uses the word "shop, and the indictment charges that the defendant "set fire to a certain house used as a shop aud store," the description is sufficient. Baker vs. Leggett. Allison Ryan own ed a tract of land in Robesou county on which, he resided, of less value than $500; mortgaged the same to plaintitt on De cember 26th, 1877, and removed to Geor gia. On the 17th of January following defendant began an aotion of debt against him and sued out an attachment, whiob was levied on the land. There was judg ment and sale and defendant bought the land on the 2 1st of February. On the 23d January the mortgage was registered and plaintiff claim, under bis mortgage, al leging that Ryan's homestead was exempt from sale under execution. Held, That the provisions of the con stitution and of the laws setting apart a homestead exemption apply only to resi dents of this State. That although Regan wat entitled to his homestead while a resident, he lost the right on relinquishing his cuizenthip and moving to another State. That the levy and sals were valid. That is plaintiff bad registered his mort gage before the levy of the attachment he would have had priority, but his failure to record bis mortgage until aftr the levy opened the door for the lien of the levy, and tne levy and ease Were effectual. Simontou vs. Cornelius. The will to be construed reads: "I give and bequeath to my daughter Julia" certain lands, ne groes and property, "all of which land and negroes and other property to remain in the possession of the said Julia and her husband during their natural lives and then to descend to the children of lhe said Jnlia equally." - . Held, That the proper constrnction of the will gives the estate to the said Julia and her husband, with a direct remainder after the death of the surviver to her children. The husband and wife took by entireties and the right of survivorship prevails. During bis life the remainder man is premature in seeking: possession. The fruits occurring daring the joint lives would beloug to the husband when by separation from the land they became per sonal property, as other personal goods reduced into possession beoame his as the law then was. . Austin vs.,Pickler. To recover on a note that is in the nature of a penal bond with conditions of avoidance, breaches must be shown by those seeking to enforce it. A note intended lo secure a support of the obligee during his life and to be void at his death, if that condition is com plied with, is of that character. And in order to charge the administrator with a failure to collect, the party insisting on its being enforced should show every fact necessary therefor.
