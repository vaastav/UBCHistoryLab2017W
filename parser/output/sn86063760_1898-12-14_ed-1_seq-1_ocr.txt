It is More Remarkable for What It Does Not Contain Than For What it Does. PresidUc- 31eiley'sC second annual nessa_-e. wiei was submitted to Con gress on uday of last week, contain ed something l~ie twenty thousand words. The %nessage may be summed Up as '.w: It is a istory LS the war: it is a fer vent exnression ci thanks to a Pivine power for the ss of American arms: it is an expresion of a nation s appreciatiou for th- lieroism and patri otism di-plaxed ji battle: it urges an increase of the re-uaam to 100.000 men: it revew i our n ltion with the nations of the world: it reiterates Re pubilean policy a!. to ie financial ques tion: it does not diu ct the Philippine problem:-it-docs not discuss legislation for the new Pcsscssions; it does not dis cuss the race troubles; it does not dis cuss the tariff. Following is a brief synopsis. includ ing some direct excerpts of the more important features of the message: -Notwithstanding the added burdens rendered necessary by the war, our peo plC rejoice in a very satisfactory and steadily increasing degree of prosperity evidenced by the largest volume of bus iness ever recorded. Manufacture has been productive, agricultural pursuits have yielded abundant returns, labor in all fields of industry is better reward ed," etc. CONTROVERsY 

WHICH LED TO THE WAR. In reviewing the controversy which led up to the war with Spain. the presi dent takes up the thread of narrative where terminated in his last annual message. le concluded: "It was hon estly due to our friendly relations with Spain that she should be given a rea sonable chance to realize her expecta tions of reform to which she had be ceme irrevocably committed." It be cameevident, however, that the pro posed plans were barren of good re sults. No tangible relief was afforded the reconcentrados, among whom the rate of mortAity frightfully increased; the proffered expedient of zones of cul tivation proved illusory, and it was ap parent that nothing save the physical exhaustien of Spain or the Cubans and the practical ruin of the island of Cuba could result from the struggle then in prog-ess. At this critical juncture the destruc tion of the battleship Maine occurred. Concerning it the president says: "It is a striking evidence of the poise and sturdy good sense distinguishing our national character that shocking blow, falling upon a generous people, already deeply touched by preceding events in Cuba, did not move them to an instant, desperate resolve to tolerate no longer the existence of a condition of danger and disorder at our doors that niade possible such a deed, by whomso ever wrought." CStill animated, however, by the hope of a peaceful solution of the diffi culty and obeying the dictates of duty, the president relaxed no effort to bring about a speedy ending of the Cu ban struggle. Negotiatioris with the Madrid government proved futnie, so far as practical results were concerned, and then it was the president presented the question to congress. The result of this statement of the case was the adoption of the memora ble joint resolution by congress, declar ing the purpose of the United States to intervene between the Spaniards and Cubans. Following swiftly upon the enactment of the resolution came the severance of diplomatic relations be tween the two countries, the proclama tion of a blockade of Cuban ports, the call for volunteers and the formal dec laration of the existence cf a state of war. All other governments were im mediately notified of the existence of war and each proclaimed neutrdly. "It is not among the least gratifying inci -dents of the struggle that the obliga tions of neutrality were impartially discharged by all, often under delicate and difficult circumstances." Referring to the "difficult and im portant character" of the work perform ed by the signal corps, the president says: "This service was invaluable to the executive in directing the operation of the army and with a total force of 1,300 the loss was by disease, in camp and field. officers and men included, only five" L As to the authorized loan of $200. - 000,000 which was takeni entirely 1-y small bidders the president says: " This was a most encouraging and significant result, showing the vast re sources of the nation and the determi nation of the people to uphold their country's honor." -THE sTIiRIxN 

EVENTS OF THE WAR. Taking up chronologically the events of the war, the president reviews them carefully. The first encounter was the shelling of 31atanzas on April 27th. SThis wtas followed by an engagement which was -destined to mark a memor able epoch in mariiimewarfare. This was Commodiore Iey'sc wonderful vic tory at 31anilla on my 1. "The eifect of this remarkable \ictory, says the president. --uponn the spirit of our peo ple and upon the fortunes of the war was instant. A pwt-'ige of invincibili ty thereby attached to our arms. which continued throughout the struggle." The president says that - only reluct ance to cause needless loss of life and prooerty prevented the early storming and capture of the city (Manilt,) and therewith the abalute military occu pancy of the whole group." Following the memorable trip of the battleshiD Oregon from San Francisco to Key West and the bombardment of San Juan and forts of Santiago, to which special reference is made. the president says: "The next act in the war thrilled not alone the hearts of our countrymen but the world by its exceptional hero isa. On the night of June 3d. Lieut enant Hiobson. aided by seven cevoted volunteers blocked the narrowv outlet from Santiago iarbor by sinking the collier Mlerriimac in the channel, under a fierce fire from the shore batteries, escaping with their lives as by a mira Spaniards. It is a most gratifying in eidenit of the war that the bravery of this little band of heroes was cordially app~reciated by the Spanish admiral." The campain of Santiago, resulting iu the investment and capture of that city is referred to as z brilliant achieve ment. A brief review is then present ed of the decisive naval combat of the war on July 3d. resulting in the con plete destruction of Admiral Cervera's tleet. Concerning it the president says: -Where all so conspicuously distin guished themselves from the comman ders to the gunners and the unnamed heroes in the boiler rooms, each and all contributing toward the achievement of this astounding victory, for which neither ancient nor modern history af fords a parallel in the completeness of the event and the marvelous dispropor tion of casualties. it would be invidi ous to single out any for a special honor." As to the success gained by the arms of the United States in Cuba, the pres ident says that the earnest, lasting gratitude of the nation is unsparingly due. --Nor should we alone remember the gallantry of the living. The dead claim our tears, and our losses by bat tle and by disease must cloud any ex ultation as the result and teach us the awful cost of war, however rightful the cause or signal the victory." 

TOTAL CASUALTIES DURING THE WAR. "The total casualties in the army during the war with Spain were: "Officers killed 23, enlisted men killed 257. total 280. Officers wounded 113. enlisted men wounded 1.464, total 1,577. Of the navy: Killed 17, wounded 67, died as result of wounds 1. Invalided from service 6. Total 91. "In the entire campaign by land and sea we did not lose a gun or a flag or a transport or a ship, and with the excep tion of the crew of the Merrimac, not a soldier or sailor was taken prisoner." I he president bears testimony and pays fitting tribute "to the patriotism and devotion of that large portion of our army which, although eager to be ordered to the post of greatest expos ure, fortunately was not required out side of the United States." The Presi dent says: "In tracing these events we are constantly reminded of our obliga tions to the Divine Master for His watchful care over us, and His safe guidance, for which the nation makes reverent acknowledgement and iffers humble prayer for the continuance of His favors." Referring to the work of the peace commission in Paris, the president says: "Their negotiations have made hope ful progress, so that I trust soon to be able to lay a definite treaty of peace be fore the senate with a review of the steps leading to its signature. "I do not discuss at this time the government nor the future of the new possessions which will come to us as the result of the war with Spain. Such discussion will be appropriate after the treaty of peace shall be ratified. In the meantime and until the congress has legislated ->therwise, it will be my duty to continue the military governments which have existed since our occupa tion and give to the people security in life and property and encouragement under a just and beneficent rule." As to the future of Cuba he says: '"As soon as we are in possession of Cuba and have pacified the island it will be necessary to give aid and direction to its people to form a government for themselves. This should be under taken at the earliest possible moment consistent with safety and assured suc cess." The president says that with the one exception of the rupture with Spain, the intercourse 'of the United States with the great family of nations during the past year has been marked with cor diality. 

NICARAGUAN CANAL REPORT IS BEADY. The president expects that the Nica raguan canal commission will shortly be able to report finally. "1 have not hesitated to express my convictions," says the president, "that considerations of expediency and international policy as between the several governments in terested in the construction and control of an inter-oceanic canal by this route require the mainten ance of the status quo until the canal commission shall have reported and the United States congress shall have had the opportunity to pass finally upon the whole matter." He regarded, in view of our newly acquired int.rests in the Pacific ocean, the construction of such a maritime highway as now more than ever indispensable. Concerning the extraordinary events transpiring in the Chinese empire, the and its expenditures $689,S74,647, pret ident says that our position among nations gives the equitable claim to consideration and friendly treatment in this regard, and that it will be his aim to subserve our large interests in the~ Orient by all means appropriate to the constant policy of our government. The president reports that the Ha waiian commission has fulfilled its mis sion, and that its report will be laid be-' fore congress at an early day. Referring to the proposal of the czar of Russia for a general reduction of the g reat military establishments, the presi dent says: "His majesty was at once informed of the cordial sympathy of this government with the principle in volved in his exalted proposal and of the readiness of the United States to take part in the conference." Alluding to the financial affairs of the country, the president says in part: The secretary of the treasury reports that the receipts of the government from all sources during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1898, including $64. 751,223 received from sale of Pacific railroad, amounted to $405,321,335. and its expenditures to $443,368,582. It is estimated upon the basis of pres ent revenue laws that the receipts of the government for the year ending June 30th, 1899, will be $557,874,647, resulting in a deficiency of $112,000, 000. 

GOLD FOR REDEEMING GREENBACKS. 'In my judgment the present condi tions of the treasury amply justify the immediate enactment of the legislation r.commended one year ago, under which a portion of the gold holdings should be placed in a trust fund from which greenbacks shouk be redeemed upon presentation, but when once re deemed should not thereafter be paid out except for gold. It is not to be in ferred that other legislation relating to contrary there is an obvious demand for it." The recommendation made by the secretary of war for the increase of the regular military establishment has the president's unqualified approval. le says he will muster out the entire vol unteer army as soon as congres< shall provide for the increase of the regular establishment. No mention is made in the message of legislation for the new possessions. No specific mention is made of the Philippine problem. Tariff is not mentioned. The recent race troubles in South and North Caro lina are not mentioned 

CUBANS DISREGARD ORDERS. They Go Through a Street in Santia go Bearing Arms. Last Wednesday wasL the anniversary of the death of Gen. Antanio Maceo and it was celebrated among the Cu bans in Santiago. A nieniorial service was held in the morning in the cathed ral, which was crowded. Considerable annoyance was occasion ed to the United States authorities by the fact that some 75 men. Cubans marched the entire length of St Thomas street, armed with rifles and machetes. although all Cubans are well aware that such conduct is strictly against the regulations, armed bodies other than United States troops not being allow ed. The offenders in question did not ask permission to march armed, and their intention was not made known to the American authorities. Indeed, the ca thedral had been reached by the parad ers before the fact was reported to head quarters. Col. Beacon, who is chief in coin mand here during the absence of Gen. Wood, immediately called upon the mayor regarding the affair, and was by him referred to Col. Garcia. who sent an orderly di eating the appearan.e of the offenders at headquarters. 31ean while the armed squad had fired three volleys, many using ball cartridges. which bullets striking the upper por tions of the cathedral. caused the bell ringers to flee from their post. In less than a quarter of an hour an officer from the Fifth immune regiment arrived at headquarters with a message from Col. Sergeant, stating that several bullets has struck his tent at different points, and asking information as to the cause. Col. Beacon ordered Col. Garcia not to allow his men to attend the evening procession armed. The sole reason why the offenders were not arrested was that they were within the cathedral limits at the time. A band of Cubans on horseback en tered the premises of the Spanish club house this evening and broke several lamps with their machetes. The United States authorites acted promptly. As a result of the outrage at least half the police force will be discharged. ACTUALLY BLOWN TO ATOMS. Men Who Were Hauling a Govern ment Mine. Cause Unknown. Foer men were killed and seven seri only injured at Fort Independence, on Castle island, in Boston harbor Wed nesday afterndon by explosion of a mine which had been removed from the channel by a diver. The dead: Sergt. Morris 3McGrath. Hiram Vaughn. Private Brennan (a diver). -- Ryan (a citizen). Vaughn, Brennan and Ryan had placed the mine on a team and started to take it to the place where the other ammunition was stored. The road along which they passed was unusually, smooth, havir~g been constructed with a view to the necessity of care in tranis porting explosive material. Without warning the mine burst. The horse and art and the three men were blown to fragments. Sergt. 31eGrath was stand ing fully 20 feet away. Hie was instant ly killed by the concussion. His body does not bear a mark of any sort. As soon as possible after the explosion~ a careful search was begun by Lieut. Raymond, who had charge of' removing the mines, but not a fragmeut of men or clothing could be found. -Licut. Raymond states that he cannot explain how the explosion. occurred. Hie say that since the order was issued from Washington hundred of mines have been handled in precisely the same way as was this one and transported oser the same road. Ryan was a civilian assisting in the work, Vaughn was a member of the en gineer corps. He had only two weeks more to serve when he expected to be transfered to a naval college to take a course in naval construction. Sergt. 31eGrath was the keeper of the island. The. Very Best Plan. Gen. 31iles's plan of reorganization for the United States army is founded on very excellent precedent. The plan is similar, says Gen. 3Miles in his re port, to that which was found so effec tive' in the Confederate army. This recognition of the excellence of the Con federate army is quite remarkable. comn ing from Gen. 3Miles, andi it will be a very bitter dose to the G. A. RI. and the old bloody shirt howlers to have the " rebcl" armies thus officially glorified. But the tribute could *not be withheld. It was necessary to organize the United States army on a proper basis, and the best model obtainable was necessarily that made by Robert E. Lee, the great est captain that America has produced. -Charleston Post. Corn Wanted. The State Department at Washing ton has received a special report from the United States Consul General at Cape Town showing that a heavy and increasing demand exists in South Africa for corn and American corn meal. In Cape Town corn is quotea at $3.52 per 1(0 pounds. or $1.97 per bushel of 56 pounds, and the supply is not equal to the demand. In that miar ket wheat brings $4.44 per 100 pounds or $2.66 per bushel of 60 pouns. Eleven Drowned. The French steamer Algerois has foundered near Bona, a fortified seaport town of Algeria. near the mouth of the River Seibous. Eleven persons were THE BAPTISTS.

Pressdent Montague began by read ing a report of the workings of Furman University, stating that he would not make an address His report began by calling attention to the fact that some changes have been made in the manage ment. These changes were not made by the president alone, but with him were the other members of the faculty. Th'le institution has two departments, the preparatory and collegiate. There are four instructors in the preparatory department. In the collegiate, there are nine schools. In all there are 13 professors and lecturers.

The student body is a noble, high-minded set, and the friend-ship between them and the president is most cordial and genial. The number is 170. which is above the average for the last ten years. The financial in come annually is $11,060. The need of the University is more money, more endowment Lo meet all expenses with the income without having to draw on invested funds.

This report commended the entire practical and financial manage ment of the orphange, of which depart ment it made specific mention. A letter from Dr. J. C. Maxwell, re signing his membership as a trustee of this institution and reiterating his for mer charges, personal and otherwise, against the management of the orphan age, was read by Secretary Ervin. On motion this resignation was accepted. Dr. A. J. S. Thomas offered a resolu tion, which was adopted by unanimous vote, extending the sympathy of this convention to Dr. Maxwell in his ill ness. Then the. Orphange question came up, Secretary Ervin read resolutions offered by A. McA. Pittman and by C. T. Scalfe, relative to past and future management of the orphanage. Rev. R. W. Lide offered other resolutions as a substitute. Mr. Lide's resolutions provided that the convention should appoint a committee of nine, whose duty it should be to go to Greenwood, thoroughly investigate all charges and affairs relating to the orphange, and to make a report which should be a positive settlement of all orphanage troubles. Revs. R. W. Sanders and R. W. Lide and Mr. J. W. Shelorspoke to the resolutions, and Revs. 0. L. Martin and C. T. Scalfe spoke against their adoption. The speeches were earnest and im pressive. Christian spirit was clearly manifest and there was no exception to this, though the interest was atb sorbing. The recent newspaper c' - troversies on this subjiect were abso ltely condemned. and no one spoke in their defence. The question was finally called and a division was necessary. When the vote was at last counted the resolutions were tabled by a vote of 74 to 79, many members not voting. The special orders was taken, and the report an the corresponding secretary's report on State missions was read by Col. Zimmerman Davis. This report recommended that the work of State missions be prosecutt.d the coming year on a basis of $15,000. The work needs it and the churches out to willingly contribute that amount. After some discussion a cash collection of $73.70 was taken up and the report adopted. The chair announced the following committee ro report next year. On Eduoat n-A. P. Montague, C. P. Ervin, J.

The Connie Maxwell orphanage mat ter was again taken up by the conven tion. Resolutions were read, one by the Rev. A. McA. Pittman recommend ing that the question be solved by the trustees who shall investigate the trou ble: another by the Rey. C. T. Scaife to the effert that the iarestigation be done by the convention in session. Still another set of resolutions were offered by the Rev. W. T. Derieux. commit ting the work of investigation to the trustees, notwithstanding that the whole matter has been investigated and that we believe Bro. Vass to have been exonerated. and that the convention bind itself to abide by the finding of the board of trustoss. The test vote finally was upon the resolutions offered by C. T. Scaife. which were .idopted os follows: Whereas, the election of a superin tendent of the Connie Maxwell Or phanage has for two years caused friction in the board meetings: There fore Resolved, That the election of a sup erintendent be taken away from the beard of trustees and be restored to the convention. Second. That we proceed at once, by nomination and ballot, in open Con ention, to elect a superintendent, whose term of office shall begin with the annual meeting of this board in 1899 and expire with the annual meet ing in 1900. Third. That his successor shall be elected in like manner at each succeed ing meeting of the convention. Fourth. That in case of resignation or death the board shall have power to fill the vacancy until the succeeding convention. At half-past II o'clock, after two and a half hours of uninterrupted and eara est discussion. the resolutions of C. T. Scaife were adopted. Immediately the Rev. J. L. Vass was placed in nomina tion as superintendent of Connie Max well Orphanage, under the provisions of this resolution. Several seconds to this nomination were at once heard. Equally prompt was a protest from the minority, who had no candidate ready. A peace and unity brother was willing to proceed and the majority were also of generous spirit. The resolution pro vided for an election, however, and this after some -confused and obscure discus sion was entered upon. Mr. Vass being the only candidate. it was ordered that "yes" or "no" should be written on the ballots. This was done. voting was proceeded with and the teilers an nounced that of 136 vtes cast S9 were for and 47 against the election of the Rev. J. L. Vass as superintendent of Connie Maxwell Orphanage. After the announcement of the vote the resigna tions of W. L. Durst, F. 0. S. Curtis and John R. Leavell, Jr., as trustees of. Connie Maxwell Orphanage were read and accepted The commit ce on time and place now made a report. Gaffney city was selected as the place. and Wednesday before the 1st day of December next. at 8 o'clock, was the time. The report on obituaries was read by Rev. J. W. Perry.

LOOKED INTO. Congress to Investigate the War De partment. On the very first day of the meeting of Congress last week Representative Sulzer of New YorK, ranking Dcmocrat ic member of the house committee on military affairs, has introduced a reso lution "authorizing and directing the committee on military affairs to investi gate the war department and the con duct of the Spanish-American war."

The resolution was referred to the committee on military atfairs. Jealousy led~ to Murder. A double murder was committed \,ednesday in a country church two miles out from M1issouri City, Mo. 31iss Della Cleveng L was shot down mortal ly wounded and her escort to the meet ing house, George Allen, was instantly killed. The murderer was Ernest Cle venger, couis to the young woman who was one of his victims. The tragedy occurred immediately after the congre gation had been dismissed, as the wor shippers were leaving the church. Young Allen and Miss Clevenger were walking out together.

Kansas, with her usual reputation of producing many strange and wondcr ful things, is again at the front with one of the most peculiar election bets that has so far come to light. Out in Grant county, which is one of the thir ty-six counties that go to make up the big Seventh congress district, over which Jerry Simpson and Chester I. Long have so bitterly centested for the past few years, there is situated at the junction of the north fork of the Cim maron river and Prairie Dog creek the little town of Golden, a "short-grass" hamlet, inasmuch as it is situated in that part of Kansas known as the short grass region. Golden is not what could be rightfully called a prosperous vil lage, nor was it expected it would be when first settled: it consists of one general merchandise store, postoffice, and a few dwellings. The inhabitants of the surrounding country are mostly ranchmen and cowboys who center at Golden for the purchase of supplies. It was Miss Lucy Withers, a resi. dent of Golden, who brought this isolat ed prairie town to the attention of the public. Miss Withers is a comely wo man of some twenty Kansas summers, a school teacher, and lives with her widowed mother. She has always been a great admirer of Jerry Simpson from Medicine Lodge and never looses an opportunity to champion his cause. A few evenings before election there was a social gathering in the neighbor hood, and it was during this time that Miss Withers and a young and well-to do ranchman, by the name of Harold Owens, took opposing yiews on the po litical situation. The young teacher questioned Mr. Owens as to the depth of his faith in his candidate's electiop, and whetheror not he was willing to. wager some of his possessions to show his contidence. This was somewhas of a set back for the young ranchmau. but he informed her that he had thirty of the finest steers that ever grazed in Grant county, all of which he valu ed at $1:000, and which he would bet that Mr. Long would be elected to Con gress. *What have you, Miss Withers, to show your faith in the return of Simp son to Cong. is? asked the young ranch man. Now, the teacher owned no steers, neither had she anything equivalent to thirty head of cattle, but she determin ed not to be outdone. She hesitated a moment and said: "I will wager you 1.000 kisses at $1 each against your steers that Jerry Simpson wins." The young ranchman had civilized bucking broncoes, mastered the lariat and many oth -r difficult feats in a ranch . man's life. but, but this offer was the most.perplexing proposition that had ever been handed him. There was something fascinating about the collat eral offered and he replied; "I will accept with the understand ing that in case I win you allow me to collect my winnings on the installment plan." i'You may suit your pleasure about that." "Then it is an agreement and our lis teners are the witnesses." The election resulted in a bad defeat of Simpson. Harold Owens says he will collect twenty kisses, a week until the obligation is cancelled. A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT. Happened in a Tall Buildingl ia New York. An accident to the elevator in the 11 story building at Pine and Williams street, New York, occupied by the Uni ted States Fire Insurane company Wed nesday resulted in the death of one of the company's directors, the probable fatal injury of another di-ector and the serious injury of a third insurance man. Several other members of the directo rate of the United States Fire Insur ance company who were in the elevator at the time of the crash, together with others. miraculously escaped. Walter H. Griffin, secretary and di rector of the company, was instantly killed. Thomas W. Caldwell of Morristown, N. J., also a director of the company, received a compound fracture of the skull and is not expected to live. He is now in the Hudson street hospital. George HI. Smith, head of the frm of Smith & Hicks. fire underwriters, was injured about the head and body. It is not definitely known whether the elevator fell first from one of the upper floors or whether the superstructure sup porting the elevator fell on top of it from the roof of the building. There was a jarring sound and then a crash. The cables snapped and the counter weigzhts, half a dozen in number and weighing from 60 to 70 pounds each, de scendcd. bounding from side to side of the shaft. They crashed through the roof of the car. One of them struck Secretary Griffin on the head, crushing it in. Another struck Director Cald wela glancing blow on the back of the he'ad, fracturing the skull and exposing the brain. Underwriter Smith was struck by the torn cables and debris. The elevator man, Dennis Sullivan, lh-d prcsencc of mind enough to throw open the lower gate just as the first crash came, and the other passengers in the car were able to get out of the cagein time to save them. After the accident Sullivan was ar rested and is held awaiting the action of the coroner. It appears from state ments made by Manager Belknap of the Otis Elevator company and from others in the building that this elevator had been inspiected ten minutes before the accidens occurred and pronounced abso-, lutely safe. Manager Balknap could not advance any theory as to the cause of the accident. Killed by a Boy. Wednesday morning City Marshal A. 1).
