Gov. 8park Is being de nounced In bitter terms. Leaders of the miners say they had the men well In hand and would not have permit ted violence, and eipress strong doubt whether It will be possible to control the rank and file now that they have been classed a "outlaws." Business men generally sympathise with the miners. Tbey voire the fear that the practical declaration of mar tial law is Just the thing to preclpl tate fighting. The mine managers, however, are much pleased. Without troops, they assert, warfare could not long bave been averted. They declare the mln era' leader had no Intention of pre serving peace, and profess to have ev Idence that violence already was be ing plotted. Despite the fact that the soldiers are coming, the operators are rapidly adding to their forces of "gun men" about the mines. Though no formal announcement of the plan has been made, It la no se cret that the employers Intend to be gin Importing non-union miner soon after the soldier arrive. Union lead ers do not ssy what action they will take if the mines resume with non union forces. The mln owners have informed th government that the miner have 500 stands of arms at labor headquarters here, that they are well supplied with dynamite, and that much powder haa been stolen, despite the guards' vigi lance, from th mines In the past few days.

C The Secretary of the treasury haa accepted blda for the Panama Canal bonds to the amount of 125,000,000. The average prlc of all th bids ac cepted is fl.03. Under the terms of th law and the secretary's accept ance of these bids, th allotments of bonds to Individual and lnstltutnins will be confined to the small subscrip tions from 110.000 down to $20. The amount of bids from lndlvldaula and institutions which It has been pos sible to accept will, as heretofore, not be large. The remainder of th ac ceptances will be bids of national banks. The bids accepted hav com from every section of th country and are mostly in small amounts. The offering of Panama Canal bonds waa largely oversubscribed; but the improvement In business conditions mines to the end that every nook and corner of the workings may be reach ed in the shortest possible time. There is a large force of experienced miners for this work and they are worng In relays with short turns owing to the accumulation of gas which prevents men from remaining long in the mln. President Oscar Murray and other officials of th Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, wer la New Martlnaburg. W. Va,, 85 miles from her on an In spection trip when they heard of th disaster. They immediately ordered their special train run to Menongah, arriving her Friday night President Murray upon bis arrival conferred with the officers of th min ing company and offered on behalf of LisreU and th company any assist ance that It was possible to render. Clarence W. Watson, of Baltimore, president of the Consolidation Coal Company was at Froatburs. ML, and Immediately chartered a special train to bring him her. After, eon f erring with th mln superintendent and other local representative of th company be said there waa bo doubt but that 400 Uvea had been lost As to th mlnar referred to by th rescued men as having ' been alive when last seen. It la believed that tbey were caught back of a heavy cav-la and could not hav survived more than a few minutes la the deadly gases with which th entry flUd as soon aa th ventilating system was Inter rupted. There Is more hop for those In more remote sections of th mln, as they may hav reached workings wher fresh air Is supplied by other openings. But at best only th most lender hope Is entertained for th survival of any on of th men la th mln until th debris can -be cleared away and communication with th out sde re-established. Th two mines regularly employ 1,000 men. working In two shifts. 500 during the dsy and 500 during tb night, and th best In formation obtainable at this time Is that th entire day fore bad gone to work and that all wer caught There is much speculation as to the cause of th explosion but th most generally accepted theory is that it resulted from black camp, scientific ally known as methane. It la believed that a miner attempted to set off a blast which blew out and Ignited an accumulation of this deadly gas and that this In turn United the coal dust a highly Inflammable substance found In greater or lues Quantities in all Vent Virginia mince. However, all ex- rlftGHtions of the ciue p to this time -i'o ui-Har!!y speculative. Only a thorough InvestlR&'.tan after tho mine Is reoH'.'n-d will dUu-iose ttie catu If It is eer escorts! utr:!. following the announcement of recent measures of relief by the treasury de partment Is regarded by the secretary aa warranting hla limiting the Issue at this time to hslf the amount offered, namely, $25,000,000. This is almost ex actly th amount of th disbursement from th general fund of the treasury that bave been made during the year on th Panama Canal account Th allotment of the thre percent certificates will not the secretary saya, exceed $15,000,000. These have been confined to national banks throughout the country which wer in position to take out at once additional circulation, this being a measure de signed to afford immediate relief.

STRONGER ARMY AND NAVY Would Strengthen Trust Law Reo- ommonds Postal Savings Bank Asks for Csmpaign Fund for Great Political Parties, Washington, D. C If the members of tb two bouses of Congress enter tained any doubt aa to President Roosevelt's purpose In again Insisting upon the consideration of what has been denominated "Roosevelt poli cies,- that doubt has been dlapelled, The President's message, read to the members of the Senat and House at noon Tuesday, makea It apparent to the most obtuse that the fight to th end I to be along the lines of legis lation previously marked out by the President Considered concisely, the subject mstter In Its most Important particu lars Is a message of reiteration. Much of tho legislation urged upon Congress Is along lines previously advanced either In former messages or In the President's public addresses. Tb message In brief says: Nation's Great Resources. nation has greater resources than ours, sod I think It can be truth fully said that the cltlxens of no na tion possess greater energy and Indus trial ability. In no nation are th fun damental business conditions sounder than in ours at this very moment Moreover, as a rule, the business of our people is conducted with honesty and probity, and thla applies alike to farms and factories, to railroads and banks, to all our legitimate commer cial enterprises. There Is a constantly growing feel ing among our people that our sys tem of revenue legislation must be re vised. The country I definitely committed to the protective system, and any ef fort to uproot it could not but caus widespread Industrial disaster. The two great evils In the execu tion of our criminal laws today are sentimentality and technicality. Federal Inspection of Railroads. The loss of life and limb from rall-J road accidents In this country has be come appalling. It 1 a subject of which the national government ahould take supervision. It might be well to begin by providing for a federal In spection of Interstate railroads. The general Introduction of the eight-hour day should be the goal to ward which we should steadily tend. I renew my previous recommenda tion that the Congress favorably con- alder the matter of creating the ma chinery for compulsory Investigation of such Industrial controversies as are of sufficient magnitude to warrant fed eral action. There should now be either a na tional incorporation act or a law li censing railway companies to engsge In Interstate commerce under certain conditions. The Sherman antl trust law should be so amended as to forbid tnly th kind of combination which does harm to th general public. No legislation can by any possibil ity guarantee th business community against th result of speculative folly any more than It can guarantee. an In dividual against th results of his extravagance. Woman and Child Labor. No question growing out of our rap id and complex Industrial develop ment is more Important than that of the employment of women and chil dren. Tb presence of women in in dustry reacts upon th character of the bomo. The conditions surround ing th employment of children bear a vital relation to our futur. citizen ship. The repeal of the duty on wood pulp should if possible be accompanied by an agreement with Canada that thera shall' be no export duty on Canadian pulp wood. . Th chief engineer and all bis pro fessional associates ar firmly con vinced that th 85-foot level Panama canal which tbey are constructing Is the best that could be devised. Postal Savings Bank. I recommend a postal savings bank system. . 1 further commend an exten sion of the parcels poat especially on tbe rural routes. Oklahoma's future Is assured by her great natural resources. The duty of the national government to guard the rights- of th Indians wltbln her, bor ders remains, of course, unchanged.
