Tbla would give tbe President tbe power in bla discretion to deter mine not only how many may be neceuary, but to aeiect tbe localities where tbey will be tolerated, and to pra acrlhe, if he eliould think proper, tbe denomination to which they ahall belong. Tbia would pUce tbe frerdum or re.lgiou a* absolutely under hi* control as the fraedom of the press and tbe government or tbe Slates. Tbeprovialon of tbe constitution which declares that Congress shall have puwer to raise and support armlea must be construed to connection with that other pro Tiblon tbat "Congress ahall make no law respecting an establishment or religion or prohibiting tbe (ree exercise thereof or abridging tbe fr?ed< m or speech or or tba press." Taking tteso two provisions together, I do not see how any cat,did man can say that Congres* hi* power, under tho pretext or raising and supporting armies, to place tbe tree exercise or reliulon ai d tbe freedom or lbs pr*sa at tbe "discretion" of tbe President. Norc.n It be denied that tbe 'reedom or both are dependent upon bis will, when tbe law permit* no one to publish a paper or to preach the gospel without a detiil from blm. Is not the ? reedom or tbe press abridged wUea a news' paper can on y be published with tbe consent or the Pre sident; and is not tbe Independence and dignity or tb* legislator loal wben be l* compslled to enter the legis lative ball with a detail to bis i>ocket, subject to b* or dered out or it any moment wben It suits tbe interest or caprice of tbe President? Is this Stale sovereignty, free dom of tb* press and free religion? i When Congress en ict? such a law It converts the re- 1 publicaoism of tbe Confederate States Into the despotism or Turkey, mskes tbe President a dictator and prostrates tb* libertle* of tb*country, the iudependeoce or tbe pre** and the religious privileges of tb* people at bis feet. Even tbe Lincoln government, despotic as it Is, has not dared to attempt any sucb encroachment upon the liber ties ol the peopl* or tbe United Stale*. I wish, in advance, to enter my solemn protest against this monstrous proposition, wbiob, ir adopted by Con gress. will not only eodauger tbe success of our cause, by breaking tbe spirit or our people, which msy precipitate counter revolution, but may, aud I lear will, engender a strong reeling ror reconstruction with the odious govern mont of tbe North as the only means of escape I rom a worse despotism. 1 therefore earnestly recommend tbe passage of a joint resolution by this General Assembly, Instructing our Senators and requiring our representa tives in Congreas ta vol* against and use all i?sslbl?

The consul's servant?a colored youth?being roused, proceeded man fully to defend his master's property, and a battle roval ensued, la which the darkey, having armed blaaself with a remarkably persuasive weapon In the shape of a cham pagne bottle, eventually beat off tbe Confederal*.

ALFRED APPI.E. FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL WRDNnnaT, Dec. T?? P. U. The gold market has been excited, with an upward ten dency, to-day. The advance waa begun yesterday under the report that Mr.Stevens, of Pennsylvania, hud given notice in the House of Representatives to introduce n bill to regulafe tbe value of moner; to prohibit tbe ex portation of gold and silver coiuj to prevent gold and sll ver coin and bullion rrom being paid or accepted ror a greater value than their real current value, and prevent ing asy note or bill issued by tbe United states rrom being received ror a smaller sum than is thereon speci fied. Tills bill waa very properly tabled by the House to day; for s more impolitic measure oould not have been brought forward, and It Is surprising that any member of Congress familiar with tbe avU consequences of former legislation on this subjsct should have ventured upon s proposition fraught with so much danger. Specie muit be allowed to remain s free commodity, and all legislative Interrerenoe with It mast be studiously guarded against. The decisive tone of the President's message as being significant of a determine tiou to csrry on ths war on tbs extreme radloal basis, with no hope of reunion but by tbe rebela laying down their arms and burying slavery In the same oofQa with the rebellion, assisisd tbs upward movement, which the report or tbe Secretary of the Treasury still facilitated.

Tbe report <>r (be toeoretary of the Treasury is, as we expected it would be, about lbe weakest and moot era tire document that could possibly bare been conoocfed, nod tbe vast Importance or tbe theme contrasts remark ably wltb tbe intlgtiiQcanue of its treatment on tbis occasion, wben tbe eyes of tbe wbeie people were turned to it in tbe expectation that Mr. Fesrenden would at length bare found a policy. But tbe entire teneroftbe I report shows that be nas no policy, and tbat be bat tbrown the burden of tbe responsibility which pro perty belong* to himself on Congress, pretty muoh as If tbe csptatn or n ship laboring In a benry see end badly leaking resigned the control uf her to bis erew and passengers. We need hardly say that tbe report is a public disappointment. There Is nnthiog either definite or decided ab<>ut It, and tbe future eourse of the Treasury ma/ be anything that earrloa or circumstances ra.iy dictate This la by no tueane creditable to Mr. Feesenden, as a statesman, least or all as a financier Tbe experience of tbe past should hire led him to the adoption of a decislra course, aud his recommeadatioss to Congress oaght to bare bees emphatic and decided. He bad an opportunity such aa seldom in the world's history falls te the lot of a minister of finance for persooal distinction and publie usefulness. But bar lag seglerted tbat epportualty, and failed te prore himself equal to tbe task he has assumed, we can only regret tbat tbe coutrol el tbe nntlonal finances nt tbis critical period In our blstory should be rested In one who has proved blnsself so utter a (allure, and who still oltngs puslllanlmou?ly to tbs wreck of the policy which was Mr. Chase's legacy to lbs oonutry. The Seoretary does not appear to know his own mind exactly,Judging by the tone of his clusasy report. It abounds In contradictions, amblgultlsa and inconsisten cies, and sbows hesitation and confusion at almost srery turn Henceforward whaterer hopes may hare been enter tained of Mr Fesseadnn'e fltnees for tbe important office erer which be presides must be dispelled, and tbe poo pie must look elsewhere for a Secretary of the Treasury who can extricate tbe oonntry from that labyrinth of financial embarrassment into which It has fallen. Raring aald this mnch of the general features of the report, we shall glanos hastily at the few material points to which, with nxoesslrs prolixity. It refers. We are able to obtain a dearer Idea of tbe amount of the national debt from the last monthly return, dated October St, which stated It at t2,0ir,0??.6l?, than from this report) end aa for ita estimates, thsy are necessarily anrellable. The reoeipts for cus toms dutlee lor the ftrst quarter of tbs current tarsi year, ending September SO, were 110,271,001, or at the rate of serenty-esmn millions a year) and tbe receipts h are stare dwindled so that eren the Secretary's esti mate for tbe curreot year, of 170,272,001, front tnis source, may prors excessive. Tbe total eetlmai?d re renus ror the current year In only Mio,112,880, which Includes 178,000,000 In certitca(ea or Indebted' ess?aa Item that ought to bare been placed under another head. Mr. Fessendea bcileres that If ("onfrees adopts msasures for Incressinc the ln(ernnl rerenue nt an early day fifty mClions a year may be added (to three hundred mlllioasi from that eource, learing n dMktener of only f4M,874,188 to be prorlded for during the current year.
