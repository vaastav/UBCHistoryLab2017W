CUSTOMS sen vice. Points from the Iteport of the Treas ury's Special Agent. WASHINGTON, Dec. 5. In his annual report to the secretary of the treasury the supervising special customs agent state that during the last fiscal year goods of the value of JGI.S76 were seized and that fifty-four arrests were madefor violation of the customs laws. The amounts recov ered on account of fines and penalties ag gregated 117,440, and on account of under valuation and Improper classification J3C0.34G. The supervising agent reports that as a result of the activity of his offi cers the duties on Canadian wool in one collection district Increased from $1,293 in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1S93, to $24,000 In the last fiscal year. Attention is called to the seizure of smuggled diamonds on the Canadian border, the appraised value of which was JC6,000. During the season of 1900 23,470 sealskins were taken, and it has been reported that the lessees took smaller seals than have ever before been taken, which. It is thought, will result in a diminished catch during the next year. The seal life In 1S90 Is reported to be 20 per cent, less than in 1S0S, which is attributed to the effect of pelagic sealing. The total custom house receipts at all the ports in the United States is stated by the supervising agent to be $234,779,000, and the expenses $7,133,000. During the calendar year 1S39 the num ber of cars employed in the transportation of merchandise between the several ports In the United States via Canada was 621, 321, and the weight of the contents of euch cars was 8.402.0S2 tons.

USUAL EXIT WAS BLOCKED AND THE PILLARS WERE CRACKING AND HEADY TO GIVE WAY. Finally Cut n Hole Into u Second Opening: nnd Escaped, 31 ach to the Joy of Friends Above. SCRANTON, Pa., Dec. 5. Thirty-two men employed at the Nayaug colliery in Dunmore, were entombed by a cave-In this morning, but, thanks to a simple fortu nate circumstance, a terrible disaster was averted. The men were at work about a thousand feet from the bottom of the slope and four hundred feet below the surface when two acres of the roof between them and the slope came down with a terrlflc crash, crushing the pillars beneath it and causing a rush of air that almost blew the men from their feet and hurled the roof off the fanhouse. Their lamps were extinguished, but finding that the air was still pure, they relishted them and began to cast about for a way to escape. Some counseled remaining where they were until help should reach them from the outside, but the cracking of the pillars in their vi cinity told them that the cave-in was ex tending towards them and that they must soon rind a way out or be caught and killed like rats in a trap. Foreman John Gibbons, -who chanced to be with the men at the time, bade them keep cool and quiet, and he would try and find a way out. Crawling on his hands and knees over the debris, and sometimes squirming through crevices that barely ad mitted his body, he made his way to within fifteen feet of the airway which led to the second opening, and which it was pre sumed was not affected by the fall, as it Is a narrow passage cut through solid rock. Returning for the men he had them take their tools and follow him. After a difficult and dangerous Journey they reached the point where the fall blocked their way. This was attacked with bars, picks and shovels, and after an hour's work a passage was cleared to the airway which, as they had counted on, was open. As fast as they could run they made their way to the second opening and thence to the surface, where they were greeted with wild hurrahs from the thousands who had gathered expecting to see them brought out crushed and mangled corpses, If they were brought at all. During the two hours and fifteen minutes intervening between the time of the cave in and the time the men emerged from the second opening, the most Intense excite ment prevailed. Scores of volunteers, urged on by the piteous appeals of tno wives and children of the entombed men, descended the slope and In the face of the fact that the roof was continually working and that tons of rock were liable to drop at any moment, they proceeded to attack the fall and dig a passage through it. The surface over the cave-In dropped. In some places, fully a yard, and huge Assures zigzag In every direction. The Nayaug colliery is an old working that was opened thirty years ago. It was pretty well worked out and nnly a comparatively few men were em ploy cd cn It, SHIP BOUNTIES FEATURES OF THE MEASURE UNDER DISCUSSION IN THE SENATE. It Provides for Payment of Subsidies to Sail and Steam Vessels Engaged In Foreign Trade. AMOUNT LIMITED TO $9,000,000 NO CONTRACTS TO DE 3IADE TEN YEARS AFTER PASSAGE OF DILL. Foreign-Bnllt Vessels to Receive Only SO Per Cent, of Compensation Allowed Americans MAILS TO BE CARRIED FREE ANTI-TRUST ACT OF 1800 MADE AP PLICABLE TO ALL CONTRACTS. Du Uders or Owners of Vessels Who Enter Into Combinations to De Deprived of Deneflts. Special to the Indianapolis Journal. WASHINGTON, Dec. 5. The feature of the Senate proceedings to-day, as on Tues day, was Mr. Frye's speech in favor of en couraging the merchant marine. Senator Frye probably Is the best posted man in Congress on shipping matters and his speech was listened to very closely. President McKinley, in his message, called attention to the fact that American vessels carry only 9 per cent, of our ex ports and imports, and adds: "Foreign ships should carry the least, not the great est, part of American trade." He then quoted the opinion expressed in his mes sage of last year favoring the policy of aid to our merchant marine. For the practical carrying out of this suggestion there were Introduced in both houses, at the last ses sion, bills which were favorably reported back by the appropriate committees. In the Senate the report was made by Senator Frye, In the House by General Grosvenor, who is regarded as the personal spokesman of the administration on the floor. This measure, for the bill3 of the two houses are Identical in character, is the one Senator Frye discussed yesterday and to-day. It has for its essential feature the payment of bounties to both sail and steam vessels engaged in the foreign earning trade. The amount of bounties which may be paid in any one fiscal year Is limited in the bill to $9.000,000, of which sum not more than 70 per cent, shall be expended in the Atlantic ocean and gulf trade, the other 30 per cent. io be expended In vessels engaged In Pa cific ocean trade. If the bounties that would be earned by the vessels engaged in foreign trade in any one year exceed $3,000.000, the secretary of the treasury is required to make such regulations as would cause any excess in the total amount of compensation above that sum to be deducted pro rata from the total compensation of each person or corporation entitled to bounties daring the said year. 

DURATION OF LIFE OF CONTRACTS. The measure as reported comprises twenty-seven sections. The lirst section author izes the secretary of the treasury to con tract with the owner or owners of any sail or steam vessel engaged in foreign trade for the payment of the bounties provided in the bill for a period of ten years, where the vessel or vessels shall have been launched prior to Jan. 1, 1000. and where launched after that date for a period of twenty years'. It Is provided that the com pensation of sail or steam vessels shall be based upon the cargo without regard to the speed or tonnage of the vessel, but the number of compensated trips that such vessels shall make in twelve consecutive months is limited to sixteen. The compen sation provided for is li cents per gross ton for each 100 nautical miles not exceed ing 1,500 sailed outward-bound, and IVi cents per gross ton for each 100 nautical miles not exceeding 1,500 sailed homeward bound, and 1 cent per gross ton for each 100 additional nautical miles sailed. To receive full compensation under this clause ves sels must carry a cargo of DO per cent, of their gross tonnage, and where the amount of tonnage falls below that amount the amount of compensation is to be propor tionately reduced. Steam vessels are to receive in addition to the compensation above noted, additional bounties according to classified tonnage and speed, as follows: Vessels of over 2,000 tons, of eleven knots speed, four-tenths of a cent per gross ton; twelve knots, six-tenths; thirteen knots, eight-tenths; fourteen knots, one cent; fifteen knots, one and one-tenth cents; sixteen knots, one and two-tenth cents. Vessels over 4,000 tons of seventeen knots' speed, one and four-tenth cents per gross ton; eighteen knots, one and six tenth cents; nineteen knots, one and eight tenths. Vessels of over 10,000 tons, of twen ty knots' speed, two cents per gross ton; twenty-one knots, two and three-tenths. No vessel shall be entitled to compensa tion under more than one of the tonnage and speed classifications. Foreign built vessels admitted to American registry shall receive only 50 per cent, of the compensa tion provided. ' The secretary of the treasury is directed to contract with any citizen or citizens of the United States, Including corporations treated under laws 6f the United States or any State, who shall, within five years after the passage of the act,' apply for its benefits, the person or persons to applying being required to give bend to the United States In a penal sum equal to ten per gross ton of the vessel or vessels to be built pursuant to such bond, with security that they will, within five years next after giving such bond, make ready for service and register for foreign trade one or more of the vessels described hi the act. Any ves-sel to be entitled to receive the benefits of the act must classify as A 1. DECREASE IN BOUNTIES. It Is further provided that any vessel launched after Jan. 1. 1000, shall receive the compensation provided for the first ten years under the contract concerning such vessel, and that for the ten years follow ing the amount to be raid shall be de creased for each year below the year next preceding by 5 per cent. It Is further pro vided that no vessel shall be entitled to compensation unless at least one-fourth of lu-r crew shall be citizens of the United Stales, or have declared their intention to become such, but licensed officers are not T Included In the term crew. Every vessel benefited by this act shall be subject to a speed test for six hours of continued steaming at sea In ordinary weather, and the registered speed shall be the average speed f)r the said six hours. Vessels engaged for three months during twelve consecutive months in deep sea fish cries shall receive a bounty of $2 per gross ton, provided that one-third of the crew shall be United States citizens, and the United States citizens so engaged shall re ceive $1 a monh during such time. It is provided that no bounty shall be paid a vessel cot engaged in foreign trade, which provision Includes private yachts and other vessels not constructed for such trade; vessels engaged in the coasting trade, vessels trading to near-by foreign ports, foreign-built vessels wrecked and repaired In the United States, and vessels owned by citizens of the United States not entitled to the privileges of regular Amer ican vessels, because not officered as re Quired by law. The bill provides that foreign built steam Ships owned by citizens of the United States In whole or part may under certain cir cumstances receive the benefits of this act, provided that Americans obtain the whole title to such vessels. It is provided that bounties applicable to the service of existing vessels of the United States shall be paid only on the condition that owners shall build within five years after making the contract new tonnage in the United States to at least the amount of 23 per cent, of the tonnage of the vessels in respect to which con tracts shall be made, said vessels not to engage in domestic trade on the great lakes. Vessels under contracts pursuant to the provisions of thl3 bill are required to car ry the malls of the United States free of charge for the whole distance for which compensation shall be earned without any ether compensation. The secretary of the treasury is author ized to withhold compensation In the case of failure on the part of any person or corporation claiming bounties under this act, in which case the bounties shall be forfeited to the United States. The anti-trust act of IKK) Is made ap plicable to the builders and owners of vessels benefiting under this bill.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 5. Among Presi dent McKinley' callers to-day were Sena tors Daniel and Martin and Representatives OUy and Swanson, of Virginia, who called to pay their respects. The President made their visit the occasion to state his views concerning the various schemes for the decrease of representation in Congress from such of the Southern States as have limited suffrage by tho-tmposltion of edu cational qualifications .in their respective constitutions. The Virginia statesmen had not gone to the White House to discuss this subject and made no reference to It, the President Introducing it with a state ment of his attitude on the question. He has stated his position publicly on other occasions and said to his callers from the Old Dominion that he had thought it proper thus to make known his views. They were very naturally gratified at what the President said to them on this matter, more especially as Virginia is soon to hold a con stitutional convention and Senator Daniel is engaged In preparing a provision for the restriction of suffrage. The President's objection to decreasing congressional representation because of a limitation of suffrage by any of the States is reflected in the expressions of General Grosvenor, of Ohio, in opposition to th Idea, and who bluntly says that "give them rope enough the Southern Democrats will hang themselves," and of Chairman Hop kins, of the census committee, which will frame the reapportionment bill, who says: 'The Southern States must wdrk 'out their own salvation." The President's attitude certainly disposes of the proposition to re strict representation in Congress because of a limitation of suffrage at this session and probably for the future. It will let representation rest on the basis of popula tion, where It was placed by the framers of the Constitution, and not in any degree on suffrage, as Representative Crumpacker proposes In his bill and as advocated by others. The Indiana congressional delegation will have a meeting soon about the reapportion ment bill on the basis of 208,000, proposed by Chairman Hopkins, of the census com mittee. Indiana would be entitled to but twelve members, a loss of one. 'Naturally the delegation wants to avoid any loss of representation. The population by this year's census was given as 2,516,463. The highest basis that would leave Indiana's representation as It is thirteen congress menIs 201,000, for no matter what the basis a majority fraction adds a representative to the number a State would be entitled to. If 208,000 bo the basis Ohio, Maine. Michigan, Kansas, Nebraska, Kentucky, South Carolina and Virginia would each lose a congressman as well as Indiana. Nebraska will lose unless the basis be placed as low as 1S8.S13, lower than that under the census of 1890. A concerted effort on the part of the States above named will probably prevent the basis being raised above 200,000. Representative Griffith to-day introduced a bill referring to the Court of Claims the claims of Oliver P. Cobb and others for oats and corn sold to the government. Representative Heraenway to-day intro duced a bill to remove the charge of de sertion against, Jeremiah C. Lamar, Com pany E, Twenty-fifth Indiana Volunteers. Senator Fairbanks to-day Introduced a bill declaring the St. Joseph river in Elk hart and St. Joseph counties nonnavlgable, the object being to legalize the bridges and dams heretofore constructed on or over said river.

As to punishments, they are to be the severest that can be Inflicted by the Chinese government. As to In demnity, the Chinese government is to formally admit its liability and then the matter Is to be left for future negotiation. It was understood that on the other points the French proposition has formed the basis of the agreement. China May Accept. LONDON, Dec. 6.

Count Von Buelow said that, speaking from a personal standpoint,- he hoped the disparities possibly existing In the laws of the different states would be remedied, but as chancellor his first duty was not to allow the federal character of the empire and the autonomy of the members of the federation to be prejudiced without the consent of the individual states. 3IcKlnleya Message Criticised.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 5.-The House de voted the day to the army reorganization bill, which was brought up under a special order, adopted at the opening of the ses sion, which limited general debate to two hours on a side. Lieutenant General Mllei and a number of army officers were in teresting spectators throughout the day. Chairman Hull and Mr. Parker, of New Jersey, of the military committee, Repub licans, supported the bill, and Messrs. Cochran, of Missouri; Kleberg, of Texas; McClellan. of New York; Shafroth. cf Colorado; Cummings, of New York, and Cox. of Tenessee, Democrats, spoke brief ly against it. Mr. McCalU of Massachusetts, Republic an, aroused the only enthusiasm of the day against the measure. Several tlmei during the last se.slon. notably on tho Porto Rlcan tariff bill, he refused to follow his party. To-day he attacked the wholo Philippine policy of the ' administration. Although temperate in language, he wan plain spoken in his warnings of the dan gers which lay ahead of the government if a colonial policy was persisted In. Ho also criticised technically several features of the bill, especially that lodging in tha President the discretion to expand or re duce the size of the army at will. In con cluding he likened the unconquerable spirit which opposed our sway In the Philippines to that of Washington at Valley Forge. Love of independence, he said, was the "noblest heritage of the human heart" He declared that the United States should Immediately give the Filipino people hon orable assurance that they should have & government of their own. In replying to Mr. McCall. Mr. Hull de clared that until Congress acted to ths contrary we must assert and enforce our sovereignty over the Philippines or dis grace ourselves before the world, and it as the duty of Congress to provide an army adequate to put down the rebellion. Eleven of the twcnty-slx pages cf the bill were disposed of before adjournment. To morrow the Grout oleomargarine bill, un der a special order made at the last ses sion, will displace the army bill, which will go over until Friday. 

BOUTELLE RESIGNS CHAIRMANSHIP. When the House met the speaker an nounced that he had a communication from the family of Mr. Boutelle. of Maine, re signing his position as chairman of tho committee on naval affairs. Mr. Dalzell, of Pennsylvania, from the committee on rules, then presented a fpe cial order for the immediate consideration of the army bill, tho rule not to interfere with other epecial orders. Mr. Dalll said . that legislation of some- character was irn peratlve, as it would take time to retrult and organize the new army which must re place the old on July 1. Mr. Richardson, of Tennessee, said that his side of the House recognized the neces sity for some legislation, but did not agre that this bill, establishing a permanent standing army, should become a law. If an emergency exists, an emergency should r provided for. It was proposed to provide an army which could be expanded at tho will of on man from W.000 to 100.OX). No matter how good or able that man might be, he was not willing to sec one man given such power. It was, in his opinion, abdicat ing the functions of Congress. Mr. Rich ardson said he was ready at all times to vote to put down rebellion anywhere and everywhere that It existed, but under the stress of" an emergency he was not willing to establish permanently a large standing army. Mr. Underwood, of Alabama, also in veighed against clothing the President with discretionary power to expand or contract the army at will. Mr. Grosvenor, of Ohio, in ourport of the bill, said that personally he was In favor of a standing army of 100,000 men. The people, he said, were not frightened when a dema gogue said that the purpose in increasing the army was to station large regiments near large cities to oppress labor. They were not alarmed by the cries that fhelr lib erty was to be snbverted. As for the oppo sition to the "sliding scale," the President always had rractlcally been supreme In the use of the army; why should ho not In the use of his discretion have the power la time of necessity to expind the army? it was a glorious tribute to our system that never had the President of the United States attempted to abuie his power over the army. One of the magnificent acts of G rover Cleveland had been his assumption of hi duty to ke"P the peace tn a grt cvmrnouweulth by means of the United
