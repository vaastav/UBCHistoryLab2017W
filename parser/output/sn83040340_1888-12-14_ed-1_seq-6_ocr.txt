.TERRIBLE KILLINGr. Doplorablo ReBult of the Murder of Mrs. Hawes, at Birmingham, Ala. Sheriff Smith Somewhat Hastily Orders His Hen to Fire oa a Mob Threatening the Jail Many Parsons Killed. and Wounded The Military in Possession. Birmingham, Ala., Dec. 10. Thursday and Friday searching parties scoured every foot of woods for miles around the city in search for the body of Mrs. Hawes, who was thought to have been murdered by Engineer Hawes, who is now in jai here for killing his daughter, but until Saturday morning no one thought ot dragging the lake where the girl's corpse was found. As soon as it was suggested, however, a party went to the lake with drag hooks and began the search and about noon the body of Mrs. Hawes was found. It was lying on the bottom of the lake at the deepest part, about 200 feet from the shore. A hasty ex mination was mado and there was found the final evidence of a double murder, the back of the head having been laid open by a terrible blow with an axe. Securely fast ened around tho neck was a piece of rail road iron weighing fifty pounds. An other pieco was tied around hor waist and a third around hor ankles. It was said that the body would be brought to the city to the undertaking rooms, and in less than two hours the two streets leading to the rooms were filled for a block each way with excited people. The officers decided that a sight of the woman's body would inflame the crowd, and it was quietly slipped out of the city under a strong guard and secreted and guardod. At night about three thousand men gathered in the vicinity of the jail intent on lynching Hawes. Mayor Thompson and several officers talked to the crowd. The mob seemed without a leader, but things looked very squally. One hundred armed officers were inside the jail, ready to make a desperate resistance. The mob advanced on the jail about twelve o'clock, and the officers opened fire with terrible effect Nine men wero killed outright, and a large number wero wounded. Terrible excitement prevailed, and tho military were armed as fast as possible. Jim O'Rourke, of Kansas City, had his brains shot out James Werner is dead. About twolvo o'clock the nob around tho county jail began slowly pressing back the outer guard and advanced down Twenty-first street to tho mouth of the alley leading to tho jail entrance. This alley is about 100 feet long and twenty wide and is tho only approach to the jail. When tho crowd reached tho mouth ot the alley Sheriff Smith from the jail warned them to stand back time and again. He yelled to them to keep back, as they would be fired on if they advanced up the alley. Finally ho called out, "I will count thrco, nnd if a man remains there in tho alloy we will fire." Tho sheriff counted three and tho crowd fell back a little and the authorities did not givo tho order to fire. This soeniod to make the mob bolder, and again they pressed up tho alley. Sheriff Smith yelled to them: "I will count five, and if you do not fall bncfc wo will fire." He counted five, whilo tho mob hooted, yelled and continued to advance up tho alloy. Then tho officers opened fire, which was at once returned by the mob. At least one thousand shots wero fired. Yesterday tho military took possession of tho city and the mob has been overawed. Tho following wero killed: M. B. Tuockmorton, postmaster, and a very prominent nnd popular citizen. Ho leaves a wife and one child. Ho was abont thirty years of age and was born in Louisvillo, Ky. He cumo to Birmingham in 1880 ns agent for the Southern Express Company, and about eighteen mouths ago was appointed postmaster. An unknown negro, shot through tho lungs, and died this morning. J. R. McCoy was toward the front of tho crowd whe'u the firing commenced. Ho fell at tho first volley. A. B. Tarrant was shot in the bark. After the first volley ho lay down on the ground with the hope of avoiding flying bullets. Fate would not have It so, how ever, and a ball struck him as be lay on his face and ranged up bis back. After a few minutes' suffering he died. A. D. Bryant was shot through the heart. Ho was standing rather near tho front, and was doing his best to restrain tho crowd from going any nearer. He fell at the first volley, and died instantly. C. C. Tate wns shot through tho hip, thigh and loin. He is dying. He is a painter, and lived at Eastlake. He is about forty-five years old and has a family. Frank Childer, shot through the body, died last evening. Colbert Smith (colored) shot through tho right lung, died yesterday morning. Lawrence Fitzhugh, a civil engineer, was fatally wounded. He was shot through the shoulder. He is thirty years old. Charles Bailey was shot through the head. It is thought he is fatally wounded. A. J. Schlede, a mechanic, was shot in the left side just under the right shoulder. It Is thought that he will die. He came recently from Kalamazoo, Mich.

He lived until ten o'clock next morning. He was twenty years old and lived at Smithfiold with his parents and three brothers. Branden, at the hospital, wounded in the thigh and abdomen, died at ten o'clock this morning. Just after he was shot he told bis attendants ho boarded at the nouse of the sheriff of Etowah County, nt Gadsden, Ala., and was here on business buforo tho United States court I notice that one of our American girls who married a nobleman has gone back to her old calling as a hired girl. She mar ried Eddie, the royal pinchbeck from across tho deep blue sea. He said he would be stow upon her all his titles, crests and patrimonial acres if she would be his'n. Sho consented. Then they went to live with her father, Eddie eating the cream off tho morning's milk of three cows, spread over his vesper dewberries. Now Eddie's brother comes from across the sea and says that he is not noble, but boils sugar at homo. He takes Eddie by the nose and tells me lady that she had better hustle for herself. So she has resumed the crumb brush and two nights out each veek. What an American girl wants to be a duchess or lady of high degree for, when sere can be an American hired girl, with ten times as much power, is more than I can make out Aside from being a sleeping car conductor, with a haughty mien and nothing to do, I would rather be an American girl, with good wages, no board to pay and my nose worn high, than to be most any thing I know of. A good American servant generally dresses about as well or better than her mistress, has moro to say about most every thing, oven as to whether company may or may not bo invited to the house, has no bills to pay for any thing but clothes, and aciuauy lives a far more independent me thnn lots of sad eyed women who are try ing to hold a very ticklish position in what we call society. Bill Kye. KANSAS RAILROADS. Annual Iteport of the State Railroad Com mUslonera. Topeka, Kan., Dec. 4. The sixth annual report of the State Board of Railroad Commissioners, which will soon leave the printer's hands, shows in detail the pro gress and further extension of the State's railroad systems, the doings of the past year in transportation, and the financial strength and condition of the various roads. The construction of the year, counting 221 miles under contract to be built by December 1, Is 515.15. This makes the total mileage 8,799. Three years ago Kansas had only 4.1GS miles of railroad. The report says that compared with the population Kansas is the best equipped with railroads ot any State in the Union, or any country tn the world. For every one thousand ot hor population sho has five and one-half miles of railroad. This, while it furnishes great advantages, has its corresponding drawbacks. The multi plication of railroads beyond the point where the volume ot business is sufficient to yield remunerative revenues to com panies charged with their operation and maintenance must necessarily become, to some extent, a mortgage on the future. Sines 1885 the conditions for the rapid development of business in Kansas have not been favorable. The reports for the year to the Commis sioners show that of tho mileage in the Kansas systems, 2,012 wero operated at a net loss of $873,G29.40. In addition to this, 4,301 miles, whilo earning sufficient to meet operating expenses and taxes, failed to earn their interest charges. The aggregate amount of deficit in in terest earnings was $6,129,508.07 for the year ended June 30, 1888. Tho total gross earnings were $74,022,015.03 less by $1, C05.O04.41 than the like earnings of the previous year. The total expenses, taxes, Interest and dividends, were $82,898,227.14, making the payments in excess of receipts $3,847,553.61. The total amount of divi dends paid by all companies was $8,385, S95.G3. The Santa Fe paid in dividends $4,777,939.75, the Missouri Pacific $2,189, 731.88, and the Fort Scott $501,924. The operations of the Santa Fe are shown to have reached a colossal scale. The report covers 3,022.78 miles of main and leased lines. The total amount of its common stock issued to June 30 was $75, 000,000, an increase of $10,990,750. The bonded debt amounted to $09,995,000 at that date. The total cost of construction and equipment reported June 30, applying to 4,708 miles, was $17G,655.59G.G8, th aver age cost per mile being $37,028.89. The freight tonnage increased during the past year but the earnings from this source di minished more than half a million dollars. Passenger traffic receipts Increased as compared with 1887. The exesss of ex penses, taxes and payments over earnings for the year was $3,517,29J.ll. The total amount of lauds received by the company from its Congressional land grant was 2,92S,cC5.49 acres. Of these all have been sold or contracted for except 3,785 acres. A CRIMINAL LYNCHED. A Colorado Murderer ami Thief Lynched by Indignant Citizen. Caxox City, Col., Doc. C. At four o'clock yesterday morning twenty armed men succeeded in effecting nn entrance to tho jail here, overpowered tbo sheriff and tore down the steel cago in which With crill, tho murderer, was confined.

Ho wns immediately carried a sligrt distance from tho jail and strung up to a telegraph polo, without resistance, nnd left hanging until daylight. Wither-ill never said a word after being wounded and appeared most indifferent ns to his fate. Harry Perdue, another murderer confined in tho jail, was not molested. In 1S72 Witherill murdered his employer, a sheep man named Wall, living in Elbert County. Ho was arrested and sentenced for life, but wns pardoned a year ago. In September ho started from Ironton, a small town in tho southern part of tho Stale, for Silverton, with two acquaint ances. Ho arrived at Silverton with tho teams belonging to thoso men, but the men were never seen or heard of. There was no ovidonco to convict him of killing the men and ho was never arrested. From there ho went to Puoblo, sold tho horses and becamo acquainted with Charles Mc Cain, and tho two startod from Pueblo for this place in October last with two teams belonging to McCain for the purpose of hauling ore.

NATIONAL AFFAIRS. Hayti Moat Deliver Up the Seized Vessel Senator Blair's Latest Scheme Silver Control and Free Coinage. Washington, Dec. 7. Action has beea taken by Secretary Whitney which leaves no doubt as to the policy of the Govern ment with regard to the case ot the Amer ican steamer, Haytlen Republic, recently seized at Port au Prince, Hayti. The re lease of the vessel has bean demanded through the proper diplomatic channels and if the demand is not complied with within a reasonable period of. time, steps will be taken to enforce It With this end In view Secretary Whit ney yesterday sent telegraphic instruc tions to Rear Admiral Chordi, command ant of the New York navy yard, to have, the ships, Richmond, Galena and Yantic, prepared for sea as rapidly as possible. It was expected that these vessels would be completed in about two weeks. The idea now is to have them ready so that they can sail direct for Hayti early next week. Orders have also been issued for Rear Admiral Luce, commanding the North At lantic station, to transfer his flag from the Galena to the Richmond and to use that vessel as the flagship ot the expedition. Officials ofhe State Department are, as usual, reticent on the subject, and will not admit even that the release of tho Hay tien Republic has been demanded. Secretary Whitney is more outspoken. When asked by an Associated Press re porter this morning about the affair he admitted frankly that he had ordered the three naval vessels at New York to be gotten ready as soon as possi ble to start for Hayti. He added: "There is a local disturbance there, you knowand it is always a good plan to have naval vessels near at hand on such occa sions. You .remember that the Haytien authorities referred the case of the seized steamer to this Government Well, we have rendered a decision and that in short is that they have got to give her up. It is unfortunate that the yellow fever broke out on the Boston while she was at Fort au Prince and compelled her to leave that climate. Otherwise the matter might have been settled before now. If it was not consid ered somewhat unsafe, we would send tho Boston back to Hayti to aid the other ves sels in case of necessity. That's all there is to it. We do not think the seizure of tho vessel justifiable and are therefore de termined that sh e must be delivered up to us." BLAIR'S LATEST XFTORT. Washington, Dec. 8.
