THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. The President's Message has been sent to Congress and telegraphed over the Union. It is very long and touches upon most public questions. It is dignified and exhaustive and a clear presentation of Re publican policy. It is not trenchant or remarkable for its perspicuity or great ability displayed. It is too long for us to print, and we shall attempt only to give our readers an outline of the most salient points touched upon. We pass over our peaceful foreign relations, which thePresi dent reviews at length, with the comment that '-we are" as Andrew Jackson is ac credited with saying "at peace with all the world and the rest of mankind." Our estimated yearly surplus is forty-three million dollars, an- Congress is recom mended to revise the Tariff so that the un necessary burden on the people may be removed. He flounders here and finally says that in reducing the Tariff "the protection principle should be maintained and fairly applied to the products of our farms as well as of our shops." To our farms! This is the first we ever heard of giving the farmers protection. The bottom did not drop out of the Republican majorities hi Oaio and Iowa and New York for noth ing. Following, the President discusses the Internal Revenue and says (we quote his words because they will be read with endorsement by many North Carolinians): luternal Revenue. "The removal of the internal tax upon tobacco would relieve an important agri cultural product from a burden which was impostd 'only because our revenue from cu.'toms duties was insufficient for the public needs. If safe provision against fraud can be devised the removal of the tft- lmnn snirits used in the arts and in manufactures would also offer an unobjec tionable method of reducing the surplus." LTdou the financial question he quotes from the report of the Secretary of the Treasury. While believing in silver coin age he does not think it ought to be made tree, and savs that any safe legislation upon this subject must secure the equality ot the two coins in tneir commercial uses. lie has not given the plan of the Secretary of the Treasury, which provides for the issuance of notes or certificates upon the leiosit of silver bullion at its market value, careful examination, but thinks the vhm suggested by him feasible and satis factory. In Canada a tax of 30 per head is im posed upon all Chinamen landing. Then tht Chinese come to America, and as Canada will not take them back without ta ment of SoO there is some difficulty. It is hoped that an understanding may be tfiVcted with the Canadian authorities. Our coast cities have no security except in the friendly disposition of other nations and an appropriation for ample coast de fences is recommended. Appropriations for needed river and harbor improvements are recommended. Care should be taken thai the appropriations be made only to worts of public and general aavaniage, iou that work commenced be not delayed for lack of funds. The wisdom of this is anuarent to all. Enlarged jurisdiction is asked for the couits, and protection to ail omcers, juries and witnesses. A speedy way of determin ivc ouestions which come before the Su preme Court is recommended. A National bankrupt law. simple and inexpensive in its iidmici-tration, is recommended. The President is decidedly humorous in hi short and hasty treatment ot trusts He rails them "conspiracies against the the public good," and truly says "they should be made the subject of prohibitory and even penal legislation." This is all right, as far a-s it goes, but it does not go to the root of the matter. Trusts are the ofl'suring of an unjust Protective Tariff. Kill that, and trusts die for want of nour ishment. Upon the subject of Naturalization the President speaks works of wisdom. We quote: "Our naturalization laws should be so revised as to make the inquiry into the moral character and good disposition to wards our Government of the persons ap plying for citizenship more thorough. This can only be done by taking fuller control of the examination, by fixiDg the times for hearing such applications, and by re quiring the presence of some one who shall represent the Government in the in quiry. Those who are the avowed ene mies of social order, who come to our shores to swell the injurious influence and extend the evil practices of any associa tion that defies the laws should not only be denied citizenship but a domicile." The operations of the Postoffice depart ment are said to be improved; the enlarge ment of the Navy is insisted upon, and the improvement recently made (by Mr. Cleveland) commented upon; the Indian question is discussed at some length, the President saying, "It is to be regretted that the policy of breaking np the tribal rela tion and of dealing with the Indian as an individual did not appear in our early leg islation" so he could be "pushed upward into the estate of a self-supporting and re sponsible citizen"; the facts in regard to the opening and settlement of Oklahoma are given; aid to the schools in Alaska from which place the Government gets a large annual revenue is recommended, as is also the organization of several sub-districts with a small municipal council of united power; the admission of four new Ftates in one day is called an event "as un exampled as it is interesting"; and Con gress is recommended to thwart the plans of those who attempt to take up the pub lic laiids (which are intended for bona fide settlers) lor speculation and for others. At the request of ten thousand brake men he calls attention to Congress and says it is in their power to bring about the use cf automatic brakes and couplers on freight cars used in Inte State Commerce. In one year over 2,000 railroad employees were killed and 20,000 injured in coupling and uncoupling cars and in handling the brakes of such cars, ibis is a reproach to our civilization. Work to perfect the Executive Depart ment of Agriculture is recommended, and it is suggest d that the weather service be established in connection with the Agri cultural Department. The celebration of the anniversary of the discovery of Ameri ca is recommended. When the President touches the Civil Service question he is evidently at sea. He tries to straddle it and recommends more clerks for the Commission, and sug gests that Postmasters be classified under the heads of, "Faithfulness" and "Effic iency" so that competent men may be re tained. He speaks strongly in favor of Federal aid to education and says: National Aid to Education. The interest of the general government in the education of the people found early expression not only in the thoughtful and sometimes warning utterances of our ablest statesmen, but in liberal appropria tions from the common resources for the support of education in the new States. No one will deny that it ia of the gravest national concern that those who hold the ultimate control of all public affairs should have the necessary intelligence wisely to direct and determine them. National aid to education has heretofore taken the form of land grants, and in that form the constitutional power of Congress to pro mote the education or tne people is not seriouslv Questioned. I do not think it can be successfully questioned when thd form is changed to that of a direct grant of monev from the Dublic Treasury. Such aid should be, as it always nas oeen, sug crested bv some exceptional conditions rf i The sudden emancipation of the slaves of the South, the bestowal of the suffrage which soon followed, ana tne impairment of the abilities of the States, where these new citizens were chiefly found, to aae quately provide educational facilities, pre sented not onlv exceptional but unexam Died conditions, lhat tne situation nas hefiti much ameliorated there is no doubt. The ability and interest of the States have happily increased. But a great work re mains to he done: and I think the general ornvernment should lend its aid. As the suggestion of a national grant in aid of education grows chiefly out of the condi tion and needs of the emancipated slaves and his descendants, the relief should, as far as possible, while necessarily proceed ing upon some general lines, be applied to th rAPda that suesrested it. It is essen- tial, if much good" is to bo accomplished, that the sympatuy ana active iuiere&t oi the people of the States should be enlisted, and that the methods adopted should be such as to stimulate and not to supplant local tax for school purposes. As one Congress cannot bind a succeeding one in uch a case, ana as tne enort must m someuegrec, uv cF-.v , - - - J Krt AvrvAKimanto I TPffHTi - menrl that unv annropnation maue iur tKJo nnmnu h so hmitea m annual J n ,1 amount, and as to the time over wmcn it is to extend, as will, on the one nana, give the local school authorities an oppor tunity to make the best use of the first year s allowance, ana on tne inner, ucium them from the temptation to unduly post- none the assumption of tne wnoie ouraen themselves. The colored people did not intrude themselves upon us, they were brought here in chains and held in the communities where they are now chiefly found by a cruel slave code. Happily ior both races they are now free. They have, from a standpoint of ignorance and pover- ty which was our shame, not mors, maue rpmaikable advances in education and in the acquisition of property. They have as a people, shown themselves to be friendly and faithful toward the white race under temptations of tremendous strength. They have their representatives in the National Cemeteries wnere a graie- t th rrhn A in its defence. Thev have (...nich r -.nr T-Aomiar armv resnments vuv-ju . .

Gen erally they do not desire to quit their j homes and their employers, despite the interference of the emigrant agents, who seek to stimulate such a desire. National Election Law. The message concludes with a recom mendation of aid to our merchant marine and a discussion of the negro question. 1 he President takes the grouud that the negro is defrauded of his vote in the South. He says that this wrong does not expend it self upon those whose votes are suppressed, Every constituency in the Union is wrong ed. Closing what is said m regard to the suppression of the negroes' vote, the Presi- it dent savs: "I earnestly invoke the attention of Con press to the consideration of such measuios within its well defined constitu tioual powers as will secure to all our peo ple a free exercise of the rigr.t of suffrage and every other right under the Constitu tion and laws of the United States, ho evil, however, deplorable can justify the assumption either on tne part ot tne exec utive or of Congress of powers not grant ed, but both will be highly blamable if all the powers granted are not wisely Dut firmly used to conect these evils. The power to take the whole direction and control of the election of members of the House of Representatives is ciearly given to the general Government. A partial and Qualified supervision of thee elections is now provided for by law, and in my opin ion tnis law can be strengthened and ex tended as to secure better results than can be attained by a law taking all the pro cesses of such election into Federal con trol. The colored man should be protected iu all of his relations to the Federal Govern ment, whether as litigant, juror or wit ness in our courts, as an elector for mem bers of Congress or as a peaceful traveller upon our Inter State railways.' . , 

DISTRESS IN HALIFAX COUNTY. From Wilmington Messenger. Halifax, JN. c, Dec. 3. A large mass meeting of our people was held hereto day to consider the distress among our people caused by crop failures. Fully 800 people were present. Mr. Tnos. lay lor, representative to the Legislature pre sided, and Judge T. N. Hill, Maj T. L. Emry and J. W. Johnston, Esq., were ap pointed a committee to draft resolutions expressing the object of the meeting. Sev oral addresses were delivered that deplored the condition and the distress of the coun ty The committee, through Judge Hill re ported the resolutions which suggest that the citizens througn a committee memor- ialize the Governor to call an extra session of the Legislature for the purpose of em- powering me county commissioners to ia- sue bonds to be applied to the relief of the people, and to do whatever else may be necessary to honorably aid the people, Judge Thos. N. Hill, Maj. T. L- Emry, W. A. Dunn, Esq., and Thomas Taylor, Esq., were appointed a committee to memorialize the Governor as to calling an extra session of Legislature. The Chronicle does not believe that the Governor would be justified in calling a special session of the General Assembly The distress is local, and the individuals in each county who have the ability must aid their poorer neighbors until another crop is made. Edgecombe's Well tO do farmers and merchants have arranged to aid those in distress by furnishing meat and bread at cost and waiting until next Fall for payment. This is a good exam pie, and we commend it to our Halifax friends who have our sincere sympathy in their distress, editor. J . A SAD KILLING. A Prominent Young Lawyer Kills a iMan. At Hendersonville baturaay evening turman torest, a young resiaent of that place, was shot and killed by A. iu. Posey. Esq., a well known young lawyer of the town. During the day Forest had had a fight with a barkeeper named Sherman and at the trial the latter bad employed Posey as his counsel. During the trial Posey and Forest quarrelled and afterward renewed the altercation on the street.in front of Posey's office. A fight followed and Posey shot Forest twice in the breast, causing death in a few minutes. Posey is in jail. He was the Democratic candidate for the Legislature in Henderson last year, and is highly esteemed. We are grieved to hear of this sad occurrence. 

METHODIST CONFERENCE. A GAIN OF 10,739 MEMBERS DUR ING THE YEAR. The Collections Increase S30,t00.12, Which Is a Gain of 4 Cents Per Cap ita The Proceedings. Editorial Correspondence. Greensboro, N. C, December 3, 18H9. The fifty-third session of the N. C. Con ference of the M. E. church, South, was called to order at nine o'clock Wednesday morning of last week. The roll-call re vealed the fact that four ministers Revs. W. M. Robey, D. D. , James W. Randall, J. J. Grigg, and T. S. Campbell -had died during the year. Bishop R. K. Har grove opened Conference with religious exercises. The Bishop is a handsome man with hair and beard of snowy whiteness. He looks like a Bishop, or a man of note. He presides well, and is a man of affairs, with excellent administrative ability and solid piety. He is a native of Alabama and was born in 1829, and is just three score years of age. He carries his years well and but for his white hair and beard would easily pass for a man of 48 or 50. He is held in high regard by the church as is evidenced from the fact that he was se- lectedto succeed the late Bishop McTveike as President of the Board of Trustees of Vanderbilt University. State Treasurer D. W. Bain was unani mously re-elected Secretary, and Mr. v . H. Branson, and Revs. W. L. Cunning- - - -rrr itt t Jl I GIM, a. M.

However that may be, he is a born Secretary, and the Masons, the Meth odists, and Democrats have enough wis dom to keep him where he serves so faith fully and efficiently. He has the best of the young men in the Conference to aid him. After the work of organizing and the appointment of the standing committees, Rev. David .Morton, D. D., Secretary of the Board of Church Extension, spoke on the importance of the work of building churches in the West, and helping weak communities to build Methodist churches. This is a comparatively new field of work in the Methodist church, but Dr. Morton cieany uemuus. rieu it 6iei, imu. . i - W A 1 . 1 1 the rjLsnoD aaaea to nis remarKs auu took up a collection (I don t know how much was raised) to aid in building a parsonage in caiitornia. fi,uuu was raised to add to the Extension fund. Rev. Wilbcr F. Tillett, D. D., Dean of the Theological faculty of Vanderbilt University, addressed the Conference on the subject of Ministerial Education. He is a native of North Carolina and is one of the brainiest of the younger men who claim North Carolina as their birth-place. He is a profound scholar, and a strong preacher, and presented the need for an educated ministry with such arguments as could not be refuted. In passing, he spoke of the North Carolina boys who had been trained at Vanderbilt, and paid a compliment to N. H. D. Wilson, Jr., of Greensboro, which not only brought tears of joy to his happy mother but also made the two hundred and more preachers and friends of his dead father happy and proud that the mantle of the sainted Wilson had fallen on a son worthy to receive it. Ho urged the young men to fit themselves by every preparation for the great work whereunto they are called. He was ex tended a vote of thanks for his admirable address which was greatly enjoyed. He is no orator but is a brainy man who talks clearly and strongly and impressively. He is a man of weight, and will be a Bishop one of these days. Mark the prediction! A sensible lady who was present the whole time of Conference told me that during the entire session nothing was more interesting than the address of Bishop Holsey, colored, upon the necessity of the education of the negro. He was present to ask a small contribution to aid in the erection of a new building Paine Insti tute. This is a college established by white Methodists to educate the negroes. A col lect ion of $80 was taken up for his cause. It ouht to have been $300. The Bishop is said to be a man of elo quence. I was sorry I did not hear him. He says that the negroes woul I get along better if some of them would join the Democratic party. On Thanksgiving Day the sermon was preached by Rev. J. D. Barbee, of Nash ville, Tenn. Everybody pronounced it a grand discourse upon the subject of Giving. Dr. Barbee was, by resolution, requested to publish it for general circu lation. Rev. W. C. Norman asked a farm er what he thought of the sermon. "Well," he replied, "he convinced me that I must live away everything I have got or go to hell." His satire upon the man who holds his property as long as1 he can. and then, when about to die, wills it to a good cause was particularly fine.

In the afternoon on Thanksgiving day, the young ladies gave a compliment ary musicale to the Conference. The preachers all enjoyed it, especially the young preachers and laymen.

SUCH an entertainment and see so lovely a throng of beautiful young girls. They looked like a picture, and even the gruff c-st old bachelor in Christendom would have had his heart softened and his tongue sweet ened to see them, and to hear their mere torious productions. Greensboro Female College has educated many of the best women in North Carolina, and its influ ence extends throughout the entire State Many homes ai e sweetened and brightened by the wives and daughters who have gone out from her walls, and the appreci ation of education been heighted, and bet ter than all, much religious truth has been taught by the women who were trained here for their life-work. "Lives of week day holiness" have for many years attested to the religious influences of the college. Long may it live to educate the young women and make them sweet preachers through their consistent and pure lives of the Gospel, and adorn the doctrine of God our Savior! C. W. Tillett, Esq., offered the follow ing sensible and wise resolution which was unanimously adopted by a rising vote: Whereas, The provisions of our law are such tnat those of our judges and so- licitors who faithfully discharge the du ties of their ofhees are often compelled to violate the Holy Sabbath in traveling from one court to another, therefore be it Resolved, 1st. That we urge the Gener al Assembly of North Carolina so to amend the law as that sufficient time may be giv en between the terms of the courts to al low the officers to go from one point to another without traveling on Sunday. Resolved, 2d. That the Secretary of this Conference transmit a copy of these resolction to the Governor of our State with the request that he embody in his next message to the Legislature a recom mendation that the law be amended in accordance with the first resolution. Mr. Tillett made a ringing speech in favor of the adoption of the report, and of the necessity of making a change He spoke of the enforced violation of the sab bath by our Judges and Solicitors as a disgrace to the laws of the State. He wanted to give them a fair chance of get ting to heaven with other men. I am sure that the Governor will be glad to re commend a change in the law and that the Legislature will hasten to give our judi cial officers this chance. The bill ought to be entitled "An Act to Give Judges and Solicitors a Fair Chance of Getting to Heaven." TRINITY BANQUET.

GAIN IN MEMBERSHIP. Mr. Branson also gives me the state ment that from all the churches in the Conference there has been a gain of 10,739 members in the past year. This ia a very large gain and shows how faithful and zealous the ministers have been during the past year. THE DIVISION. The General Conference was memorial ized to grant all the territory in this State to the N. C. Conference, and then to set off the Western N. C. Conference. If all cannot be transfered, then the East or the West are asked for. The General Conference will fix tha dividing line TRINITY MOVED TO RALEIGH, j The greatest question before the Confer ence was 4 Shall we move Trinity College?" The Trustees met on Saturday night and all of them except two voted to accept Raleigh's proposition. Raleigh's last pro position is: To erect a handsome building of three stories (according to the plans ex hibited by President Crowellj and to furnish a site of twelve acres. The erec tion of this building will cost $34,000 or $35,000. The site has already been gen erously donated by Mr. Wm. Boylan, and is admirably suited for tne purposes or college grounds. It has a fine growth of young trees upon it. On Monday after President Crowell had explained the proposition and exhibited the plans of the building, Jno. W. Mauney, Esq., of Salis bury, offered the following resolution: "Resolved, 1st. That the Board of Trus tees of Trinity College be, and it is hereby authorized and directed to move Trinity College to the city of Raleigh when the citizens of said city shall have erected on the site designated and known as the Boy lan lot the building proposed and agreed to be built by them, provided that before said College is moved as aforesaid there shall be made, executed and delivered to said trustees a good and su fficient deed in fee simple with proper covenants of war ranty and seizin, conveying the lot and site designated, to said trustees and their successors in office for the use and benefit of the North Carolina Conference Method ist, Episcopal Church, South, as it now ex ists, and for the use and benefit of such Conferences as may be hereafter created by the M. E. Church, South, out of the territory now covered by said Conference, and for the use and benefit of such Con ferences as may be hereafter created by the M. E Church, South, out of any ter ritory within the State of North Carolina. Resolved, 21. That all vacancies on the Board of Trustees of Trinity College shall be filled by the North Carolina Confer ence till it is divided, and when divided, by such Conferences as shall be created, as provided iu the foregoing resolution, beginning with the Conference furtherest east, and that Conference filling one and the next to it filling one and the Confer ence next to it filling one," aud so on, till each Conference has filled one, and then again the same way ia turn." Upon this resolution there was long, animated and earnest discusser. The opponents of removal were present with their war-paint on. lhey spoke earnestly aud well. They were terribly in earnest, and believed thoroughly that they were right in opposing removal. The leading speakers against removal were Rev. C. M Pfi'i'ER, Rev. W. C. Gannon, and Prof. J. F. Heitman, who is a member of the faculty of Ttinitv College. That thev . . t 1.- ! i i v.. m ..-.n bear me out in saying. At the request of the Conference, President Crowell spoke in favor of removal. I regret that I can not print his speech. It was a magnifi cent erf rt. He rose to the height of the great occasion and spoke with an irresista b!e and convincing power. No argument could withstand his logic and his faith. He is a man who is destined to take high rauk. He has nerve, courage, convic tions. He believes in himself and his plans, and he is an indefatigable worker. He will make Trinity College a great suc cess in Kaleigh, and l'rmity Academy in Randolph, under his plans, will be a flour ishing classical Academy. After President Crowell's speech the vote was taken. It was For Removal 141 Against Removal 41 Majority for R.m jval 100. This ojens a new career for Trinity. Its friends will now bury all division and pull together to make it a great and and a suc cessful American College, the equal of any in the South. If all the friends of the College co-operate wi:h President Crow ell nothing will b wanting to place Trin ity in the front ranks. It is piobable that some legislation will I be needed before the Col'ege can be re moved. A committee, composed of Presi dent Crowell, Justice Walter Clark, an.iJ. W. Mauney, Esy , was appointed to secure any needed legislation. 

DELEGATES ELECTED. The el. etion of delegates to the General Conference eliui-ed much interest. The nvx' it i. era! Conference wil; iu all proba bility divide the conference and eleit new Bishops. The division of the conference made it important that a strong delega tion be elected. The following are the lay delegates elected after a number of ballots: Donald W. Bain, of Raleigh; Du B. F. Dixon, of Oxford; Julian S. Carr, of Durham; J A. Odfll, of Greensboro; D. B. Nicholson, of Clinton; and J. A. Mauney, of Salisbury." Tho alter nates elected were JUSTICE WaL tf.r Clark, cf the Supreme Coin! bench; '"or,. A. C. Davis, of La Grange; aud Mr. R. R Crawford, of Winston. This is a fine delegation of representative North Carol in-t Methodists, aud they are well distiibtited throughout the State. It would have been impossible to have chosen wiser men, or men who better represent the progressive spirit of Methodist laymen. The following are the preachers elected : Rev. Jno. R Brooks, D. I) , Rev. J. A. CUNMNGGIM. RFV. W. S. BLACK, D. D. , Rev. Frank L. Reid, editor Raleigh Christian Advocate, Rev. Y. A. Sfiarpe, Rev. H. T. Hudson. D. D., Rev J. E. Mann, D I)., and Rev. F. D. Swindell. Key. Jno R Brooks leads the delegation, having received. t: e largest vote cast. He received 38 more votes on the first ballot than any one else a compliment unprece dented. He is the biggest man (he weighs about 275 or 300 pounds) in the confer once. The following are the three alter nates elected: Rev. E. A. Yates, 1). D., Rev. W. U. Moofe, and Re G. W". Iey. Bishop Hargrove preached in West Market Street Methodist Church Sunday morning to a packed church. He is a hands me man and a fine presiuing offi cer. His sermon was on the charaeter of Judas in the lessons drawn from it. It was a clear, logical, lucid discourse and greatly pleased most of the people. I heard not a few level-headed laymen and preachers pronounce it a great sermon. I did not so regard it. It was a good ser mon, but not a geat one. It had little uplifting power in it, and less of what old fashioned Methodists call unction. It did not command that deep interest which a 2REAT sermon commands. It may be that having recently heard Bishop Wilson preach two of the greatest and ablest ser mons I ever heard, I was not competent to judge the effort. Certainly it did not measure up to the two sermons Bishop Wilson receutly preached in Raleigh. But a man miht prea; h a great and grand sermon, aud still might fall far short of that eminent and profound theologian. After the sermon a class of thirteen dea cons were ordiined. The service was most impressive. Sunday afternoon, at Westminister Presbyterian church. I heard an excellent sermon by Rev. C. W. Byrd, of Salisbury, on the character of Ruth It was ele gant, earnest and eloquent, and was well received. He is one of thj brainiest oF the younger divines iu th-j Conference, and is destined to hold high position in the church. Westminister church is a model little church iu South Greensboro, which was built about two years ago by the Presbyterians. Its pas tor, Re'. E W. Smith, (son of the distin guished Rev. J. Hanky Smith, D. D., is a man of marked force, and will in course of time receive the manf,Ie from his ven erable father. God grant that the old Presbyterian divine will long be spared! Messrs. S. T.

A big Sunday School Mass Meet ng was held Sunday afternoon at the Centenary Methodist church. Several addresses were delivered. I hear that ot Rev. I). H.
