We ere glad of this in formation of the precise location of these Indi ana regiments, as their friends will know where to address them, and forward them the necessaries and luxuries they can spare for their comfort. Gr.. Sherman A correspondent of the Cincinnati Gazette, writing from Frankfort, Ky., says: The insanity of Brigadier General Wm. T. Sherman, lately commanding in Kentucky, has been a matter of quuti secret gossip for some time, but it u the desire to keep it out of the papers. As this desire had failed to be realized, I deemed it proper to telegraph last night that the atones ot his having been "stark mad at times while commanding in Kentucky," wer ex aggeratious. His insanity was not clearly de veloped until his arrival at SexLilm, bot he was all the time despondent while in Kentucky; was the victim of hallucinations, and ,ppear. clearly to have been gradually sinking into his present mournful condition. Dr. Elijah Newland, of New Albany, has received the contract to supply the army at Cairo rann nana The 49th Indiana, Colonel J. W. Ray, left Camp Joe Holt, on Wednesday, fur the seat of war. Calks B. Smith ox Arming the Slaves In his speech at the Prentice dinner at Washing ton, Hon. Caleb B. Smith, Secretary of the In terior, said of the Cochrane Cameron proposition to arm the slaves: Putting arm into slaves' hands! If this be attempted to any extent, the whole world will cry out against our inhumanity , our aavxagery, and the sympathies of all mankind will he turned against us, as they were against the blacks, that murdered and drove the French fwm Hayti. And, if it he attempted, the soldiers in the army from Southern Indiana, Southern Illinois, afl Maryland, Kentucky, Delaware, Pennsylvania, nearly all, and from New York south of the Erie Canal, with the strong regiments from New Jersey, will, before God. protest being thus put on au equality with negro soldier in their ranks. '. Dr. S. J. Young, of Terre Haute, is now an Assistant Surgeon in the United States Hospital at Mound City, near Cairo. Lee Yarvan, a Lieutenant in the 19th Indi ana, has been appointed Adjutant of the 58th In diana. Col. Orr. w Indiana adds nine regimenta to our already large army in Kentucky, this week. This will leave only eight regiments in this State yet to be filled. A correspondent of the Cincinnati Cominrr ciol, writing from Baltimore under date of De cember 7th, says: The 21 st Indiana has returned from the East ern Shore expedition, coTerud with laurels and lice, having pissed through the many dangers and vic -situdes of that bloody campaign without the loss ot a single man. The Graxu Army of thk Usiox. y a comparison of the list of Federal troops now in the field, from the several States, with the tables of population, it is found that the number from Illinois is about five per cent ; that is. about five men in every hundred in Illinois are now in arms for the defense of the Union. Indiana has one in twenty two, Kansas one in twenty -three, and these States lead all the rest in this respect. Little Rhode Island heads the list of older Suites on these-u.ord, she having contributed one man in 24. HoLLixs's Gunboat. The celebrated batter ing ram, or "turtle," from New Orleans, passed Memphis on the 4th inst., for Columbus, Ken tucky. How tuet get Nicws. It is said that the officers of the blockading fleet at New Orleans receive late news by bottle express floated down tne Mississippi, which some of their Union friend? ,n New Orleans and up the Mississippi send down to them, sealed. The new Campaigx in Kentucky. There are decided indications ot a concentration tor a forward movement in Kentucky. General John son's brigade has advanced to Green river, and other brigades are under orders to move. The weather is exceedingly favorable lor operations, and we hope soon to be able to announce a de cisive blow in '.he direction of the rebel rotary capital. Cin. Gazrite. General W. T. Sherman's Misfortune. The ComtRrrcial states that it has intelligence, which it can not discredit, that General W. T. Sherman, late commander of the Kentucky De partment, is insane. Symptoms which excited notice during bis administration in Kentucky, have at length developed into a decided type. This disarms all censure of his management and all criticisms upon his ability, and excites sym palhy in their stead. Cin. Gazette. Capt. Geisendorf, of company "H," 20th Indiana, has resigned, and, we understand, ar rived at home. The Battle or Fredericktown. We have the official report of this battle, fought in Mis souri on the 21st of October, 1861, before us. The 24th Indiana, Colonel Hovey , and the 1 st Indiana cavalry, Colonel Baker, figured in the engagement. It was in this battle that two of Indiana's noblest sons Major Gavitt and Cap tain High man fell. The rout of the enemy was complete. Their force under the rebel com r ander Thompson, was about four thousand i men. Their loss was very great. One hundred ami fifty-eight of their dead were buried by our j troops, ami many other bodies afterward found. There wese taken on the field eighty prisoners. Our loss was six killed and sixty wounded. Cols. Hovey and Baker fiarticularly distinguished themselves in this buttle. The Cincinnati Gazette, a Republican Anti Administration print, holds forth, in its yester day's issue, m follows: tj j fir Upon the Bull Run disaster our army officers generally look the benefit of the irresponsible or baby act. There is no military responsibility for tl;e movement-- of our armies. Everything was charged upon the people or the press, not only in tne past, but the account was to be made cfver uuViroited incompetency in the future From this it came tobe regarded in the military m,"d as the hrst duly ot a General to resist in flexibly all pressure lor a forward movement 1 his was to be the prof of the greatest gener alship. The country having 1 oen damaged in reputa tion by the responsibility for one unfortunate ad vance, was supposed to be under continued iof picion of desiring a forward movement and an Hctive prosecution of ...e war Consequent! the first thing tor onr Generals to do to inspire the confidence of the country, on taking com mand, was to declare solemnly- that neither the : people, the politicians nor the press should 'bree them to advance before their time This is ac icepted as proof of the greatest military quali ties, which are enhanced in proportion as this in ertia is protracted. We have unfavorable news from the 7th In diana, Col. Gavin, now in Western Yirginia. Sickness to an alarming extent is pre vailing in the camp We are informed that of the volunteers from Decatur county in this regiment, several have died and their corpses have arTived at home. Seventeen private soldiers of the French ar my, in Bonaparte's time, by their bravery and talents, raised themselves to the following dis ttagnished stations: Two became kings, two Prmet. nine Dukes, two Field Marshals and two Generals. Gea. Bueil's army approaches a total of 10 ,000 men. It is every way, the finest as it is the largest army in the field under one com tnander, excepting the force under Gen. McClel Ian on the Potomac. The average number of letters received for the to Idlers at the Washington postoffrce is 45,-1 000 a day, making an aggregate of 90,000 envel opes and sheets of paer a day . rO.MittWMO.ll.

Mr. Johnson of Tennessee, moved that so much of the President's message as refers to a railroad to Western Ky., and Tennessee, be re ferred to a select committee. Motion agreed to. The 8enate went into executive session and upon the opening of the doors adjourned to Monday. 

HOUSE. Mr. Blair, of Missouri, rising to a question of privilege, caused to be read the fol low. ng extract as further explanatory ofa the re marks which h'j made yesterday ou Mr. Lovejoy V reception, having in view the reservation ol a part of Geu. Halleck's general order relative to ! fugitives. The resolution, !t has already been stated, was laid on the table: Headol arters Dkpaetkknt of Missouri To j Hon. T. P. Blair: Yours of the 4th inst. is just received. Order No 3 was, in my mind, merely a military necessity. Unauthorized persons, ' black or white, free or slave, must be kept out of j our camp, unless we are willing to publish to the . enemy everything we oo or intend to ao it was a military and not a political order. I am ready- to carry out any lawful instructions in regard to I fugitive slaves which my snperi u s may give me. j and to enforce any law which Congress may pass; but I can not make law, and will not violate it. You know my private opinion on the policy of confiscating the slave property of rebels in arms If Congress shall pass it, you may be certain that I ahull enforce it. Perhaps my policy as to the treatment of rebels and their property is as well set out in order No. 13, issued the day before your letter was written, as I could now describe It. Yours truly, H. W. Halleck. Mr. Lovejoy replied, and, in conclusion, said If any soldier want to fight simply for the pur pose of returning fugitive slaves, he had only to remark that the army would be stronger without them. Mr. Blair of Missouri, from the Committee on Military Affairs, reported a bill authorizing the raising ofa volunteer force for the better defense of Kentucky. Mr. Wyckliffe, who several days ago introduced the bill, proceeded to show the importance of passing it. Kentucky, he said, was to be the great battle ground of this war; the people of that State hoped soon to see the day when the invader's foot would be expelled from their territory which is now invaded. Property has been ruthlessly de stroyed or carried off. Hundreds have lieen made desolate, bridges burned, 4c, and it is to protect the State while the army is marching elsewhere that the volunteer force is needed. Mr. Wickliffe also said that he had received from the Military Board of Kentucky au urgent application to call on the War Department and a.-k for just such a corps as the bill provide!. He had brought the subject to the attention of the President and Secretary of War, and it met not only with their approval but that of all the Cab inet. Mr. Maynard spoke of a recent sojourn in the part of Kentucky so much ravaged and laid waste by the rebel troops, and would allude at some fu ture time to the distressing condition of affairs in Eastern Tennessee, which, he said, he alone had the honor to represent. His people, he said, had been left unprotected by the Qoi ernment, notwithstanding their firm devotion lc the Union. He held it to be a duty not only to protect loyal men in Teunessee and Kentucky but in South Carolina and every where as much as in Pennsylvania and the adjoining States. Further consideration of this bill was postponed till Monday. The House proceeded to the consideration of the special orders, namely, the various proposi tions involving question of emancipating persons held as slaves by the rebels. From Western Virginia. Cheat Moi-stain, Dec. 14. On yesterday one of the hardest and best fought battles of the war took place at Alleghany Camp, Pocahontas county. General K. H. Milroy commanding the Union troops, and General Johnson of Georgia commanding the rebels. The fight lasted from daylight till 3 o'clock in the afternoon. The Union loss is about 30. while that of the rebels is over 200 killed, including a Major and many other officers, and 30 prisoners. Gen. Johnson was shot in the mouth but not fatally. The 12th Georgia regiment suffered the most. Milroy's force numbered 750 men from the 9th and 13th Indiana, the 25th and 32d Ohio, and the 2d Virginia. Johnson's force numbers over 2,000. The 9th Indiana fought bravely to the last. After driving the enemy into their barracks five times, our forces retired in good order. The rebels set fire to their camp, and retreated to Staunton. Gen. Milroy has driven the last rebel army out of Western Virginia. Kentucky IVew. Louisville, Dec. 14. Capt. Lee's expedition returned here from Jacksonville bringing two prisoners.

The Federals replied with two volleys, wounding several, whom the cavalry carried off ana returned. Federals were unhurt. New York. New York, Dec. 14. Official account of-Col. Brown, of the fight at Fort Pickens, mentions the fact that he considers it useless for vessels to be armed with other than rifled guns, and speaks in the highest commendation of the performance of his Parrott guns. The Time dispatch Utes that rebel deserters say that 75,000 rebels were preparing, with four days' rations, for an advance in three lines from Centreville. Detachments sent towards Fairfax, however, discovered no enemy. The Bermuda Royal Gazrite of the 3d inst., has the following, relative to the escape of the Sumter: On the morning of the 25th ult the Iroquois astonished the St. Thomas folks by dropping into the harbor and reporting that on a dark and pn,ually night the Sumter had slipped through the fingers of the D ikotah and Iroquois and gone no one knows where. The escape is vnriously accounted for. According to one ncconnt a French war steam er came out of St. Thomas during the night, anil the Iroquois -rnve chase mid wlen day lieht came the latter discovered his mistake, but meanwhile the Sumter had stolen sway and neither the Dacotah or Iroquois could give any account of her. v Suiid.iY XU lit Dispatches. nlumrl V.ivt.

The rebel Captain Sweeny and sixty-three other Secession prisoners reached here atst uighl. From Wheeling. Wheeling. Dec. 15. The Convention ha dis posed of the boundary question. They include, unconditionally, in addition to the thirtytuiiie counties included bv the of the August Convention, the counties of Pi Ik ntas. Green Buer. Morgan. Merwor, and Mc Donald. They also 'ak in Hampshire, Berkley. J efferent, Pendleton ami Frederick, on the con dition that a majority of the votes cast ist the district ami a majority of 'J comities composing it exnress themselves iu favor of coming in at the election to be held on a day appointed by the Legislature. This attempt to extend the boundary is regard ed by some as an endeavor to embarrass the prog ress of the new State. The Convention was yesterday discaesing a section relating to treason against the State. Mr. Van Winkle of Wood raised the issue that there could be no such tiling as treason against a State. There was one clause making it treason to speak, write, publish or circulate anything to uphold invasion or insurrection during the con tinuance of the same. This clause will probably be expunged. Mr. Ballett of Ohio county introduced a propo sition prohibiting the importatian of slaves, mak ing it the duty of the Legislature to regulate in a humane manner the family relations of slave- and ; providing that after a certain date involuntary ! -ervitude,. except tor crime, within the new State, I shall cease. Keferred to a committee. The discussion on this will robably begin some time next week. From it v In iik i on. Washington-, Dec. 14.

The speech was made by Speaker Grow, and the flag was received, in behalf of the regiment, by H. D. Kelly ol Philadelphia. The eloquent ad' dress was listened to b a large audience. The grounds were tastefully adorned and ample pro visions provided for ail military as well as the civilians present. From Kaltimore. Baliuiobk, Dec. 15. We learn l'rom the Cap- I tain of the Norfolk tha. he was informed by the j Captain of the steamer Illinois, six miles off Charleston harbor, at 10 o'clock Thursday night, j that a tremendous conflagration was evidently at ! its height in that city. 1 be reflection on the clouds exceeded anything lie ever saw, and the who lenity , with the dark outlines of Fort Sum ter, was brightly illuminated. It did not appear like a , wfiecn n from smouldering ruins, but an uncontrollable conflagration. This is later than the Norfolk Day Book' dis patch. Later from nrope. Halifax, Dec. 15 The Royal mail steamer Europa has arrived at this port with highly im portant intelligence. She waa detained at Quecnstown till the 3d by order of tb,e Government. , She has the Queen's message on board for Lord Lyons. Lokdox, Dec. 1. The Observer states that the Government has demanded from President Lin coln and his Cabinet the restoration of the per sons of the Southern envoys to the British Gov ernment. Yesterday afternoon after 5 o'clock Her Majes ty held a private counsel at Windsor Castle. Three of her Ministers, including the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretary of State, were transferred from London to Windsor by special train to be present. Previous to leaving town, the three ministers had attended a Cabinet Council at Lord Paliuer ston's official residence. The Observer also says: A special messenger of the foreign office has beeu ordered to carry to Washington the demands of the British Government for Lord Lyons, and will proceed to-day to Queenstown. The public w ill be satisfied to know that these demands are for an apology, and to insist on the return of those' who were thus violently taken frcm that sacred asylum. The Observer adds there is no reason why they should not be restored to the quarter deck of the British Admiral at New York or Wash ington, in the face of some ten or twelve men of ; war, whose presence in the Potomac would render the blustering Cabinet at Washington as helpless as the Trent was befoie the guns and cutlasses of the San Jacinto. It is no fault of ours if it should come even to this. The arrangements for increasing the force iu Canada are not yet complete, but in a very few hours everything will lie settled. In the mein time a large ship, the Melbourne, has beeu taken up and is now being loaded with Armstrong guns, and some 80,000 Enfield rifles, ammunition and other stores at Woolwich. It is not impossible that this vessel will be es corted by one or two sl.ips of war. The rifles are intended for the Canada military, and a strong reinforcement of field artillery will be dispatched forthwith. The Times's city article of the 30th sayg the position of the Federal States of America is al most identical in every commercial point with that which was occupied towards us by Russia be fore the Crimean war. Russia had a hostile tariff, while we look to her for a large portion of our general supply of breadstuff's, for there is this peculiarity in our present case that the commence ment would Ire by the breaking of the blockade of the Southern ports, at once setting free our in dustry from the anxiety of cotton famine and giving sure prosperity to Lancashire through the winter; at the same time we shall open our trade to f? ,000 ,000 in the Confederate States who desire nothing better than to become free customers. At the Privy Council on Saturday an order was issued prohibiting the export from the United Kingdom, or carrying coastwise, gunpowder, salt pelre. nitrate of soda and brimstone. The Timet has no hope that the Federal Gov ernment will comply with the demands of Eng land. The Morning Star declares that the statement of instructions having been sent to Lord Lyons to obtain the restitution of the Confederate Com missioners or to take leave of Washington, was premature and so exaggerated as to be virtually untrue. The Liverpool Courier believes that the War rior has been ordered to Annapolis with the ulti matum ot the Government. The steamer Jura arrived out on the 28th. The London Timet, in alluding to the decision of the Cabinet, says that the nrrest of Maso i and Slidell is a clear violation of the law of nations. and believes that Lord Lvons will be instructed by the first steamer to demand reparation. If not complied with, he will be instructed to with draw the Legalon from Washington. Liverpool, Dec. 2. The steamer Persia has arrived here. Breadstuff's are flat and all qualities have de clined, slightly influenced by the hope of a peace ful solution of the San Jacinto affair. Lotno, Dec. 2 - Consols for monev are quoted atU292J,. American securities have an upward tendency and rates slightlv advanced. Cape Race. Dec. 15 The steamer City of ; Washington pafsei here at 11 o'clock this morn with ri.c& hv te'pr rnnh to the 5th inst in 'The shiD Ladv Franklin, from London for New York, put into Plymouth on the 3d inet She took fire on the same night and was scuttled So extinguish the frames. Some Soather.ters ship ped among her ciew and one was suspected of tiring her. The steamer Australasian has been chartered I to convey troops, and i battery of artillery is to sail on the 12th mst. It is stated that the steamer James Adger had I captured a privateer off Fayal on the 1 ah ult towing the prise into that port. This is evident ly a canard, as the James Aflger arrived at .Bal timore some time since. The San Jacinto affair monopolised the atteu tion of Ihe press, who denounce fc in strong terms, and active naval preparations are making. The latest by telegraph to Queenstown to the 5th says the excitemeut iannabated. The Pfris Tempt repeats the statement that Napoleon has tendered his service ns a mediator. It was rumored that the steamer Persia had been chart e-ed to convey troops to Canada, but Ibis is jironounrcd premature. The steamer Australasian was advertised to sail for New York on the 4th, but the America was substituted.
