BRYAN AGAIN THE LEADER Roosevelt Alienates Jefferson Demo- crats by Japanese Attitude CHICAGO, Dec —The democrats predict a political upheaval as the re sult of Roosevelt's treatment of the Japanese situation and they say Bry an's chance is heightened. Heretofore it was thought that Roocevelt was more of a Jefferson democrat than a republican, but they now regard the threat to send troops to San Francisco as alienating him forever from con sideration in the same class with Jef ferson and reinstating Bryan as the unequivocal leader of the democratic hosts. Sydney Vanwick, Jr., of San Fran cisco, here says, "Bryan never, arro gated to the federal government any thing half so radical. Naturally the people turn to Bryan and the demo cratic party which does not inter fere with the sovereignty of states." COLLIERS GET BOOMERANG.

WAR BO6IES ARE ROUTED "Teapot Tempest" Has Spent Its Force and the "Big Stick" Is Still Unbending. WASHINGTON, Dec. 6— After stirring up the country, giving the ex citable ones food for expression the war cloud of 1906 is dissipated leaving only the rumbling of a court case in California. The officials most concern ed regard the whole thing as a "tem pest in a teapot." It Is not considered that there was justification for the talk it caused, to say nothing of the serious talk by members of congress anent the ghost of state's rights. Those having the views of the president on Japanese think he could have appeased them by less advanced declarations. California congressmen who talked almost continuously for three days were thought to be talking for home consumption. At the same time they were serious In the contention that Japanese coolies must be excluded in the same way as Chinese coolies are. 

GIRL SUES; WEDS ANOTHER. Former Minnesota University Pro- fessor Marries Belle. FORT DODGE, la., Dec. 6.— W. H. Lippold, former professor of botany at the University of Minnesota, and Miss Alma Robinson of this city, were married here at 8 o'clock last even ing, regardless of the fact that Lip pold had just been given notice of a breach of promise suit against him, in which Miss Emma Heilman of Chicago is the plaintiff.

IMPORT GIRL WORKERS. Owners of Cotton Mills of Carolina May Be Arrested. PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Dec. Wholesale arrests of cotton mill own ers throughout North Carolina on charges of importing more than 1,000 girls from England and Ireland to take the places of American laborers are expected within a week. An nouncement was made to this effect today at the local immigration office, following a rigid probe by Inspector McLaughlin, acting under instructions from Commossioner of Immigration Sargent. It is contended that the alien con tract labor act has been violated by members of the Mercantile club of Charlotte, N. C. an organization com posed of mill owners. Two months ago the steamship Noordland brought forty girls, destin ed for Charlotte. They were de tained by the immigration authorities pending an investigation as to their future homes. All declared they had come to this country of their own vo lition, having learned there was work for millworkers in the south. Although examined closely all told the same story! The similarity or tne answers aroused the suspicions of Commissioner Rodgers, so he decided to detain the girls. At this juncture the secretary of the Mercantile club of Charlotte put in an appearance. He succeeded in landing the girls. Commissioner Rodgers permitted this, because it had been shown the girls were to be provided with homes and because it would give him an opportunity to investigate con ditions in the places where the girls were to be taken. t Inspector McLaughlin discovered much alien labor in North Carolina and found that the wages are great ly below the average paid American labor. DEPEW GROWS JOVIAL Snubs and Slurs Have No Curbing Ef fect on Chauncey. WASHINGTON, Dec. s.—Senator Depew, ruddy complexloned and com pletely restored to health, sat in his library in dinner dress sipping his af ter dinner coffee and discussed his waning popularity. "For the fifty years that I was on the stump in politics, beginning with the campaign of '56 I had nothing but praise and flattery from the press; for the last two years nothing but unlimited abuse, I am curious to know how long it will take for the abuse to reduce the gratification and swelling of the head induced by fifty years reduction already, con sidering that the forces are operating in the ratio of 50 to 2." The senator discussed political ques. tions, and said that the feeling of un rest was growing. "Hughes was the Ainly man who could have beaten Hearst. Roosevelt is the only man the republicans can certainly elect in 1908. The people trust in him to carry out the reforms and the conser vative element fear him less than any other man who might be elected on a redical platform." Depew believes Roosevelt was honest in his declara tion that he would not run again in 1908, but that there would be condi tions under which he could not refuse. Senator Depew favors the inherit ance tax. "The people want it," saiJ he. "When Sir William Harcourt put through the interitance tax in Great Britain he was criticized for taking from the portion of widows and or phans. Harcourt replied that there were lots of people willing to take the inheritance less the tax." The income tax is different. The su preme court has declared it unconsti tutional and congress would be slow to pass a law in face of the court's decision. Senator Depew said he favored the Philippine tariff.
