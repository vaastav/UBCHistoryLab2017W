In his most-sanguine hopes, Presi dent Wilson could hardly have ex pected to put lluerta in an American prison, out there he is. 8 E. Crans, state lire marshal, an nounces that unless certain property owners destroy property which has been condemned, he will start action against them in the circuit court. The Huron postoflice primary among th' democrats of that city will be held on Dec 15, according to an nouncement made by C. W. IIocli stettler, Beadle county chairman. The half billion dollar loan made by England and France is to be paid back in a hundred years. Here's hoping that their memory is good even unto the fourth and fifth gener ations. Pone Benedict's allocution to the consistory of cardinals contained a stirrinsr appeal for eaily peace. The council announced the appointment of Bishop Joseph Busch, formerly of Lead, 8 D., to St.. Cloud, Minnesota. Within the national forest bound aries are some 21 million acres in pri vate ownership, consisting of lands granted or taken up for one purpose or another before the forests were created or of homestead entries made since. Meyer London of New York, the only socialist'' member in congress, who preferred to be taken care of by the democrats in the committee as signment rather than the republicans was given memberships of the labor committee as he had asked. The poor packers are to be pittied. Their plea generally is that they only make three or four per cent on their iuvestment, and they usually get away with the talk. But now comes the announcement that the Cudahys will cut, a big Christmas melon of •S2,000,000, which amounts to OS per cant on the capital stock. Without much delay, the jury that tried the Mam burg-American steam ship company's officers found four of them guilty of violating the laws of the United States in shipping sup plies to German cruisers from ports of the United States. The maximum penalty is two years imprisonment and §l(i,()oO line in each case. Garrett Fort, general passenger agent of the Union Pacific, points out that the railroads of the United States demonstrated their faith in newspaper advertising by spending $10,000,000 for newspaper space in the last tiscal year. Incidentally, he might have added, some of them got a whole lot of space which they would rather not have had. The United States ambassador to London has protested against the British habit of taking the vessels of this nation whenever it sees lit. The troubles of the past between the United States aud England have been largely caused by its interference with the ship-ping and the sailors of this country. England cannot break with its old habits. There is considerable comment over the state just at the present time as to the numerous deaths or disabil ity caused by paralysis. The comment is along the line of whether there is any particular reason for this pre valence at this time, or whether it '•just happens" that there are numer ous cases without any special reason for the happening. Dakota Republican: The Lester ville Ledger is of the opinion that it will not be long before it will be im possible to tell a republican from a democrat or vice versa. And a con tinuation of the story might include the statement that at no distant date it will be bard to distinguish a demo crat or a republican from a prohi bitionist—or vice yersa. The total mileage of railroad lines now in the hands pf receivers is 11,988, or a little more than one-sixth of the total mileage of the country. The capitalization of these lines is $2,264,000,000. The question of pres ent condition of the roads is whether their ills are due to geueral business coalitions, too much legislation or e&ceesive capitalization. X*, 

PIERRE. SOUTH DAKOTA. THURSDAY. DECEMBER 9, 1915 1 CONGRESSMAN GANDY'S COMMITTEE ASSINGMENTS Washington, D. C\, Dec. 0. -At the democratic caucus Saturday Con gressman Gaudy of South Dakota re ceived the following committee as signments: lidian affairs, public lands, irrigation of arid lands, and railways and canals. CLARK ELECTED SPEAKER Washington, I). C.,Dec. (i. -Champ Clark was reelected speaker, 221 to 191. In a speech Mr. Clark predict ed that a press of legislation would force perpetual sessions. RUSSIANS MENACE BULGARIA Huron lluronite: Last week it was vaguely announced that the Russians had entered Bulgaria. It was stated that this movement would have afar reaching ell'ect on the Bulgarian situ ation and upon ail the Balkan affairs. There must have been something in the report. Today's dispatches say the Germans are rushing troops to Iiustchuck, on the Bulgarian side of the Danubian boundary between Bulgaria and Rumania, to repel a movement of Russian troops. Germany is reported to be weaken ing its France-Flanders line to procure artillery with which to contest the Russian advance aud meet a concen tration of Rumanian troops. At what point, on the Black sea coast these Russians landed has not, been stated, except that it has been indefinitely said that they were ex pected to use the Danube for a trans portation route. They are headed direct for Bulgaria and that their movement is important is indicated by the German haste to counteract it. With the Russians moving south westerly through Bulgaria and the French-British Serbian troops mov southeastwardly through Bulgaria to meet them, there is likely to be some stir in the neighborhood of the meet ing point. PUNISHMENT NOT REVENGE The elimination of the revenge I theory frwm punishment in schools, and even in some prisons, is proof of progress in this amazing hour. In the schools children are being made to understand that punishment is not revenge, and in a sense not even pen alty, but is "chastisement" in the literal meaning of the word. It is necessary instruction in right con duct. The boy made to stay after school to be interviewed by the teach er is assured that it is a benefit to him, not a harm, and not a reprisal. He is having actually an added privi lege, an extra gift of the teacher's time and attention. This is truly making discipline what it should be, aud relating the noun to the word disciple, which means a young learn er. The disciplined child or man, then, is in the act made a young learner. TO OLD AND BETTER Yes, an election was held in the city on Friday last, and 114 citizens took this opportunity to express themselves as between the commis sion form of government and the council plan. Just 297 of them voted in favor of returning to their first love, that of eight aldermen and a mayor, while only ll7evinced a desire to continue the five commissioners. It was rather a one sided affair, with the majority totaling 180. Vermil lion Plain Talk. LADEN WITH BEANS Copenhagen, Dec. 3.—The Ameri can steamer Andrew Welch is being held in the harbor of Haelmsted by Swedish torpedo boats for an unsuc cesl'ul attempt to proceed to Ger many, according to dispatches here. The American steamer eluded Brit ish warships and arrived with a val uable cargo of beans. FORTY-NINE ARE FOR IT New York, N. Y., Dec. 6.—Former Presidents Taft and Roosevelt, the governors of twenty-one states, three former American ambassadors and twenty-six other prominent Ameri cans are agreed that preparedness should be the paramount issue before congress and that the policy of the government should not become a par ty issue. Their opinions were gath ered and published today in a sym posium by the New York World. Mr. Roosevelt denounced emphatically the "half measures" proposed by the administration's preparedness pro gram. Mr. Taft advised that party lines be abandoned in considering preparedness. it aSi- gfW" 'v 

ANOTHER RAIL LINE Mitchell, Dec. V. "It never rains but it pours." This is what the peo ple between Mitchell ana Pierre are thinking because of the announce ment that another road has been in corporated to be built between the two towns. The new road is incor porated, has tiled plats and has asked for a permit to build from the state railway commission, under the name of the South Dakota Western Bail way company. In railway circles this is known as the Bruce and Fel ton project, because C. W. Felton, of Sioux City, traveling freight and passenger agent for the Milwaukee road, and William L. Bruce of the firm of Bruce Land company, of Yankton, are the incorporators and promoters. 1( is generally considered, because of the connection of Mr. Felton with the Milwaukee road, that the new line is a Milwaukee project and is an ellort to defeat the construction of the Dakota & Southwestern road, re cently incorporated. BANK GUARANTY LAW The state bank guaranty commis sion was in session in Pierre Tuesday for the purpose of deciding what state banks are in condition to do business under the bank guaranty act which goes into effect January 1. After that date depositors in state banks will be protected against loss of deposits by bank failure through the creation of a fond from which they will be reimbursed in case of the insolvency of banks in which their monev is placed. The commission will probably be in session throughout most of the month of December making a list of state banks entitled to do business under the new act. PAPER HOUSE BURNED St. Paul. Dec. tt.—A loss of $200, 000 caused by a tire which destroyed the four-story brick building of the Leslie Paper company and partially destroyed the Barrett it Barrett Co. building adjoining. LOUIS N. ULREY Louis N. Ulrey, one of the pioneer residents of Pierre, passed away at his home in East l'ierre Saturday morning, following a stroke of par alysis, which he suffered on Wednes day of last week. Mr. Ulrey had been about the city as usual and after going to his home early in the evening complained of dizziness, which proved to be paraly sis, and his condition continued to grow worse until death summoned him home. The deceased was born in Ohio in 1849, where he resided until a young man, when he took up his residence in Iowa. He moved to Ree Heights, this state, in 1882, later corning to the Capital, where he had since resided. Besides a wife and one daughter, Miss Hazel, the deceased leaves one sister and two brothers. The funeral was held from the fam ily home Monday afternoon. Inter ment was made at Riverside ceme tery. It iK the season of poaco on ouo hemisphere at loast. x. s. .**£ 5 :arLl 1 

ABSTRACTORS AT HURON The South Dakota Abstractors as sociation wiil hold its annual meet ing at Huron December 14-15 and an interesting program has been pre pared for the gathering at which the attendance usually runs from fifty to seventy live. H. J. Gieson of Aber deen is president of the association L. L. Goldsmith, Fort Pierre, vice president C. E. Noel, Jlighmore, secretary-treasurer. The executive committee includes the president and secretary and R. L. Clisby of Parker, J. C. Southwick, Watertown, Oscar Grue, Webster. THE NEW 

LINE UP As complemented, the result of congressional elections in November, 1914, the democratic majority in the senate was increased from 13 to 16. Iu the house it was reduced from 143 to 25. The new senate liueup was: Democrats, 5(5 republicans, 40. The new house democrats, 230, republi cans, 196, progressives, 7 socialists, 1 independents, 1. The last house had 286 democrats, 125 republicans, 17 propressives and 1 independent.

He believes that American governments and American people have been drawn more closely together through these demonstrations of community of purpose. In the phil osophy of the thing the president is right and the future will award him the credit for a demonstration of commend able national patience that the present does not entirely accord to him. From his contemplation This is a matter to be settled by congress and if congress does not settle it in a way that is satisfactory to a majority of the people, congress will hear from a majority of the peo ple at the next election. It is reported that the fish hatchery at Spearlish was to be discoutinved, probably due to the order transter ing D. C, Booth, in charge, to the hatchery at Homer, Minn. Hon. E. W. Martin has received word from Senator Sterling aud Congressman Handy that there is no danger of the Spearlish hatchery being closed.

President Wilson deals entertaingly ana justly with the relationship between the United States and the other politi tical divisions of the western hemis phere in his discussion of the Monroe doctrine. The president believes he has dem onstrated to the southern republics, through his treatment of the Vexican situation, that the United States has no intention of ever taking advantage of its weaker neighbors and that, its intentions are all for the welfare of the several countries with which this coun try is associated in a geographical sense. 1 he president knows that he has sev eral times turned the other cheek in his dealings with turbulent Mexico and he believes that he has thereby im pressed its sister republics that the great strength of the United States is to be expended for their good, rather than for their injury. of the brotherhood of American republics and the responsibilities devolving upon the United States as the leading nation in the congregation of coun tries, it was not difficult for the president to transfer his thoughts to preparedness for war and to indirect ly suggest that the defender of all American republics should put itselt in condition to protect the entire con tinent from European aggression. In this it will be considered many that, the president was unneces sarily assert!ve—that the situation does not call for the vastly expensive program he has laid out—that tbe isolation of the Araerieau continent is its strength against the cupidity of those far across the seas. by •V* if South Dakota soil is fertile in the highest de gree. It was long ago established that no better slock country could be found on the globe. Alfalfa has been tried and found not wanting. In dry years the seed crop is a gold mine in wet seasons the hay crop is a bonanza. Corn, king of the grain crops, has been raised here for years with remarkable success. Red and white clover can be seen growing wild on vacant lots or abandoned fields. Legumes grow wild on the prairies, and the wild grasses that cover the prairieB furnishes food for live stock every month on the cal endar. With these facts staring us in the face, waste our prairie grasses, an item which alone if utiliznd, would make the present population of the state all rich. Much of the by products, such as straw, corn fodder and other surplus roughage which might be turned to clear profit, and the result. Land that this year produced from $30 to $90 per acre is a drug on the market at $ 15 per acre. t/» $ !$ 4r, Mi $ 7$ Hp fats i, -'i Ui£ aSPifg Hp*
