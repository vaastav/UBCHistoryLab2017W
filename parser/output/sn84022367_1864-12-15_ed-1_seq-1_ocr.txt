MONDAY, DECEMBER 12, 1364 Ednrattfcnal Lllla. The subject of popular and collegiate education received Its full proportion of atteutlon at the late session of the leg Ulatnni. No less than Ave bills were introduced relating to on Agricultural College, ouly two of which, namely, the one repealing the law of last year, and the one establishing what purports to be a parely agricultural college finally paMed. An act waa passed providing tor defraying the entire expense of the district schools from the grand lint. A bill was also passed prorlding for the erection of school hous s in districts neglecting to do their duty in that res pect An act authoring towns to sup port high schools, and another amend ing the present law providing for the distribution of public money failed to become laws. The hill repeal! ng the last year's College act was stontly opposed by some of the ablest friends of that act. Mr. Chand ler of Woodstock, who was a memlwr last year and as chairman of the Com mute on Education reported the Mil, ap peared before the committee this year and earnestly opposed the repeal, It was especially urged that it would be an act of bad faith, inasmuch as one in stitution, the Vermont University, had accepted its provisions, and made all the necessary arrangements for that purpose. Hut all the "assembled wis dom" have spoken the word, and also passed a law creating an Independent Agricultural College. If this act should not be repealed next year if the great body of firmer iu Vermont, for whose especial benefit this law waa passed, should take hold of the matter if a fa vorable location, and a liberal endow ment should be secured, and ample pro vision be made for instruction in "all branches relating to agriculture," the agricultural college may be made a lead in:: institution of the State. We believe that classical studies are not expressly excluded; an 1 furthermore, the expres sion, ' those branches relating to agri culture," is susceptible of a pretty wide interpretation. This college, as we have seen, is de signed to be par txoUence. an institution for raising up young farmers. It re mains to be setm whether fanners will regard it in that light, and whether they will cherish and sustain it. The sum realized from the sale of land scrip will be but a small portion of what will be needed for buildings and endowment. If the farmers wish to make their col lege a centre of attraction, not only for their own boys, but also for those re siding in the other states and Canadas, they must make up their minds to "fork over" to the tune of one hundred and fifty or two hundred thousand. There is no valid reason why Vermont should not lead the world in her race of farm ers, as decidedly as she does In her breeds of sheep. We had intended to say a word upon the law requiring the school, to be sup ported by the grand list. We have only room to say that while the new law will be displeasing to those who are wedded to the practice ef having the teachers "board around," it will probably receive the hearty approbation of irineteen twentleths of the truly enlightened friends of education. Nulllfitatiou XulUflrd. N jt to know something abont R. Tsachhrs Wasted. General Butler wants teachers for his free schools In eastern Virginia, which commence on the 1st of January ; wages for men t5 and $60 per month, for women $20 and S0 preference given to disabled sol diers and soldiers' wives and widows. Barnwell Rhett of South Carollnia, (for so the F. F.'s down there all pronounce) argues one's self unknown. His origi nal name was plain Robert Barnwell ; but for adequate considerations, the cognomen Rhett waa appended, thereby glviug the whole a slightly classical look, like '"M. Tulllus Cicero," or "C. Julius Caesar." With less than a tenth part of the talent, but more than a hun dred times the "enduring brass" of Ilayne and Calhoun, he has affected to follow in the footsteps of those badly eminent nulhflers. As a specimen of the unequal steps in which he has followed hJs fathers, we may mention that some years ago, he had a son in Cambridge College who hail reached the last term of his senior year, and, strange as it may appear, had distinguished himself for good scholarship and good conduct. Something, we do not remember what, happened to be said or done, either in the college or the neighborhood, which R. Barnwell Rhett thought best to be displeased about, and so he ordered his son to leave, and come home lnstanter. No entreaties or disclaimers, either of the faculty or the son were of any avail. In consideration however of the good record of the son, his name was permit ted to appear with the graduating class, and he was honored with a degree. Not only does R. Barnwell Rhett affect great ness while he practices littleness, but also, while engaged in the practice of deviltry, he makes (great pretensions to sanctity. After having to the extent of his poor ability labored in the cause of nullification for thirty years, when at length South Carolina had really sece ded he is represented to have put on thf airs of old Simeon, aud expressed Lis readiness to ascend. Siuce the memorable epoch of 1860, very little has been heard of R. Barn well Rhett, till quite recently, we And he has turned up in the legislature of his darling aud fiiHicted "South Caroli nia." He has recently introduced into that august or ghostly body a series of resolutions declaring that South Caro lina is determined to right out the war ; that the sovereign states are not amen able to the confederate government for their existence, and that any attempted conscription of state oiHcers on the part of Jeff Davis, calculated to disturb the operations of the state governments, are flagrant usurpations, to which the states should not submit; that any interfe rence with the press Is unconstitutional ; that the taxation projects of the rebel president are, like the old tariff laws, "unconstitutional palpably, deliberate ly, dangerously ;" and lastly and irre pressibly, that the institution of Afri can slavery is under the exclusive juris diction of sovereign states, and any law passed by Congress to emancipate a slave in any state, or to appropriate money from the treasury of the states to buy and emancipate slaves, is unconsti tutional and void. Now this is what we may call Nullifi cation nullified. R. Barnwell Rhett could not stand it any longer. As we learn from Esop that a scratching, mous ing cat could never become a gentle and affectionate spouse, and from the inspir ed prophet, that the leopard cannot change his spots, so, from these resolu tions, we learn that the Incorrigible, whose surname is Rhett, cannot be cured of his eomtitut 'tonal nigger and nullification. He and his brother confederates in South Carolina and Georgia are getting themselves entangled in a knotty snarl which they cannot unravel, and which they will have to cut with their frHsty swords. Let them cut and be hanged. HUlPB in inn intuni ia. vujcv tion has been raised to the publication of the amounts paid by individuals as income tax, but it is already serving the good purpose of putting the officers on the scent for frauds on the government by deficient returns of incomes. - The Boston Transcript states that in the third and fourth districts it is discover ed that A number of persons of large fortunes, Who spend from twelve to twentv thousand per year, have made returns of incomes. iesS tha j a tbl'd of their annual expenditures. This causes 1 so much indignant inquiry that the rev enue officers are stirred up to investiga te!? and without doubt some cases of trad i'ZJ this matter will be detected nd properir ounished. We fear there is no small amount of tnls 8011 of cheat ing, and it is commuted, too, by the very men who have the lafes' Incomes, and are best able to pay their full share towards the suppon, 0r the government. . Unfortunately it is a fact that many . man whose word is considered as goc-1 1 as their bond in private business affairs, Mem to have no conscience in respect t i their 'public duties.

Mektino oh the Stats Temperance Si;ik.tt. The meeting of the State Tem perance Society, which is to be held at this place ou the 21st and 2id Inst., should receive the attention of all the frieuds of the cause, and measures should be .adopted to reuder it one of strong interest. In order to render it such, several things are requisite. 1. The Executive Committee should be prepared with an able repot t, setting forth the present state of the temperance cause in the Bute generally, what has been accomplished during the past year, and what measures should be adopted in future. Such a report should be in a good measure to this meeting what the President's Message is to Congress, or the Governor's Message to the Legisla ture, and it is not too much to say that we may reasonably expect such a report from the men who compose the present Executive Committee. 2. The towns should secure a good delegation to attend the meetings ; and their delegates should come prepared to give valuable information. The maxim, "Old men for counsel and young men foi war," should not be overlooked in appointing these delegates. It is to be in an important sense a Temperance Conference, to the interest of which ev ery delegate should come prepared to contribute his share. If the organiza tion is worth keeping up. and if it is worth while to nold such a meeting, pains should be taktn to .render it one of interest at the time, and of influence on the future. It has l;n so in years passed, and we know not why it may not be so now. A committee of citizens has been ap pointed to receive delegates and assign them places of entertainment. To aid this Committee, persons who propose at tending the meeting are requested to forward their names immediately either to Rev. S. O. Abbott or Rev. E. H. By ingtou, Windsor. Our citizens will, we trust, be prepared to give the delecates a cordial reception, and we hope they will not come in straggling numbers nor with a faint noart. Irawi Chron icle. Watch im. ths Wkllamd Canal. The St.Catherine's .Jonrnal says that the col lactors alone; the canal have taken such measures, in accordance with the in structions issued by the government to prevent vess-els parsing the canal having raiding parties or warlike materials ou board, that tber- is scarcely the possi bility of one setting through. The col lector of that port. James Lamb, Esq., has given instructions to his subordi nates to search every vessel, not only those which may be liable to suspicion, but even thoe that are not, such as the boats of the Northern Transportation Company, so that it is almost certain that any attempt to violate their neu trality will be detected. miscellaneous Item. James Steel is 100 years old and the oldest man in Wisconsin. He was married lately to a young widow of 88 summers. The captain of a Mississippi steam boat lately warded off a guerrilla attack by having Dixie played on the calliope. The rebels cheered Instead of firing, and the steamer went it way. Jeff. Davis' late Message to the rebel Congress was regarded in England as exhibiting a considerable amount of spirit conveyed in words of desperation. The journals were very shy of encourag ing the plan of arming the negroes. A nephew of Gov. Vance of North Carolina, is under arrest at Matamoras, Texas, for bigamy and robbery. He was there to obtain supplies for the rebels, and joined a gang of natives, who stop ped a stage and robbed the passengers. The chivalry are getting into bad ways. The rebels in England, with their foreign sympathizers, were greatly dis appointed at the fact that the Presiden tial election passed over in such a per fect calm. They appeared also to be alarmed at the fine demonstration of moral force and self-control exhibited by the American people on the occa sion. T The Richmond Examiner, to show Its hatred of the Yankees, is unwilling to be under obligations even to Web ster's Dictionary, and has gone back to the style of English spelling which pre vailed befVwe the revolution. It prints "horrours, terrour, honour, ge-vernour, publick, democratick." This is certain ly quite in keeping with the crab line inarch of civilization at the South. If the clerks and members of the reb el legislatures are as analytical in their pronunciation as were those in our own, they will have to pronounce the last syl lable of the word "governour" so as to rhyme with such words as hour, power, and shower. It was quite noticeable in the legislature of this State that readers and speakers were careful to say gov- orn.ni inr-na. elect-on. c. : ana one. gentleman who had wfejf said lister, corrected himself and said usi-oa i "Tan End of th Waa." A corres nondent of the Boston Herald says that the Richmond Examiner or rnaay na n editorial which opens as follows I "The war is near an end If wa but con tinne to hold our own, much more cer uinlv if we meet with some moderate n Tennessee and Georgia." It bases these remarks and most of the ar ticle upo n editorial in the New York Times on out National Finances. Sharp Order op Gbn. Butler, Gen. Butler has issued an order for the pro tection of the enlisted men in his com mand, as follows : ' "General Orders A'o. 163. It has come to the knowledge of the commanding general, by frequent complaints of pri vate soldiers, that officers borrow mon ey of the enlisted men of their com mands. No practice could be more demoraliz ing to both officers and men. Enlisted men do not feel themselves at liberty to refuse their officers. Men, If they loan money to their officers, expect favors in return, and there is an end to discipline and an incentive to favoritism. Offi cers borrowing money of their men do not regulate their expenditures within their Income, ana nna tnemseives unaoie to repay It. This practice must oe stopped. Here after it will be held cause to recommend for dismassal any officer who shall bor row money or incur debt to an enlisted man. After the next payment any on cer who shall be Indebted to an enlisted man, and has not paid him, win oe rec ommended for dismissal upon complaint of his creditor." j Scbstitptes is tub Nbw Corpi. It is stated that substitutes for enrolled men may be enlisted In the 1st corps, Major General Hancock commanding, and the nrlnciuals will be exempt from draft, bnt such substitutes will not receive the Government bounty. They should be forwarded to Washington for enlist ment. Reoresentative recruits may be enlisted In this corps and they will re ceive the Government bounty. j California Correonderce. Sacramento. Cal., Nov. 9, 18H4. Editor Rutland Ilernid : It will not be news when this reaches you, that Abra ham Lincoln has been re-elected Presi dent of the United States. But I can not refrain from recording the part which the Pacific States have taken in this consummation, in this the most im portant event of the nineteenth century. At the date of this but partial returns have been reeelved from this and the two neighboring states, yet meagre as they are, they are sufficiently full to form a gratifying opinion of the result. California will give a Union majority of from 20,000 to 25,000 at least 6000 more than she gave for ytate officers one year ago. Thus it will be seen how the Golden State, the land of Broderick, of Baker, and of civil and religious liberty in the distant West, has given the lie to her revilers, and vindicated her fair name from the aspersions and the stigmas of such old political and so cial jackals as Gwin, Weller, Biglcr, and a score of other renegades of the same genus, whom I will not awaken from oblivion by mentioning here. Oregon has done honor to herself, as she always does, while Nevada, that ju venile State, not yet three weeks old, wheels into line by the side of her sis ters and astonishes her most sanguine friends by this her virgin vote. Eleven electoral votes for the Union and Lin coln and Johnson will speed across the continent from the Pacific Slope and re- verberate back the thunder tones that we can almost hear to-day, rolling up from the great states of the valley of the Mississippi and from the free States of the Atlantic. As the winter of '61 and '62 will ever be a memorable one to California as the winter of the flood, so will the past sea son be equally so as the year of the great drouth. Within the last twenty months the rain which has fallen iu the central and northern parts of the state has been les-s than one-fourth the amount of ordinary years, while in the southern counties, from Monterey to San Diego, the wet season of '63 and '64 has been omitted entirely, and now the vast herds of horses and cattle that once roamed over the fertile pastures of San Luis Obispo, Los Angelos and Santa Barbara, have perished and their bones lie bleach ing upon a barren desert. The losses sustained by the rancheres of the lower cinties of the state surpass the concep tion of the eastern farmer, where the scarcity of rain may sometimes injure, but never utterly ruin their crops. Men who in former years have held In possession tracts of land for miles In ex tent, and who numbered their herds by lens of thousands, now look around to see their property gone, and themselves unable to live upon the sterile plains that are left them. Although there has been more rain in the region farther north, yet taking the State together, less than the usual crops by at least three fourths have been harvested. Nor does the difficulty arising from an intensely dry season end here , the rain that is re quired to produce vegetation is also nec essary In California for the purpose of operating the mines, which form no In considerable item in the resources of the State. As a natural consequence, the mining for more than a year past has been con fined almost exclusively to the quartz leads, where steam Is substituted for water, in separating the precious metal from Its baser combinations. The result of this extreme drouth can be easily imagined ; business through out this State and Nevada which de pends largely upon the productions of California has become stagnated. The laborers who have been thrown outj of employment, together with the heavy emigration from the East, now form a surplus population anything but desira ble, in hard times. The rainy season not yet set in is anxiously looked for, and should rains fall copiously between now and March, the State will survive her present misfortune and a famine pre dicted by many will be averted. The State Agricultural Society which holds Its annual Fair in this city, made no exhibition this fa. I, owing to the ' drouth. In place of It, however, the So ciety held a 8tatc Horse Show, which took place during the third week of Oc tober. Much attention has been devot ed to the breeding of fine horses witiin the past few years. There were some splendid displays of the Morgan, Ham- bletonlan, Black Hawk and other favor ite bloods, as well, as the cuswmary amount of trotting and of coarse the inevitable "fast time" always made at horse races, was exceedingly "rapid" here. ' The Society's prize of two hun dred dollars for mile heats, best three in five, was taken by a horse that crossed the plains this season, in 2.38. A ten mile race was also made In something less than thirty minntes-very respect able trotting; as well as very cruel treat ment for the horses that participated. But not forgetting that "brevity Is the soul of wit, and tediousa the outward flourishes," I am ' w. C. Ja. '' ' ; - -. ! . o - Local and Stale Items. Christmas Festival. The ladle of Trinity Church, Rutland, will give a Christmas Festival at the Town Hall oa the evening of Thursday, Dec. 22d, com mencing at 6 1-2 o'clock. Refreshments, and an assortment of useful and fancy articles will be offered for sale. Ad mission 2S cents. The proceeds of the Festival will be appropriated towards the purchase of an organ for their new church ediflce. Firs. Yesterday morning at about four o'clock a Are was discovered In the brick building, near the head of Wash ington street In this vUlage, occupied by Messrs. B. dt D. C. Billings, mer chants, and J. J. R. Randall, architect. The fire had made such headway before the discovery was made, that It could not be extinguished before the whole of the Interior of the building together with nearly all its contents were con sumed. The engines were promptly on hand, but unfortunately the water had been shut off, and It was some time be fore they could commence playing. As soon as possible, however, the water was let into the tank at the head of Wash ington street, and the firemen, all as one, commenced with hearty good will to throw two streams upon the confla gration. The new Hook and Ladder company were also promptly on the ground, and performed most excellent service. The Town Hall was several times on fire, but it was quickly extinguished, and the dwelling of the widow Huntoon, which is attached to the store, was in imminent danger, but was not injured. The safe of the Messrs. Billings was taken out from the midst of the flames, red hot, and its contents were found to be uninjured. A show case, and a few boots and shoes only were saved. The Messrs. Billings were insured for $3,000 in the office of the " Norwich Fire Insurance Co.," of Norwich, Ct., and for $1,000 in the " City Fire Insurance Co.," of Hartford, Ct. The building, valued at aKut $3,000, was insured for $1,400 in the Vermont Mutual. Mr. Randall had no insurance. His loss is in some respects irreparable, as it consisted in choice Instruments, some of which were imported; plans, drawings and books which no money can replace. His pecuniary loss cannot fall much short of three thousand dol lars. There were also collections of valuable memoranda acquired during twelve years of practical operations in building, all his account books and pa pers, and the records of the Union school district. A receipt for between two and three hundred dollars which he had re cently paid, was found near the Savings Bank, at least sixty rods from the fire. One of the worst hardships connected with Mr. Randall's loss is that of the plans of several costly buildings, upon which he had spent many months, and which must all be begun anew. While we would extend our heartfelt sympathies to the sufferers, we are sensi ble that words are of little avail in such a case. It was certainly a very unfortunate circumstance, to say the least, that a full supply of water was not at hand when It was so much needed. It will pjobably set the citizens of this village to thinking again on the subject of wa ter. Had there been any wind, hardly any of the buildings In the immediate vicinity could have been saved. It is not known how the fire originated. A Card The Firemen of the village of Rutland will please accept the thanks of the Engineers and Wardens, for their promptness and willingness to. do their whole duty at the Are on Sunday morn ing. - The'r pficiekcy kept It from spreading in the least. ; , Bek.
