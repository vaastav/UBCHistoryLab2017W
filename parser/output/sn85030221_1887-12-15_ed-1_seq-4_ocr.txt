BEER TRADE. That Emporia is not the only city in Kansas that indulges in beer is mani fest by the following special telegram to the Kansas City Times: Topeka, Kan.. Dec. 9. The trial of the case of the Phillip Best brewing company of Kansas City against Aid- ricn & .Drown, arusnmis.. or. vr iciiua. began in the United States court this alternoon. me action was nrougnt to recover $3,000 claimed to be due on account of beer sold the Wichita firm a rear azo. The defendants set up a counter ciaim oi biu.uuj on account oi the failure to carnr out the terms or the contract to furnish them with beer as the plaintiff s agents at Wichita. The evidence elicited showed an im mense beer trade in Wichita during the thiee months in which the contract was in force. Amonir other things the defendants testified that they had purchased from the plaintiffs and sold. during the period named, 8o,54o cases of beer, or 877,080 bottles, and 68,756 gallons of beer in bulk, making a total oi nearly 1,200,000 bottles, or one-third of a quart of beer per day during the three months tor eacn mnawtant or wicmta, upon a oasis or 4.u,uuu population. The most astonishing feature of the case, however, is that the principal at torney for the druggists is Assistant Attorney General ilallowell, who is now seeking to force the plaintiffs to pay a heavy sum because they do not continue to inundate Wichita with beer through the agency of a class of per sons be ii so bitterly prosecuting for violations of the prohibitory law. in addition to the amount oi beer al ready stated the defendants also swore that they had sold during the same time nearly as much more, which had been purchased of other brewers. In this case, as in similar cases in Emporia, it will be observed that a gentleman who has been a leading ad' vocate for enforcing measures of the most stringent nature, bas, because he gets a good fee as a lawyer, gone over to the enemy. A prominent lawyer of this city, who is noted as a leader in third party measures, took a somewhat similar action in the case of a con demned whisky seller, the prohibi tionist leader procuring a commuta tion of sentence for the convicted whis ky dealer, and when spoken to regard ing the matter said that it was merely a matter of business, and that as a lawyer he could attend to it. Yet this gentleman or Mr. Hallowell have no hesitation to break up another man's entire business prospects and send him to the penitentiary for actually doing less against the cause of temperance than either of the two have done as lawyers in defence of violators of the prohibition law. Out on such hypo- cracy and such canting hypocrits. THE FANATIC. The person who runs the Fanatic claims that The News is endeavoring to incite a riot, because it denounces him as a blackguard. Tie real truth of he matter Is that he co irts a cow- hiding, as it might create sympathy for him. Although he deserves a coat of tar and feathers, we hope none of our cit izens will give it him, as it would only redound to his benefit as an advertise ment. We are sorry to say that, in a city that can furnish people foolish enough to take all the delicacies of the season and beautiful bouquets of flow ers to the cell of a- cold-blooded assas sin, there are also people foolish enough to think that a thiua that does not even understand the rudiments of the trade he pretends to work at, may possibly be working in the interests of temperance and morality. ine anatic man snouid take warn ing by the fate of Spies, Filden,Lingg and the other Chicago fanatics, as there Is a limit even to crankism. He should remember that liberty for him self ends when he begins to encroach on the rights of others, and that when he tampers with the good names of our citizens by printing them in a little blackguard gutter snipe devoted to nothing but ventilation of personal spite, he is going just a notch farther than is necessary. Were he a citizen of Emporia looking to what he thought her best interests, the case would be different. -But we have it from his own lips that he was run out of a town farther west for just such meddlesome ness as he is now manifesting here. Some true friends of temperance, we have no doubt, believe that this system of publishing the names of all " who purchase liquors does the cause good. But were some person to come to this city and start a little "nin-ar'und" sheet and publish the names of all our citizens wno purchase dry goods or groceries on "tick" what a howl would go up. Yet the credit system is un doubtedly an evil which should be abated, and to publish the names of those who run bills would be just as justify able as to publish those who purchase liquors for medical purposes. Because some people run bills which they do not intend to pay Is no reason why others should not get credit who are in the habit of paying their just debts. Neither is it right or proper that a person's name should be made a public town talk for purchasing liquor for medicine, because others purchase it to gratify their appetites. Although this man pretends to be working in the interests of temperance alone, and in his articles conveys the idea that he would willingly lay down his life for the cause, yet, if our read ers will take a second thought and re member that he constantly suggests that his subscribers pay "50 cents In advance," a mercenary motive may be found, and when it is remembered that had he wished to lay down his life for the temperance cause his wish might have been gratified by simply remain. ing where he was before he came to Emporia, knowing before he came here that we have one of the most law-abid ing and conservative of populations, and that his chances to lay down his life here were in the minimum. That he is a coward and a whelp is shown by his trying to convey to the public the erroneous idea that this pa per approves of mob violence, and ac cuses us of lying when we simply state the truth. Were he not either a coward or a villian he would not be eternally prating about violence to his person, either fearing the punishment he well merits or wishing for some action to be taken that can be construed into persecution, so he may thus put shekfls in his purse, evoked by silly sympathy from his fellow fanatics. The writer of this article professes to be a prohibitionist himself. - But he has no kind of use for people who go out of their way to do an uncalled for injury to their neighbors and then at tempt to shield themselves under the cloak of the temperance cause. Like' the high-toned Hallowell of Wichita, this meek and lowly would be editor, is a fanatic because it pays him, and, like Hallowell, when he can make more money from - the whisky dealers than from the temperance people, then he will probably advocate their cause. . . . . . , Out on all such, hypocrites. The Kansas City people, are improv ing. They have a Sunday law forbid ding the opening of saloons. Sunday last an attempt was made to enforce its provisions, aT)d among the first ones found violating the law was an alder man named Ixxmey, who had voted for the ordinance. The Kansas City News, commenting on the case, says: Alderman Looney voted to grant to the recorder the power to annul the licenses of all: the saloonkeepers violat ing the Sunday closing law. Will Be corder Davenport to-day annul Saloon keeper Looney's license?" PRO AND COIT. Judge Brewer, in the United States Circuit Court, has issued a decree, de claring John Walruff's brewery, at Lawrence, a common nuisance, and di recting the United States marshal to close and abate the same, the decree also awards an injunction perpetually restraining. John Walruff, the mem bers of his family, their agents and employes, from manufacturing intoxi cating liquors or selling the same, or from manufacturing, keeping, for bar ter, sale, gift or use, in, on or about the famous Walruff brewery. Neverless, this decree seems to be at least a little In conflict with a decision just handed down by the supreme court of the state, which has decided that any person In the lawful and bona fide possession of Intoxicating liquor may use it as he sees fit; he may drink it himself or give it away, but be cannot by any shift or device in selling or giv ing away lawfully evade the provisions of the statute prohibiting the manufac tore and sale of intoxicating liquor. They also hold that a person cannot be convicted under section 16, of the pro hibitory act of 1882. for keeping in his house, store or in a wareroom thereof intoxicating liquor ror ms own use, ox for giving the same away if done hon- stly and in good faith, and not as a shift or device to evade the provision of said act. The opinion is rendered by Chief Justice Horton, all justices concurring. . -i his latter opinion was ren aerea in tne case or a person who was charged with violating the prohibition law because he kept a keg of beer in his house, and when his friends called he treated them to a glass of beer. Especial stress was placed on the fact that they held a sort of friendly party once a week at his house for the purpose of drinking beer. No one was charged with dis orderly conduct, however, and the meetings were not had for the pur pose oi nnanciai penenc to any one, as the beer was not sold, but given to his friends. In our telegraph dispatches will be found an account of a brutal assault made yesterday on Dr. Mcrrison Man- ford by the overgrown Kansas City bully, Ed. Oorrigan, who, were, it not for his father's money, would not be recognized anywhere outside of a jail or workhouse. We are inclined to think that Ed. will find that he has bit off more than he can chew this time for Dr. Munford is not the man to al low himself to be beaten up by a bully without making it hot for him, and we should not at all be surprised if this evenings telegrams snouid announce that he he had already paid for his bru tality with his life. He is deserving of no more mercy than a mag-dog, and when met by his victims should be treated just as if he were really one of the animals he puts himself on a par with. The law is too slow and uncer tain a remedy for villains of this char acter, whose wealth is a shield to their baseness. This attack on Munford after the even more brutal one on Mo- Bier, will exonorate the Doctor for any remeay ne may neem expedient to use in the case. This is the manner in which the Du buque Telegraph, a democratic sheet tries to dodge the issue laid down by President Cleveland for his followers to face. It speaks volumes; "The line." aava the Sioux atv journal, adverting to tne president message and the next national cam paign, "tne line is sharply drawn. On tne one side is protection; on the other, rree trade." ir this were the issue protection would surely win. But it not. The executive message is not a free trade declaration, and even if it were it would not be binding on the democratic party. The latter is op posed to free trade, not alone because the altolitirm of the duties would' be destructive to the best interests of the country, but because the advocacy of such removal by the democratic party would be equiv alent to the ruin of the organization. It is practicable to revise the tariff and reduce the revenues without opening our ports to the free admission of for eign goods and impairing the protec tive principle. The democrats will doubtless prefer to define their own po sition on this question rather than have the Journal and other republican news papers aeune it ior tnem. The "Trust" business was first Btarted by the government, and was a bigger swindle than any that have as yet been formed since. It was the trade dollar with its legend of "In God we Trust." The young man who shot three times at Jules Ferry declared that he was one of twenty revolutionists who had resolved on getting rid of French statesmen who were objectionable to them.

FOUND AT LAST. ! DeUSaUUtla Jail In Ibiu for tbs ISiHcr ! Baxtsr UK Kprlag. : : Since the time of the finding of Bax ter's body in the Cottonwood last spring numerous persons named Smith I and several parties with other names nave been watcnea ana arrested sup posed to be the murderer. Something has however been proven by said parties acquitting them from the serious charge. Sheriff Wilhite has been un tiring in his search and from a tele gram received Monday it looks as If his work on this question was nearly ended. It will be remembered that a man named Dell Smith disappeared from Kansas City about the tune Bax ter left and it has been ascertained to an almost certainty that he leit in com pany with the murdered man. During the correspondence Wilhite learned where Smith's home was be fore moving to Kansas City, and wrote the officers that he was wanted and what for. The officers answered the correspondence by saying that Smith had ceased to write to his old home since last spring, naming a time correspond ing to the time Baxter left Kansas City. These circumstances and many others point very conclusively towards Smith as the guilty man. The telegram received Monday states that Dell Smith returned to his old home a few davs ago and was ar rested and lodged in jail to await the arrival of the sheriff who started Monday noon for his man. Coonty Teacher Association. At 2 o'clock the Lyon County Teach ers' Association was called to order by Prof. Wilkinson. Mr. B. W. Spiker was elected tem porary chairman. The exercises open ed with a vocal quartette given by Messrs. Kelley, Dudley, Johnson and Phillips. Miss Grace Kirkendall re cited, "The Schoolmaster's Desk. The piece was replete rrwlth truthful pictures of a district school teacher's hardships. Miss Mamie Dolphin read a very able essay on "Errors in Teaching Language and How to Correct Them. She deprecated the teaching of techni cal grammar before the pupils were able to frame a correct English sen tence. The pupil should not so much be impressed with the idea that he is reciting as that he is in general con versation with the teacher. Pupils should be led to have something ac curate to say before saying. Good practice in language is to write reviews of stories. Superintendent Dixon, in her discussion of the paper emphasized the advice to use pictures as aids in composition work. Miss Kuhlmann recommended the publication of Miss Dolphin's paper in the Western School Journal. Supt. A. E. Dixon addressed the as sociation on the subject of "Seat Work for Little Folks." She said, if pupils had something to do, there would be little trouble in keeping them orderly, She gave several ingenious devices for supplementing the text book and keep ing the pupils interestedly at work, The county teachers should remember that a cloudy day does not mean a poor programme, and those absent to-day missed something of value in Miss Dixon's address. Mrs. S. J. Pierce conducted a recita tion in combination number work with a class of little children. The children were as much interested as anybody and caused a good deal of amusement with their lively little stories. Chil dren are bound to learn and to want to learn with such pleasant instructions The exercise elicited some very lively discussions.. To-day's meeting has been one of the most profitable of the year. Professor Wilkinson's genial humor keeps the association in good spirit. Bev F.T. InsraUs Resigns. After the morning services at the First Congregational church Sun day morning the congregation was asked to remain in their seats a few minutes, during which time the pastor. Rev. F. T. Ingalls, took occasion tender his resignation to take effect January 1, at the same time stating that he had accepted the presidency the Drury college at Springfield, Mo. In referring to the severing of his pastoral relations with his parish ioners, and to the ties of love and tenderness which had grown up during the time in which he had been located here, Mr. Ingalls' feelings were so overcome tnat ne was unable to pro ceed with his remarks, and at thier con clusion tears were streaming down the cheeks of nearly every one in the church. The occasion was a very touching one, and made plainly mani fest the great esteem in which the beloved pastor is hem by his congre gation, as well as the great love and regard he has for his charge. A Letter from California. 8an Diego, Cal., December, 5, 1887 Editor News. When I reached this place early in uctober tne weatner was very pleasant. xne Day ana its surroundings were beautiful, and, taken altogether, it was delightful; and then the activity ilinnlnvlij in lfal OtarntA tranaafitinna and in building up a fine city on these Darren nuis in so snort a time wa wonderful to one not used to such fasc inating things. But after a few days study of the subject, we begin to dis cover tnat even this is not perfection and tnat this tavorea spot has its dis advantages, that the dust, fleas and mosquitoes are. to say the least, very unpleasant and that it can scarcely be called a health resort. Ague typhoid, malarial fevers and rheuma tism are very prevalent, even in the temperate climate of the coast, and they are much worse in the hot valleys of the interior. They boast here that tins is tne most even temperature in the world, yet old residents have told me that they have seen the tempera ture cnange torty-nve degrees in but a little more than four hours. Before the rains set In the prevailing breeze was from the sea (southwest), and very steady during the day, except from 7 to v o clock a. m., when it was calm Rain came on the 24th, and that day and the next (Thanksgiving) the rain fall was over two inches; more, they say. than tne total rail last year. Since the rain there is no dust, and not so many fleas and mosquitoes; but at the same time the weather is not so Eleasant, as we haye heavy fogs and igh winds, amounting to storms at times. We feel the cold severely, as but few here have fires to go to, and have to endure it until the snn comes out, and a lady recently summed up tne climate by tne remark, mat sne would rather be warm in a cold climate, than cold in a warm climate. This city is improving very rapidly. building fine business blocks and hand some residences, and expending 9400, 000 upon a sewerage system and $80,000 to improve " the city schools. I believe this place is destined to be of importance in the near future. The hotels, restaurants and lodging houses are reaping a rich harvest. The furniture and grocery stores are doing well. Mechanics who are connected with the building trades, teamsters and laborers get steady work and good wages. Still there is a reeling tnat this state of affairs cannot last very long and then what? I am satisfied that there is a check in real estate sales. No panic, so far, as had been predict ed, but simply a feeling that prices had been forced too high and that tbey would have to wait and let the city i catch up with the prices. All who own outside property, have been forcing it upon the market, and have been getting more for 25x100 foot lots than an acre should have Bold for. Taking everything Into consideration I think too many are coming here from Kansas. This country may continue to prosper, but there is a risk that should be considered. To a Kansas farmer the change is very great, and not always agreeable. From grassy plains to the barren hills of this coun try, where it requires years to produce fruit, ard as to vegetables, a man has to compete with Chinese cheao labor. I believe the grass crop of Kansas. alone, is of more value than all the pro ductions of this state, aside from the wheat of the central part of the state. The Emporia colony is generally doin well, and they are pretty well satisfied still but few of them I think teel at home, and are not willing to tie them selves down here, in tact, that is characteristic of California andrhas always been, that but few feel at home here. They feel that they are just Btaying here while business is good, or, as they used to express it in the mines, until they made their pile, then they would go back to God's country. Hoping that the subject will appear of importance enough to you to induce you to iorgive me tor such a long, rambling letter, i remain yours truly, iU. V. PltTTNER. IMslrlct Court. 

MONDAY. The court convened to-day promptly at nine o'clock. The crim inal cases were Bet for yesterday and very few -of the legal fraternity were present. The first case called was the state vs. Anna Freshman. charged with selling intoxicating liquors. After excusing eight men from the first twelve called, a jury was procured, nine of whom were sworn in and the other three affirmed. Col. Feiehan read and expounded tne charge against defen dant, l. .,. .Lambert, attorney for Mrs. Freshman made a statement of the defence. Schillingf ord was brought up from the jail as a witness. In the afternoon the state produced more witnesses, among whom were Schillingford. His story was straight forward and very clear. Mr. Dlefen dorf, express, agent was also on the stand with the delivery books of the company, showing the number and amount of shipments to defendant, The court room was well filled The case of the state against John Stine, charged with stealing a horse at Neosho Rapids sometime ago. was dis posed of yesterday in the district court by his attorney providing an alibi for him. The depositions of eight or ten citizens of Toronto were produced that proved that Stine was in tnat vicinity ror a week or two before and several weeks after the horse was stolen and that he bad never been away from there during tnat time. tuesda.y Tne jury in tne case of the State vs, Mrs. A.

A short time after court convened the jury returned with a verdict of not guilty. Schillings ford's trial on the same question will come up later, when we are informed he will plead guilty on two counts charged against him. The case of Amos Heller, occupied most of yesterday and a great many witnesses were present. Heller was put on the stand and according to his testimony he knew nothing of the cattle being stolen and simply obeyed his father when he brought them to John Atyeo. The testimony was finished about half-past two and after warm arguments on either side was given to the jury about four o'clock, After a half hour's deliberation the jury returned with a verdict of not guilty. ine rest or tne alternoon was occu pied with the case of A.

This case is one in which a land title is in question Preliminary. The preliminary trial of the eleven boys charged with felony was held be fore Justice Evans Tuesday in Morris hall, which was utilized as a court room for the occasion.

Special Agent Mayer was present and assisted the city attorney Several railroad conductors and brake- men were examined to show tne state oi tne cars named in the charge when started from Argentine, Topeka and other points and their condition in regard to seals etc. when arriving here. Agent R. E Torrington testified to checking two of tne cars and stated what was missing from each. Goods that had been dis covered by Mrs. Brown at her home and returned to Witte, agent at the junction were produced in court and identified by her.. She also stated that Hamilton and George Bechtel called at her home to get their share of cigars and other articles found there but they were , not given them The examination closed about four o'clock. Scott, Hunt, Tiffany, and Curl Hill were released, the others were bound over to the district court. The case will come before his honor Judge Graves as soon as possible.
