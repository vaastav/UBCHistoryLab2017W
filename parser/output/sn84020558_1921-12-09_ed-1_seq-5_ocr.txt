DEMOCRAT C SENATOR ASSAILS SPEECH OF HARDING PARTISAN WASHINGTON. Dec. 8 The Re publican party's leadership was as sailed in a speech in the senate yes terday by Senator Harrison, Demo crat of Mississippi, who declared President Harding was dalng "the verytWngs for which he as a senator had denounced President Wilson." The president's message, he added, constituted an appeal to partisanship and warning to Republicans to dis avow their allegiance to "bloc' or ganization. Mr. Harrison attacked the senate Republican leaders, saying they had "shifted and hopped until none of us knew where or when or why." Sec retary Mellon also was denounced as seeking, in his annual report, to "help along" the ideas of President Hard ing with respect of "relieving the rich of heavy taxation." When Mr. Wilson opposed or urged legislation, Mr. Harrison continued, the then Senator Harding declared him as a "dictator and an autocrat," and when Mr. Wilson issued his ap peal in 1918 for the eelction of a Democratic congress, Mr. Harding was equally bitter in his denounce ment. "Yet we have the spectacle.' he said, "of the president making c speech against the soldier bonus, a thing unprecedented. Then yesterday he appealed to the agricultural group to line up to get behind the party banner." He said he was confident there had been a misprint in the president's message, where Mr. Harding bad ex pressed appreciation of the "signal achievements" of the extra session. What the president meant, he added, probably was "single achievement." o A letter, written by King Charles 1 to his father, James 1, when he was a 10-year-old boy, has been discover ed in an old house in Edinburgh. The crypt museum of Parliament House paid t0,000 for the letter.
