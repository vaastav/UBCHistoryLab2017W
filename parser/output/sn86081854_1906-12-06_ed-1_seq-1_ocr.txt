We are just beginning to realize the extent and the value of the coal fields of Sullivan county. Thus far they have almost entirely escaped the attention of"the assessors and commissioners. Conservative esti mates place the merchantable coal in Sullivan county at over 20,000,- 000 tons. What is the value of this c >al per ton, for the purposes of as sessment? Coal royalties in Sulli van county vary from fifteen to twenty cents per ton. That is the amount the owner of the coal land receives from the companies that buy it and operate the mines. In other words these amounts repre sent the selling price in the market, j The question now arises, what value j should the assessors and the County j Commissioners place upon it for tax- | able parposes? Inasmuch as it re- j quires many years to take all the j coal from any given coal tract, it would be manifestly unfair to place : upon the coal an assessment equal to ; (he amount of royalty paid for it. But the present worth or present value of such deferred payment | would seem to be a fair basis of as- 1 sessmcnt. So, if the operation cov- J crs a period of ten years the rate j should be higher than if it covers a 1 period of twenty-live years. In the; Wyoming Valley coal region the as- j sesMiients run from SSO to f.OO per foot of vein per acre, depending upon the thickness of vein. The! thicker the vein the more valuable | per foot. Thus a three or four foot j vein wiii be assessed at SSO per foot, | or from $l5O to S2OO per acre, while ; an eight or ten foot vein will be as- ; sessed at from s4so to >OOO per acre. | In this connection it may be start- ; ling news to the great majority of j lax pay r- in Sullivan county thai the rich coal lands of the Bernice j region are at present assessed at only i $ Is. 00 per acre ! The amount is so j insignificant as to appear ridiculous, j Recent litigation in this county has i made clear to everyone that our j coal lands have enormous values, i Why should they not be assessed at j their real market value? No one j asks that they be assessed for more j than they are worth, but the farm- | crs and property owners throughout the county demand and have a right i to demand that the same principle j shall be applied in assessing coal ! lands that is applied in assessing farm lands, houses and lots in vil- | lages, stores, hotel, proporties, and j other forms of real estate, to wit, an ; assessment that shall represent their | real and actual value. Anything j short of this is not only unjust and j unfair, but a plain violation of the ■, law. '1 he officials whose work it is to j make these assessments and to linal- j ! ly adjust them, have a most import- j ant duty to perform. The great j | body of taxpayers throughout the I county arejooking to them to per-| form these duties without fear or favor and with exact justice to all. | We firmly believe that they will do ! this and that the triennial assess ment of 190(5 will be the most cor- j reel and equitable of any yet made. The News Item will give Irom | time to time extracts from the as- ; sessnients that we may deem of in terest to the general public. An exchange says : Count Boni is trjing to keep the wolf from the the door by selling scandals of the French Smart Set to a scan dal mongering newspaper. That is about the size of the man, but it ought to inspire the wolf to extra efforts. To Prevent Occceit.

Awarded Heavy Damages. Oscar \V. Shatter, a Phillipsburg baker was awarded 

SIB,OOO damage* against the Lehigh Valley Railroad company by a jury in the- Hunter don court last Saturday. The jury was out all night and returned with a verdict at 9 o'clock. Shaffer was injured in a grade crossing accident by the lilack 1 >i;.- mond Express on November 1", 190.). The accident occurred at Phillipsburg while he was driving in his bakery delivery wagon. The crossing is protected by hoisting gates in charge of a man in a tower, but on the day of the accident the gates were tended by a foreign* r while the regular gateman was off i duty. The baker wagon was per j milted to enter the crossing almost ! at the moment the express was dut ; and was struck by the engine and l thrown several feet. Shatter had a j miraculous escape from death. As i a result of the accident the horse died some time later and [Jlr. Shaf fer is said to be a cripple for life, having partial paralysis of one leg and side. World's Temperance Sunday wa.- very fittingly observed at the M. E. (•'lurch at Forksville. After the close of the lesson period the children of the Sabbath school, under the leader ship of Miss Sara lla.ikell, marched from the primary room with flying banners and waving Hags singing a stirring temperance song. A short program consisting of music, read ing and recitations was rendered in ; a most excellent manner, after which the pastor, Rev. D. J. Ebert' took charge of the service, lie took j for his theme "Man Traps," and de- ! liven (I a strong sermon full of warn ing against the wiles of the enemy. The topic of the Epworth League ser\ ice was announced as "The Use of Strong Driuk," Lender, Mrs. Anna Nye. The evening service j was attended by an unusually large audience as were the preceding ser- : vices. It was a very' interesting and ! profitable met ting, a fitting closing j to a memorable day in the annals of j temperance observance. Eleven were kiiled and KM were i injured in the United States during j the football season of 1900, accord- j ing to the Chicago Tribune. I.ast ! year eighteen players were killed [ and lot) severely injured. The de- j crcise iti casualties is especially j marked among high school players. ! In the season of 1905 eleven high school players were killed and forty ' seven injured, wliiH" in the season just- closed seven were killed and forty-seven hurt. This year not one fatality has occurred among the larger American colleges. The Factory Inspector, a quarterly periodical published in New York, and devoted to the interest of fac tory inspection in the United States and in Canada, has the following ed itorial comment in its October issue concerning our State Capitol build ing, a i ut of which was given .• "There has been some coinplafht, by the way, at the cost of this splen did architectural structure, which , will remain a landmark of beauty j 'and usefulness for centuries. Theex pense ot"building it was some sl3, 000,000; but, all things considered, it is difficult to see how it could have been erected for the money, especi ally as public buildings invariably | cost somewhat higher than private i ones of the same character. "This imposing structure should ! awaken a feeling of pride in the breast of every citizen of the State. | Artistically as well as arehitectural , ly, it is a monument to the talents | and genius of i t.- designers and build ers. The decorations are, of course, I lavish and ornate, but they are ! pleasing to the eye and will have an i educational influence to the advan- j ! tage of everyone who views them, and this great building was com pleted in four years after it was be- I gun." There should be u compulsory ; vaccination law in this state such as they have in Germany, and then there ought to be a law to imprison those mfsguided persons who advo cate resistance to the enforcement i of the vaccination law. —Exchange.

With upraised in diet the sheriff it Elizabethtowil, Ivy., will this week auction off "Dock" Auberry, a shiftless white man who refuses to work and the words of the auction eer will probably bring back to the older among the spectators the scenes of slave times*. Auberry's ser vices will goto his purchaser for a period of nine months. The pr< - ceedings will be under the State Vagrancy Law, which is called into use so little that action under it in variably attracts attention. He was tried last week and convicted, being found by the verdict "strong, able bodied, with no visible means of sup port and too lazy to work." A black bear held up the United States mail near Roiring Hraneh Tuesday, and this new faugled road agent is still at large. Elmer E. Warer, rural mail carrier out of Roaring Branch, having a horse and regulation United States rural deliv ery cart came upon a bear that stood in the roadway. Ilis horse took fright and the wagon was near ly overturned, the bear persistently standing and looking, but finally making off into the woods aboult the time the mail carrier's horse was frightened into a frenzy.

Jerome Ortletr of Dushore, was awarded the contract to build the Lutheran church at Mildred. Andrew Carnegie, bestower of libraries, capitalist, author and philosopher has entered upon his 70th year. It was November 25, 1839, that tbe light came to bis eyes over the heather of bis native Scot land. Mr.Carnegie is in as rugged health as it in all these years he had been free and wild in the land of cakes by brae and burn, instead of amass ing millions to give away with a conscience pang that it is not so good to die rich. Mr. Carnegie has given away nearly $150,000,000 of his collossal f<utune and declares that he is still ready to give. .M 1 mries have been reared nil ov< the land with bis capital, and many others are in pro cess of erection. Not only in the matter of libraries lias Mr. Carnegie invested his money for the public good; but he has expended many millions along other educational lines. There have also been innum erable contributions to charity, but in this matter Mr.Carnegie does not take the public into his confidence.
