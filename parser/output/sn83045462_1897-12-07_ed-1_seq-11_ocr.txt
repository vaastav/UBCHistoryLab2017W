HlMluria-nl Authority for the Lrgpnd About Minn St. Lfger. J'r??u; tl?- lioutlou Stunrinril. The legend of the Lady Freemason is ex as in the dry li^ht of history, by a < .;rrespondent who communicates his learn ed inquiries to lis this morning. The popu lar veision? which everybody had heard and nobody quite believed?was that Miss St. Leg?r. daughter of a former Lord Done raile. had concealed herself in the case of a granfifather's clock/' which was standing in a nn.jn where the occult rites of the fra M? rnity were about to be celebrated; that she sneezed (or did she yawn?), and was ?lragg?-d from her hiding place, but,, in lieu ? ?r instant execution, was mercifully al b-wed. in regard for the feelings of her father and brothers, to be initiated into all the mysteries of the craft. Being a wom an. she was considered to be sufficiently | punished by being told a secret and forced i to keep it. The fact that she never di- ; \ ulged what she learned has be?n used by perverse misogynists as a proof that there was nothing to reveal. Faithful Masons have been fixed on the horns of a rather discom erting dilemma: either there was nothing to tell or a woman never found it ? ?ut. They have been invited to repudiate ?ither the mystery or the woman. But our correspondent comes to their rescue. From ills researches in situ, and his inves tigation 01 ihe family archives, it appears That Miss St. Leger did not hide herself in a clock, for the simple reason that 110 time piece of sufficient capacity was kept at Doneraiie Court. What really happened, or may have happened, is that she was sit ting in a library adjoining the room in which the ceremony was being enacted. But the partition wall chanced to be under going repair; and while she was dozing? perhaps over a novel of the period?she was aw; k? r.ed by the sound of voices. Natu rally she wished to know what was being said. Some girls in their father's house would have walked into the next room and taken their proper share in the conversa tion. But this was too tame for Miss St. Leger. She pulled away some of the bricks and es tablished a position of vantage where she ? ?tild see and hear without being observed. All might have gone well, but either the lodge program was less entertaining than she had expected or. as our correspondent suggests, she suddenly realized the "terri ble eonsequences of her action." Whether .-h*- was conscience stricken or merely bored, she determined to make her escape. Sh? got safely into the hall and saw nobody there hut the family butler. But he was no longer the obsequious retainer; he was a man and a Mason. Indeed, he was acting as doorkeeper to the lodge whose sacred rites she had profaned. It was no longer a ea-e of servant and mistress; she was the ? ulprit. he the avenging priest. Obviously, he had to tell her papa. It was equally matter of course that she should fall into a swoon?it gave her time to review the situ ation. The sequel cannot be more touch ingly described than in our correspondent's own language: "The fair culprit, endowed with a high sense of honor, at once con sent ed to pass through the impressive cere monies she had already in part witnessed and become a Freemason." The recision of the narrative leaves nothing to be de sired until we ask for the date. All we are told is that "the year was probably 1/10." Probably! We had imagined that this full, true and particular account was transcribed from authentic and contemporary records. But if the year is only a matter of con lecture. what of the rest of the narrative? is it one more essay in that branch of his tory which the Germans call "subjective reconstruction"?inventing a private fancy and stating it as an ascertained fact?

Mr. Robertson said, "was when 1 couldn't get out of Juliet's bedroom. 1 was pla)ing with Mme. Modjeska, and all went well until it came to bidding Juliet a fond farewell and leaving her.

But it was an uncom fortable experience! But that was not all. After the balcony scene came'the tomb scene. The tomb was built upon steps. I ascended all right," said Robertson, "sat down on the tomb, when, to my horror, the Ktepo. which were evidently on rollers to facilitate moving the erection, began to move away toward the footlights. I gave a horrified exclamation under my breath, to which Modjeska responded under her veil: 'Vat has happened?* 'The steps have rolled away/ 'You will have to jump,' sho returned, calmly, and I did have to jump.

The young man is a worshiper at the gilded sljrine of Bacchus, and. after a seance with tne god. he Invariably strives to wear down his cranlun. to its normal size by a brisk dash in the open air on the back of a fine saddle horse.

MB PRAISE fPE A STATE PAPEH Its Manner of Treating Public Questions Approved. EDITORIALS IX BRIEF Admirable no to Cuba. From I he New York Evening Poet. President McKinley deals with this sub ject (Cuba) In an admirable manner, show ing In no offensive way that the granting of belligerent rights Is not a legislative, but an executive proceeding; that Its exer cise depends upon facts which can be as certained only by the executive, and that the granting of belligerency would not change the status of the rebels, except for the worse, since it would give Spain the right of search on the high seas, even up to the margin of our territorial waters. The impressive words used by Gen. Grant in a message to Congress on a similar occasion are quoted at length and approved. In deed, the granting of belligerent rights to the Cuban rebels Is discountenanced In every possible way. The upshot of the whole Cuban matter Is that we ought to help the (\ibans to gain autonomy, but not to commit any breach of the law of na tions, and that, "if it shall hereafter ap pear to be a duty Imposed by our obliga tions to ourselves, to civilization and hu manity. to Intervene with force, it shall be without fault on our part, and only because the necessity for such action will be so clear as to command the support and ap proval of the civilized world." If the latter condition Is fulfilled, not even Spain will have room for complaint. The message. Indeed, can hardly fall to have a strong Influence In Spain and Cuba, as well as In the United States, and we cannot doubt that the Influence will be beneficial. Subject Ably Handled. From the Baltimore News. The President's treatment of the Cuban question is as able as his handling of the currency question Is weak. It reviews the history of the trouble between Spain and her West Indian dependency, and of our own connection with the matter, in so clear and Impartial a manner that the statement cannot fail to carry weight in all quarters. It will be difficult for the ad vocates of a "hurrah" policy to make head against the showing made by the President of what has been thus far accomplished by the policy of firmness combined with mod eration. IuMpirliiK and Hrurtenlnic. From the Ntw York Mall inid Ktpress. President McKirley throughout his offi cial carter has shown a disposition to take the public into his confidence and to avoid that needless mystery which leads to false report and mistaken speculation. It is characteristic of the President that he should at the outset extend a greeting of cordial welcome to the Congress. He be lieves In cultivating harmony between the executive and legislative branches ol' the government, instead of inviting hostile col lision; and it was this sensible and pa triotic attitude which made much for the successful enactment of a tariff of pros perity at the extra session, despite the fact that the party of the administration was not and is not in control of the .Sennte. This spirit of co-operation finds yet broad er expression in lifting above partisanship, prejudice or section the great questions of foreign policy, revenue, currency, national obligations ami the Improvement of the public service. When a President addresses himself to his task in such a spirit of broad and exalted patriotism, he is sure to enlist tile instant and sympathetic atten tion of the whole people. It is a comprehensive message, bristling with suggestions, inspiring to action, heart ening to the country and dignified in every aspect. Clenr and VltcorouK English. From tlio l'hlla<l<.-l|>hln Telegraph. The document is written In clear and vig orous English, and is manifestly the work of a man of convictions, who has the cour age of them, and who is not disposed to drift hither and thither with every wind of popular fancy and sentiment. Clear nnd Firm. From the J?rooklyn Eagle. The practical, clear, conciliatory, yet firm character of the message commends It to earnest and patriotic citizens, regardless of party. The hope will be general that the Congress may act in the wise and moderate spirit of the President's recommendations. KxpreHaen the People's Opinion. From the Newark Advertiser. What the President says about the finances Is the expression of the enlight ened opinion of the nation. His words will have their effect in minds heretofore ob stinately closed to rational arguments. What he says about Cuba is the utter ance of thoughtful statesmanship. The President does not spare Spanish rule In Cuba. He fitly characterizes the butcher. General Weyler, who was recently recalled by the Spanish government. Oti the subject of Hawaii, the President says that every consideration of honor de mands the confirmation of the annexation treaty. Therein he reflects- the almost unanimous sentiment of the American peo ple. Every citizen should read the President's message. It is full of patriotic interest, and it presents in concrete form the great questions that affect the welfare and honor of the nation. It Will lie Read. From the New Y'ork Evening Sun. The President's message will be more generally read than any message of recent yrars because it treats of some questions which have reached a crucial stage, such as our duty toward Cuba, Hawaiian an nexation. the Benrg sea controversy and bimetallism. President McKinley's views and recommendations are expressed in language as terse and direct as to the na ture of the subjects treated will permit. Peaee With Arbitration. From the New York Herald. Here i?! th" high-water mark of the mes sage: "The best sentiment of the civilized world," says the President, "Is moving to ward the settlement of differences between notions without resorting to the horrors of war. Treaties embodying these humane principles on broad lines without in any way Imperiling our Interests or our honor shall have my constant encouragement." This is a high concession to the spirit of the hour. Truly, as the President says, the best sentiment of civilization moves to ward peace with arbitration. A summer campaign will waste the Industry of a gen eration. It is not war alone, but the losses which come as Its sinister aftermath, such as our own generation of pension burden.-*. A wise Congress will follow as sailing di rections. "Peace with Industry at home; peace with arbitration abroad." We do not crave an interesting session, or brilliant debates, or coruscating statesmanship. We have had enough of war, more than enough of jingoism, and i ow peace. Peace with Industry at home. Peace with arbitration abroad. These are the watchwords of the hour. And as Congress heeds them with vigilance, courage and hope, it will be well for Con gress and the people. These words are the alpha and omega of American statesman ship. Conservative Cuban Policy. From the Baltimore Sun. The best part of the message is that which Is devoted to the consideration- of the Cuban question, which is treated at length In a lone of great moderation and conservatism, of sound statesmanship and patriotism. The considerations by which the President professes to be governed are those which Influenced the action of Gen eral Grant (.from whom he liberally quotes) during the eight years of his administra tion. and which controlled the action of Mr. Cleveland, only strengthened, as Mr. McKinley points out, by the lecent action of Spain and the duty Imposed upon our government and people of awaiting the re sults of the changed policy of the liberal ministry of Senor Sagasta and the milder methods of General Ulanco. A recognition of the Independence of Cuba under present conditions wonld be. In the President's. Judgment, "Impracticable and Indefensi ble." and a recognition of belligerency "un wise and, therefore. Inadmissible." "In tervention upon humanitarian grounds" In the face of what Spain otters and of tb* ??T,S '?UCd ;steps already taken in the direction autonomy of the is 'aPf' a"d f"r-Thi' Jemoval of the causes strlfn i^fa , to the Present unhappy "?ulA *?- *?llally uncalled for and . ^e,same tln?e the President ofev!?wtji AnS-jif?

Thus, on the subjects of Hawaiian annexation, the staling contro versy, International bimetallism, reciproc ity negotiations, 'arbitration and the In dians, the President briefly acquaints the country with the latest facts anu accom panies them with a forecast or the results which he anticipates. It is peculiarly grati fying at a time when the improving condi tion of affairs Is still susceptible to ail verse influences, however slight, that he is able to take a thoroughly sanguine view of the near future. The most devotee! friends ot good government, and republicans ln i>ar ticular, by whom the elevation of the civil service has been faithfully promoted, will -note with pleasuie the President's pledge to promote that process by all the means In his power. Knrnext 11 nil WInf. From tile l'lillnriclphlu Press. President MeKlnley's first annual mes sage thoroughly reflects the intellectual and moral qualities of the author, it is frank, direct, luoid, earnest and wise. It is the product of it sincere man, a cleir thinker, a trained and experienced legis lator and a practical and sagacious states man. It will deepen the steadily growing conviction of th(j ecuntry that the helm of the government jfe in tlie hands of a sane, wholesome aix^gfecreet ruler who brings to the lilgli the largest sense and the purest -tar*'v.

RitliliiiiiiT- Aiueri: mii. Many will ragr-t Uiat the President still clings to the idea of Jlrvternatlonal bimetal lism. He considers the work of the com mission most successful as far as It has gone, .'tti4i says the commission Is still en gaged in negotiatk ns v,*itii several coun tries, which he does not mention. A (<ooil ( hurt by Which to Slerr. From the PlilladflphU Timif1*. While the President's annual message contains a great ileal of that "information of the state of the L'nion," which the Con stitution directs him, from time to time, to give to the Congress, the greater part of It Is rightly devoted to the two subjects of most conspicuous importance, the currency and Cuba. It indicates a clear understand ing of many con7?i>-x subjects that come before the executive, and its recommenda tions arc generally sound and Interesting. The paragraph oh. the Civil service is evi dently sltut-re, shows no sign of sur render to,the dMapialuing influence of the spoilsman. FintvlrV, theimossage ends with the significant Sentence that "It Is a com manding duty to'Reepthe appropriations within the receipts of tlie government, and thus avoid a deficit." 1 This Is the real-secret of the "deficit"? not Insufficient revenues, hut excessive ap propriations. And It is by restraining the expenses of the government within the limits of probable 1 evenues, instead of reaching out over land and sea for new fields of expenditure, that th > deficit is to be avoided. The President has thus given to the Congress, on all domestic affairs at least, a good churt by which to steer. A Satisfactory )lFnmigr, From the Allwny Joiirn.il. 'rh(' message sent to Congress today by the President of the I'nited States will have a reassuring effect on the countrv, and Is calculated to stimulate all Interests. It confirms the opinion that has been en tertained that we are to have an adminis tration firm but conservative; vigilant in defending American interests wherever found and yet moderate in all Its dealings. >o Truce of Jlnffolmu, From the 1'hllmlelpbiu Itecord. There is no trace of jingoism ln the dis cussion of the attitude of Che United States toward Spain and her rebellious colony. The efforts of the Spanish government to put an end to the rebellion by the promise of home rule to the Cubans, by the aban donment of the atrocious methods adopted t>y General Weyler, and by the substitution or civilized warfare for savagery, are recognized as sufficient reasons for delaying the acknowledgment of Cuban Independent or belligerency, or forcible Intervention on Ihl ?' thf!, I'nited States.

EYES. EnfClluli I'apcrn Generally Find Fault With the HfNNiise. LONDON, December 7.?The St. James Gazette, this afternoon, commenting upon President McKinley's message to Congress, says: "It has disappointed everybody in the attempt to give universal satisfaction. Pres ident McKinley Is in an unpleasant posi tion, having to sit on the fence. As a whole. It locks like an early confessicn of a great failure." The Pall Mall Gazette takes a favorable view of the presidential message and criti cises the comments of the Times, remark ing that it is as impossible "to deal witn the Ctiban question without offending Spain as it would be to deal with Armenia with out offending the sultan." The Globe is of the opinion that it "would have taxed the abilities even of a great statesman" to deal with the question satis factorily, adding: "Although all the arguments against the annexation of Cuba are equally applicable to Hawaii, the United States is determined to have the latter, though America, a fourth-rate naval power as it is. can only hold Hawaii on sufferance. In the event ot war she would be bundled out. neck and crop, by any tirst-rate power which tinds it necessary to occupy the island." Dally Telegraph's View. The Daily Telegraph, commenting editori ally on President McKinley's message this morning, says: "It used to be America's proud boast that she had no foreign policy. Judging from President McKiniey's message the new world Is no more free from the burdens of diplomatic negotiations than the old. In a document of portentous length, mostly In tended for Spanish consumption, President MoKlnley has devised a specious pretext for gaining time. It contains passages that will certainly wound Spain's national sus ceptibilities. The whole tone, though meant to be conciliatory, savors too much of the magistrate availing himself of the offend er's act to be very conciliatory at Madrid." Culled Weak and Colorless. The Daily Chronicle describes the mes sage as "weak and colorless compared with vigorous handling of public questions to which jlr. Cleveland accustomed us." It says: "The explanation of this is simple. Mr. Cleveland was in front -of Congress; Mr. McKinley is behind it. The President's comments on the currency issue are posi tively childlike in their simplicity. It is safe to prophesy that his treatment of the Cuban question will be received with a storm. The annexation of Cuba would be a deplorable mistake; but the reason for re fraining from that course are not the milk and water ones Mr. McKinley advances." The Morning Poet, after paying a trib ute to the President's "fine sense of duty, in the face of domestic trouble, in sending the message at the appointed hour," says: "The message advocates a scheme of legis lative effort less short-sighted and less cal culated to set class against class than the misguided policy cf the last session. On the Cuban question the President is vague and diffuse, but studiously correct." Thunderer's Vsual Growl. The Times says: "Its tore of patronizing tolerance will make the message not whol ly agreeable to Spain. Probably the Pres ident calculates that if he can satisfy the jingoes for a time with eloquent denuncia tions and warnings, he will find it easier to pursue a moderate policy. "Regarding his currency proposals, It seems too probable that Mr. McKinley still clings to the notion that something may be done for silver. So long as he follows that will-o'-the-wisp he can hardly be expected to attempt any thoroughgoing reform of the currency. An Viewed In Hovaan. A special to the New York Herald from Havana last night says: A summary of President McKinley's message, published in the afternoon papers, exercised a distinctly calming effect on the sentiment of vague unrest which has pervaded Havana during the last few days. Expressions of satisfaction because of the dignified, conservative tone of the message are heard on all sides. On the part of the autonomists it was greeted as an assur ance that the people of the United States hold friendly sentiments toward Spain, and that no fears need be entertained that every consideration will be accorded to the government in its efforts to pacify the Is land by the speedy establishment of an autonomic regime. Among the American colony apprehen sions of a popular demonstration from a possibility of resentment to American In terference were laid at rest. On the part of Cuban sympathisers some disappoint ment Was expressed, but by this element the action- of the President was generally foretold.and discounted. Secretary General Congas to. speaking for Captain General Blanco, said that the ut terances of the President were, in general, viewed wkh satisfaction, their only objec tion to the message being that Its phrasing might possibly leave many loopholes on wtslffi false hopes might be founded by the supporters of the policy of Interference.

A number of well-known theatrical peo ple were drinking and chatting in a North 6th street saloon a. few nights ago. when a tough-looking specimen of the genus hobo blew into the place and approached the group at the bar. He wa&^shaggy and unkempt, and the effects of years of con- 1 stant tippling were apparent in the rich coloring of his nose. In a very husky " eafy Willie voice he asked if he' and his pal might entertain the crowd. This per mission being granted, he went to the door and called out: "Chang!" The crowd was amazed to see a disreputable-looking Chinaman come ambling in and stand by the tramp's side. With a short Introduc tion the oddly-assorted pair went to work and displayed some really remarkable feats in legerdemain, one feat in particular prov ing very mystifying. This was to allow any person to take his own penknife and plunge the blade into the Celestial s arm or leg In any spot he pleased. After repeated encores mind reading was resorted to and a really fine exhibition was given. After thia one of the audience, who was recognized as a magician, drew the pair aside and tried to bargain for the secret of the knife trick. The men wouldn't tell, however, and after about $3 had been col lected they departed. After Tweaty-Sevea Years. Ftom the Syracuse Herald. C. P.
