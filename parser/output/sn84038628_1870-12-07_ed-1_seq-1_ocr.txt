Established Oct. 18, 1851 i IFF ICIAL CITY & COUNTY PAPER A Chignon Horror ia Fulton County. The Lewistowa (Fultoa county) Union reports that the daughter of an acquaint auoe, in the southern part of thai county, lately tonod her bair comiujr out to an unusual extent, and wai alto troubled with cuutinuoua itching ou tha bavk pari of her head. As a matter of course too youug lady wore a chignon. Ivpon examination of her acalp, beoeaih the chignon, it waa found to be covered with smell black inaect about the aiza ot a grain of wheat, which had eaten into bar head and down her neck in a moat frightful manner. Says the Union : , Toia ' head gee" ia ma.de of sea moss, aud it ii supposed to coo lain the eggs of aa insect which were, incubated by the warmth of the head.- The vermin were at last removed, though not without considerable trouble and pain. The ceie wus at first reported to be critical, but lately we learn that the lady ia recovering. She will how ever, lose all the bair whioh grows on the back part of ber head, but will no doubt, consign to the flames the chignon. -A si.uilar cast, near Fertnington, it report ea as proving latai, tae truth ot which we are unable to vouch for. But the developetneott of the case meo tioned ought to banish from society thit unsightly fashion. Already a number of ladies, hearing of this case, have consigned to the Uamet their chignons, and do doubt many others who wear them will do the same thiug. Baltimore gave a Democratio majority of S.aOO, although about 8,650 negro voters were registered. The Baltimore American an intensely Radical journal, save the re suit of the election proves "that the negro is an element of weakness and not of strength'' as was supposed, to the Radical party. The same view of the case ia taken by some of the Radical papers in Indiana. In their oom meets on the October election in that State a iac aa over tne oountry the r,J9 are in deep mourning over their treacherous bant ling. They made him a voter to vote their own Radioal candidate into power and keep htm there Bat Sambo is no fool, even if his skull is is a little obdurate, and when voting day comes, goes for principles con. sequrtntly vote the straight Democratic ticket.

The administration intends that the loss must be borne by the holders, altogether the offence was the result of official negligence.

The London Standard says that the Gladstone ministry it preparing for an in famous and disastrous capitulation to Russia. In spite of Granville' resistance, the con ference has been accepted without the withdrawal of the Russian note. The mere meeting of the powers will be the virtual submission to all that Russia asks.

As oe had at the time at his disposal 200,000 able bodied men and nve hundred cannon entrenched in a fortified camp, protected by toe rmea guns ot the naval artillery, we aaked him to attempt resistance aud to hold Orleans against the enemy.

The committee are uninformed as to the tubseqnent movements of the army of the Loire. " The proclamation is considered by many -is a charge of incapacity and treachery against DePaldines. Bkulin, Deo. 7. A dispatch from Ver sailles dated Monday, announces that an officer was tent from the King's headquar ters on Monday morning, into Paris with a letter to the Government, stating that the city of Orleans had been captured by the Prussians. That the army of the Loire had oeen routed, and lost thirty guns and several thousand prisoners were taken. Gen. Ducrot is supposed to have been killed in the retreat across the Mint. Washington, Dec. 7. It is thought that Admiral Porter's chances of being confirm -d as full Admiral, have been greatly damaged by his attempts to repudiate his letter on Grant. There is a rumor that more of the same sort will be brought to light, by the late head of the Navy Depart ment, who is interesting himself in the matter. The parties explanation of his scarlet letter, as published to day, is looked upon by every body here, as a very weak and unmanly affair, and as doing him more harm than good.
