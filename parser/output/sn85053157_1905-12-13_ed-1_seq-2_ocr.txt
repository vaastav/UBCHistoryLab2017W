The River Press Published every Wednesday Morning by the River Press Publish ing Company. LEASING THF. PfBLIC DOMAIN. That portion of the president'« mes Bape which suggests a change in pub lie land matters by adopting a lease system is of special interest to those engaged in the livestock industry The president's remarks in this con nection were in part as follows: Once again I call your attention to the condition of the public land laws Recent developments have given new a urgency to the need of such changes as will fit these laws to actual present conditions. The honest disposal and right use of the remaining public lands is of fundamental importance. The iniquitous methods by which the inon opolizing of the public lands is being brought about under the present laws are becoming more generally known, but the existing laws do not furnish effective remedies. The recommenda tions of the public lands commission upon this subject are wise and should be given effect. The creation of small irrigated farms under the réclamation act is i powerful offset to the tendency of cer tain other laws to foster or permit monopoly of the land. Under that act the construction of irreat irrigation works lias been proceeding rapidly and successfully, the lands reclaimed are eagerly taken up, and the pros pect that the policy of national irriga» tion will accomplish all that was ex pected of it is bright. The act should be extended to include the state of Texas. The reclamation act derives much of its value from the fact that It tends to secure the greatest possible number of homes on the land, and to create com munities of freeholders in part by set tlement of public land, in part by forcing the subdivision of large pri vate holdings before they can get wa ter from government irrigation works. The law requires that no right to the use of water for land in private owner ship shall be sold for a tract exceed ing 160 acres to any one land owner. This provision has excited active and powerful hostility, but the success of the law itself depends on the wise and firm enforcement of it. We cannot af ford to substitute tenants for free holders on the public domain. The greater part of the remaining public lands cannot be irrigated. They are at present and will probably al ways be of greater value for grazing than for any other purpose. This fact has led to the grazing homestead of 640 acres in Nebraska and to the pro posed extension of it to other states. It is argued that a family cannot be supported on 160 acres of arid grazing land. This is obviously true; but nei ther can a family be supported on 640 acres of much of the land to which it Is proposed to apply the grazing home stead. To establish universally auy euch arbitrary limit would be unwise at the present time. It would prob ably result on the oue hand la enlarg ing the holdings of some of the great land owners, and on the other in need less suffering and failure on the part of a very considerable proportion of the bona fide settlers who givo faith to the implied assurance of the govern ment that such an area is sufficient The best use of the public grazing lands requires the careful examination and classification of these lands in order to give each settler land enough to support his family and no more While this work is being doue, and until the lands are settled, the govern meut should take control of the open range, uuder reasonable regulations suited to local needs, following the general policy already in successful operation on the forest reserves is probable that the present gra/.ing value of the open public range is scarcely more than half what it once was or what it might easily airain be under careful legislation. The forest policy of the administra tiou appears to enjoy the unbroken support of the people. The ere at users of timber are themselves for warding the movement for forest pre servatiou. All organized opposition to the forest reserves in the west has disappeared. Since the consolidation of all government forest work In the national forest service there has been a rapid and notable gain in the use fulness of the forest reserves to the people and in public appreciation of their value. The national parks with in or adjacent to forest reserves should be transferred to the charge of he forest reserve service also. 

MONTANA 11EET St'GAIt. Advices from the Yellowstone valley Indicate that sugar made from beets grown in that part of Montana will be on the market next seasou. It is an nounced that a factory will surely be built at Billings, and there is every probability that a similar plant will be established at Bozeman in time to handle next year's beet crop. The labor problem, the greatest difficulty encountered by the promoters of these enterprises, is said to have been solved by an arrangement with a J apanese syndicate to furnish all the help needed at a stipulated price based upon the acreage under cultivation. Some interesting facts about beet sugar production are given in a bulle tin issued by the Montana experiment station, which says the location in any community of a beet sugar factory of a capacity of 600 tons—the most approved and economical unit—means the purchase of 60,000 tons of beets from the farmers of the immediate neighborhood, at an average of $5 per ton, and a pay roll disbursement of t60,000 per annum—a total of 9360,000 paid in cash to such community dur ing the fall and winter months. The effect of the distribution of this enor mous sum, in addition to the ordinary disbursements, may easily be con ceived. The bulletin states that the follow ing are the essential requirements of location for a successful factory: First—Beets, in sufficient quantity and of the required sugar content and purity. It is unprofitable to work beets containing less than 12 per cent, of sugar, and they should rather aver* age 14 per cent. Anything above this average is so much better. The purity of the beet is of equal, if not greater, importance and should be at least 80 per cent, or better. Beets of high purity and comparatively low sugar content yield more sugar than those of higher sugar content and low purity. By purity, or the coefficient of purity, as it is technically called, is meant the ratio of the sugar to the solid contents of the juice. On general principles, the acreage required for a plant of any capacity shoukl be ten times the daily tonnage capacity: for a 000 ton plant, 6,000 acres. A trifle smaller acreage in ir rigated sections might suffice, as the tonnage product is apt to be, with proper care, nearly 50 per cent, greater. Second—Water. The water supply should be at all times adequate and not subject to fluctuations or failure, and as free as possible from mineral matter. At least 3,000,000 gallons daily are required for the operation of a 600 ton factory: and the source of supply should always be reason ably near the factory site, to avoid excessive pumping apparatus and op erating expenses. Third—Drainage. As the above quantity of water must be discharged from the factory heavily contaminat ed with 9oil washed from beets, with the waste lime and impurities removed from the beets and juice in the pro* cess of refining, it should not be al lowed to flow into any natural water course used below for domestic pur poses. Fourth—Money. Without this all the others are valueless so far as the establishment of this industry is con cerned. To construct and properly equip a modern sugar beet factory, the cost will be approximately $1,000 for each ton of daily capacity; that is, a 600 ton plant will cost about $600,000. This does not Include the cost of railway switches, purchases of seed, or agricultural expenses, for which and for a small working capital a further sum should be raised, varying with the conditions. This amount of money must be fully assured from some reliable source before it is at all safe to enter into any contract for construction. TWO CANAL IUIL1HNG STOKIIS. A writer in Maxwell's Talisman maeks an effective and interesting com parison between the cost and benefit of the two great canal building pro jects undertaken by the federal gov eminent—the Panama enterprise and the reclamation of arid lands. After describing some features of the isth miau canal proposition, he says: Congress this winter will also pos sibly consider another canal building story, which while it is claimed to pre sent some features needing congres sional attention, Involving as it does a number of millions of dollars' ex penditure, is looked upon generally as but a small iucident In comparison with the vast possibilities to trade commerce and prosperity which will develop from au inter-oceanic canal. Let us sum up a few of the geueral facts in connection with the two pro jects—the Panama caual aud irriga tiou caual building, which is the other subject referred to. As an engineering project the Pan ama caual may cost half a billion dol lars—it is, as a matter of fact, con ceded that the present estimates are entirely inadequate to consummate this vast project. The interior department has m course of construction irrigation works which will water something over a million acres at a cost of about $30.000,000, or on an average acreagc charge of probably about $30. Offi cial estimates of that department place the ultimate rcclaimablc area of the American desert at about 70 million acres. It is not expected that this will be reclaimed at oucc. But sup posing that the popular sentiment of the country favored irrigation eaual building as strongly as it favors isth mian canal building and that the two projects would be completed at about the same time, say 20 years hence, what would we have? The Panama canal costing half a billion dollars and 70 million acres of new irrigated homes costing, on the above basis, $2,100,000,000. The engineering work on the irrigation project would thus be four times the magnitude of the Panama canal project. The value of these two schemes of development can not be as easily com pared. It is an open question as to how much of a benefit the Panama ca nal will be to the country. Most peo ple who are characterized as broad minded, believe that a Panama canal will be of great strategic importance from a military point of view, and that of still greater moment, the com merce of the country will be vastly benefited; that we will have a quick and sure means of intercourse be' tween the throbbing hives of manufac turing industry in the eastern half of the United States and the vast and rich trade fields of the Orient; but there are other eminent and sagacious statesmen who have never favored cut ting the western hemisphere in two and who now predict that with the suc cess of Japanese arms and the open and expressed determination of Ja pan to develop her manufacturing in dustries, by the time the canal is fin ished we will find the Oriental market practically controlled by the "Yan kees of the East." What does the project of the irriga tion of the arid lands hold out? There is no difference of opinion, there can be no question on this subject. Prob ably the majority of the people of the United States and certainly many so called astute politicians in and out of congress, fail to realize the potential greatness of the irrigation proposi tion—in a word, they are apathetic; but among those who have given any serious consideration to this subject, there is but one verdict. The recla mation of this vast inland empire will constitute an internal development which will surpass anything which has ever been witnessed in the world's history. The settlement of these great tracts of desert into countless small rural homes and the regeneration of the dry but fabulously rich desert soil into a gigantic garden will form a home market for the United States far ahead of anything which our com merce enjoys at present. All in all, it may occur to the closer students of our internal affairs that perhaps the Panama canal project is not really the greatest and most prom ising work upon which the nation is engaged, especially when it is con sidered that the need is becoming more pressing every year for an outlet to our rapidly advancing population, both through domestic increase and heavy immigration. Indian and White Man. Senator Long, of Kansas, was asked what he thought of the oft-repeated as sertion that Indian agents generally manage to rob those whoäe interests they are supposed to guard. By way of indirect but none the less pithy re ply, he said: "Many years ago a chief of the Yankton Sioux was dis cussing this subject. He was a natu ral orator, as are many of his race. 'You pick out the poorest man you have,' said he, 'to send up here and give us our goods. When the agent comes here he is poor, but he soon gets rich. After he gets rich he goes away and another poor man comes, and he gets rich and goes away. This is kept up year in and year out. Now, my white friends, there are a g-r-e-a-t m-a-n-y poor white men and there are some thieves.' I have always heard that this old chief was a very wise man." From $7 to $15,000,000. A striking career was that of the late Charles Hackley, lumberman and philanthropist, of Muskegon, Mich. Hackley went to Muskegon when a mere boy, In 1856, with only $7 In his pocket, having worked his passage across Lake Michlgau on a schooner. He amassed a great fortune, his wealth at*his death being estimated at $15,000,000, while his benefactions to Muskegon alone amounted to more than $4,000,000. Although he Is said to have contributed to every church in the city, he never attended any, and never witnessed a performance in a theatre. Would Chungc Naturalization Law Washington , Dec. 5.— President Hoosevelt today transmitted to the house the report of the commission on naturalization appointed March i, last, by executive order. The report contains records and the draft of a bill for uniform naturalization methods. The features of the commission's bill as outlined in the president's message contemplate dispensing with the applicant's preliminary declara tion of intention to become a citizen aud confine the jurisdiction to confer naturalization to the federal courts, and, in certain cases, to state courts possessing civil jurisdiction. The bill also provides that no certificate of naturalization shall be granted au til after the expiration of 1*0 days from the time of the filing of the peti tion.

EI.KIXS WANTS COMPROMISE. Railroad Senator Submits Plans of Gov ernment Rate Regulation. Washington , Dec. 5. — Senator Elkins, chairman of the committee of interstate commerce, after the presi dent's message today made the fol lowing statement regarding railroad rate legislation: "As I understand it, the president does not desire to vest in the commis sion arbitrary and uncontrolled pow er to fix rates. He has repeatedly stated that the action of -the commis sion in fixing a rate should be sub ject to a review by the courts, and that the railway company should be furnished legal protection against any injustice. That being the case, a law giving to the commission power to fix rates should not be drawn in such manner as to give the commission purely executive discretion in fixing rates. It should give to the commis sion power to change any rate only if the existing rate be unreasonable, or otherwise in violation of the interstate commerce act, and it shoulà give to the commission power to change a rate that is unreasonable or otherwise unlawful only to the extent that such change may be necessary in order to remove the unreasonableness or other illegality of the rate. In other words, it should only give to the commission power to reduce a rate to the maxi mum that would be reasonable and lawful if originally imposed by the railway company. A statute can be drawn to effect this result. If those who advocate vesting in the interstate commerce commission the power to fix rates are in good faith seeking to car ry out the policy of the president, they should be willing to accept a statute giving to the commission the power to fix rates substantially in the following terms: 'Whenever any rate, fare or charge fixed by any common carrier for any service shall be unreasonable or un justly discriminatory, the interstate commerce commission shall have power, after investigating the facts and hearing the parties affected, to make an order modifying such rate, fare or charge so far as may be necessary in order to remove the un reasonableness, unjust discrimination or other illegality thereof; and such order shall take effect at the expira tion of such time as the commission shall prescribe, not less than days after publication thereof. Any party affected by any order shall be en> titled to institute a proceeding to re view such order in the circuit court of the United States in any district through which the line carrier may run. a Gold Heart For Roosevelt. Washington , Dec. 5. — A gold heart was presented today to Presi dent Roosevelt in behalf of the people of Colorado by Representative Bo nynge of Denver. The heart, which was of unalloyed gold, was enclosed in a handsome case bearing this in scription: "From the heart of the Rocky mountains, this symbol of pure Colo rado gold, I« sent by men, women and children, rich and poor sharing alike, to Theodore Roosevelt, president of the United States, whose great heart brought peace to the people of Japan and Russia. Thanksgiving day, 1905, A. D." The money to pay for the gift was raised by popular subscription, many of the subscriptions being one penny each. In all, 8,000 pennies were sub scribed. Montana Matters In Washington. w ashington , Dec. 5.—Representa tive Dixon has introduced a bill de signed to open the Fort Peck Indian reservation for settlement. The gen eral provisions of the bill are similar to those providing for the opening of the Flathead Indian reservation. State Engineer John W. Wade, rep resenting the Montana state land board, today continued his conference with Representative Dixon and Secre tary of the Interior Hitchcock relative to the enactment of a law allowing the state of Montana to surrender to the government title to several thousand acres of land in Madison and Beaver head counties to be used as a reser voir for the proposed reclamation scheme under the provisions of the Cary act by the state land board. Ii these counties it is proposed to irri gate about 75,000 acres of land under the scheme. Representative Dixon to day introduced a bill to allow the state to make the necessary exchange of 1 anils, while Secretary Hitchcock expressed himself favorably regarding the bill. Representative Dixon has intro duced a bill appropriating $300,000 for the federal building at Great Falls. It is uncertain what attitude the house leaders will assume toward such appropriations this season. Ilritish Cabinet Resigns. London , Dec. 4.—The political cri sis in the United Kingdom reached a climax today, when Arthur J. Bal four. the premier, formally tendered the resignations of himself and the members of his cabinet to King Ed ward, who accepted them. His ma jesty has invited Sir Henry Campbell Bannerman to an interview tomorrow morning, when he will offer him the mission of forming a new cabinet. Sir Henry will accept the task, and within a few days, even within a few hours, a new government will be formed. There is some uncertainty as to when the dissolution of parliament will be effective, but it is not consid ered probable until after the new year. An interesting feature of the politi* cal situation is the prospect of a closer alliance between the Irish and the labor parties in the new parlia ment. James Keir Hardie, the social ist and independent member, in a po litical speech tonight, frankly Invited such an alliance. He pointed out that 45 labor members, combined with 75 Irish members, would provide a vot ing strength which no government, however stromr, could afford to ig A New British Premier. London , Dec. 5.— After a conference of an hour this tnorr with the king, Sir Henry Campbe. * innerman ac cepted the position of p -.nier. It was agreed to form a new cabinet. Before going to the palace Camp bell-Bannerman received a visit from the duke of Devonshire, a member of the unionist and free trade parties. It is believed that if Bannerman has allied himself with Devonshire, home rule will be sidetracked for the tariff question and, for a while at least, free trade will be the paramount issue of the new ministry.
