Scraps and |acts. ? "The consumer is the man 1 am after." These words were attributed to James B. Duke, the tobacco magnate, by Albert H. HIKman, a tobacco Jobber, who was a witness today in the $300,000 damage suit brought by John E. Locktr, of Brooklyn, against the American Tobacco company, which is being tried in the United States court in New York. Hillman described a discussion regarding tobacco prices he had with Duke about the time of the organization of the Metropolitan Tobacco company, which it was claimed was the local selling agent of the American. He said he protested that jobbers could not stand an advance in prices and Duke replied: "Raise your price to the retailer. Let the retailer raise his price to the consumer. The consumer is the man I am after. If the retailers won't raise pricts we will establish retail stores of our own." Counsel for Locker offered evidence to show that the American Tobacco company had conspired to injure Independent jobbers, but the court ruled out such testimony. ? Alexander Scott, or "Lucky" Scott, or "Death Valley Scotty," arrived in IMeW lorn it tew ua> a a?u nviu ? ,?? Cruz, Mexico, on the Ward liner Esperanza after a seven weeks' visit, says a dispatch. Scott says he represents friends of Felix Diaz, and that he and four Americans went to Mexico on a secret mission. They were joined there by some more Americans, and he has left eleven of the mysterious friends, behind. He said they conducted their business with Diaz in his ceil through Diaz's lawyer. Diaz, he said had been removed from his cell in the municipal castle to the fortress of San Juan de Ulua, which commands the entrance U the harbor of Vera Cruz and which was stormed by Gen. Winfield Scott. From here, Felix Diaz is allowed to send out and buy such fare as the prison does not provide. "Diaz was double-crossed," says Scott. "He had an army around Vera Cruz of from 2,800 to 3,000 men and he had good machine guns. Gen. Pascal, an old college chum of his, sent him a letter in which he said he was going to join Diaz with a force of 600 men. Diaz trusted him and invited him to come to Vera Cruz. Pascal marched into Vera Cruz at the head of his complement, showing the Diaz colors. Diaz met him, alone and unarmed. in a public square in Vera Cruz and Pascal took him prisoner. Pasea . troops made just a show .of fightinr ' awe the townspeople. I found the sentiment of the country generally in favor of Diaz." ? Leading members of the Atlanta bar are so outraged at public utterances made by Rev. Hugh Wallace, pastor of the Jones Avenue Baptist church, reflecting on the honor and integrity of the judges of the loca'. courts, that they are talking of prosecuting the minister for slander. The Rev. Mr. Wallace Is quoted as saying from his pulpit: "Justice in Fulton county is weighed by the dollar mark. God have mercy on the courts of a community when they reach such a condition as this!" And further in the same sermon, "Red handed murderers have been turned loose on this community by the courts simply because they were backed by money and influence. It is a shame, men who are guilty of cold-blooded heinous crimes should go free and disgrace the name of justice. simDly because they have money and influence." The charges of the Rev. Mr. Wallace have made a stir all the more sensational because never before in this generation has a Judge of an Atlanta court been accused of venality. "This preacher should be made to prove his charges or should be forced to leave the community," said an officer of the bar association yesterday. The Judge of the superior criminal court in this city, Hon. L. S. Roan, is an upright, God-fearing gent'eman a Christian and a splendid character. The whole personnel of the Judges on the Atlanta bench is such as to place them individually above the reach of such outrageous slander as that indulged in by this minister, but his utterances none-the-less hurt the community; they hurt the dignity of the law; they are sensational and miserably untrue." ? Washington, December 11: Denunciation of the legal procedure undei which a "brown-hued, black-skinned thick-lipped, brutal-hearted African can walk into an office of the law and demand an edict guaranteeing him legal wedlock to a white woman," was one of the many sensational features ol a speech in the house today by Representative Rodenberry. of Georgia, in favor of a resolution he had introduced earlier, to prevent inter-marriages ol whites and negroes. Mr. Roddenberr} prophesied that the legal sanction oi mixed marriages ultimately might bring this country to a conflict. He declared that "no brutality, infamy or degradation in all the days of southern slavery possessed such villianous char acteristics and atrocious qualities" as mixed marriages." The measure, a direct result of the recent marriage of Jack Johnson, the negro pugilist, with a white girl, did not get to a vote. In Chicago, Mr. Roddenberry said, not only is the white slave traffic carried on, but "the white girls of this country are made the slaves of an African brute, sanctioned by the laws of the state, and solemnized by a form of the marriage ceremony." Mr. Roddenberr> added: "We say this is a great country with its morals, traditions, virtues and examples deserving to be emulated and envied by the other countries of. the earth. But we see an African wit! much brutal force, with no moral character, with no stamina, entering the office of a probating magistrate or other legal officer in that city and calling on him to issue 'to me. Jack Johnson'?a marriage license to wed a young American woman, of our own blood, our own color." The speaker declared that "in the fe'lowship between the blacks and the whites in the south, the blacks respected the superiority of their former masters and would commit self-destruction before entertaining a thought of matrimony with a Caucasian girl." ? Wytheville, Dec. 11: Thirty-five years in the penitentiary was the pen alty Sidna Allen will pay for the part he played in the shooting up of Carroll county court house on the fourth of March last, when five persons, including the presiding judge, the sheriff and the commonwealth's attorney were killed by members of the Allen clan and a number of others wounded. Allen's nephew, Wesley Edwards, will spend twenty-seven years in the penitentiary. These two sentences were the result of a compromise this afternoon following a verdict of voluntary manslaughter In the case of Sidna Allen for the murder of commonwealth's attorney William M. Foster the jury fixing the penaltj In that case at five years' imprison- , ment. Allen already had been found guilty of second degree murder at a former trial for the killing of Judge Massie, for which he had been sentenced to fifteen years in the penitentiary , and the other indictment pending against him for the murder of Sheriff Webb was compromised by letting him , plead guilty to second degree murder and take a fifteen year sentence, the combined sentences making 35 years. 1 Three indictments against Wesley Ed- ( wards also were compromised, he tak- , Ing a sentence of nine years' imprisonment on each. In the second trial of ' Sidna Allen, which ended today, nine s of the jurors on the first ballot stood j for acquittal and the other three for murder in the second degree. Following their discharge, the jurors in an interview declared that not one of them i thought the evidence presented by the j state was sufficiently strong to sustain tne cnarge or conspiracy. mis enas. so far as the courts are concerned, a tragedy which was without parallel and which stirred the country from one en to another. On the fourth of last J March following the conviction of j Floyd Al'en of an offense which would , have sent him to the peniuntiary for one year, members of the Allen family, clannish mountaineers, opened fire on ' the court officials. At the first volley, ; Judge Thornton L. Massie fell mortalij wounded, and when the smoke had cleared away. Sheriff Webb and Com- ! monweaith Attorney Foster also were I found dead. On the following day one ( of the three jurors who were shot died of his wounds, as did also Miss Bettie 1 Ayres. who had been a witness against I Floyd Allen. Floyd Allen was arrested i on the day following the tragedy being too bad'y wounded to escap . The ar- ' rest of the others implicated in the 1 shooting, followed at various intervals.

YORKVIUJE. S. C.? FRIDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1912. c We are betting on the appointment of r J. William Thurmond for district at- c torney. This is under the arrangement 8 where the senators will dominate the r situation. , m , r "Provided, that no postmaster shall c be appointed who is personally objectionable to either of the senators." Al- r though that does not mean "standing 1 by one's friends," there is no discount * on the "punishment of enemies." J Just what has become of Felix Diaz * it is hard to say. Not long ago it was 1 reported thot he was killed, and now * Death Valley Scotty is being quoted as 0 saying that he is in i rison in Vera [ Cruz. 1 , . , t Speaking of the probable enforce- * ment of the anti-gambl'ng law in eon- " nection with the Charleston race track, 11 when an effort was made years ago to c enforce the dispensary law, did not the e Charleston grand Juries refuse to re- c turn true hills? _ c An Associated Press dispatch from ^ Washington says that a resolution offerred by Representath e Roddenberry of Georgia to prevent marriages between whites and blacks did not get a f vote. We cannot understand why, un- ' less the southern representatives thought the Georgian was merely mak- . ing a bid for notoriety; but the dlspatch does not explain. ' * ' n Both Taft and Roosevelt are quoted p as saying t^iat they will not again be q candidates for the presidency. While of r course the country has seen that such a declarations do not necessarily mean 0 anything, if it does turn out that way. / the Democrats had better take warn- t ing. It was only the personal quarrel ^ between Taft and Roosevelt that split t the Republican party and made the b ;reat victory of November possible. If s the Democrats can stand together un- c der Wilson he will lead them to estab- c Mshed security; but it will not take c much quarreling to give the Republi- e ?ans a return to power. p ? p It is understood that Mrs. Dugas. f formerly Mrs. B. R. Tlllrian, Jr., is not v at all satisfied with the decree of the c supreme court as to the disposition of b ner cniiaren. wnue lecnnicauy inr J new decree does not constitute a re- f versal of the former decree, in practi- c cal effect it may operate as such rever- t sal. The former decree save the chil- a dren to the mother absolutely. It war u based principally on testimony that a went to show that the father was unfit t for the custody because of alleged addiction to the excessive use of alcoholic liquors. In the present case what the * court considered to be the preponder- 1 ance of the testimony, went to show 3 that the husband had reformed and on a the strength of that showing, the court v saw proper to give him a right to see 5 the children at certain fixed times. A? v to what might happen in the future, un- 1 der these conditions is a matter of a speculation in which the human nature v element will have to be tt.ken as figur- c ing quite largely. If the mother does 3 not live up absolutely to the orders of 11 the court In both letter and spirit, it is n likely that there will be further ordnrr a that will still further change the situ- 8 ation. The recent decree of the court n did not require the father to provide e for the support of the children and a 1 report has gone out from Columbia. ? suggesting that the mother may sue v for alimony; but there is no tangible foundation for the suggestion. m b The Yorkville Enquirer remarks: "The version (of the Richmond inci- n dent) given out by the governor, which v ;s the version taken down officially at c the convention, is very different from , that on which many newspaper comments have been based.'" It is to be tl hoped that The Enquirer wi'l point out these differences with particularity. In every essential the stenographic report furnished by the governor confirms th ti newspaper reports.?Columbia State. ri Most of the versions we have seen tl printed, simply quote the governor as b saying "to Hell with the Constitution." ti and stop there and most of the news- t< paper comments we have seen seem to w be predicated on the assumption that f< that was all there was to it. In treat- h ing the matter in this way, we think ri the newspapers have been very unjust w to themselves. An Associated Press r< version of the speech was printed in t( The Enquirer of last Friday. The full oi text, as taken down by the official ste- al nographer of the convention and re- fi produced from the Columbia State of s< i uesaay, is oeing printed xoaay. n tne w SiaU H unable to see the difference, we o. despair of being able to point that dif- si ferce out to it and shall not attempt to if do so. So far as we are concerned, how- ly ever, we desire to say as we have said g< many times in the past, that we do not tt believe in lynching under any circum- ti stances. We do not believe the practice lc is calculated to accomplish the end it k: is supposed to seek. On the contrary t? we believe that it has the opposite ef- ol feet. The only way we know of to stop al lynching is through a just and strict \V nforcement of all the laws. M ?~ c Senator Tillman is quoted as having m said in Washington: "I am sorry to 3ee that the governor of South Carolina has come into the limelight again, as it 01 will do the state no good." pi It was Senator Tillman who, while a governor, declared that he would lead of i lynching mob under certain condi- sc lions, and it is governor Etlease who hi Says that he would not order his troops di to fire on the senator and his mob un- ec Jer those same conditions. Both are fli wrong, the only technical difference pi being such as might be distinguished tu between the wrongs of omission and pr commission. There are those, no doubt, df who will give the senator credit for a be change of heart on the subject, and we sc lope that in doing so, they will not be gc mistaken. We. however, are not jump- ra ng at any such conclusion. When it th leveloped la?t summer that the govrnor had received more votes than the enator and the senator complained hat the governor had stolen the love f the senator's former friends, we hought we saw In the charge quite a lerccptible tinge of Jealousy. And if hat be true, maybe the senator is only nvious now because when he said his ittle say, it was purely for horn? conumption, while the governor has had he somewhat broader opportunity of elling what he thought about it to a tig bunch of other governors. And also, ince we have come to think about it, vhen Senator Tillman said his say, here were those who declared that it vould "do the state no good." That the completion of the Panama anal is going to have a tremendous inluence on the commerce of the world joes without saying, and that thebusiicss of the United States is going to >e tremendously affected is equally ob'ious. That the present routes of ommerce should be so shortened as to ime and distance without producing evolutionary effects somewhere, Is inonceivable; but that the United States hould be the principal beneficiary does lot necessarily follow. That will de>end upon the wisdom of our statesr^i in using the proper means to scure the desired ends, and although it s not improbable that some mistakes nay be made at first, we are confident n the belief that eventually this counry must come out on top. At a big conerence of leading commercial experts rom all parts of the south and from arious South American countries beng held in Atlanta, it was pointed out he other day that the greatest present ibstacle to securing the fullest benefits rom the canal to this country is the ack of a merchant marine. Just what his means Is not fully understood hroughout the interior of the United States; but briefly it may be comprelended In this explanation: There are omparatlvely few American vessels ngaged in the foreign trade. Amerians own many vessels In this trade; iut they are under foreign flags, prinipally British. Being under a foreign lag means many things. Among othnn u~ is uiai Luc uiiiLcio auu seamen cue ? lso foreign, and that all are subject to 1 ertaln foreign regulations. The prln- 1 Ipal reasons for this condition of af- < airs are first that snips of the same 1 onnage can be built more cheaply ' broad than In the United States and t hat foreign built ships are not entitled t o American registry and also foreign 1 egulations permit the hiring and < naintenance of crews at much less ex- t iense than do American regulations, t 'he one difficulty could be removed by 1 emovlng the tariff duties from ships nd ship building materials and the ther could be removed by allowing imerican ship owners to pay starva- t ion wages and treat their crews like t ogs; but It Is not clear that the adop- s Ion of either of these expedients would e at all desirable. The advantage of t ending out American goods in Ameri- r an bottoms, aside from the freight re- s eipts, is the better facility with which r ommercial relations may be establish- I d, and new lines of trade developed, r Cow if the United States is to be deiendent so largely upon the doings of ? oreign ship owners, all of whom an \ rorking primarily for their respective > ountries, it is only natural that such ? lenefits as will grow out of the com- j iletion of the canal will tend away rom this country, and that Is why that < onference In Atlanta so naturally r urned to the Idea of American ships * nd no less naturally seemed to agree * ipon subsidy as the quickest, easiest .nd most practical means of solving he difficulty. We are not very much Interested In he horse racing proposition any more, to be sure, we see in the situation omething like this: Race track demorllzation having run its course and shipped itse'.f out in almost every other tate In the union, has come to South larolina to avail itself of what seems o be a last foothold. We care nothing bout racing, on its merits, or otherrise. That is a personal opinion. The onsensus conclusion of ordinary obervation is that racing would never old its vogue anywhere except in conectton with the gambling feature. We gree to that. It is true that there are :ood honest men who say they have ever experienced an exaltation more xilerating than that brought about hrough drlvine their own fast trotters r riding their own runners past the ,-inning post to the tune of the tumul- ^ uous enthusiasm of yelling thousands, c 'here is something in this, no doubt; ut it takes money to bring about these onditions, more money than can be aised by legitimate purses, and no J ray has yet been found for the sue- r essful raising of this money except hrough the various forms of gambling ( hat thrive in connection with the 1 sport." Wherever horse racing has j ourished, the surrounding communi- j les have had to pay the price in cor- v uption and debauchery and generally J1 here has been no cessation of the ^ lighting effects of such dissipation un- o 1 there was little or nothing left for it 1 j feed upon. Then the moral sense ^ ^ould be awakened and there would / )llow prohibitive legislation. As we s ave suggested, the evil has already * un its course in this way almost every p here else, and that is the principal a ?ason why the racing crowd has come 1 ) South Carolina. There are twenty ' ther states that would be more prefer- g ble to this crowd, if it were not for the . ict that they have already run them- n ?lves out of these states. And that is y hat is going to happen in South Car- b lina; but not, of course, until the old :ate has paid the price like the others. | ' it were in our power, we would glad- 7 save the state what she will have to v o through; but what can we do? Have ^ .An? nAAnl/v ?i,UA f V? A " lUiac pcupic wuu rvncw auuui it at tuc j me, forgotten what happened in Co- rr imbia last winter? As soon as it was o nown that the gamblers intended to ike charge of the city, a large portion the state press raised the alarm, and tl Iter the racing was commenced, a ell-known Columbia newspaper man. [r. James A. Hoyt, then editor of the h olumbla Record, undertook to get the o latter into the courts. He did begin roceedings. But already the hotel 0, en, the cigar stands, the soft drink h ;ople, the gambling joints, the street c< ir folks and others had gotten a taste s< : what was in it for them and they >on made it so not ior Mr. Hoyt tnat i had to let loose. As it happened he ^ d not fully control the paper he was m litingr, and the controlling financial In- A jence used the means necessary to ^ it him out of business. He was vir- o) lally forced to sell his holdings. The fc ocecdings he instituted went dilly- M lily one way and another and finally icame abortive. If Mr. Hovt had been m ipported. supported with earnest vl- to ?r bv influences that are even now c< ising a hue and cry against the races e gambling horde would have been | p< >ut out of business. As it was. tti natter went to the legislature, whlc nade a big show of virtue in the cor lideration of the whole thing; but f lally wound up by the passage of a ict which reads as if it were hors< ligh, bull-strong and pig-tight; bi vnicn is not worm a mil or Diue near 'or the reason that there was left ot if it a special provision that was ir ended to insure the execution of tl aw by means of Injunction, provld* Lhat should become necessary as a la resort. Now, of course there are thoi vho will say that this Is all humbu ind It Is necessary to explain a litt further. As strong as this antl-gan ; law appears to be, it was passed :he knowledge of the fact that thei racing people Intended to abandon tl dca of further meets in Columbia, ur ess conditions should become moi propitious, and that as the local goi jrnment of Charleston is in full accoi tvlth the plans of the racing crow :here Is no danger of any really earnei effort to enforce the law. If the Injun* :ion featured had been left in, then i joon as the local Charleston author ies had clearly showed their hand, pr fate Individuals down there, wl hought otherwise, would be able t rive trouble by the same means ths VIr. Hoyt had tried to employ, with n suits so disastrous to himself in Cc nmhln Aa It Ip avopirtVilnr, I.. Im.Al 'or the continuance of the gamblin business In Charleston, and so far t ,ve are concerned we do not propose I vorry about the matter any more, n< rntil we see some evidence of oppos :ion that seems to have the stamp < >ther than purely political motives. W ire against gambling, and we woul ike to see the racing crowd run out < ;he state; but as matters stand, we s< >ut one way for it. Charleston, dif )osed that way by an overwhelmin najority anyway, is going into tl hing deliberately, and she has got 1 un her course. As to whether Charlei :on will ever get enough of It to fe< he need of reform on her own accoun ve are unable to say; but we do pr? J let that if Charleston does not ever :ually take a turn on her own accoun he time will come when the balance ( he state will be compelled, in self-d< ense, to do something. But since thi njunction provision was stricken 01 >f the bill last winter we do not s< vhere there is any Just reason for lay ng blame other than against Charlei on. If Charleston officials and Charlei on grand and petit Juries will not ac ve would be at a loss to think of an >ther effective expedient, except poss )ly martial law, and Just how that is ( :e brought about does not clearly ar )ear. The People are Honest. You can fool all the people a part < he time, and some of the people all tl ;lme; but you can't fool all the peop ill of the time. Abraham Lincoln Is commonly give he credit for having said this firs rhere are those who claim that it xvt laid long before Lincoln's day. But nakes no difference who said it firs t has always been true and it is tri iow. There are many dishonest individua imong the people; but the people as vhole are not only honest but general! orrect. The only exception Is whe ill of them may have been fooled for iart of the time. Men who are dishonest as indlvldi i's when It comes to promoting the >wn selfish interests, usually kno lght from wrong as well as other pec lie, and may be depended upon to <3 lght, unless they think they have sort lartlcular benefit to be gained by doln vrong. It is not to be claimed that major les are always right. There are tim< vhen only a part of the peop'e spea or the whole people, and just as apt e lot they may not reflect the true vole )f the whole people; but when th vhole people speak on the strength < ull information; those who disagrc ,vith the deliverance in the be'ief the s wrong, will do well to make a moi careful examination to see if mayha hey have not made up their judgmer 'rom an incorrect angle. Of course it is not to be assume n;u me people are always right, c sven that they are ever entirely rlgh or the most that can be claimed i hat when they have all the facts, the ^an be depended upon to do the bes hing that It is possible to do under th ircumstances. But the people as a whole are neve tnowingly and wilfully dishonest as In lividuals very often are.

There is considerable Interest over h the question of the remission of taxes on the district around Clover that was j swept by the terrific hail storm of last _ summer. j In his speech at the state campaign meetine. Gov. Rlpasp cairi hp a-nnM gladly do what he could for the peop e of the storm sweot district, and if it should be thought advisable, would ask the general assembly to remit all taxes or such portion of the taxes as might J be thought best this year. That the governor will make such recommendation as the best judgment ' of the people most interested, think should be made, will be taken for granted; but it should be understood that the general assembly will not necessarily follow the governor's recommenda\ tion. j The question involved is much larger I than most people have yet grasped, as I If taxes are remitted, the remission will 1 probably not only include all the prop1 erty in the town of Clover; but all that 1 embraced In the several thousand acres ? of devasted territory surrounding the L town. J But there is more to be .done than the ) mere revision of taxes, because as 1 thoughtful Clover people see, the . schools have to be provided for and 5 other things have to be looked after. . The interest on the school bonds must 1,? In ~ < f uc ^aiu. HICJC is IJU wiiii-i ?a^ IUI |i, and if the special school tax should be suspended, the flourishing school at Clover would either have to suspend or i be supoprted by private subscription, i and that after all would be a hardship : rather than a benefit, j It has been suggested and there is i something in the suggestion, that if the i state would give real aid to this district, it might assume responsibility for i all the taxes Itself. That is, let the taxes be suspended or rather remitted and then let the state make the entire amount good, i Or perhaps, If the general assembly is not willing to do this as proper a thing as it would be to do, then it might , at least suspend all state and county taxes?everything but school and bond taxes. If there is anything to be done, how-1 < ever, there must 2be some intelligent, well directed effort, to get full information. There should? be collected data that will properly define the devastated territory, and the assistance and co-operation of the county treasurer should be secured In the determination of exactly what It Is advisable to do. But in the meantime, it will be very well for all the people interested to go ahead and pay their taxes If they can, as though they were expecting no remission or abatement. The information upon which the governor and the general assembly will be expected to act will have to be gotten up as soon as possible; but the people will do well not to build thrlr hopes too high on a certainty of relief. It is possib'e that relief may be forthcoming but there Is no certainty. STORM RELIEF FUND. The members of the committee in charge of the distribution of the Clover storm relief fund are coming in for more or less erumbline. and comnlalnt because of what they have done or have not done. As stated some weeks ago, after considerable%ibor, a list of the persons to whom the money would be distributed had been compiled preparatory to sendin? out checks; but distribution was held up, pending the receipt of some i $200 reported to have been subscribed from Rock Hill and vicinity. This amount was promised for December. 1; but as it has not been forthcoming up to date, the committee has decided that it can do no better than to go ahead and distribute what it has. The amount of a hundred and a few dollars reported to have been raised by Mr. S. S. Faris, was duly paid over to the committee, and has no connection with the $200 above referred to. From the tenor of the complaints that have been received, it apprars that the writers of the complaining letters seem to think that the general distribution has already been made, although they have no concern on their own account, they want justice for friends and acquaintances who they think have been overlooked. One man writes thr.t the oats contributed by Mr. Finiey were given to a certain man who is well able to buy oats for himself, while the writer has to get out cordwood or saw logs at 50 cents per to buy oats. As a matter of fact the contributions in kind were not distributed at all. The committee could think of no way in which it could secure an equitable distribution and decided to convert the wheat and oats into cash and distribute the money. Another man writes that he understands that good big sticks of the cash contributions have gone to certain well known and well-to-do citizens who are not In need. He mentions the names1 of two men who have not received a cent or expected a cent, and who though heavy losers are still In good shape, and would not take any of this money if offered to them. But the members of the committee are not resentful on account of these complaints. They very we!l understand how all kinds of rumors can get started and how people who do not know any better, believe them. The members of the committee understand that they have nothing to do but to do the best they can. The understanding is, that as soon as possible after a general distribution of the funds on hand has been made, a complete list will be furnished to The Enquirer and it will be published for the benefit of the public, as well as in Justice to the committee and in Justice to people who have been reported to have received donations but who have not received them. SELECTING SEED CORN. The following Intelligent and comprehensive instructions for the selection of seed corn for exhibition purposes are according to Prof. Gardner, thoroughgoing expert on the subject, and they will prove of Interest and value to corn-growers in this locality: It has been claimed by some, that the success of some corn breeders has been due not so much to their ability to produce high yields as to their ability to select winning show samples. Now, while a high yield of corn is of primary importance to the farmer, the ability to select good show samples should not be slighted in an. 1 way. In selecting a sample, the main idea to keep in mind is uniformity. Uni - * -1 ? I ? ? (M loriniiy ul snapc, tuiui, ctitu hidcntion in one sample will often win over another sample which contains a lot of very good individual ears ; which are not alike. ( See that the ears are of as nearly ( the same length and circumference as , possible. Discard those ears that are , not cylindrical in shape, that is, see ( that they are round and taper as little as possible from the butt to tip. J Color has reference to both the grains ( and cobs. In a sample of white corn 3ee that there are no yellow grains or red cobs (unless it be a red cobbed, white variety, which is unusual). In i a yellow variety see that there are no white grains or white cobs. In fact, even a pink cob is objectionable in yellow corn. The deep yellow cob is preferred. The matter of cobs is even carried further than is indicated in the above sentences, for it is desirable to have the ears of the sample of same shade of white or ye'.low, as the case may be. Ey indention we mean the wrinkled portion .of the top of the grains. See that the ears are of the same roughness or smoothness in this respect. A very sharp grained ear is undesirable, so also Is a very smooth grained ear. The next thing to consider is the individual ears in the sample. Select only those which are straight. Have the rows of grains running straight up and down the ear. Have the rows of grains running uniformly and evenly out over the butts and tips and to such an extent that the tip is entirely covered with grains and that a cup- ^ shaped cavity is formed at the butt. g where the ear is fastened on the stalk; r flnrl hp snrp to spp that the snaoM he- _ tween the rows of grain are as narrow f as possible. Finally, see that the ears v are solid, that Is, they should be so c firm that you cannot twist them In j your hands or move them with your j fingers. v Now, take your knife and remove t from the ears all pieces of husks and p silks. Cut out the portion of the stalk t that remains attached to the corn at u the butt end. Scrape all the portions t of the cob that you cut with the knife t so that the cut Is left clean and smooth, j Wrap each ear separately in a piece p of newspaper and pack carefully in ri a box. If you are so fortunate as to o be able to arrange your sample In t the show room, put the longest ear on I the right and the next longest to It t and on down, having the shortest ear b on the left of the sample. b Do not kick If the Judges don't t give your sample first place, but try c to select a better sample next time. p , a LOCAL LACONICS h Prizes at Sharon. Sharon special of Dec. 11 to Char- . lotte Observer: The entertainment tj which was given by the students of 0 Sharon high school Tuesday, was well t( attended and thoroughly enjoyed. This v entertainment consisted of recitations, j music, drills and pantomimes. The occaslon was chosen by Principal W. J\t\ Boyd as the time for awarding the C( prizes which he had offered to encour- n age boys and girls In growing cotton and corn, in canning, preserving and i. pickling. For the best jelly the first _ prize went to Master Egger Robinson, p for canning, the first award went to j Miss Virginia Pratt and for pickles Miss Aline Shannon won the first prize. ja For the best cotton Paul Good was the ir successful winner, and for corn the first tj. prize went to Mr. John Whifside. This is the first year that this feature t has been introduced and the result is , quite surprising and gratifying. It is quite likely that another year additional prizes will be offered by the business men or ssnaron ana tnus make tne or- n forts of these young people even more worth while. Hi Rock Hill Poultry Association. m Rock Hill Herald Wedntsday: About y< a dozen enthusiastic poultry fanciers of re Rock Hill gathered in the city hall of Tuesday night and formally launched dr the Rock Hil! Poultry association. Of- 15 fleers were elected and plans made for, lv holding the first show between the first' cr and fifteenth of February, 1913. As in time was short it was decided to wage I of a vigorous campaign for members and' w each member of the executive commit-112 tee was instructed to take the names of new members. The entrance fee was fixed at per year and a 1 nou t>raisers of the county are cordially invited to join the association and have a part in making: the show in February a success. The committee will meet later to determine upon the prizes to be olTered and arrangre the minor details of the occasion, also fixing the exact date for the show. While it was not definitely decided Tuesday night it is likely that poultry fanciers from other counties will be invited to compete for the prizes offered. The officers elected are as follows: President, J. E. Parker. Vice President, W. W. Fennell. Secretary-treasurer. W. H. Brice. Assistant secretary, John Reid. Executive committee?T. O. Flowers, W. B. Wi.son, Jr., M. G. Bryant, John Reid. W. H, Brice, W. G. Duncan, J. E. Parker, W. W. Fennell, Ira Dunlap, F. S. Love W, J. Nelson. J. E. Parker, the president, is an ardent poultry raiser and is thoroughly fitted to perform his duties as head of the organization. With the hearty co-operation of the executive pnmmlHofl ?..ill J Lx jranvci win iiu uuudi arrange for a most creditable display of birds from Rock Hill and the surrounding country. The show will act as a stimulus to the poultry raising industry throughout the entire county and as a result chickens and eggs will be more plentiful next year, eliminating the necessity of sending to other states in order to supply the local market. 

SOUTH CAROLINA NEWS. ? Spartanburg Herald: One thousand nine hundred and fifty people of Spartanburg county called on Dr. Howell, the hookworm expert, for examination during the past six weeks and of this number he found that nearly 400 had hookworms. He has closed his clinical work here and from now until the holidays will devote himself to compiling statistics to be submitted to the state board of health. Dr. Howell came to Spartanburg about six weeks ago for the purpose of giving free treatmeand making free examination of those who called on him. During that time he spent every Saturdav In Snarfn burg, making examinations and giving advice and free medicine to people who were infested with the parasite, while the other days in the week were given over to similar work in various parts of the county. In speaking of hookworm disease in this county Dr. Howell said it la not as prevalent here as in counties In the eastern and lower sections of the state. ? Columbia, December 12: R. A. Richey, convicted at the spring term of the 1910 court for Abbeville county of statutory rape and sentenced to ten years' imprisonment in the state penitentiary, was today paroled by the governor on the condition that he give bond in the sum of $5,000, that he will personally appear before the governor of South Carolina on November 23, 1913, to be and receive what is then and there ordered by the governor. Richey, a rich white farmer of Abbeville county, was convicted of statutory rape, the alleged victim being a young white girl who was living in his home and who was said to be under 14 years of age at the time of the alleged assault. The case attracted widespread interest but the sentence of the lower court was affirmed by the supreme court and Richey was sent to the penitentiary. Two boards of pardons some time ago recommended a parole for Richey and several physicians examining him reported, that he is now a hopeless invalid, not even being able to leave his bed. His alleged victim, said the board of pardons appeared before them and Sflid thflf >ho *h/\iirrV>* J ...... ?**v ktiv/un<>w ihviicj nau UCCll punished sufficiently.

Columbia State, Tuesday: The South Carolina State Plant Breeders' issQclation was organized here yesterlay at noon at a meeting of a score of representative farmers held in the library at the state house at noon. Pracilcally every interest concerned in the levelopment of agriculture in the state vas represented, Including farmers :he state's agricultural college, the state's normal and industrial college, ;he state Farmers' Union, the state de>artment of agriculture, the United States department of agriculture and he United States farm demonstration vork. The meeting was called to order >y Commissioner Watson, who stated hat while wonderful progress had been nade agriculturally through the Introluction and application of farm demonstration methods, resulting in adding nilllons of dollars to the agricultural >roduction of the state annually in a ew years' time, the time had now come vhen the average farmer was wisely ailing for more scientific instruction, ie predicted that with the Introduclon of Intelligent plant breeding there vere still millions of dollars annually o be added to the state's aericultural iroduction. The association proceeded o the permanent organization and ipon nomination by President Dabbs of he state Farmers' Union, who referred o him in most complimentary terms, ). R. Coker of Hartsville, was elected ^resident of the association by acclanation. In similar manner H. W. Barre f Clemson college was elected secreary and treasurer of the association, t was determined to provide an execuive committee consisting of five memers with the officers as ex-officio memers, and the selection of this commitee was left to the president. The exeutive committee was instructed torepare the constitution and by-laws nd report to a genera! meeting of the ssociation to be he'.d in Columbia durfig the national corn exposition. It was etermined to ask the general assemly of South Carolina to appropriate 1,000 for the expenses of the secreiry's office in the prosecution of a vigrous campaign. A legislative commit?e consisting of L. L. Baker, Bishopille; A. C. Moore, Columbia and ames Q. Davis, of Winnsboro, was se>cted. President Coker upon taking le chair exp'alned in detail, citing oncrete instances, the far-reaching leaning of plant breeding work. His ddress to the members was illuminatlg and carried home to them the imortance of the step now being taken, nth President Dabbs and Mr. Coker Iscussed plant breeding and standard:ation of agricultural products in reitlon to both production and markctlg. and it was very clear that the two lings were absolutely dependent upon le character of work now to be underiken by this association for the mateal increase of profits from the farm. This Year's Cotton Crop.?The merican cotton crop for the season ' 1912-13 will amount to 13,820,000 lies of 500 pounds, (not Including nters) according to the first estlate made by the government this ?ar through the crop reporting buau, bureau of statistics, department ' agriculture, and announced yester- i ly afternoon. This compares with ,692,701 bales of 500 pounds, exclus- : e of lint'rs, produced in the record 1 op of last year when the total crop < elusive of linters was 16.250,000 bales 500 pounds; 11,608,616 bales In 1910 1 hich Including linters amounted to ,005,688 bales; 10,004,949 bales in 1909 which including linters amounted 10,315 382 balra; 13,241,700 bales in 1908 which Including linters amounted to 13,587,306 bales and 11,107,179 bales in 1907 which including linters amounted to 11,375,461 bales. The average total production, exclusive of linters, for the five years from 1906 to 1910 was 11.847,270 bales. The value of the crop, Including seed, for the same period, averaged $778,822,000, while last year's record crop is estimated to have been worth $859 480,000 and the 1910 crop, $936,180,000, the most valuable ever produced. Governor of Canal Zone.?President Taft Is thinking of offering the governorship of the Panama Canal Zone to Col. Goethals. builder of the canal. If Mr. Taft makes his proposed Panama trip, It is practically certain he will offar fhn nna? 4a 4a1>a tvi vi?v? puoi iv V/Ui< yjvcuittiB #mu liuvr up with him, whether he accepts or not, p.ans for the zone government. ' Special Important positions are to be 1 filled and do not have to be confirmed 1 by the United States senate. It is ex, pected that Mr. Taft will fill them before he g( ts out of office. To enable President Taft to appoint ' Col. George W. Goethals, chief engineer of the Panama Canal Zone, a major general in the army, Senator Sanders ; of Tennessee, today introduced a bill creating an additional major genera!1 ship. President Taft in his recent message asked for such a reward for Col. Goethals. The bill was referred to the military affairs committee. Whisky in Australia.?Thirty years ago, whisky was the beverage of commerce in Australia. It was almost impossible to do business without washing it down with whisky. The morning and afternoon nips were epidemic. All that has been radically changed by , the arrival of the age of reason. It may not be that in the aggregate, less whisky is being consumed today in Australia than thirty years ago. Population has substantially increased. But it is undeniable that whisky and business have become largely divorced. In the professions as well as in com, merce, men have discovered that it does not pay to associate whisky with business. The demand today is for clear brains and a strenuous application to business during office hours. Where the social custom demands it. tea is now largely the beverage honored In place of whisky.?Australian Review of Reviews. ? Secretary of War Stlmson told the house committee on military affairs , Wednesday about the plans of the government for fortification of Hawaii through works back of Pearl harbor and about plans for guarding the Pan- y ama canal on 'and by troops stationed along It, as well as at its two ends. The , protecting force would muster 5,000 or 10,000 men. He told of the plans for enlarging the army strength In the Insular possessions that only about 16,000 regulars would be left In the United States proper and particularly urged the need of increasing the fie'.d artillery. Gen. Wood, chief of staff of the army, has completed arrangements to detail more than 10,000 troops for coast defense duty around the Pearl harbor naval station, Oahua, Hawaiian Islands. The troops, which soon will take up their station there, will Include six regiments of infantry, one regiment each of cavalry and arti'lery and twelve companies of coast artillery. There are now about 3,000 troops on the island of Oahua. American Farmer Invited.?"An Invitation to American Farmers" is the title of a handsomely illustrated folder which has ben issued by the Southern ral'way, cal'ing attention to the fifth National Corn exposition to be held In Columbia Jan. 27 to Feb. 8. A large number of thes-^ folders will be distributed among northern and western farmers and they will also be placed In the hands of farmers throughout the south. The folder not only sets out the attractions of the National Corn exposition but gives interesting facts concerning the agricultural possibilities of the south which should appeal especially to farmers in other sections of the United States.. In getting out this folder the Southern railway is aiming to co-onerate for the success of the National Corn exposition and at the same time to call at eeniion to the south as a corn rrowing "ountry In the hope of attracting desirable farm sett'ers to this section. South Carolina Appointments.?The South Carolina delegation, upon the invitation of Senator Tilman, met in his office last Tuesday morning, according to a Washington dispatch to the Greenville News, and agreed upon a general line of policy in regard to South Carolina appointments. It was the understanding that as nothing could be done until they saw President-elect Wi'.son, that the senators should confer with Mr. Wilson aa soon as practicab'e to learn his policy. If he agrees to have the senators and congressmen from the state, control the patronage, then the rule to be followed will be this: All the postmasters will be designated by the congressmen in their respective districts, provided th~t no postmaster shall be named who Is personally objectionable to either of the senators. The collectors of the ports will be recommended in the same way. The United States marshall and district attorney will be designated by the senators after conferring with the delegation. It was the opinion of the delegation that President Wilson should be urged to rescind the executive order issued by President Taft, p'acing all fourth class postmasters under the civil service, for the reasons that in the south this opens wide the door to negroes and they believe this order was issued lor the purpose of perpetuating Republicans in office. ? Legislation designed to accomplish the rehabilitation of the American mer-. chant marine will be sought from congress by the Southern Panama Canal conference which was formerly organized in Atlanta last Wednesday. In th& face of spirited opposition from Frank P. Glass, editor of the Birmingham News, the conference adopted the following resolution at the close of its first meeting: "Whereas, the Panama canal, built by American enterprise and capital, will fall immeasurably short of its possible benefits to American commerce unless American ships exist to use it, therefore be it resolved, by the Southern Panama Canal conference in session in Atlanta, Dec. 10 1911 that we respectfully urge that the congress of the United States formulate and carry into effect at the earliest possible moment, definite and practical legislation which will give all necessary and reasonable encouragement to the American merchant marine and American commerce with foreign commerce, and be it further resolved, that, the executive committee of the Southern Panama Canal conference be and are hereby instructed to transmit this resolution to the president of the United States and the members of congress and use all other necessary methods to see that the Intent of this resolution is carried into effect by the congress of the United States." Mr. Glass objected to the resolution on the ground that it would put the conference on record as advocating ship subsidy, a proposition founded on the fundamental principle of protection which he said the people in the United States had rejected. Samuel G. Douglass of Nashville, who offered the resolution, denied that it carried an endorsement of ship subsidy. "Say that in the resolution and I will withdraw my objection," said Mr. Glass. Mr. Douglass retorted that he did not object to ship subsidy if congress determined such legislation was necessary to bring about the desired end. What he wanted, he said, was some action by congress to encourage me Dunoing or American merchant ships. He agreed, however, to modify the original resolution which read "we demand and insist" legis'atlon, so as to read, "we respectfully urge."
