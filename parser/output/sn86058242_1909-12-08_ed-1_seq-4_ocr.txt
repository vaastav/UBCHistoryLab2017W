President Taft's message to Congress is a judicial document. It covers a good deal of ground and is strong in many of its features. The people will be relieved to find that there is no beating of torn toms and banging of cymbals in it. It3 tone is so moderate and tranquillizing that in comparison of some of the presidential documents preceding, it is an anodyne. Mr. Taft does not suggest the taking of any drastic and mordant means to bring about his aims. He is content to let well enough alone. The document will exasperate no one. There are no doubleshotted ebullitive threats to stir up a row and yet the president speaks with telling effect. He is the great moderator and pacifier. Not to frighten away prosperity, not to throw a wet blanket on business, not to lash the nation into turmoil, are his evident de sires. A careful reading of the message will show that Taft is in the right place. THE OLD 

GAME OF FOOTBALL SAFER. It is quite amusing to note the comments on football as a game, made by those who never saw- a real match between trained elevens. This class together with the striplings who were running around in short dresses when the game jumped into prominence are displaying their ignorance by declar ing that the day of the flying wedge and the mass play were infinitely more dangerous than the open field and murderous tackling of the up-to-date game. The kind of football played today is far more perilous to life and limb than was what is now called the lod-style game. Statistics will prove it and those who have played the game a dozen years ago will verify it. The old game was far safer. The looser style of play which it was thought would remedy the dangerous features of the play has not done so at all. The forward pass in a broken field with its opportunities for fiendish tackling where men in play do not have time to find themselves before they are encompassed in a mad charge in itself is a hard play. Stop illegal piling up, pulling and push ing a player along. Don't let the offense gather too much power before it hits the line. Eliminate the forward pass and narrow the neutral zone between the scrimmage lines and many dangerous features will be eliminated. Keep TaiTis out of the game unless they have a physicians certificate that they can play and there won't be 3S killed, S00 maimed and hundreds more injured. HAS HAMMOND GROWN? WELL RATHER. Hammond will have a representation of nearly thirty persons at the banquet of the Indiana Society of Chicago which is to be held in the gold room of the Congress hotel. A table is to be set aside for the Hammond delegation. This is of no significance except in that it shows the social progress that has been made by this city in the past fifteen or twenty years. Twenty-five years ago it is doubtful if a full dress suit could be found in the whole city, The social activities of the Hammond people of those days was confined to mask balls, the butcher's picnic, Sunday picnics, dog fights and prize fights with an occasional trip to a theatre in Chicago. The people of the pioneer city little dreamed that in the year 1909, thirtty or more Hammondities would be journeying to Chicago in formal attire, the guests of business men statesmen, authors and playwrights of national reputation. As we remarked before the matter is only of interest, in the light of the past, as showing that Hammond's progress has not been entirely along com mercial lines. There is something else patent besides the remorseless pursuit of the lady on the eagle. Seriously, the influence of such affairs upon, the community is beneficial To hear and see the greatest artists, authors, speakers and playwrights of the middle west, for most of them come from Indiana, is a privilege. Their wisdom and witticism will be reflected, in a degree, upon the com niunity at large and the local members of the Indiana society who have made it possible for so many Hammond citizens to attend this delightful affair are doing more than providing an evening's entertainment for their friends It was only a few days ago that a man of national reputation who spoke at a Hammond gathering, expressed the opinion and the serious opinion that no where else in the state could the affair have been so successfully given 4WH BLANKET YOUR FAITHFUL ANIMAL. The cold weather has at last arrived and the old appeal to horse owners to "blanket your horse" is being made. And if the appeal was made in every issue of a newspaper, the cost of the space would be paid for in excess, if any good was accomplished thereby. It is an old appeal to the faithful old horse, man's best friend, the faith ful beast who does more for mankind and gets less in return than any other animal in the animal kingdom. BianKet your horse. Its a small thing to ask and it is likewise a small thing to do. Think yourself how you would feel after a hard run to stand out in .the biting wind, some times for hours with nothing to protect you How much care does the horse really get? It is true that the horse is us ually well fed and at night housed in comfortable stables. But in com parison with other animals, for instance, petted and prized dogs and cats, who are cuddled and cared for. petted and pampered, fed and feasted, bathed and -perfumed. Does the horse get any of these? Should he not be at last well fed and cared for, for what he does in return? Is he not at least deserving cf a warm outnket during the winter weather? A little common sense is all that is necessary. Man's heart is not hard and as a general rule he loves his horse. It's just forgetfulnesp, but don't forget. Please blanket your horse. THE gtorm-door is king. - GLORIOUS goosebone weather. -- SHOPPING early advice is getting rretty late. IT is also the time of the short day and the bill that bothers to beat the band. IT is somewhat of a relief not to be bothered with flies and mosquitos anyway. AND you certainly could never have seen anything more beautiful than those trees. OF course you heard from Medicine Hat, if it didn't catch you with your ear tabs on. THE squdger is persona non grata, but that doesn't make any difference to him whatever. leart to Heart Talks. By EDWIN A.IVYE. DECIDEDLY NOT, OTTO! A Chicago newspaper is authority for the statement that one Otto Will iams is to stage ten-round bouts in Gary in the near future and has been assured that he can hold the bouts. It is reassuring to read or Mr. Williams assurance. Perhaps he is Kid Howard in disguise or at least the latter's re incarnation. The honorable "Kid" a short time ago assured Chicago sports that all he had to do to pull off bouts in Hammond was simply to hold them. When the time came, however, the Howard person was sadly disillusioned, juite likely the sublime faith of Mr. Otto Williams is to be rudely shattered, indeed it is more than likely that when he pulls cf ten-round fights in Gary, "the stars will grow old, the sun grow cold and the leaves of the Judgment Book unfold." Nothing doing Otto! Put not your money in three sheets ad vertising ten-round bouts In Gary. We have enough troubles of our own at present without dallying with your ten-round affairs. There are enough clashes between the authorities and the blind pig owners coming off to furn ish our pood people with all the excitement necessary without your little game. A 

LITTLE less than three weeks in which to fuss about Christmas pres ents in your dreams. THE weather fiend has already be gun to tell you how he hates winter and longs for the good old summer time. WE will know who discovered the North Pole first, mighty soon. Santa Claus is expected to-arrive within a few days. INDIANA HARBOR boy who ran away to Hammond, came a little too late. The Boyville election excitement is all over now. .- INDIANA should have a state re publican love feast this year, the chickenhearted down state brethern notwithstanding. Vik NOW then who will be the first to get the snow all cleaned away. Don't all speak at once and please don't block up the sidewalk. HICKS says that December is going to be u stormy month. Please Mr. Hicks we'll take your word for it. It isn't necessary to show us. SEND in your Christmas presents early, says an .exchange. Sure send them in early and send them in often. AVe dearly love Christmas presents. A KENDALVILLE has fourteen candi oates for city marshall. Probably there are no crossings there to clean off snow in the good old winter time. s PITTSBURG man made eight at tempts at suicide. If he was anything but a Pittsburg man he would remove from the city and take his body with him. WE are glad to note that Bjornst jerne Bjornson is pronounced out of danger. We have had a lot of trouble in pronouncing the name of this dis tinguished man. IT will be necessary perhaps to spend a little of the hookworm fund to get some of the politicians in this neck of the woods together during the rext few months. MR. CHRISTY says "I don't care three whoops what she said." Mrs. Christy says "If he takes me in his arms, I'll forgive him." Somebody get a net they're falling. PRESIDENT Zelaya knows how to sympathize with the small boy who has been led to the woodshed and well paddled on the place provided by na ture for paddling purposes. j WE note with pleasure that the price of peanuts is soon to increase. This will probably make it harder for the man who is incessantly munching them in your ear to get them. WE will give a years subscription will show us a democratic paper that to the Sunday 

TIMES to any one who ever speaks of a republican policy as anything but a grab or a graft. A KANSAS hen has laid an egg bear ins the legend "Drought 1911" This is pleasant to look forward to when there is so much of It frozen on the ground and falling through the air. AN exchange says that "after a man has been married a while he does hate to walk down the street with his wife hanging on his arm.'' Well we think the wife's feelings ought to be con sidered a little. .. COULD it be done in your town? The Plymouth Independent says: fif teen women in an aid society of this city. . sat together and sewed for a whole hour without saying a word. It was done on a wager and no deaths occurred, but the scene that followed when the time was up may be imagin ed much better than told. THE SQUARE DEAL. Young man Do you know why there is such a large proportion of failures in busi ness in this country? Do you think it is because of lack cf experience or of energy or of proper location or of management or of proper advertising? All these may have something to do with business failures; but. according to a business man who has made his millions, it is lack of something else. And what do you suppose is that lack? Lack of downright business honesty! You do not think so? You have come to believe perhaps, as many young men do believe, that knowledge of the busi ness, "tricks of the trade," shrewdness in getting the better of a bargain, the ingenuity of deceit that these are the qualities by which men get on in the world today. That is where you are mistaken. The millionaire mentioned, whose name is known throughout the coun try, says: "I'm not a preacher or a moralist Business isn't a thing to preach or grow sentimental over. But it is so 6lmple in principle that only a fool mistakes it and falls." Continuing, he says: . "Twenty-five years ago I discovered for myself that honesty was the easiest graft known to business. It can't fail in the bands of a man with common horse sense. . Once let it get abroad that every customer coming iuto your place gets the square deal and you can't keep them out with a club." A very strong statement that. But the man has proved it. He start ed up in business determined upon a policy of "making good" to every cus tomer. His definition of making good was the Golden Rule that is to say. he de termined to treat every customer of his precisely as he would want to be treated if he were the customer. And from that policy he reaped a fortune. Simple? So simple, as he says, that "only a fool mistakes It and falls." There never was enunciated a truer statement than that of the old copy books, "Honesty is the best policy." Do not get It into your head that rascality pays. Dishonesty spells FAILURE and spells it in capital let ters. The square deal wins always, everywhere. which, resulted in the loss of both his eyes. TRY TO CATCH BURGLAR. An attempt to rob the Phi Delta Theta House at Bloomington early Monday morning -was frustrated by two members of the local chapter, Millard' K?nt and Dane Hoover, whose attempt' to capture the lone burglar was un successful. The barkir.fr of a pair of bulldogs kept in the house at night gave the boys wr.rning. j STRICKEN BY APOPLEXY. Major David F. Allen of Frankfort, one of Indiana's best-known men. Is in a critical condition at his apart ments in this city from a stroke of apoplexy. He was stricken while alone about 5:30 Sunday evening and for nearly twenty-four hours lay on ; the floor of his room conscious but! unable to aid himself or call assistance. TO BE CITY AGENT.

Peterson, who for somt time has been city ticket agent for the Monon at that place, will on Jan. 1, become city passenger agent for the company at Indianapolis. LOCATE MOONSHINERS. Mooashlmng" on an elaborate and profitable scale is alleged to have been unearthed in the heart of the business district of Elkhart, only the barricaded rendezvous of the illicit workers proved to be an oleomargarine shop. CRUEL TO HIS HOG. John Bondrager, a well-to-do fasmer of near Auburn, was Monday made de fendant in a suit filed before Justice Green for inhuman treatment of a hog. The complaint, made by his neigh bors, is that Bondrag-er ran the norker. stoned It and then chased his dog after it till the animal fell, in the fence corner almost dead. ORDERS MONKEY ENGINES. The Monon has ordered three of the new type, known as the "ironk'jy" typi passenger engine. The coi-.r.any h.xa number of these etig'nes now in service and Is so pl'.ised with them that it thought It wise to purchase ad ditional engines of that type. Theae engines have three pairs of dilving wheels and handle the through pas senger trains at high speed.
