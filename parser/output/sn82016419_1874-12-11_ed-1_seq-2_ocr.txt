The- 4'aruilsi , Web Afala. -o. ,r mo annual report of mate Auaitor, J). VT. Wilder. cresU ed a sensation. The one Jntt out eclipses that made last year la many respects. We hare not been favor ed with an advance copy, by our es teemed ft lend, the auditor, but have been permitted to glance over a copy we round in tbe hands of a friend who was passing through our city. We feel a little slighted that we have not been furnished with a copy. We read enough of this report to express the opinion that It, too, will rream a senssuon. in the matters of completeness, plain and blunt lan guage, and the amount of valuable information It gives of the financial status and history of the state, it is me moat remarkable state paper ev cr issued In any state. It contalna about fifty large pamphlet pasroa and is replete with figures, giving lust the information needed, not on ly by the members of the incoming legislature, but by all the people Its style and matter are so inteseet- Ing tbst when one sits down to read it be does not wish to Isy it aside until he has gone entirely through it. Mr. Wilder does not mince his words In reflecting upou those who have administered tbe various de partments ot the state government. We like the report on this account, notwithstanding our toes are slight ly tread upon along with those of others. We had something to do with framing the state printer law which the Auditor criticises rather severe' ly, and tbe reason we do not "squeal" Is that he does not tell the truth In his assertions about that bill. We do not ssy he deliberately falsifies. We suppose he has been lead into error In some way. Had he known how faithfully and hon estly the work was done on that bill, he would not have said it was framed against the interests of the people and In thoso of the public printer. It Is the truth that hurts, and Web's assertions do not wound our feelings in tho lesst. We suppose there are many other statements In this remarkablo re port which must he taken with considerable degree of allowance, but the mass of truth, and the wonderful amount of Inlormatfon it contains in statistical form, as well as its fund of wise and practic al suggestions, must lead to great good to the state. This report is of more practical value to the state thsn all the state documents ever Is sued, ltarrlog its overdrawu state ments iu some Instances, its seem ing anxiety to censure, Its distaste ful egotism, in holding up its au thor as the only officer who has dono anything for Kansas, and its chesp puff of two or three fellows, it is all right. As we look at tho matter it is decidedly out oftatse to pun" officers who have dono their duty, and to engage iu electioneer ing for them, in a state report, sir. Wilder doubtless thinks this all right, and we shall not quarrel with him about It. There is so mueh that is good in this report, that its faults are lost sight of. To give some Idea of the matter of this remarkable document, we give briefly its "table of contents." After preliminary remarks it be gins with an examination of the an nual expenditures of the state. Un der this head a table is given, show ing tho rate of taxation, tho amount taxed, and the taxable property of the state as fixed by the State Board of Equalization for each year begin ning with 18C1, and closing with 1874. Accompanying this Is a table showing the latest reported valua tion and rate of taxation in the dif ferent slates of the Union. Next the report gives a series of tables, showing tho expenditures for slate purposes, under the different heads, lor each year since the state was ad mitted. Special tables give the cost of printing year by year, and the amounts voted for uewspapors. Then follows a table giving in total the general revenue, and school and interest taxes collected and paid out each year from 1SC1 down. These tables, it Is needless to say. furnish a class of Information which has heretofore been Inaccessible, and of the highest interest and importance. The auditor then discusses at length the various subjects, manuscript journals ; double and crroucous as sessments; commission and mile age to county treasurers; public printing ; the Insurance department ; investigation of school funds; the bond registration law, with a table showing the municipal bonds regis tered in 1874; the fiscal agency; bank statements ; fees and salaries ; the standing of railroads; the state debt, with a table showing the date of Issue, lor what purpose, rate of interest, terms of payment, &c, of all the bonds ever issued by the state; the sinking fund ; sale of In dian land ; repeal of laws ; the state relief bonds ; county organization ; school land account: condition of the treaaurv: proceedings of the State Hoard of Equalization; tabu lar statement of the taxable proper ty in the state, by counties, as fixed by the state board, and tbe amount of taxes apportioned to each county for the year 1874 ; tabular statement of the railroad property or the state by counties; bow much our taxes amouut to, and for what they are ptid; a tabular statemeut showing the amount of taxes iu the various counties, aud for what purpose ley led, the rate per cut., indebtedness, and total amount of taxable proper ty; and general summing up. Tho message of president Mmc- Mahou lo the French Assembly seems to give the best of satisfac tiou everywhere It inspires a large deicree of hope in the stability of bis government. It proves his desire and ability to restore quiet and confidence among 'the Frenob people.

91EETG OP CO!lXEH. Congress assembled Monday. A quorum of both houses present. The most of the session was occu pied by tho reading of the President's message. All the Kansas delegates were present In the Senate Senator Ingalls introduced a bill providing that the pre-emption settlers in Kansas, shall be allowed a year's absence from their lands ravaged by grass hoppers without loss of their rights. He also submitted a reso lution instructing the committee on Indian affairs to inquire into the recent disturbances in the In dian territory, and to report to the senate what measures were neces sary to protect life and property and preserve the law and order in that region, and whether the best Interests of civilization do not de mand the immediate establishment of courts of United States inside of the territory. Laid on the ta ble. Senator Hitchcock, of Nebraska, introduced a bill appropriating $100,000 for the purchase of food to be issued to the starving suf ferers from the ravages of the grasshoppers on the Western fron tier. In the house the first bill intro duced was one repealing what is known as the press gag-law. M TI1K It A no 

CTXIUM.Y DEVOID OF cxKmciEcrc OltlcUm Srr. Irto TltaisiUaaTlvtaisr Jlemre. But what shall we sav of a national legislature so utetrly void of conscience as onrs is to-aay r in we pumic lire of the nation there Is not one great statesman left; not one who stanus as a strong, wise, moral hero before the world. With all his faults, with aU the arrogance and bitterness of later years Bumner was such a man ; and he was the last. The long struggle with slav ery, and ror tbe nation's lire, uevci oped many such. There was a cause then able to fan the dead embers of patriotism Into a llvlne flame. That was a time of moral exultalon, daring. toil, self-sacrifice. But now no aggres sive wronir threatens us : and all man' Hesitation of these sublime virtues has passed away. Never has tbe service of the nation been so utterly empty and void of great men, high alms and noble efforts: so dull, listless and me diocre. It Is tbe hour and power of vulgarity, of uttei . purposeless mate rialism, of undisguised selfishness, and blank vacuity. When tbe ty pioal deni agogne of modern times was tbe fore most man In Congress, we might well raise the despairing cry, "God save the American Commonwealth r Tbe land has redeemed herself in this re gard. If Butlerism were likely to die with Butler, we might well rejoice As It is, a negative victory has been won, but we need a positive one. As we look upon our public affairs. mighty advertisement stares us in tbe fur: u Wanted, a great moral hero!" Hay God send such men Into the field of our national life! For, looking back of the record of the last four years, at Back Pay, Credit Moblller, our home bribery suits, we must con fess that, boast of our bigness as wi may, talk of the "effete despotisms of Europe" as we will, our public con science Is more debuacbeil, and our civil service incomparably worse, than that of anv other nation in Christen doni. We are sufferinsr from our old Fourth-of-July fallacy. The above statements are selected from Mr. Norton's Thanksgiving sermon. The first thing that demands no tice is the assertion that our nation al legislature is to-day "utterly void of conscience." This is a shocking denuncistion against a legislature composed largely of the men who legislated for us during our terrible war, and who since devised our constitutional amendments so as to mako the best national constitution In the world one that liberated four millions of .slaves, aud gave them civil equality. By tho enact menta of our natloual legislature since the commencement of the war up to the present day, it can be proved that no other national legis lature ever did so much in so short time for the elevation of the poor and the protection of the lower classes of society. With a singl exception tho legislation has been so good as fallable men can make up to tbe present day. Yet, Mr Norton says "Oor public conscience Is more debauched, and our civil servico incomparably worse than that of any other nation in Christ endom." So Mr. Norton believes but where is the evidence that his belief is well founded ? The nations of Christendom are numerous, and therefore there may be some cases that Mr. Norton has not iuvestigat ed which may be worse than ours, 2d. Mr. Norton says, "In tbe pub- lio life of the nation there is not one great statesman left. Snmner was such a man, and he was the last." What an unfortuuale natiou we are II Our last great statesman is doad! In forty ot millions of people there is not one srreat statesman in public life I Sumner was a man for whom once had great respect and deep sympathy, lie advocated a good cause when it cost him much to do so; but he wss too much of an ex tremlst to succeed well in advocat ing anv cause, lie was taiented and eloquent, but lacked the pru dence neceasary to bis being a great atateaman. His speech sgainst Pres ident Grant proved him to be a very vicious man and one who had no regard for truth. There was in it tissue of palpable falsehoods, which he must have known to be such Since I read that speech, I have had no respect for Sumner. Any man who Is educated, talented, eloquent and prudent may become a great statesman. And we havo thousands of such, and a number of such are in the uational legislature. 2d. That General Butler erred In some instances, is true ; and it is al so true that he served his country nobly dnring the rebel war, and was the first general who took right ground in respect to the slaves. He did much more for his country than Sumner, whom Mr, Norton eulogizes as the "last great statesman." If all the minister in the Uuited States were to teach as Mr. Norton has done in the extrsct here present ed, they would loose the bands of government, and place us in the condition of the South American governments. mat a oooy sa large as our natloual legislature, selected by common vote, will be ail honest, is not to be expected. Some bad and designing men will be elected. And that there has been some eases of bribery, is admitted ; but notwith standing these exceptions, our gov ernment has been well administered under the presidency of general Grant up to the present day.

FBOSI CEDAB T ALLEY. A Cls-SMce Celefcrsstlo. Cedar Vaixet, Chase Co., Dec. 6th. i Yesterday was a fine day for the 'atrona and their friends at and around Cedar Point; old and young, grave and gay, bad all things common in a good dinner, gotten dd bv the good ladies of Cottonwood, Cedar and the Point. We rather like snch gatherings. They create a feeling of kindness, so ciability and benevolence, and while we enjoyed tbe festivities of the day those of our fellows that have, through the calamities of the past season, been less fortunate, were not netrlected. Arrangements were set on foot to look after the needy. Dr. Mead of the Point presided, and at the opening of the meeting read a good essay on the objects of the order. Col. 8. N. Wood, of the Falls, gave us a good address. Mr. Mor gan of the Leader was also with ns and, although he could not be prevailed upon to give us a talk, be did us the kindness to act as secre tary. Miss E. V. Doughty, of the Point, read a very good essay on juvenile culture, which was well recieved. Mr. Cunningham also spoke in regard to the interest, of the order, Mr. Cunningham, his wife, and Mr, Bates did tbe singing, Mrs. Cun ningham at the organ. The only drawback here was not enough to assist in vocal mnsic. A vote of thanks was tendered the singers and invited speakers, when all adjourn ed in the best of hnmor, feeling the better for haying spent the day socia bly and profitably together. In The Nkws of the 27th ult., am made to say that there had not been a death in this county for the last two years. This is either mistake of the printer or of my self. I think I wrote country not county. Cedar Is a uice creek of about 1C miles in length, emptying into the Cottowood river a mile east of the Point, and heading not far from Sycamore Springs in Butler county When I speak of Cedar valley mean the valley of this creek and its tributarys. This valley contains about sixty-five or seventy families, Since I wrote you before I have learned that there have been two infant deaths in this valley quite recently. A. V. Sheep. Mr. lilandin, of this city, has brought on a thousand fino sheep and expects to largely increase his flock next spring. Tho Mennonitcs are also takin great flocks into Harvey county They expect to make this a prom nont feature in their industry. We are glad these experienced and thorough men are taking hold of this buiness. Mr. George Plnmb, of this county, after many trials and vicissitudes, has make of it a complete success. He looks upon it as our most proQta blc form of farming , and he knows what he is talking about. Given vr the Ghost.

OFPICI OP 8TATK ISOABD OP AOKICI LT'E, Topee a KS., Dec. 1. 1874. To JIU Excellency Tho. A born, Governor of Kansas. Os In compliance with your request tor a summary of returns made to this office relative to destitution in the state, the result of grasshop per or locust devastation, I have to report. The counties that are absolutely unable to provide for their own destitute lie west of the sixth principal meridian, and for the most part are the following. Populafn. Oetttitute. Harbour 608 Barton two t Kills and unorganized counties ot Np.ih anil 200 300 KuHh -too 200 100 1M9 Klsworth Kdwardit Decatur Ford Harvey Jewell Ltincola McPherson Mitchel I Nortoa Us borne Ottawa Pawnee Phillips Pratt Reno Kepuhlitt Rice t Roots Ruwiel Smitli 150 10 1,000 450 M)0 V00 UO0 1,000 4O0 150 1,100 100 1.000 300 A0O HM .150 1,500 Total 00,104 Census of 187:'.. t Estimated, 1,0W There will be some aid required ror tne counties or I rego, Hodge man and Kingman, but the re turns are too indefinite on which to base an estimate. At least 50 per cent, should be added for clothing and bedding, making 18,134 requiring assistance for other than rations. As you are aware, the war de partment has indicated its purpose to issue army clothing for men, in reasonable quantities, to tbe coun' ties of Russell, Lincoln, Osborne, iiooirs, I'awnee. Harvey. Rice, Ford, Norton, Phillips, Jewell and smitn. in most oi me loregoing coun ties wneai was raised, but was most unevenly distributed. Homesteaders depended largely upon tne corn crop and vegeta bles, which were destroyed. The failure of corn, the principal food for domestic animals in the state, has necessitated the feeding of wheat; in addition to this there has been a large increase in the acreage of winter wheat sown this fall. These two causes have di miuished the supply of breadstuns, and lessened the ability of those counties to provide for their own unfortunate. There are individual cases of destitution in isolated localities in other parts of the state (of which I make no estimate), and the county commissioners and other citizens are resolute in the en deavor to not only provide for their unfortunate, but- to contrib ute to tne destitute on the fron tier. While thev mav be able to tase care of themselves, it is be Ileved that thev will be, ia the majority of cases, unequal to the emergency of supplying the fron tier. Destitution is greater than has been supposed. Our people axe not beggars, and there have been many cases of suffering discovered wnere delicacy has hidden it from public view as long as possible. An important consideration seems to have been overlooked. Farmers are compelled to feed wheat to work animals. Bad re sults are already apparent in many localities. It ia unnatural food for work animals, and unless corn can be provided for spring work, at least in part, there will not only be disease and sufferinsr among stock, but farm industries will be regarded.
