Declaration of wa,. w'h Austrfa-Hungary was rec ommended to congress today by Pres ident AVilson. Immediate war with Turkey and Hu'hKh. '"rcrmany's other allies, the president told congress he did not be 1 eve necessary at this time because they do not yet i-tand in the direct path of necessary action. Immed;ate war against Austria, even tho she only be Germany's vas sal and not her own mistress, the president declared was necessary be cause the central powers must be con sidered a one and because the war can be conducted successfully in no other way. Ciiving plain warning:, however, that he would not hesitate to ask for de claration of war on Turkey and Bul garia when he considered it necessary, the president said: 'Ve shall go wherever the neces sities of this war carry us but it seems to be that we shall go only where -immediate and practical con siderations lead us and not heed any others." Not I'ntil Militarism Is Beaten. Peace, the president told congress, can come only when the Prussian military autocracy is beaten down; with the world thru rulers the world can trust, when they make repara tion for the wrongs their present rul ers have done and when the enslaved people of Belgium, Northern France and the Balkans have been set free. Germany's declaration that she is fighting a war of self-defense against deliberate aggression, the president if' ringing words declared "wantonly false," and he reiterated anew that no one is threatening the existence of the independence of the peaceful en terprise of Germany. Of those who speak of peace with out the overthrow of Germany mili tary autocracy, the president declared: "I hear men debate peace who un derstand neither its nature nor the way in which we may attain it with uplifted eyes and unbroken spirits. But T know that none of these speaks for the nation. They do not touch the heart v.t anything. They may safely be left to Ftrut their uneasy hour and be forgotten." Defines Our War Aims. Declaring anew that the United States has no war on Germany's skill, enterprise or commercial achieve ments, the president declared that the United States became Germany's ene my only when she started out to domi nate the world by force of arms, gat ing again the war objects of the Uni- .tcd States and tnose wnicn ne be lieved to be those of the allies, the president declared: "I believe t"at I speak for the when I say two things: 'First, that this intolerable thing of which the masters of Germany have shown us the ugly face, this menace of combined intrigue and force which now see so clearly as the German power; a "thing without conscience or honor or capacity ior covenanted (Con tinned oil Puffe Two.) 

WILSON TELLS AMERICA'S AIM IN GREAT WAR Vo Conquest on Germany's Commercial Enterprise. Remove Power of Kaiser, Who Upset Peace of World. SHOWN US THE UGLY FACE Resent Kaiser's Attempt To Rule AVorld by Arms- Price of Peace To Be Justice to AH Nation's Alike. Washington, Dec. 4. President Wil son delivered to congress today an address considered so important in its relation to international affairs that it has been transmitted in advance by the government to practically every capital in . the world. Text of Message. The president "P"1 gfiifnUBif' ?i Gentlemen of the Congress: Eifiht months have elapsed since I last had the honor of addressing you. They have been months crowded with events of immense and grave signifi cance for us. I shall not undertake to recall or even to summarize those events. The practical particulars of the part we have played in them .will be laid before you in the reports of the executive departments. I shall dis cuss only our present outlook upon those vast affairs, our present duties and the immediate means of accom plishing the objects we shall hold al ways in view. I shall not go back to debate the causes of the war. The intolerable wrongs donet and planned against us by the sinister masters of Germany have long since become too grossly obvious and odious to every true American to need to be rehearsed. But I shall ask you to consider again and with a very grave scrutiny our objec tives and? the measures by which we mean to attain them; for the purpose of discussion here in this place, is ac tion and our action must move straight toward definite ends. Our object is, of course, to win the war and we shall not slacken or suffer ourselves to be diverted until it is won. But it is worth while asking and answering the question, when shall we consider the war won? All Know Purpose of War. i From one point 'of view it is not necessary to broach this fundamental matter. I do not doubt that the American people know what the war i.s about and what sort of an outcome they will regard as a realization of their purpose in it. As a nation we are united in spirit and intention. I pay little heed to those who tell me otherwise. I hear the voices of dissent who does not I hear the criticism and the clamor of the noisily thoughtless and trouble some. I' also see men here and thera fling themselves in impotent disloyalty against the calm, indomitable pow er of the nation. I hear men debate peace who understand neither its na ture nor the way in which we may at tain it with uplifted eyes and unbrok en spirits. But I know that none of these speaks for the i.ation. They do not touch the heart of anything. They may safely be left to strut their un easy hour and be forgotten. But from another point of view I believe it is necessary to say plainly what we here at the seat of action consider the war to be for and what part we mean to play in the settle ment of its searching issues. We are the spokesmen of the American peo ple and they have a right to know whether their purpose is ours. They desire peace by the overcoming of evil, by the defeat once and for aJl of the sinister forces that interrupt peace and render it impossible and they wish to know how closely our thought runs with theirs and what action we pro pose. They are impatient with those who desire peace by any sort of com promiseddeeply and indignantly im patient, but they will be equally im patient with us if we do not make it plain to them what our objectives are and what we are planning for in seek ing to make conquest of peace by arms. Stamp Out German Intrigue. I believe that I speak for them when I say two things: First, that this in- tolerable thing of which the masters of Germany have shown us the ugly race, tms menace or combined intrierue and force which we now see so clearly as the German power, a thing without conscience or honor or capacity for covenanted peace, must be crushed, and if it be not utterly brought to an (C6ntinued on Pace Two.)

An armistice be tween Russia and Germany has been signed at the headquarters of Prince Leopold pf Bavaria, says an Exchange telegraph dispatch from Amsterdam today. The armistice is valid for a period of forty-eight hours. General Staff Surrenders. Petrograd, Dec. 4. Ensign Kry lenko, the Bolsheviki commander - in chief, telegraphed today that the gen eral staff which has refused to recog nize the authority of the Bolsheviki has surrendered. General Dukhpnin assumed the post of Russian commander in chief after the disappearance of Premier' Ker ensky, with headquarters at Mohilev. The headquarters staff refused to carry out the orfters of the Bolsheviki to enter into negotiations with the Germans for an armistice. The Bol sheviki government announced the deposition of General Dukhonin but he refused to recognize its authority. A Petrograd dispatch yesterday said troops loyal to the Bolsheviki had been sent against the . general statf headV quarters. - " Cossacks Threaten Attack. Petrograd, Dec. 4.

GRANT RATE HIKE Western H. K.'s Get Increase on Steel and Iron Goods. Ranges as High as 40 Per Cent Affects K. C. Territory. Washington, Dec. 4. Increases in freight rates on Iron and steel articles ranging as high as 40 per cent were allowed to western railroads today by the interstate commerce commission. The increases, however, were not so great as the railroads asked. The railroads had asked to cancel commodity rates and apply fifth class rates which would have caused in creases varying from 20 to 50 per cent. The commission held, however, that these were too high and allowed a varying scale of increases ranging up to 90 per cent of the fifth class rate. Former rates on iron and steel articles were entirely too low in west ern trunk territory, the commission held. The new rates which may be filed shortly would apply principally from Chicago, Peoria, 111., St. Louis, Kan sas City, Minneapolis, St. Paul, Du luth and Mississippi river crossings to various western destinations. Were Abnormally Low. No increase is proposed in present rates from Chicago to St. Louis and other west bank Mississippi river cities, and the commission specifies that the new rates must not disturb the present relationships in commodity rates from Kansas City and St. Louis. In explanation of the abnormally low rate heretofore prevailing on iron and steel products in this territory, the commission's decision said: "If the difference between class rate levels in central freight association and western trunk-line territories may be taken as representative of trans portation conditions generally the pro posed rates are not relatively high." Shippers of western territory had protested1 quite generally against the proposed increases. Slilit Increase on Live Stock. Washington, Dec. 4. Applications for increased rates on live stock in less than carloads east of the Mississippi river were denied today by the inter state commerce' commission but per mission was given to make new mini mum weight rulings which would re sult in small increases. The increases allowed amount to an average of IS per cent and apply mainly to shipment of breeding ani mals. The commission also ordered eastern railroads to cancel proposed rates 1- roviding charges on ordinary live stock, dependent upon value. 

AMERICANS ARE CASUALTIES IN CAMBRAI FIGHT Engineers First U. S. Men To Fall in a Big Battle. Extent of American Losses . There Not Yet Announced. FIERCEST FIGHTING OF WAR German Charged Machine Gans in Fifteen Waves. One British Gunner Fired 70, 000 Rounds in a Day. BY WILLIAM PHILIP SIMMS. With the British Armies in the Field, Dec. 4. Americans were again in action around Cambrai with the British .today. They were members of the same army engineering units who on Sat urday and Sunday were caught be tween the lines and who threw down their tools to grab British rifles. The American have suffered some losses, but their detachment is proud of the opportunity to do its bit and to be the first American unit to suffer in a great battle. Battle Continues Unabated. The battle out of Cambrai continues with unabating ferocity today. Fight ing like wild cats, the British have been stemming the enemy and where they have been forced to give way, they have only done so in their own good time, after repulsing all aiiacKs. This plan held at Masniers. It has been followed elsewhere. The fields near Queant, around Byng's new salient, down to vend huile are piled with dead Germans today. Fifteen waves deep the enemy came to the attack. In these solid phalanxed-like columns British artil lery, machine guns and nries aia tear- rexecution. - - West of Bourlon. one British -ma chine gunner fired 70,000 rounds on one gun in a single day ana all at a range of not more than 1,300 yards. It was usually less than that. This was only one rapid fire gun out of many directed at the solid masses of the enemy. But they never seemed to make an impresion on the fifteen waved lines. The dead dropped in piles, but other gray coated fighters filled the gaps. A Lieutenant's Brave Exploit. The exploit of a certain tank lieu tenant is an example of the British spirit of battle. The lieutenant's cap tain, in charge of the tank, was killed early yesterday morning. The subal tern took command, a few hours later at 10:30 in the morning his tank was hit squarely by a German shell. The lieutenant got his men out of their steel, wagon and had them entrench nearby. Then alor.e, he clambered back into the tank and personally worked the Lewis guns that stuck out of its bar bettes in front. He worked them so rapidly that they got red hot and he ran out of ammunition. He had to leave the tank. But the lieutenant was still anxious to fight. He and his men found -a German machine gun nearby and with it attacked 200 Germans. They held the enemy until British infantry pant ed up and grabbed the enemy posi tion. British officers who have been thru the war mill declare today there nev er has been any heavier fighting than that which the "Cambrai seotor has seen in the last few days. Attacks and counter-attacks succeed each other endlessly bringing the action into one vast battle. Today the most violent spot in the fight was apparently around Lavac querie. Field Marshal Hinder.burg is giving Crown Prince Rupprecht fresh divi sions. ,They have been pouring in from all directions. Probably some of them-are fnom Russia. . The Bavarian prince is flinging them into the struggle in the old Ger man fighting styles masses upon masses. Before Americans Get In. From prisoners' it seemed apparent that Germany is exerting her utmost, desperately anxious to force a decision before the Americans arrive. Germans, Bavarians, Prussians and the grenadier guards the very pick of the Teutonic forces are in the Ger man assault. AX.Ii KXVY THE ENGINEERS. First to Join in Big Battle With Boches C amp Is Aroused. American Field Headquarters in France, Dec. 4. Every dough boy, every marine, every other sort of an American fighting man now, "some where in France," wished to heaven today he had been an army engineer. .The American camp, from head quarters to the most remote village, buzzed feverishly with news of tl:e engineers exploits at Cambrai. Every man envied their lot, speculated oi the glory of getting a chance at tht boches in the oend and wished they'd hurry up and let the real fighting men get into action. The engineers can command the best the camp has from now on they are real heroes. News of the way American rrmy en gineers jumped into the fray side by side with British Tommies did not reach the American camps, until Mon day evening. Then special newspaper editions deluged the countryside and were feverishly devoured by the Sam mies. Headquarters remained "silent on the whole matter. INSIST BRITISH JOIN IN A TEST OF NAVY POWER Growing Sentiment in Ameri can Jfavy for Sea Action. Chief of. Operations Opposes Xaral Drive by Britain. ALL THREE NATIONS JOIN Hnrl British, French and U. S. Warships for Knockout. Believe It Might Bring Quicker Decision Than by Land. BY CARIi O. GROAT. Washington, Dec. 4. The British hand is gradually being forced in the matter of a more digressive offensive naval policy. Despite the opposition of Admiral Benson, chief of operations, subtle pressure is being exerted which, it is believed, will eventually cause Great Britain to depart from her defensive program. Prominent government officials in formed the press tbday there is reason to believe the growing sentiment in the American army and navy for of fensive measures to supplement- thel terrinc land drives is having its ef fect. "While the present plan of scour ing: the seas with destroyers and keeping the British battle fleet intact cannot be immediately changed, the coming year will probably see a shift which may have a vital effect on the allied fortunes of war. Younger Heads for Action. While Admiral Benson believes a naval offensive is doomed to failure, younger officers insist that unless naval power is tested, the bloody see saw on land will go on almost indefi nitely, whereas a single blow Btruck hyithe British, -French- and American navies might be the knockout punch of Germany. What its advocates most fear is that the British, yielding to American pres sure, will go at the task half-heartedly. No half way measures should be attempted, for that would be worse than avoiding a test. Meantime the navy is swamped with submarine-curbing inventions. Offi cials declared today that gradually a method of checking the U-boats is being evolved and that, with this ex pected cure, the naval offensive can be the more safely tried.

URGE CUT IN BREAD Bakers Council Recommends Reduc tion Under Gov't License Dec. 10. Washington, Dec. 4. Immediate reduction in bread prices wherever possible has been recommended to bakers thruout the conntry by the war emergency council of, the baking in dustry. Bakers will go under govern ment license December 10, using a set formula and producing a standardized loaf required by the food administra tion. In announcing recently that the baking industry was to be put under license, the food administration de clared there is no reason why bread prices should not be sharply reduced. The information that a reduction has been recomtrtended came to the food administration today in a telegram from Henry Stude of Houston, Texas, president of the National Association of Bakers. The telegram was similar to one sent by the war council to the bakers. It reads: "The council calls attention to the various recomr. endations in the United States food administration's report suggesting a reduction in prices, with government control of raw material used by the baker, and a reduction in operating expenses. There should wherever possible be an frnmediate reduction in price to the retailer.
