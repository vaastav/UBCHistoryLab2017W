Will BE WED MEXICAN FORCES MUST! CEASE FIRING INTO AMER ICAN TERRITORY U. S. GOVERNMENT IS DETERMINED! [To Remain on American Soil and] Return Fire Would Not Be an Act of War. JTON, Deo. the con tending Mexj^ force* opposite Naco, $?is., do not ?e??o firing into Jx?qtV can territory the three batteries of fieid artillery sent t? the international line wll be ordered to retsra the fire. This, is the United States Govern ment's determination, It became known tonight after a full discussion of the situation by President Wilson and his cabinet. No .specific orders have been given, but while Brigadier General Taajcer H. BIIsb, who was di rected to proceed to Naco, with the field artillery, is en route there, offi cials expect an answer to the sharp warning 'given to Mexican factions battling across the border that bullets and shells must not fall on American soil. . No act of "aggression" is contem plated, a statement made by the White House today said, but officials draw a distinction between aggressivo and defensive action. For cavalry or field artillery to cross the Mexican line or open fire first would constitute an act of aggression, but to remain on American soil and return,the fire of the Mexicans is, In tne opinion of high officiais, ? measure ' of . defense fully Justified and riot an act of war or invasion. ! The White House statement Issued by Secretary Tumulty after a confer ence -with the President was as fol lows: > "It has been thought wise to streng, then "the forces at Naco because of tho recklessness of the contending factions there in falling to. control the direction of their fire. Of course, no aggressive action is contemplated.' It was explained at the war depart ment that the artillery ordered to Naco could fire over the Mexican town into the lines of the Mexican factions which insisted on firing into Ameri can territory. This Is the plan should, warnings prove futile. The general ex pectation however, is that no such contingency will arise. > ~ The Washington government's ac tion constitutes a precedent for the fu ture and was taken to mean that any. firing into American terrltoiy along the border would be met by similar, steps. Mai>y telegrams had come tel ling of injuries resulting from stray bullets ' end at yesterday's cabinet meeting, where the telegrams , were discussed, it was understood that the determination to put an end to such occurrences was emphatically ex pressed.

"The families of our, chiefs and of ficers, and many of. our :soldiers are living in Naco, ArixV Under these cir cumstances you can flee how reasonable it is for us to avoid firing toward tho United States." .
