The steamer Seaside contemplates extending her run to Allyn, North Bay. She now runs only to Hartstein Island and the extension will add twelve miles to her semi-weekly trips. Some of the loggers at Ellis’ camp in Chapman’s cove, resented the ap pearance of a Chinese cook to replace Barney Johnson, and it is reported that he was shipped to Olympia on the City of Shelton Monday morning.

There being no opposition ticket, only 52 votes were cast. A. F. Dipman, L. J. Morrison and James Forrest were elected coun cilmen and A 1 J. Munson, town treas urer. One poor benighted individual cast his ballot for four not very highly respected citizens of the Point, to whom he must be related. Blood will tell H. C.

The President’s message, the docu ments which everybody talKs about, but few have the patience to read, was delivered to congress Tuesday. The message is a disappointment in many respects, and the President dog gedly upholds several of the policies, financial and otherwise’ which have brought upon the people hardship and contempt. Photographer Baker seems to have struck a vein of bad luck of late. East week he made a trip to the Chehalis Indian reservation near Oakville. Af ter a hard day,s ride in the rain he reached the reservation, put up his horse in the big barn and was drying himself in one of the houses, when the barn was discovered to be on fire. In a short time it was totally destroyed with several hundred tons of hay, oats, barley and roots; besides all the horses and cattle except one cayuse and one cow. Baker’s horse being among the last, as well as a fine government team and hack. Mr. Baker feels his loss considerably, more for his attachment for the animal than for its value. The Chehalis reservation has just become selfsupporting and this fire will put it back considerably. Olympia merchants have given the steamer Seaside a bonus to make three trips each week to all North Bay towns and Hartstein Island, and bring those residents to Olympia free of charge. The object is to get them to do their trading there. Much of this trade now goes to Tacoma but still a consid erable amount comes to Shelton, and if our merchants will get up some scheme to make trading more conven ient it is likely that Shelton can secure the bulk of this trade within the coun ty. We have several big general mer chandise stores where goods are sold as cheap as they are anywhere and in drugs, dry goods, clothing, holiday goods or any other line of trade, there are splendid big stocks from which to buy at very low prices. The county trade should be retained where it will benefit us all. We suggest that a floating dock be built at the point and some inducements offered in the way of free or cheap transportation from the points mentioned. A perusal of the Journal’s advertising will con vince that Shelton is amply able to supply the county people at very low prices. See Asmus’ big announcement. He intends closing out his stock of gener al merchandise and also selling his property interests in Shelton. If j'ou want anything prices will be no ob ject. The Mason County Logging Co., has about finished logging at camp 14 and has transferred one horse team and part of the men to camp 3, in the “cut-off.” The camp in charge of James Mcßeavy, has still plenty of timber in sight. The Company is now laying out a switch and locating new camps in timber about a mile south of Laue Newatzel, which will be opened up in time for spring worK. The spur will leave the main line just east of the LaKe, and will be constructed with the iron now on the switch to camp 14. The L. M. Co find themselves over stocked and are offering some lines of goods at cost for a few days in order to have them reduced before invoicing. O. C. Hanson has gone back to clerk ing again, and is handling the yard stick in the big store. The Mottman Mercantile Company, of Olympia, sends us an ad, which will be found on the first page. This new concern is one of the largest in Olym pia, and have already earned a reput ation for low prices and fair dealing.

The Olympian does not profess to know the sentiment of the majority o - f the women of this state on the ques tion of woman’s suffrage. If, however, their sentiment is to be judged by that which was evidenced at the recent election iu Massachusetts, by the women of that state, the greater num ber of the women themselves do not want the privileges which suffrage brings. At the election there, which was to determine as to the extension of womans suffrage iu municipal mat ters, but one female in ten availed her self of the privilege to vote on the proposition. The indifference of the women is iu itself an argument against the extension of suffrage to them, for if they are not enough in terested to say whether or not they want to vote, upon what proposition would it be possible to get an accurate expression of opinion from them? However, it may be possible for the women of this state differ in the mat ter from their sisters in New England. —Olympian. Correspondence And County Notes. Hood Canae, Dec. 3,1895. John Mehan an old Puget Sounder, died near Tahooya, Nov. 29. He was buried at Union City last Sunday. For some time he has been in poor health.

Todd plans to leave his home this week for a political campaign of a few months, around Seattle and Ta coma and Eastern Washington.

The potato crop in this region has about all been gathered, but it was very light compared with most prev ious years, owing to dry weather. Even the rich Skokomish bottom has produced smaller crops on account of th e dryness of the season than everbe fo re The Riverside Literary Society man aged to gather about thirty-five per sons together together last Friday evening notwithstanding the storm. The subject for debate “That the Mex ican war conferred more glory on the United States than the war of 1812,’ was decided in the negative. The next debate will be “The usefullness of wealth or knowledge. The Riverside Observer, under its new editor, Miss Mabel Bone, was a decided success. An odd exercise was the reading of eight different versions of “Mary had a little lamb;” three in English and one each in Irish, Dutch, Chinese, Pigeon English, Pigeon French and Chinook jargon. As the latter has never appeared in print, we send it to yc u with this. By the way did you ktiow that the yarn from one stocking knit from the wool from the lamb, was given to a church in Boston, and sold in bits, amounting to a hundred and forty dollars.
