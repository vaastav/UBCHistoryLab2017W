Dlgreat of President McKinley'a jftrst Annual Message. 4Xukh; Reform, the Cuban and Hawaii ma Question Itralt With Alone; Con. aarvatlve Lines Other Matters Given Consideration. Congratulations, WASrrnfGTON. Dec 6. President Mc Kinley sent his annual message to con- fr-ess. He congratulated it upon assembling under Yelicilious conditions. Peace and good will with all nations of tlie earth continue unbroken, he cays, and we should feel cenuine satisfaction at ia growing spirit of fraternal regard and uni fication in all sections of our country and toe tilting of great public questions above party prejudice. The Finances. Beginning with the subject of the finances, the president says that while the full eUect of the legislation of the extra session has not yet been realized, what it has already accomplished assures us of its timeliness an.l wis-ioin. To -test its permanent vaiue further time will be required and the people, satisiied with its oper suuds and results thus far. are in no mind to withhold from it a tair trial. The next ques tion pressing for consideration is that of the currency. With the reat risuunrs of govern ment and with the honorable i xumpie of the past before us. we ouu'iit not to h"si tate to enter upon a currency revision which will make our demand obliga tions less onerous to the eovernm it. and re lieve our financial laws from ambi-'Ui y and ioubU The evil of the present system is found in the great cost to the government of maintaining at a parity with gold our dillerenl forms of money, and tlie exjierience of the past four years have demonstrated that this is not only an expensive charge upon the government, but a dangerous menace to the national credit. It is manifest that we must devise some plan to protect the government against bond issues lor repealed redemptions. We have Kxju.uuu.Ouu of currency, wnicn the gov -emment. by solemn enactment, has undertaken to keep al par. and nobody is ooltged to redeem la gold but the government, which must borrow -the gold. The law, which reqi ires the payme.ut -out of the treasury of redeemed I'nited Males note, demands a constant replenishment of the .cold reserve, especially in times of panic and .insufficient revenue, and during the preceding Administration 4-&f..'ild,-4Ui 4-,-per-ceuU bonds were issued and sold to sustain the gold reserve and pay the esjtenses of the government in excess of revenue. While ft Is true that a greater part of this is used to apply deiicient revenues, a considerable ior tion was required to maintain the gold reserve. If no further legislation is to be had. to correct this and the policy of selling bon is is to be continued, then cougress should give the sec retary of the treasury authority to sell bonus ml long or short periods, beariiur a less rale of Interest than is now authorized by law. The resident says: Keeonrmendations, "! earnestly recommend as soon as the receipts the government are quite surlicieut to pay all the expenses of the government, that when any United States notes are presumed for redemp tion In gold ami are p-.i'-eue-d in gold, sucn notes shall be kept and set ap.irt ami only paid out in e change for goid. Tuts is an obvious duty. If the holder of the United States note prefers the Fold and gets it from the government ae should not receive back from the govern ment a United Slates note wituoul paying goid in exchange fur it." That amounts, to the president's mind, to giv ing an interest be.iring deoi. a government bfud, for a non-interest oeariug debt, a United Estates note. The government should be re lieved from the burden ot providing all the a-ouf required for exchanges and exports. This uujrht to be slopped. With an era of prosiTity and sufficient receipts we may feeino imnutiiaie embarrassment, but the danger wiii be ever present. The president invites careful consideration or the detail plan of tiie secretary of the treas ury to protect the gold reserve. He concurs with bim in the rec ,niiiiendat ion that national iankH be allowed to issue notes to the face vaiueof their bonds deposited: that their cir culation tax be reduced to one-hall of one iier .cent., and national banks may be established with a capital of &-.'.Yoiju. Ho also recommends 'that the issue of national bank notes be re Mricted to the denomination of ten dollars and upwards and that they be required to redeem their notes in gold. The Cuban Question. Turning to foreign affairs, the president de--votes much space in his message to a consider--aUon of the Cu -an question, which he says, is the most important prolilem with which our government is now called upon to deal in its foreign relations. Sumuiari7iug the history of former outbreaks, the president comes down to the present insurrection, speaking uf its re sSiarkabie increase, its t -nacious existence Against enormous forces massed by Sain the widespread destruction of property and the disiegard or the civilized code of war on both sides. He says these conditions Hire rise to gravest apprehensions. There is so desire on our part to prolit by Spain's mis fortunes, and we have only the desire to see Cjubans enjoying that measure of self-control, which is the inalienable right of man. Of the ooacentration policy of Weyler he says: "It tins utterly failed as a war measure, it is not tfuvilized warfare it is extermination." Our Government's I'rotest. .Against this abuse of the rights of war. ths president says, he has felt constrained, on re peated uccasious to enter the lirm and honest protest of this government. He outlines his instructions to Minister Woodford, which were in substance to impress upon ttic Spanish gov ernment the sincere wish of the United Slates to lend its aid toward the ending of the war by reaching a )ieac ful and lasting result, just anil 3ouorablc to Spain and to the t'uban people. It was also asked whether Spain of her own volition should not make profiosals for settle ment and it was said thai we could not contem plate an IlideUuite jieriod lor the accompiish--snent of this result. The Spanish Reply, The Spanish reply to Mr. Woodford, was, in v.he president's opinion, in the direction of a better understanding. It admitted our friendly purposes and deep interest, aud declared that the new government was bound to change of policy that should satisfy the United Slatesand pacify Cuba within a reasonable time. To this end political reforms will be put into effect and onilitary operutious conducted on humane lines. It was suggesU-d that Spain be left free to conduct military operations and grunt political reforms wnile the United States for its part should enforce neu tral obligations and cut on the assistance -which the insurgents, it was asserted, received Trom this country. Karly and complete paciii- cation is hoped for. The president declares that the Spanish dis . position to charge us with failure to meet in ternational duties is baseless, and points to the efforts this government have made at the . cost of minions, and by the employment of the - administrative machinery of the nation to per form its duty welt He also says that the fact that no military expedition or armed vessel -,as left our shores has been diplomatically t represented with Spain. Promising that throughout all the horror and danger to our 1 peace, the United States has never abrogated uts right to determine its policy as to Cuba, the president points out that, of untried measures, there remains only: Kecogniiion of the insur gents as belligerents, recognition of the inde pendence of Cuba, neutral intervention to end the war by imposing a rational compromise be tween the contestants, an intervention in favor X3t one or the other party. Mo Forcible Annexation. "He says: "I speak not ot forcible annexa tion, for that can not be thought of. That by air code of morality would be criminal aggres sion. Taking up the question of belligerency, cv president quotes at length from President Ofraut's message of December 7, !.. wherein as declared that the condition in Cuba war raated neither the recognition of independence nor the reeomiiion of belligerency. He adds aal moreover a recognition of bellig erency would confer upon Neither party to conflict a status not there'ofore act ually possessed while it would weUiu heavily In Spain's behalf, giving her the right to search a the hi h seas and extending her maritime rathts to the margin of our territorial waters, 'or these reasons," says the president, "I regard the recognition of the belligerency of the Cuban insurgents as now unwise and there fore inadmissible. Should that step hereafter be deemed wise, as a matter of right and duty, he executive will take it." Hopeful Citange In Spanish Pollry. He points U the hopeful change In the Span ish policy to the pledge of reform and to the abatement of the horrors of war as reasons against intervention on humanitarian grounds. The lirst acts of the new government lie iu ihe honorable paths it has outlined: the policy of Tvpine and extermination has been reversed aad broad clemencies proffered: measures have, been taken to relieve the horrors of starvatio n Thepoetct the Spanish aimies. it is as aerted. is to be used not to spread ruin and des ctatioa. but to protect the resumption of agri cultural industries. The president sketches hc autonomy scheme of the Spanish govern ment, and says that it is honestly due to Sp-cin cast aha should be given a reasonaie chance to realize her expectations, a id to prove the as serted efliciacy of the new order of things to which she stands irrevocably committed. He points to the manv con'-essions already made, to the modifications of the horrible order of concentration, to the release of the Com petitor" prisoners, und the fact that not a single Amencan citizen is now under arrest in Cuba. He says the n-ar future will demonstrate whether a righteous peace is likely t be attained, if not. the exigency of further and other action by the United States will re main to be taken. Sure of the right, the gov ernment will continue its watchful cares over every American citizen and its efforts to brm? about honorable peace and, says the President: "IZ it snail h ace after appear to be a duty imposed by our obligations to ourselves, to civilization and humanity to intervene with force, it shall lie w Uhout fuuit fn our part, and only because the necessity for sueh action will be so clear as toco umatid the supiort and approval of the civilized world." Hawaiian Annexation. The president next takes up the subject of the annexaio;i of Hawaii which, he says, should be accomplished, liapioly reviewing his former argum"tiis in facnr ot annexation, he says that legislation is rci-ired in the event of the ratitl caiion of the treaty and. whiie abrupt assimila tions of immature i- nientsof population should be avoided, just provision should be mane for self-rule in local miners with tue largest po litical iilierlyto the Jl.w.-aiians. HesaysTuat Ine dispute between Japan and Hawaii over the itiiuiie-ation question is now in a sat i -factory stageol :,cKiemetit dy negotia tions; that our government has not intervened, an I that it is learned that Japan is now con lidctit in the intention of this government to dea. with ail possible uitcruir questions alTect ing her interests in the broadest spirit ol friendliness. Ontral American Complexities. Keference is made to the failure of Mr. Mer ry to be received as minister to Nicaragua on account of the otil;eatii,ns of that country to the diet of the liiva'cr liepubiic of Central Ame ica. As there is uo lega. authority at present to accredit him to Ire- diet. -Mr. li.iker, the present minister a- Managua, has been di rected to present his letter., of recall. Air. W. tlodfrey hunter is sai l to be likewise accred ited to Honduras, a member of the Greater lie pubiic, and his case is awaiting action. The Nu-araguit Canal. The Nicaragua canal is spoken of as of large importance to our country, and the promise is made of further reference to the subject which, in the report of tiie commission now at work, is sent to congress. International lll-Metalliftm. The president says of the international mon etary commission that, notwithstanding dil igent etiort, the envoys have failed so far to secure an agreement. Gratifica tion is expressed at the action of France in this matter in joining in our ciiects, and it is said that the negt.a.aiiotis are still pending. Meanwhile the envoys have not made their linal reports, believing lhat ttiedouMs raised in certain quarters re,ieciin the feasibility of maintaining parity between goldand silver may yet be solved, 'i'lie president earnestly hopes that theii labors may br. n ubuu'. au interna tional agreement. Ket-iproeity Negotiation. Mr. Kass-.n. of Iowa, is said to be now con ducting ne'nti.itior:s with several governments lor reciprocity arrangements u.ttier the tanil act. and it is believed i uat oy a careful exercise of the powers conferred by l!i" ael. some griev ances of our owu and oiaer countries in our mutual trade relations may be removed or alle viated and Hit volume oi our commercial ex changes enlarged. The president earnestly urges the improve ment of our merchant marine, the Inferiority of which, he says, is humiiiaiin to tnu national pride. Protection of Seal Life. Keference is made to the recent conferences at Washington on the subject of toe protect.on of seai iile. the results 01 uhicli place beyond conlrovcrsy. it is said, ol the duty of the gov-ci-niiieiils concerned to adopt measures without delay for tile preservation of the herds. Nego l.auous to this end are now in progress. International Arbitration. International arbitration is declared by the president to represent the lu st seitnm- iit ol the civilize 1 world, and treaties cmh.idyiiig these humane, principles on broad lines, 'without in any way lmeeriiiingour interests or honor, will have its constant eucouragemenL The 1'a Is JkXHM,tlon.

The Navy. Under the head of the navy, the president points to the necessity for speedy legislation to procure the armor for the three battleships now building, which would be otherwise use less. He sp-aks iu terms of praise of tne qual ity of our ships, aud thinks that the time has now arrived when the increase to which the country is committed should for a time take the form of increased facilities commensurate with the increase of our naval vessels Luck of Dock I'acil.tles. He refers to Ihe lack of docks, and urges that three or four of the largest docks be provided on the Atlantic, at least one on the Pacific coast, and a floating din-k in the gulf. There should also be ample provision for munitions of war and an increase of oincers and enlisted men. Additions are also necessary to navy yards, and as there are now on the stocks live large battleships it is recommended that an appropriation tie made but for one more battle ship on the Pacific coast. Several torpedo boats are also necessary. Legislation Needed for AlBMka. Attention is called to the need for prompt legislation as to Alaska and the extensj-jr, of civil authority wituiu the tefriiory. Tuere is need for surveys an. I for the citabiishment of anoi her land utile- al some point in the Yukon valley, for which an appropriation is ask4d. Military force is also necessary aud the estab lishment of some sort of flexible government. If the startling rep irts as to the probable shortage of food for the miners be fully vert tied, ev. ry etiort should be made at any cost to carry them relief. Affairs in I lie Indian Territory. The message deals at some length with the unsatisfactory condition of adairs in the Indian territory. 'I he large wnile eleni'-ut is said to be without protection and without schools or oth er rights of citizens: leading Indians have ab sorbed great tracts of lanus and created an aristocracy, and the friends of ine Indians be lieve that ihe iH'st interests of the live civilized tribes would be found in American citizenship. Failure of the Dawes Commission. Keference is made to the failure so far of the Dawes commission to secure the consent of ths trities to an extinguishment of the tribal titles aud a division ot the lands. It is said that should the tribes still fail to ratify the agree ment, that some legislation should be had by congress. The Quarantine Laws. The president approves the rccommeu . At ion of the secretary of the treasury for an .(ten sion of the quarantine laws, and also surest the appointment of a special commission io as certain the caa of yellow fever. Tlie Khiihmh I'Mcitlc Kailrond. Speaking of th? pending sale of the fc ansas Paeilic railroad, it is said, that if no belter bidder is received than the upset price UxeJ by the court, the government would receii only R'.nilu.ouO on its claim of nearly I3.0 u.oou. He believes that the government has the authority to bid oa the road, and has directed the secre tary of the treasury to make tne deposit of Ijih.Oui required to qualify as a bidder and to bid at the sale a sum at least equal to the prin cipal of the debt to the government. Congress Should Legislate In th Case, He suggests, however, that in a matter so im portant as the government becoming a possible owner of the railroad, congress should enact some legislation to define its views. It is clear to him. however, that the government should not permit the property to be sold at a price less than one half the principal of its debt and less than one-fifth of its enure debt, principal and interest. The Civil Service. The president devotes the last chapter of his message to i he civil service, the practical im provement of which, he says, has long been a subject of earnest discussion, and which has of late years received increased legislative and ex ecutive approval. During the past few months the service has been placed upon a still firmer basis of business met ho is and personal merit. While the right of deserving veteran soldiers to reinstatement has biien asserted, dismissals for merely political reaWins have been carefully guarded against: the examinations improved and made practical, and a distinct advance has been made by iving a hearing befort dis missal upon all cases where Incompetency is charged or demand made for the removal of officials. This last has been done with out impairing the power of re moval, one of the vital safeguards of the system. Much remains to be done be fore the system can lie perfected, and the pres ident says that be shall not hesitate to exempt rases which he thinks have been improperly Included in the classified service, or include those wmch. in his judgment, will best 1 promote the public service The system has the ap proval of the people, and it will bo his endeavor to uphold and extend iu Retrenchment Suggested. In conclusion, the president admonishes 004 gress not to encourage the increase of the esti mates for the maintenance of the government. They would admilof decrease in many braneres and it is a commanding duty to keep the aopto priations within the receipts of the govern uasntl and thus avoid a deficit.

Intermit Revived In the Alleged Georgia Clew Corroborative Evidence la at Hand The Slurderer l.elleved to be a Convict Now Serving a Life Sentence la the Georgia feniirntlary for Another Murder. Little Rock. Ark., Dec. a. Interest In the Pitts (Ga.) clew to the murderer ot Hon. John M. Clayton, which had about subsided here, owing to tiie tone ot recent communications from Luther Aiken, the Georgia convict guard, who claims to be in possession of the name of the murderer, has been revived, and it is now probable that the clew will be investigated. Sheriff J. D. Clary of Bradley coun ty. Ark., in an interview with Gov. Jones, has related strong corroborative evidence of the alleged fact that a Ueorgia convict has confessed to the murder of Clayton at Plummerville iu the autumn of 1SS9. Sheriff Clary says that he has information from a former citizen of Georgia, now living in Brad ley county, that a Georgia convict made such a confession to another convict, and that the self-confessed murderer of John M. Clayton is now serving a life sentence for another murder in Georgia. His name is withheld, but it is stated that he is a former citizen of Arkansas aud fled from the state im mediately after murdering Clayton. At the time the murder was committed it was generally considered to be the denoument of a political fight, but, ac cording to the confession, politics played no part in the terrible affair, revenge for an old grudge being the motive given by the Georgia convict. The state authorities say they will leave no stone unturned to bring the murderer to justice in this state, bat are in a quandary as to how it could be done, should the murderer be found serving a life sentence for murder in another state. The state of Arkansas has a reward of only S5U0 standing at present for the arrest and conviction of the murderer, but it is thought that the relatives of the murdered man will supplement the amount to the end that the Georgia clew may be thor oughly investigated.
