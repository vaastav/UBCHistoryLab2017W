Features of Pres. Wilson's Message. The principal features of President Wilson's message to Congress are as follows: It points out that the people of Europe will soon be suffering for the necessities of life and that we should be ready to extend "our help and manifest services." Refers to the opportunity for supplying the countries of Central and South America, heretofore trading with Europe, with articles of manufacture and commerce; in this connection emphasizes the need of building up the merchant marine, the development of which has been "stunted and hindered" heretofore, and urges the passage of the pending shipping bill. Criticises the policy concerning our natural resources, as "the laws we have made do not intelligently balance en couragement against restraint," and urges the passage of pending bills concerning use of water power and the "unlocking of the resources of the national domain." Urges the passage of the Philippines self-government measure. Regrets that the rural credits legislation probably cannot be enacted at this session. Urges the Senate to confirm the proposed convention for safety at sea. Recommends that Congress make provision for the survey and the charting of our coasts, especially the coast of Alaska. Urges economy in Government expenditures, asserting that "the people of the United States are not jealous of the amount their Government costs, if they are sure that they get what they need and desire for the outlay"; that the Government needs "systematic reorganization and reassembling of its parts so as to secure greater efficiency and effect considerable saving in expense"; that it should be organized as a business man would organize it; and that "it is not expenditure but extravagance that we should fear being for." As to national defense it is declared that "we are the champions of peace and concord"; that "we have had a clear and settled policy," and "while we retain our principles we never shall have a large standing army; we shall not turn America into a large military camp; we shall not ask our young men to spend the best years of their lives making soldiers of themselves." In lieu of this, it is suggested that the efficiency of the national guard be increased and that the citizenry of the country be trained in the use of arms, in drill and maneuver and the sanitation of camps. In reference to the Navy declares that "we shall take leave to be strong upon the seas," but only as a means of defense, not conquest; that "the country has been misinformed," and that "we have not been negligent of national defense." County Attorney C. W. Herndon and and Assessor F. L. Hunt departed Wednesday evening last to Utah, where they will look after important matters for Mohave county. Under instruction from the State Tax Commission Mr. Hunt has had a large number of wild horses rounded up in the Hurricane plateau section, of our northern strip, and will advertise them for sale to pay the tax due the county and state. His cowboys have notified him that they have one hundred and fifty of the horses corraled and it is to sell them that the two county officers are going into that country. Many of these horses are well bred and the cowboys in southern Utah often capture them and break them to the saddle. It is expected that many buyers will be on hand to bid on the animals. Over the plateau country are said to bo thousands of wild horses, and unlike the usual run of wild horses these have gotten away from the herds of the cattlemen of that country. It is the intention of the Assessor to capture all the un-branded horses possible and dispose of them for the tax and expense of sale. This and Five Cents.
