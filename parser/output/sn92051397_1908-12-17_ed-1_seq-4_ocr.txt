RUMORS STILL PERSIST Siiys IVniilo An Not ('mnlniTil Hint Kvcrytlilns: Wus llljrlit, mill AliN for a ('iiiicrpwsloiiiil In- r( Inn I ioti. Indianapolis, Deo. -The Indian apolis News, mentioned In the apodal message on Ihe Panama canal deal, sent to congress yesterday by Presi dent Roosevelt, Issued n reply to the chief executive to-day; It says: It Is dltlloult to eharaeterli-.e fully the latest outbreak of the president without resorting to the. use of lan guage as undlgnllled nnd blameworthy as that which put the president's ut terance In a class by Itself In tho ofllelnl literatim of the high ollice he holds. Whatever provocation Mr. Roosevelt may have felt pricking his soul, nothing could justify or much loss extenuate the torrent of invective and virulence which he poured out In a state paper upon the head of pri vate eltlsfens. No one In his sober senses can fall to regard the performance as a grave de rogation to the dignity of the presiden tial station, a pitiable exhibition of towering rage on the part of the chief magistrate, and the source of humllla Hon and chagrin to the entire country It is quite Impossible to think of any of Mr. Roosevelt' long line of dlstln gulshed predecessors that could possi bly have so forgotten the dignities am decencies- of his exalted position as to transmit to congress a message In any way comparable with that of yester day. The News says further thai whether Mi. liooseeelt knows It or not, rumors and n ports touching the Pannnn transaction have been numerous and persistent, ami that notwithstanding all Ins nssevva lions, people still are not convinced that everything was as II should have been, this without In the least Impugning the good fatlh of the president or his agents In the negotia tions. Tim News says many points have not been denied up and they tail not be cleared up by threats of libel and pen lashings of editors (lint hold the good name nnd the Interesls of the eouatry quite as dear as does the pres ident The pirer says In concluding lis statement thai Hie Rnlney resolution snmild be adopted and that congress make a i-enrrhlng Investigation of all the facts, clrrnnistanros nnd rumors connect, d with Ihe Panama activities of (in- go; ernment.
