OŸ THE President's Message. The President in hie message at the opening of Congress on last Monday, con gratulates the country on the gratifying condition of our foreign relations. What «light differences have arisen during '.he vesr have already been settled or are in a fair way of adjus: ment. Ot the Irish ar rests he says a somewhat extended corres pondence with Great Britain has been held on that subject, and a disposition to respect our rights has been shown by the release of the arrested parties. Of the Isthmus canal the President says: The claim of this nntion in regard to the suprrvision and control of the inter-oceanic canal across the American Isthmus has continued to be the subject of conference. It ii likely that time will be inure powerful than discussion in removing the divergence between the two nations, whose friendship is so clearly cemented by the intimacy of rrlationa and the community of their Inter ests. The Russian persecution of Hebrews is dwelt upon.- A courteous remonstrance from tills country 'was amicably received. The President believea the time is not far distant when. Russia will be able to secure toleration to all religious faiths. The protection of submarine cables is now the subject of an intei national confer ence at Paris, and our Minister to France is attending as a delegate. The President recommends that discretion be vested with the Executive to send delegates to any Im portant foreign conventions and that mon' ey be provided to pay the expenses. Attention is calked to the onerous fines imposed by Spaln and . her colonies upon United States vessels for trivial technical offenses against local regulations. Com plsint is also made of the excessive fees de manded- by Spanish consuls in American ports, whfch amount to ai considerable ex port dutv. The German Government has invited the United States to participate in an inter national exhibition of domestic cattle, to be held at Hamburg. In July, 1883. An appro priation is asked for that purpose. The death of Mr. Marsh, our laid Minis ter to Italy, is deplored In fitting terms. The extradition treaty with Belgium, which has been In operation eighteen years, has been replaced by another. Negotiations are in progress with Switaerland with the view to a treaty to determine whether a cltisen of that republic enn renounce his allegiance and become naturalised in the United Slates. The deportations of paupers from certain Swiss cantons to this country has substan tially ceased On the Chinese restriction act the mes sage says: The recent legislation restrict ing the immigration of laborers from China, lias given rise to the Question whether citl uns of China proceeding to or from anoth er may lawfully pass through our own. In construing the'act of May 6th, 1882, in con nection with the treaty of Nov. ist 1880, the restriction would seem to be limited to Chinese immigrants coming to the United States as laborers, and should not forbid'a mere transit across our country. I ask the attention of Congress to the subject for such action as may be deemed advisable. The return of the indemnity fund to China and Japan is recommended. The treaty lately concluded with Corea awaits the action of the Senate. During the late disturbance in Egypt through the timely presence of American vessels protection was afforded the persons and property of many o,' our own citizens and those of oth er countries, whose governments have ex pressed their thanks for the friendly ser vice. The reciprocacy treaty with Hawaii, which becomes terminable in September next, receives due attention, and an enlarg ed diplomatic intercourse with San Do mingo is recommended. The lawlessness existing on the Texas border Is deprecated, and legislation for its suppression recom mended. The establishment of an interna |ionai boundrv between the two republics i» recommended, and money asked to make the survey. 

SOUTH AMERICA. Our relations with Venezuela continue unchanged. Action is asked on the pend ing awards against that country. The United Stetes is invited to send representa tives to Caraccas in July next to the cen tennial celebration of the birth ol Bolivar, tile founder of South American independ ence, on which occasion it is designed to commence the erection of a statue of Wash ington and open an industrial exposition, to w hich American products will be admitted. The President requests that this count™ lie repsesented and suitable provision made The^recent Chili-Peru embrogllo Is re hearsed at some length. In January last this country sent a special mission to tue belligerent powers to snggest that Chili ac cept a money indemnity and refinquish her demand for territory. To tills Chili re fused to accede. The intervention of this country could go no further without en dangering our peaceable relations. 1 lie ter ritory of Peru has been partitioned, and any protest against this harshness of the victor nation would need to be backed up with an anned force. It is to be regretted that Chill exacts such rigorous conditions, and is so Indisposed to submit to arbitration the terms of an amicable settlement. Some time ago invitations were sont to tiie various American countries to send representatives to a peace Congress to >* held in Washington in November last. This being an unusual exercise of executive P'nver, the President last April asked the opinion of Congress upon the proposed meeting. No action was taken on the mat ,er nor anv provision made to meet the ex penses. 'Accordingly he postponed the «inference and notified the powers interest «1 to that effect.

DIPLOMATIC CHANGES. Changes have occurred in the diplomatic representation of several foreign P powers during the last year. New ministers from ™ Argentine Republic, Austria, Hunenrv C . hina 'j F D ance ' J a P an > Mexico^ j® Netherlands and Russia have present ed their credentials. The mission bf Den mark and Venezuela at this capital have been raised in grade, Switzerland has crea ted a plenipotentiary mission to tills Government, and an Embassy from Mada gascar and a minister from Siam will short ly arrive. Our diplomatic Intercourse has been enlarged by the establishment and re lations with the new kingdom of Sierra, by a mission to Siam, and by the restoration of the mission to Greece. A charge d'af faires will shortly be sent out to Persia the representatives of Great Britian have hitherto protected the rights of our citizens in that empire. Legislation is recommended to place this country in harmony with other powers with respect to the international rules for the prevention of collisions at sea. Monev is asked to enable the Smithsonian Insti tute, under the Department of State, to make an exchange of official publications with the leading European powers in ac cordance with an agreement made in Paris. The act of Congress making appropria tions for the diplomatic and cousular serv ice is warmly approved. It contemplates the re-organization of both branches of such service on a salaried basis, leaving the fees to enure to the benefit of the Treasury. Of the finances of the country the Presi dent says it appears that the ordinary rev enues from all sources for the fiscal vear ended June 30th, 1882, were as follows: From customs, $220,421,730.25; from inter nal re v.,$ 147,497,595,45 ; from sales of public lands, $4,753,140.69; from tax on circulation and deposits on National Banks, $8,956, 766.45; from repayment of interest bv the Pacific Rail wav Company, $840,554.37; from sinking fund for Pacific R. ft.', do., $796,271.42; from customs, fees, fines, pen alties, etc., $134.334,800; from fees, Consul ar letters, patents and lands, $263,89997; from proceeds of sales of government prop erty, $314,959 85: from profits of coinage, bullion deposits' and assays, $44,693 ; from Indian trust funds, $575,243; from deposits by individuals for surveying public lands, $'23152,506; from revenues of District of Columbia, $1,715,176.41 ; from miscellane ous sources, $3,383,445.43. Total of ordi nary receipts, 403,425,250.28. The foreign commerce of the U. S. dur ing the last fiscal year, including'imports and exports of merchandise and special, was a* follows ; Export merchandise, $750,742'' 272; special $49417476; tot.il, $ 799 . 950,736 Import merchandisew$724,630,574 ; special. $42477,390; total, $767,111,964. Excess of exporte over imports of merchandise, $25. .902,683. This, excess is less than it has beeti before in any of the previous six years, as appears by the following table for the year ended June 30th : Excess of exports over imports, pf merchandise, in 1876, { 176,796,434.81; 1877, $151,152,094; 1878, 207,814,234; 1879, $2^4,661.666; 1880, $167,683,912; 1881, $259,712,718; 1882, $25.902,603. During the year there have been organ) sed 171 national banks. Of these Institu tions there are now in operation 2,269, a larger number than ever before. The val ue of their notes in actual circulation on July ist, 1882, was $324,656,45a I com mend to your attention the Secretary's views in respect to the circulation, and to the modes by which that result may, in his judgment, be avoided. On the coinage of silver dollars the President savs; I have seen nothing to al ter, but much to confirm the sentiments to which I gave expression last year. A com parison between the respective amounts of silver dollars in circulation on November ist, 1881, and 011 November ist, 1882 shows a slight Increase of a million and a half dol lars, but during the interval, there had been in the whole number coined an increase of 26,000,000, and the S,ooo,ooo thus far mint ed make a little more than 35,000,000 in circulation. The message refers at length to the rev enues of the country, and the President gives Ills views on the tariff, advising a thorough revision of the tariff laws. The revenue from customs for the fiscal year ending J une 30th, 1879, amounted to $ 137, 000,000. It has in three succeeding years reached first $186,000,000, then $198.000, 000; and finally, as has been already stated, $226,000,000. Indian affairs are referred to as follows: From the report of the Secretary of War it appears that the only outbreaks during the past year occurred in Arizona and in the southwestern pai t of New Mexico. They were promptly quelled and the quiet which has prevailed in all other parts of the coun try has permitted such an addition to be made to the military force in the region en dangered by the Apaches that there is little reason to apprehend trouble in the future. Afler referring at considerable length to the reports of the heads of departments, the star route cases, the public service, po litical assessments, and agriculture, the message, uuder Us sub-headings leads:
