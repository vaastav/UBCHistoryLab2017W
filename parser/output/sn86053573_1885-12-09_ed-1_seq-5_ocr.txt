COMMENTS ON THB MKS3AOE. What Messrs. Morrison ami nnmlall nmt Others Think of tho Document, Tho President's mcisago was, of courso tho chief subject of comment yesterday and last night. Everybody was discussing It, and very varied wero tho opinions expressed. Most of tho statesmen commended It, and thoso that did not placed tho Injunction ot "Don't quote mo" on their interrogators. The most general comment was that the mes sago was too long. An old-tlmcr says that Cleveland's message was tho longest over given out except President Tyler's first, which was so long that tho Homo had to read It by sections half ono day and tho second part tho noxt. A statistician who figured out tho length of tho President's message says that there wcro 1,013 words In It. Somo of tho opinions expressed yester day aro given below t Itcprcsentatlvo Morrison, tho author of tho horizontal tariff bill ot last year, was first met. "What do you think of tho President's messagot" "His a lengthy, carefully prepared docu ment so far as I aracapabloof Judging n paper of literary merit." "How do you llko tho treatment of tho tariff?" "His recommendation of a reduction Is exactly In my line, and of courso has my approval. Tho reduction ho recommends Is greater than that proposed by my hori zontal bill of last year." " v nai uocs mo rrcsiucni mean uy say ing that tho greatest reduction should bo In tho tax on ncccssarlcst" "Oh, that Is a very general expression sometimes even demagogues uso It. But the President means by lt,what I meant In my bill, by leaving out silks, spirits, wlno, and other things that pcoplo cau do without to fay their present high rates of duty, whllo put In, and tried to rcduco SO per cent., nearly all tho things tho pcoplo must have." "Do you think tho message, likely to lead to tho tariff, reduction!" "Yes; It all thoso who profess to llko tho messago aro honest enough to voto for tho amount of reduction recommended.'" "Havo you read any of tho documents ac companying tho messagot" " l cs; anu lounu somo aiiniirauio rovenuc reform doctrluo In Secretary Manning's ro port." "What do you think ot tho President's views on silver!" "Well, I think somo legislation on tho subject Is or soon may bo necessary, but It Is likely thcro will bo somo reductions ot tariff taxes before tho Prcsidcut's views on silver aro enacted Into law." Civil Service Commissioner Edgcrton said: "It Is an admlrablo message. Tho civil eervlco rccommcudatlons aro In con formity with tho President's. I wassuro that his views would bo as they arc." Itcprcsentatlvo Randall! "Ycs;lt Is a good message. I have no fault to find with auy portion ot It. It meets my lews." Representative Warner said I "Tho lews on tho silver question aro about tlio sumo as set out In his letter ot March last. I llko tho messago whero It touches upon tho tariff, but do not agrco with tho President's views upon tho silver question. Thcro aro somo things posslblo and somo things im possible. It is Imposslblo to havo n con traction of tho currency to tho extent of one-third of It, by taking gold out ot circu lation, and at the samo tlmo havo what Is left depreciated by SO per cent., as It Is asserted will bo tho case. Such a thing novcr took placo In any country in tho worldlnauy age, and It never can.'' 

IVIIEIU: TO GO FOlt IMUCSKXTd. Tho l'lnco "iVltoro l'lcgnnt Holiday Gifts Can Ho Gotten. A little lady that reminded tho visitor ot tho Mikado school girls, courteously sv ung tho door open at tho Bon Marcho yesterday afternoon. Holiday gifts wcro tho objcctlvo point, as it wcro. Combined with a light purso was an ardent dcslro to sccuro presents which would bo at tho samo tlmo elegant and not procurabloby every one so us to bo too easily duplicated by other donors to tho samo parties. Tho only difficulty was to discriminate among so many beautiful things. Most of tho bril liant array had been imported especially for this house. Tho most conspicuous ar ticles wero of plush, aud every form In which that most popular material Is used can bo found. Then there wcro ele gant mirrors, fancy willow-ware, jowolry, leather goods, umbrellas, neckwear for la dies, fans, and every tiling elso that could bo thought of. Tho elegant Imported hats aud bonnets marked to sell for $13 to $20 aro now put down to tho uniform prlco of $8; wraps, baby novelties, mantlo llacons, arti ficial flowers, nnd Courvlssler gloves wero a few of tho things tho reporter saw alter his wallet was exhausted. He afterwards saw about a thousand other things ho wanted described In a colossal advertisement, which ho had access to beforo tho public, being In the National Republican this morning for tho first time. Till! NAIIDELI.O TUIAT.. Further rncts Developed In tho Cir cumstantial Circle. Tlio cross-examination of Wills C. Mor rls was continued In tho criminal court yes tcrday, upon tho resuming of tho trial of Antonio Nardcllo for tho murder of Car mine Rotunno, but thcro was no material difference from tho direct testimony. Arthur Wclland testified that whllo clerk ing In tho drug storo at tho corner of Mary laud avenue and Four-and-a-half street, in July last, Nardcllo, accompanied by Willa Morris, camo In twlco to havo his finger dressed. Ho said that In a fight with a man tho man had bitten him. To tho witness it seemed a wound almost tho length ot tho finger, cut to tho bouc. Ho had novcr seen a bite looking liko It. fty tho testimony of Helen Robinson and Nellie Robinson a letter written In jail by Nardcllo was traced to Willa Morris. Sarah Williams, keeper of tho bagulo No. 281 Maryland avenue, cavo an account of Nardcllo's visit to her hottso, tho length ot tlmo ho remained, aud leaving with Willa Morris. At a few minutes past I o'clock tho court adjourned for tho day. Tlio Comlnc llollduyx. Thcro Is n decided tendency this year to mako Christmas presents of useful, practical, and Bcnstblo articles of wearing apparel, Ac., and no firm In Washington Is better able to meet theso wants than Woodward & Lotlirop, tlio enterprising proprietors of tlio JlojtonDry Goods House.
