The Erie Railway "Reform."?A special telegram from London to the Herald an* Bounces the progress of the organization in that city of a combination of the holders of Erie Railway shares for the pupose of effect lag a new and improved direction of the under taking. The movement is simultaneous with that which has been set on foot in New York with a like object, and which is assisted by the adhesion of the President and at least two memhers of the Stock Exchange in this city. Mr. James McIIenry heads the "reform" pro ject lo England. The Shooting Affray at Richmond, Va., Yesterday is another evidence of the evils of carrying concealed dangerous weapons.

The PreaiAeutial agitation bat actively com menced. Tbe policy of Mr. Greeley, of leav ing the republican nomination to the national party Convention, Vas been overruled and set ? aside, and, from tbo general voice of the partj, '?tfJeneral Grant is pronounced its candidate for Ibe succession. Thre democrats and the anti Gx.ant republicans accept the situation on this ground, and the main question before them is, "H.W can General Grant be defeated ?" We bavesK.hown how be might be defeated through the projected impeachment movement, but this mo revel t hangs fire. From our special de spa tcbes o i the subject, which we give to oar readers ' morning, It will be seen that the democrats t re disposed to take hold of it; bul while we are awaiting further develop ments let ne a what the President-making politicians at W. *shington are doing and what, k> the-republican party and in the demooratlo party at headqiwn ^erst 'B the drlft of the wind. It seems to bq set tied that, at the request of nearly the whole-boo 7 of the republican Sen ators, Mr. Fish will* rt 'main at the head of the State Department' foi ' an indefinite time to come, but that Mr. a Vkerman, the Attorney General, has found! it expedient to retire, and that Mr. Robeson, the Secretary of the Navy, will probably reft re very soon. It Is announced that Judge*' Wl Hams, of Oregon, s very acceptable man; ? atsd one of the Joint High Commission, big' H appointed to the place of Mr. Akettnwi , and that, most probably, in tbe event ofcthe-4 retirement of Mr. Robeson, some P?nnsyt**ok vn (hut not tbe amiable and venerable 14*. Bt ?rle) will be ap pointed to that vacancy.4 Al 1 this Is plain sailing; but tbe continuance |of Mr. Fish in the Cabinet seems to bs a git 'at disappoint ment to Mr. Greeley.. He hasfcmdently been hoping for a change in the State^Department to tbo disadvantage of Senator Cqnkling and te> the advantage of Senator Feniou at id his factioi*' in the councils of the administrate n ; bnt that fat is now all in the fire. Moreover, from the retention of Mr. Fish it would appear that neither the Senate nor the President cares anything for the personal hostility of Mr. Sum ner or the grievances of Mr. Fenton or the wrath of Mr. Schurs. General Grant, in short, evidently believes himself strong enough. In the Senate and In the country, to get along without these men, and so he leaves them to take their own oourse and sticks to his St. Domingo friend, Mr. Fish. But what docs this retention of Mr. Fish ' signify in reference to Cuba? Does it mean , the continuance of his exploded do-nothing ? policy, or a new departure ? From the tone and the hints of the President's Message on Cuban affairs we think.it means a new depar ture ; but we shall see. Uuquestionably the late horrible Spanish barbarities at Havana, and other recent events in and around the "Ever Faithful Isle," give an opportunity for a splendid coup cCUat in that quarter from General Grant. However, as General Grant's p olicy is peace, we are not very sanguine of a Jacksonian settlement of the Cuban question; bat we shall see. Meantime General Banks, as chairman on Foreign Affairs in the House, is following up the suggestions of the Message; but he seems to be very careful in keeping within the mark. He proposes a bill, for in stance, to prevent our citizens from holding slaves in foreign lands; but he has nothing to propose to put an end to Spanish insolence and Spanish barbarities in Cuba. Is General Banks temporizing with Spain or only amusing Mr. Fish ? And what has beoome of General Butler? Neither in the House nor In the- Senate, so far, have we had any foreshadow ings of the Presidential line of action of the democrats or anti-Grant re publicans. All sorts of democratic bun combe resolutions have been offered* (abounding in glittering generalities signifying ?nothing; but we have looked in vain For any proposition of a practical character in refer ence to a Presidential programme against General Grant. The Hon. Fernando Wood submits a programme for the party in power which is only good for buncombe, and Tom Dick and Harry have each their coastitiu tional amendments to propose of an 1m practicable character; bat beyond this clap trap we have nothing yet from the democrat a in Congress touching the great Presidential question. The President, in bis Message, recommends the abolition of the income tax and all our internal revenue assess ments except the taxes on tobacco, wines, malt and spirituous liquors and stamps, and upon this proposition the democrats might do something in forcing the republicans to show their bands ; but nothiog is done. Mean time the period is fast approaching for the col lection of these internal taxes, and any bill Intended for the relief of the people in 1872 In this matter ought to be passed without delay. The present prospect of any relief to the country in lessening our burdens of national \ ??? vs F-. ,v<r- v taxes, Internal and tariff, is anything but en couraging. The Presidential game of the demo crats is evidently the game of hampering and baffling the republicans in their relief meas ures, and then to hold them responsible before the country. 0 i the other hand, the republi cans appear to be afraid to venture into the deep water of financial reforms, because of the ganger of discords and splits that may strengthen the anti-Grant factiou. The two houses will doubtless adjourn over, at least from the Thursday or Friday before Christ mas to the 8th of January, to allow the members the enjoymeat at borne of their Christmas and New Year holidays, so that it will be nearly a month yet before we can expect either House to go regularly to work; and then, from (be increasing excitements of the Presidential agitation, we fear that bun combe Resolutions, amendments and speeches, will prevail to the end of the session. We were ioformed last week that Wednes day evening, the 13th instant, was appointed for a conference and a confidential oyster sup per, on the half shell, at Washington, between the anti-Grant republicans, George Wilkes in the chair, and the bewildered democrats, on the project of a joint stock coalition tor the defeat of General Grant. So general, how ever, has been the outcry from the untei rifled democrats of (he country against this passive or possum policy, this policy of pretending to be dead when the party is still alive and kick ing, Mils policy of reversing the old fable by disguising the democratic lion in the skiu of a republican donkey?so great, we ear, is the democratic outcry againa! this jackass policy, that, as it appears, this joint stook con ference has been indefinitely postponed. We apprehend, then, that, without auy under standing with Mr. Wilkes, the democratic mem bers of the two houses will go home to spend their Christmas holidays, and that in retnrnlng to Washington they will hold a caucus of their own, and, hit or miss, that this caucus will adopt tho old policy of another Presidential fight by the democratic party. We think it probable that, with the return of Congress* to business, if not before, there will be such n democratic Congressional cau cus, and that the upshot will be ap address to the country wad a call, through Mr. Belmont and his National Committee, of a national democratic convention, for the purpose of cutting out a new party programme, according to the recommcndatton of Mr. Voorhees, of Indiana, in tnis event, unless something should "(urn up" on the impeachment; scheme, the anti-Grant republicans may get up a little party of their own, and by a fusion with the labor reformers, the temperance party and the women's rights party, and with Mr. Gree ley for President and Wendell Phillips- or General Butler for Vice President, they may give us a rery exciting and a very amusing Presidential contest. Suob, we think, with the different parties and factions, is the drift of the wind among politicians at Washington? General G>rant for the administration party, a democratic ticket on a new programme for the democratic party, and a fusion tic&et for the anti-Grant republicans and all the outside factions and reformers of the day. ,Coa?rewi YeMerdsr?The Adntabtritloi Assailed and Defended?The Assertion Bill. fti the Senate yesterday the oonfliot between i the (assailants and cbaiwpions of. the adminis tration, which had' opened with spch rigor on Wednesday, was renewed, and the Senate Chamber was the scene of an acrimonious qnarred, in which quarter was neither-asked nor giwen. The attacking party consisted of Trnmbull, of Illinois ; Scburz, of Missouri, l and Tipton,,of Nebraska, while thii defence ? was carried *a by Morton, of Indiana;; Sher man, of Ohio; Nye, of Nevada, and Conk .ling, of Ne w York. Senator Wilson^ of Massa chusetts, ioccupied< a neutral position * but, while shie lding the administration! from the 'hard blows aimed at It,, be gawe to/its friends and champions sonnd and sonsitile advice. He warned them that they werq damaging their cause in this eyes of the people in attempting to pre vent ^the fullest investij ation asked for, and told them that it was- va ry important for them to appear right as well s s to be right. He therefore sustained and vs .ted for Senator Trumbull's proposition looisi ng to a thorough investigation of all the ?bi irges to be made against government officii Is. The debate lasted the wbcie day, but the question was still undecided when the Sf mate adjourned. The repeal of the duij /? on coal and salt, under the two bills whiehi. the House passed at last session, was the suhf ject of an interroga tory put to Senator Sheas ian, chairman of the Finance Committee? as ? j when the committee woald make its report. Mr. Sherman informed the Senate that the cm* mmittee was prepared to report the bills, wrf.tb amendments which would cover the-who! e subjoct of the tariff. He thought it best, frowever, to wait until the House should againJ.ake action in the matter. Senator Trumbull^ Nivho put (be interrogatory,. did not appear tvat'iafied with the answer, and gave notice tbajc he "would to-day move to dis charge the Fityance Committee from thejfurther consider ation ^of thq bills repealing the duty on coal &Dd*B&lt, arid ask.the Senate? to take i them up tor'action. The question 'of the- Eight Hour law also oame up Incidentally yesterday in the .Senate, in the shape of/a bill authorizing back pay to laborers, and meohanics in the government employment during. % period when their pay was tat down is proportion to the time they actually worked. The whole principle of the Eight Hour law,, and of legislative interference between the employer and employed, received 'a well-merited condemnation at the hands of Senator Morrill,'of Vermont; Senator Trum bull, of Illinois, and Senator Ferry, of Con necticut. This afforded an indication of the reception which Mr. Hoar's International Sooiety bill will meet in the Senate if it ever passes the House, as it probably will. The House spent the whole of the day yes terday In discussing and voting on amend ments to the bill to apportion members of Con gress for the next decade, in accordance with the changes of population as shown by the ninth census. The bill as passed fixes the whole number of Representatives at two hundred and eighty-three?an Increase of forty over the present nurnb?? The State of New York only gets one number additional, so that it will javo thirty-two Representatives in the tiext Congress. Pennsylvania gains two 'members, Massachusetts one, Yirginia one, Illinois five, Indiana one, Ohio one, Wisconsin two, Missouri four and Michigan three. It will thus be seen that the additional members are distributed for the most part among the Western States, and that the Middle and East ern States barely bold their own. In fact, were It not for the increased number of Repre sentatives which the bill provides, and which increase is of very questionable propriety, many of the older States would be obliged to submit to a diminution in the number of their Representatives. We do not see, however, that there is anything gained by letting these States keep their representation when the relative preponderance Is given all the same to the new States. Even the present organi zation of the House is cumbrous, and it would be much better to lop off forty members than add to the number. A Testimonial to Baron Gerolt?The American friends of this amiable and re spected diplomat, who for so many years ably represented the Fatherland at Washing ton, have just subscribed for an elegant epergne of solid sterling silver, described elsewhere, which they intend to present to him as a testimony of their esteem of his high personal character and as an evidence of the appreciation of his genuine and generous qualities. The old Baron, despite the intense pleasure of boar hunting over his broad lands in Germany, will doubtless spare timo to return many thanks for this high mirk of value net upon bis character by the people of the United Stales. The Prince of Wale*. The greater portion of our cable news IVom London this morning encourages the thought that the gleam of hope of yesterday has bright ened into something lika?iinshine. The Prince is, no doubt, still in danger; but hope and confi dence hare taken the place of fear, to some extent, in the minds of the British people. The bulletins are more reassuring, and the general tone of publio feeling was more qaiet. The Prinoe maintained his struggle against exhaustion manfully during the day. It appeared, indeed, as if the more grave symptoms of the malady had abated very materially, if not permanently, ia the period from early morning to a late boar of the night yesterday. The case was not so hopeful this morning.. The physieiaof^n attendance at Sandringham issued a bulletin* dated at the Prinoe's resi dence, at one o'clock. This was published in London at two o'clock A. M. to-day. The doctors state, tas will bs seen by our cabte telegram, thai the patient waB "very unquiet from tene'oioek"Thursday night." This does not look woll. It denotes the presence of hectic, euperiodfticed by the prostration of typhoid fever, and tbue probability of its return, perhaps to-night, '.at the very moment when rest is most needed. In the recurrence of these assaults we thlufc we can perceive the main point of ^danger just now. The interest taken in the Prince of Wales since hie life began to be' despaired of has been a universal surprise. Should the Prinee recover, he will, uo doubt,. be of all men the most surprised when he learns that the proba bility of his death oreated so-much alarm and called forth so much sympathy. For some years past be bae been the best abused man of bis time. It is not unfair to say that ho has been accustomed for , some time to regard himself as the butt of ptublic abuse. Worse than has been spoken and written of the Priam of Wales oouid hardly be spoken or written of any man. .His Illness,' however, has filed the worift with alarm, baa inspired the British people with fear, and has called forth a genuine sympathy, the ranger of which baa been wide as the limits of civiliza^n. The press of the United States has been quite ; as kindly as, and almost more gentle than, the 'press cf Great Britain. After all, howevea, this sudden and com plete change in the tone of publio sentiment is 'not so much to be wondered at. The Prince 'is young; and, although the public mind is naturally-disposed to be faultfinding, it is at the same time instinctively generous towards the indiscretions of youth. If the Prince did not do what he ought to have done thoughtful people did not forget that he was rich, that he was idle, that he was young, and that be lived and pursued his own ways nnder the fierce torchlight of modern times. Then there was bis mother, whom not only the British people bat the entire world has learned to love and. respsct. More than that, there were the Princess of Wales and her young family. All of these were entitled to sympathy; and while it was freely given to them the maximum of benefit went to the Prince. ? The chances now are, to some extent, in favor of the Prince's recovery. Should he re cover it will be his privilege to learn how muoh the British people love him and what value the world sets upon his life. If be abuses opportunities afresh afforded him, or if he fails to turn them to good account, he will lose what he will never be able to regain. A splendid field is before him. It will be bis own fault if his future career is a failure. The public mind is generous, but it is also just and very exacting. The Meeting of the French Bourbon* In Switzerland. The partisans of Henry V., so styled, have, during the last few weeks, been more than usually active. Secret meetings, and mysteri ous movements have arrested the attention of the newspaper correspondents as well as afforded opportunities for gossipers to float their rumors on the political atmosphere,. The meeting at Lucerne, at which the believers in the restoration of the monarchy rallied in strong force recently to meet the Count de Chambord, is not without a certain signifi cance. A Herald correspondent, writing from Lucerne in relation to this assemblage, says that upwards of two hundred members of the National Assembly were In attendance there, and returned to Franoe more strongly impressed than ever in the interest of the Count de Chambord. The most prominent leader in the movement was Count Benoit d'Assy, a man of tnuch energy and skill, and who played a prominent part during the first days of the National Assembly In Bordeaux. It is estimated that upwards of two thousand visitors thronged the hotels of Lucerne, and some of the best families of France were represented. Merchants, lawyers and farmers, too, were there, and even some of those who held office under the empire were on hand to express their admiration of monarohical institutions. Notwithstanding this imposing show of strength and the temporizing conduct of Thiers, whose policy is regarded by these monarchists as worse than no policy, the chances of the re storation of the monarchy are exceedingly doubtful. These chances are also lessened by the dissensions existing between (he two branches of tlie liouse of llourbon. Though it has time and time again been announced that the fusion of the Orleanists and Bourbons has been arrived at, we fail to perceive it. Harmony is unknown to such an extent that the monarchists may move amicably and vigorously toward the accomplishment of their ends; and while this state of affairs con tinues to exist in that direction, and with the dlssatisfaotion freely expressed among the French people toward M. Thiers' republic, a movement on the part of the imperialists would not be a surprise to any person who has watched with ordinary attention the course of recent events in France. Tnz Frbnou Legislative Committer on the subject of capitulations to the Prussians during the war have reported unfavorably of the conduct of the officers in command of six fortresses of secondary importance. Thp com mandants have been sentenced to punishment. The committee will proceed to inquire into the cases of the capitulations at Sedan and Motz? very unpleasant subjects and of little benefit In any point of view except to persons who delight to be classed as the "prophets of the u*?L" The International and the Police?The la? Judicious Order of the CeeiailMloaers Revoked. The Commissioners of Police yesterday re voked their injudicious order directing the Superintendent to use all the power of the force to prevent the proposed Sunday demon stration of the International societies, and in structed that officer instead to adopt such measures as may be necessary to preserve the public peace on the occasion. Some discus sion took place before this action was decided upon. Commissioner Bosworth maintained tbe right of the Board to enforce the Sunday laws, which he regards as prohibiting such demonstrations on tbe Sabbath, but ex pressed the opinion that it would be unde sirable to do so at this time at the risk of riot and bloodshed. He declared that the societies would, in his belief, have been satisfied to give up the proposed Sunday parade and to have held their demonstration on another day of tho week but lor the posi tion taken by the "secular press," which had condemned the order of the Commissioners as a violation of the rights of citizens and bad advised the Internationals to meet on Sunday In deQancv of the police. Mayor Hail, who was present, dissented from the opinion that a memorial ftineral procession was prohibited by the Sunday laws, and was of opinion that those laws were not applicable to the city' of New York. Be also advocated an appeal to* tho State Legislature for ao act regulating processions in this city and presented the' draft of a bill for that purpose. 17m statement of Commissioner Boswortb, that the secular press had urged the Inter national societies to defy the police and dis regardl the order of the Board is incorrect, so far as the Hbbald Le? concerned. While we condemned the stupid and injudicious action of the Commissioners as it deserved to be con demned, we advised the Internationals to avoid any oonfllct with the authorities; and to hold their demonstration on some other day than Sunday. Nevertheless, we regarded the police order as a violation of the rights of the citizens and. as an unjust discrimination against the International societies. Other funeral demonstrations, with processions, music and banners, have been constantly held in this oity on Sundays, without any interfer ence on the part of the police, and we believe that the Intermeddling of the Board in this particular case was instigated by prejudice against the International and its objects, and not byvany peculiar regard for the sacredness of the Sabbath. That we were correct in our judgment of the injustice and injudiciousaess of the order is shown now by the action of the Commissioners in backing out of the posi tion they had too hastily assumed; for we cannot suppose that the terrors of the Inter national or of the "secular press" would have driven them from a clear line of duty. We prefer to believe that the tardy reversal of their action was the oonsequence of a convic tion that the ground they had taken was untenable, and we only regret that they wero not more prompt and candid in acknowledging, their error. The result is a gratifying triumph for the Internationals, who have evinced good tem per and sound judgment during the progress of the controversy. It remains tor them to be as modest in victory as they have been patient during the struggle for their rights, They are now more' imperatively bound than ever to see that their demonstration is a peaceable, sober and orderly one, and that no act is suf fered that can offend public decency. Thoy may make their proce ssion as imposing as they please, but they must take care that they respect in their arrange ments. the convenience of their fellow citi zens who do not belong to their order. Tbey will r no doubt have a large body of men to handle, and tbey should, see that system and regularity are observed in the muster and parade. It is to be hoped that every man in the procession will abstain from intoxicating drinks, and, above all, that they will avoid any ohanoe of collision with outsiders or with the police. After the crusade that has been made against them their conduct will be jealously scrutinized on this their first great public demonstration, and they owe it to the cause they represent to do no act that can bring reproach upon their association. We congratulate them upon the reversal of the un just and arbitrary police order, and we call upon them to show by their peaceable and orderly behavior that no necessity for the in terference of the force with their proposed parade ever existed. Let them next Sunday do honor to the dead Communists and credit to the living Internationalists at the same time. Tub Danobr to the republican party of a split which cannot be healed is thickening in the Senate from day to day. Let it come, and let us see what is the strength and what is the game of the anti-Grant republicans. The time is at hand for action. Tub Woman Suffragists are in a state of great consternation. While the Wyoming Repeal bill has been bandied from the Legisla ture to the Executive of the State, vetoed by the Governor and then passed by the Houso over the veto, thus putting the petticoated preachers there in a grand ferment, the branch in New York is by no means settled on a peace basis. Julia Ward Howe ventilated a perfect boat of grievances at Ghickering Ilall last -night, among them the disappointment felt at not receiving invitations for herself and friends to the late bftil at the Academy in honor of the Prince Alexis. These, with the difficulties in the ranks recently developed at Washington and the troubles horoscoped for the movement during the present session of Congress, leave the followers of Stanton in a singular condition. Tub Atlanta (Ga.) Neu> Era (republican), Is pretty nearly corract when it avows that "Outside the Southern Slates the democratic party seems to be without a platform of prin ciples, without a settled policy, and almost without organization. Thus ceasing to be a national parly, it has degenerated into a sec tional faction; and it hopes for recognition and power only as an adjunct to some new or ganiz ition yet to be formed." The South be ing the only section of the country where the democratic party has the least vitality, Is it not about time some Southern man was spo ken of by the old leaders for the democratic nomination for the Presidency?aay Senator Stevenson, of Kentnoky?a sound Uolou man lit time of oeril and dancer ? Hw?. Ub.t Bill la Oown?-Tto Wed*? of Another Tremendous ReT*lutlofliv v Within the last ten years, on the questions of African slavery and the civil and political status of the African race in this country, we have passed through one S4 the moat stupen dous and decisive revolutions' the history of mankind, and now we are on the verge of another. The revolution accomplished turned upon the wrongs of slavery and the rights of the black race; the revolution upon which are about to enter will be fought upon the wrongs of the laboring classes and the rights of labor. By the. revolution we have left be hind us, the old social and political institutions of our Southern States of two hundred years of cultivation have been torn up by the roots. By the revolution which is just before as, the, social and politioal institutions of the civilised world, some of them older .than the Pyramids, | will be swept way. We say (bat we are on the verge of tbie mighty revolution; for in the Labor bill of Mr. Hoar, of Massachusetts, introduced in the national House of Representatives, we have the entering wedge of this sweeping revolu tion. This bill, reported on Wedaflpday last to the* House, from the Committee on Educa tion and Labor, provides for the appointment by the President, with the advice4 and ^son sent of the Senate, of a commission of three persons, to hold office for two yeetra,' unless their duties shall have been soooec accomplished, who are to investigate the* subM jectof the wages and hoars of labor and-the*!, division of the joint profits of labor and capi tal between the laborer and the capitalist,. and the social,' educational and sanitary con dition of the laboring classes of the United States, and show how the* same are affeoted! by existing lawsTegulating commerce, finance and eurrency. The commissioners are to re ceive'a salary of fire thousand dollars each, and itey employ a clerk, and they shall re port the result of their investigations to the President, to be by him transmitted to Con gress. The significant faot in connection with this bill is that it really comes < from the International, and is offered as a bid from tho party in power to the International' and its co-operating labor societies for their support in the approaching Presidential election. It is the beginning, it is the entering wedge, it is a bold move,, and it looks like a new departure for the republican party. In introducing this bill Mr. Hoar admitted his obligations to the International and had a good word for the Paris Commune. This, from a Massachusetts Puritan, unquestionably means business.. The democrats in the House were caught napping ; but, on a motion by one of them to lay the bill on the table, they wore speedily rous9d from their slumbers, and then they begaa their efforts to appease the angry lion that stood before them in the name of the rights of labor. This is a beginning, and it may be con sidered in the light of a republican compro mise with the International to tide over the Presidential election. But it admits the In ternational into Congress as a political power la the land, and the agitation will go on and gather strength as it goes. What is the trouble with the laboring classes of tho United States? Tbey complain that through banking monopolies, railway monopolies, man ufacturing nfonopolies, and monopolies and combinations of oapital in every shape and form, under our existing laws, capital is bo coming stronger and the laborer weaker?the rich are becoming richer and tho poor poorer from year to year; and the International pro poses to cut out these evils?as slavery was cut out?by tho roots, beginning with the in vestigation proposed by Mr. Hoar. But what can these agitators do against the combined capitalists of the country?- What has been done within the last ten years bf the anti-slavery agitators against slavery and King Cottony representing in all its ramifica tions in American politico a substantial capi tal equal.to five thousand millions of money? Why, the laboring masses of this, oountry, with a few years' political training, in a single Presidential eloction, with the Congres I sional and State elections of the same year, [ may effect a revolution that will astonish themselves. But once fairly uader way, where will they stop? The republicans may hold back the labor movement for this Presi dential election; but what will be the electioo of 1876? Who can tell?
