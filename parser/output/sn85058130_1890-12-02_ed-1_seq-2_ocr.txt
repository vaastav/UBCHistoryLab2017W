GULF PORTS The South Atlantic and gulf ports occu py a very favored position towards the new and important commerce which the re ciprocity clause of the tariff act and the postal shipping bill are designed t pro mote Steamship lines from these ports to some northern port of South America will almost certainly effect a connection between the railroad systems of the continent long before any continental line of railroad can be in operation Thevery large put very lrge appro priation made at the last session for the harbor of Galveston was justified as it seemed to be by these considerations The great northwest will feul the advantage of trunk lines to the south as well as to the east and of the new market opened for the supply of food products and for many of the r manufactured products INTERNATIONAL AMERICAN BANE I bad occasion in my last message to transmit t Congress a report adopted by the International American conference upon the subject of the incorporation of an international American bank with a view 0 facilitating money exchanges between the states represented in that conference Such an institution would greatly promote the trade we are seeking to develop I re new the recommendation that a careful and well guarded charter be granted I do not think the powers granted should include those ordinarily exercised by trust guar antee and safe deposit companies or that more branches in the United States should be authorized than are strictly necessary to accomplish the object primarily in view namely convenient foreign exchanges It is quite important that prompt action should be taken in this matter in order that any appropriations fur better communication tion with those countries and any agree mEnt that may be made for regiprocal trade may not be hindered for the convenience of making exchanges through European money centers or burdened by the tribute which is an incident of that method of busi ness RELIEF Or TiE SUPREME COURT The bill for the relief of the supreme court has after man Jears discussion reached a position when final action is eas ily attainable and it is hoped that any dif ferences of opinion may be so harmonized as to save the essential features of this very important measure In this connec tion I earnestly renew my recommendation that the salaries of judges of the United States district courts be so readjusted that none of them shall receive less than 5000 per annum tNADJCSTED SPANISH LVND GRANTS The subject of unadjusted Spanish and Mexican land grants and the urgent neces sity for providing some commission or tribunal tr bunal for the treatment of questions grow ing out thereofwas twice brought by me to tbo attention of Congress at the last ses sion Bills have been reported from the proper committees and beta houses on the subject and I very earnestly hope that this Congress will put an end to the delay which lias attached to the settlements of disputes as to the well being of matters and claims under these grants These disputes retard prosperity and disturb the peace of large and important communities The governor of New Mexico in his last report to the secretary of the interior sug gests some modifications of the provision of the pending bills relatine to small hold ings of faim lands I commend to your attention the suggestion of the secretary of the interior upon this subject NATIONAL 1SANKRUPT LAW The enactment of a national bankrupt law I still regard as very desirable The constitution having given t Congress jurisdiction of this subject it ought to be excrcised and uniform rule3 provided for the administration of the affairs of in solvent debtors The inconvenience result ing from the occasional and temporal ex ercise of this power by Congress and from the conflicting state codes on insolvency which come into force intermediately should be removed by the enactment of a simple inexpensive permanent national bankrupt law I also renew my recom mendation for legislation affording just copyright protection for foreign authors on a footing of reciprocal advantage for authors abroad OrrLERS AND RAKES ON FREIGHT TRAINS I I may still be possible for this Congress to Inaugurate by suitable legislation a movement looking to uniformity and in creased stability in the use of couplers and brakes upon freight trains engaged in interstate commerce The chief difficulty in the way is to secure an agreement as to the best appliances simplicity of effective ness and cost bein considered This diffi culty will only yield to legislation which should be based upon full inquiry and im partial tests The purpose should be to se cure the cooperation of all welldisposed managers and owners but the fearful fact that every years delay involves the sacri fice of 20000 lives and the maiming of 20000 young men should plead both with Congress and managers against any need less delay IRRIGATION OF ARID LANDS The subject 61 the conservation and equal distribution of tho water supply in the arid region has had much attention from Con gress but has not as yet been put upon a permanent and satisfactory basis The ur gency of the subject does not grow out of any large present demand for the use of tho lands for agriculture but out of the danger that the water supply and tho sits for the necessary catch basins may fall into tho bands of individuals private corporations and used to render subservient large areas dependent on such supply The owner of the water is the owner of the lands how ever the titles may run All unappropri ated water sources and all necessary reser voirs should be held by the govern ment for the equal use at fair rates of tne homestead settlers r who will eventually take up the these lands The United States should not in my opinion undertake the construction of dams and canals but shouldlimit all work to such Ttirvpy nnrt ob > rrnHnn vil < tcrmine the water supply both surface add subterranean the areas capable of ir rigation and the use of tbo storage capacity of reservoirs This done the use of the water and of the reservoir sites might be granted to the respective states or terri tories or to individuals or associations upon the condition that the necessary works should be constructed and the water furnished at fair rates without discrimina tion enacted by the legislatures or by boards of water commissioners duly con stituted The essential thing to be secured is the common and equal use at fair rates of the accumulated water supply I were almost better that these lands should remain arid than that those who occupy thorn should become the slaves of unre strained monopolies controlling the essen tial element of land values and crop results 

POSTAL TELEGRAPH The use of tho telegraph by the postoffice department fr the trans as a means rapid trns mission of written communications is I be lieve upon proper terms quite desirable Tno government does not own or operate the railroads and it should not I think own or operate the telegraph lines It does however seem to be quite practicable for the government to contract with the tele graph as itdoes with the railroads to carry at specified rates such communications as the sender may designate For this method of transmission I recommend that such leg islation be enacted as will enable the nost office department fairly to test by experi ment the advantages of such a use of the telegraph FEDERAL ELECTION LAWS I any intelligent and loyal company of American citizens were required to cata logue the essential liumsn conditions of na tional life 1 do not doubt that with abso lute unamity those would begin with free and honest elections and it is gratifying to know that generally there is a growing and nonpartisan demand for better election laws but against this sign of hoped progress must bo sot the depress ing and undeniable fact that election laws fact I and methods are sometimes cunningly con trived to insure the minoritys control while violence completes the shortcomings of fraud In mi last annual message I suggested that tho amendment of the ex isting law providing a federal supervision of Congressional elections offered an ef fective method of reforming these abuses The need of such a law has manifested itself in many parts of the coun try and its wholesome restraints and pen alties will be useful in all Tho constitu tionality of such legislation has been af firmed by the supreme court Its probable effectiveness is evidenced by the cnaracter ot the opposition that is mado to i I has been denounced as i i were a new exor cise of federal power and an invasion of the rights of the states Nothing could be further from the truth Congress has al ready fixed the time for the election of members of Congress It has declared that tue vote for members ot Congress must be by written or printed ballot It has pro vided for the appointment by tho circuit courts in certain cases and upon the petition of a a certain number of citizens of election I supervisors and made it their duty to su pervise the registration of voters con ducted by the state officers to challenge persons offering to register to personally inspect and scrutinize the registry lists and to affix their names to the lists for the purpose of identification and the identi ction thf preven tion of frauds to attend at elections and remain with the boxes until the votes are all cast and counted to attach to the regis try lists and election returns any state ment touching the aecurasv and fairness of of the registry and elections to take and transmit to the clerk of tho House of Reprefentatives and evidence of fraud ulent practices which may be presented to The same law provides for appointment of deputy United States marshals to attend at the polls support the supervisors in the discharge of their duties and to arrest disclarge thCr dutes per sons violating the election laws The pro visions of this familiar title of the revised statues have been put into exercise by both of the great political parties and in the north as well as in the south by the filing with the court of the petitions required by law I is not therefore a question whether we should have a federal election law for we now have one and have had one for nearly twenty years but whether we shall have an effective Jaw The present law stops just short of effectiveness for it surrenders to the local authorities all con trol over the certification which establishes the Prima facie right to a seat in the House of Representatives This defect should be cured Equality of representation and the parity of tne electors must be maintained or everything that is valuable in our sys tem of government is lost The qualifica tions of an elector must be sougnt in the law not in the opinions prejudice or fears of any class however powerful The path of the elector to the ballot box must be free from the ambush of fear and the en ticement of fraud the count so true and open that none shall gainsay it Such a law should be absolutely nonpartisan and impartial It should give the advantage to honesty and the control jx majorities Surely there is nothing sectional about this creed and if it shall happen that the pen alties of laws intended to enforce these rights fall hero und not there it is not I because the law is sectional but because happily crime is local and not universal Nor should it be forgotten that every law whether relating to elec tions or t any other sublect whether en acted by the state or by the nation has force behind it the courts the marshal or constable the posse comitatus the orison are all and always behind the law One cannot bo justly charged with unfriendli ness to any section or class who beeks only to restrain violations of law and of personal right No community will find lawlessnets profitable no community can afford to nave it known that the officers who are charged with the preservation of the public peace and the restraint of the criminal classes are themselves the product of fraud or violence The magistrate is then with out respect and the law without sanction sancton The floods of lawlessness can bo levied and made t run in one channel The killing of a United States marshal carrying a writ of arrest for an election offonsa is full of promptings and offense to men who are pursued by a city marshal for a crime against life or property Butit is said that this legislation will revive animosities and I some have even suggested that when the peaceful methods of fraud are made impossible they may be supplanted by intimidation and violence I the proposed law gives any qualified elector more than his equal influ ence or detracts by so much from any ther qualified elector it is fatally impeached but i the law is equal and animosities it is to evoke grow out of the fact that some electors have been accustomed to exercise the franchise for others us well as for themselves then the animosities ought not to be confessed without shame and cannot bo given any weight in the discussion with out dishonor No choice is loft to mo but to enforce with vigor all laws intended to secure t the citizen his constitutional rights and t recommend that the inade quateness of such laws be promptly reme died I to promote with zeal and ready in terest every project for the development of its material interests its rivers harbors mines and factories and the intelligence peace and security under tho law of its communities and its homes is not accepted as sufficient evidence of friendliness to any state or section 1 cannot connivance at election practices that not only disturb the local results but rob tho electors of other states and sections of thoir most priceless political rights 

GENERAL APPROPRIATION HILLS The preparation of the general appro priation bills should be conducted with the greatest care and closest scrutiny of ex penditure Appropriations should be adequate to the needs of the public service but they should be absolutely free from prodigality I venture again t remind you that the brief time remaining for the consideration of the important legislation now awaiting your attention offers no margin for waste I tho present duty is discharged with diligence fidelity and courage the work of the Fiftyfirst Congress may be confidently dently submitted to the considerate judg ment of the people Signed

Irish members of the commons to consider what action the Nationalist party shall take in regard t the leadership took place at noon Parnell wes the first to arrive and took the chair and called the meeting to order Tele grams from the delegates in the United States and from Archbishop Croke were read An adjournment was then taken for luncheon Prior to the meeting Parnel hold c conference with his supporters Joseph D Noland Kenny John Redmond Edward Harrington Power Shiol and OKelly wore present at tho conference Parnell on leaving the room said to an Irish reporter Tell them I will fight to the end Parnell looked pale but chatted cheerfully with his friends He took no part in the proceedings beyond stating the meeting had been called in accordance with the decision reached by the party Friday last The meeting reconvened at 130 feoventyfive Irish members of tho house ocmg present A great oundiooi telegrams was handed in by a reporter representing I the Frayiittiis Journal of Dublin The only outsider admitted was Michael Davitt who has decided not to contest any constituency for a seat in tho house of commons The proceedings were of the stormiest order Purnells supporters strove hard to secure another adjournment urging a meeting to decide tho question of the leadership the Irish party should bo held in Dublin Sexton hotly protested against adjournment A majority of the party ho declared desired to keep tho leadership unstained Sextons remarks wero fre quently interrupted by tremendous cheer ing from Parnells opponents who com prised a majority of those present Redmond made a passionate appeal t tho members to pause before they deposed from his rightful position the leader of the Irish nation who by unparalleled services had earned the gratitude of the Irish people He declared that those who by their voice or vote induced the sacrifice of a man who had sacrificed so much for Ireland would have to account to the Irish people The facts of the divorce case were fully known when Par nell was reelected leader of the Irish This assertion was greeted with cries of No No Gladstones letter was with held Redmond unmoved by the inter ruption went on to say that notwithstand ing their previous action taken with full knowledge of Parnells position a section of the party at the bidding of the Liberals now want to sacrifice their leader and with him the national cause Irishmen tho world over would ask where was the con sistency of such a course After Redmond had finished Parnell ad deessed the meeting saying substance The time has come when I must speak out against the opposition within our party which has been created by Gladstones let ter The men whose ability has been most conspicuously exercised against me Healy and Sexton will have to bear tho responsibility Hoaly has been trained in this warfare Who trained him 1 Who telegraphed to him in America to come back Who gave him his first chance to enter public life and got him a seat in parliament prompting rebuilding and restraining him That Healy is here today to destroy me is due to myself Mr Healy reminds mo of his services Ho hasnt been slow to remind me of them at any time 1 understand he attended the recent meeting in Dublin call ing on me to retire Who asked him to do sof Who asked McCarthy to travel to Dublin and say he would be able to give information which would throw a different complexion on hidden events I Where was Sexton at this same meeting Where wore you all Why did you encourage me to maintain the leadership in the face of the world i you were not going to stand by me Why did my officers encourage me to take my position on tho bridge if they were going to act as traitors and hand me over to another commanderinchief l I did not i ask them for the certificate ot character I given at the Dublin meeting Our posItion is backward but the whole blame or the creation of this position does not rest with me A leaderkiller Barry has been putup to stan me as ho stabbed that old Lion Isaac but in days gone by What is now to bo said about the request for my temporary retirement Sexton at the recent meet ings here told me that I could resume the leadership and that the leaders were with me Tenminutes afterward I e astonished me by saying he believed I would reject the leadership Referring to the Howarlen propostli Paruell said Gladstone told him none ot them were final For mesaid Parnell it was a question of drafting a bill It was a question of weak judgment on the part of an English politician it was ques tion of dealing with a garrulous old gentle man who inouopoliol the conversation and with whom as everybody who know him knows it is difficult to get in a word ed ewuys Before you vote for my dispo sition be sure you are getting the value for it On Saturday we were all areed wo would not have this Gladstone bill Not a man here has a word in favor of it Are you sure you will be able to get anything batter I Healy or McCarty or Sexton sees a way clear to get anything better for Gods sake let them say it I wont stand in their way On Saturday 1 made this proposition to McCarthy Let Glad stone Harcourt and Morley give him let ters that in the event of the return of the Liberals to power home rule will be pro posed by which the control of the constab ulary will be vested in tho Irish executive who will be responsible to an Irish parliament empowered to settle the land question McCarthy went to Mr Gladstone with these proposals with my assurance that these concessions made I would retire from public life Gladstone has replied will hold no com munication with me as leader of the party McCarthy Interrupting No no Parnell He is perfectly welcome The same propositions were placed before Har court who replied that under no circum stances will he give any promise whatever now or hereafter to any Irish party Ro membe Harcourt will be your leader when Gladstone dies Condon Not our leader Parnell It will not be Morley You will not deny that this great man Harcourt whose chains you arc going to put on your necks has the reversion of the Liberal leadership This same man has declared that his limits to home rule aro in Cham berlains scheme of local government I Harcourt over comes into power he will give you local government with plenty of coercion I know what Harcourt will do and what Gladstone and Morley will do I I am t leave you tonight I should like to have some security I is not an unfair thing for mo to ask to see you within sight of the promised land or that I should come with you having come so far until you are absolutely sure of Ireland and I can co no I further An enthusiastic outburst of I cheering followed Parnolls remarks i McCarthy followed He told how he went to Gladstone Saturday and that Gladstone told him he regretted the disorganization of the Irish party but that he could not re gard him as representing that party and therefore could not treat with him He would offer no suggestion nor would ho sign any document or give any message to be conveyed to the party Ho informed McCarthy he could not give any document with any certainty that it might not be printed by some of those concerned I Harcourt told him in view of the manifesto ho would not give anybody assurances I which were to bo brought to tho notice of Parnell As to the general question of Parnolls I retiring McCarthy said Parnells leading error had been his keeping private until r t o u 0 Parnell am perfectly willing to admit the blame but I am glad that I have told now before the full mischief has been done The motion for the retirement was made by John Barry who aided the late Isaac Butt in founding the home rule chfedera tion of Great Britian in 1872 Joseph Nolan moved an amendment to the effect that the question of retire ment should be postponed until tho mem bers personally ascertained the views of their constituents the party then to meet in Dublin and decide Parnell ruled out of order any reference to his conduct in the OShea case and this brought him into frequent collision with different speakers especially Healy with whom Parnell exchanged hot words He I displayed great passion throughout Finally after many short speeches Par nell putting the question to adjourn de clared the ayes had it without asking for the nays Healy protested but Parnell declared the motion carried Healy then moved that McCarthy take the chair amid great cheering Parnell said he had not left the chair yet Then put the question said Healy Parnell Im not going to have my ruling challenged by Healy After a few remarks Parnoll again put the question when the majority seemed favor of continuing the debate and Parnell declared it must pro ceed Several members declared it would be a physical and mental impossibility to continue and Healy consented to adjourn on the understanding that the meeting should terminate tomorrow Dont have any understanding with him said Parnell whereupon Healy re torted It is very hard to have an under standing with Parnell Finally Sexton acted as mediator and secured an adjournment Dublin in Favor of Parnell
