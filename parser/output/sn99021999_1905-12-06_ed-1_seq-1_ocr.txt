LaFollotte appeared today before Hi joint body of the Wisconsin legislature cV.ied In extraordinary session and per sonally read his message. He wM cordially received. A large crowd gathered, including a num- , li'.-r of students of the university end many j Mauison men ana women, as wen imm.j ull of the lUlt officials and employes. Gov ernor LaFollette read tils message from a Kintod copy. The governor's message Is a lengthy docu ment and contains over forty mei of closely printed mutter. ' Four recommendations are marie In the message regarding the revision of the rail road rate commission law. In the first ha recommends, that the commission be au thorized to prescribe a uniform system of keeping accounts of the business , trans acted In Wisconsin, by the railroads and that all roads should be required to fllo with the commission from time .to time reports of their Income. 1 He wants sep arata accounts kept of the business done by the railroads in this state and in other states, as well as an account showing the value of each railroad In the- state. The second recommendation provides that the law be so amended that special mileage tickets, commutation tickets, excursion tickets and party ticket! can be issued at less than the regular rates' for National Guard and Grand Army of the Republic encampments, students, Iiomeseekers, etc. This . third recommendation provides for additional power by the commission to In vestigate rates. . Ills fourth recommenda tion would give; tjie commission the right to decide what safeguards shall be erected at any railroad crossing in this state. Regarding railroad tanses, the governor says that tl.144.399.li in railroad taxes .are now due the state, the payment of which has been held UP by litigation. He says that the holding up of Just taxes by the railroads is a serious embarrassment to the ttate, and had thhe , taxes been paid the state tax levy would not have been neces sary. He recommends .that legislation be enacted .at once which In the future will -win pel . tho. iii Qturit-.wa.aaiK ot an railroad taxes, leaving the railroad the right to recover such taxes if - it shall be found that they were unjust or wrongully col lected. What the governor wants Is, first . the payment of railroad taxes and litiga tion afterward. If necesatry. Instead of litigation first and- payment last, as he holds is now the case. Prlsaavr Election Uw, The governor pays considerable attention to the primary election law and points out thut the strongest point that can be made by the opposition to Its enactment la the fact that a Candidas may be nominated under, the present law by less than a ma jority vote. He suggests that provision e made, by amending the law, so as to en able the voter at the primary to Indicate upon the ballot his first and second choice of the candidate presented for each office. In the event that no candidate had re ceived a majority of the first choice votes, then the second choice votes could , be counted, resulting In a nomination by ma jority vote. The plan recommended is that used In Australia and provides that If, after the ballots have been counted, no candi date has an absolute majority of the first choice votes, then the ballots cast for the candidate receiving the least nutrjber of votes on the list ara assorted with refer ence to second choices as to the remaining candidates. If no one then receives a majority of first and second choloe bal lots, a similar assortment of ballots of the lowest remaining candidate Is made on the ' bad of second choice and added to the votes, for their candidates, and so on until some candidate baa a majority of first and second choices. With this amendment the governor thinks ths primary law would be much stronger. Corporations ana lasaraace. The Investigation of publtu 'corporations snd Insurance companies Is one of the most Important features of ths messaee. He tskes ths railroads to task for main taining what h calls expensive lobbies and for resisting the prompt payment of taxes. "The people of Wisconsin have at least as good a right to know Just what money has ten oxpended ny the railroads and other public service corporations of this state in .salaries, In lobhying. In political cam paigns and legislative entertainment," he says, "aa the people of New Tork have to know the same facta with respect to the life Insurance companies of that state. It - Is no mora a betrayal of a trust relation for the president of a Ufa Insurance com pany to pay himself a salary amounting to a plundering of policy-holders than for a railroad president to pay himself a salary in excess of the value of. the services be renders to the railroad company." He suggests that a legislative Investlga tkn which would uncover all fact with re lation to this Important subject will re quire much time and labor, but that no . money so expended would be wasted. Bv- rry fart as to the expenditures which have a bearing upon the transportation rates will be of materlnl aid to the railroad com missi mi. He thinks such an Investigation would be wholesome In Us public lesson. He discusses at length the insurance scandals of New York and la bitter In Ms denunciation of those companies which have been caught by the Investigation. He motes much of the evidence that has been unearthed and comparea by figures the Northwestern Mutual Life 'of Milwaukee with the eastern corporations. "It has yet to be Intimated." he says, ''that the North western Is guilty of any Such Irregularities as have, been found to exist la ths New York companies. ' Its Invitation, recently published, courting Investigation, would In dicate that It has nothing to conceal. The subject of Insurance legislation and ex penditurea of public service corporations oins up such a wkle field, and there Is such need for a thorough Investigation, that I recommend that a committee, with a JCoaUaued oa Second Page.)

CHANGES IN SOME DETAILS SUGGESTED Floor Teat Partly Satisfactory and a Farther Experiment Proposed ta Determine Exactly Its Ab. selate Safety. - The board of engineers appointed by the city council to inspect the Hayden Bros." building now under course of construction and to determine whether It Is safe and w(l! be safe when it Is completed filed Its report with the council Tuesday night. The report tells In detail of the Investi gation of the board and It concludes by recommending several changes In the pres ent structure. The board found" that the load upon the foundation of the columns had not been equally distributed and these should be strengthened; It condemns the use of cast Iron columns In a ten-story building; It recommends that a further test be made of another panel of the floors not tested by the engineers and suggests j the plan by which tjie tests should be maae;. tne Doara touna tne noor oeams and connections are amply strong to carry the load Intended for them to carry: the steel colun.ns were found to be designed to carry the weight to which they will be subjected; the board recommended that ample wind bracing should be provided for the entire building before stories are added above the fourth story. ( Copy Seat to Haydea Bros. The report la signed by all three members of the board. City Engineer Rosewater, O. V. P. Stout, piyfessor of civil engineer ing at the State university, and T. L. Con dron, consulting engineer, of Chicago. A copy of the report in accordance with the council resolution - was sent to Hayden Bros, and Is now under consideration by them. The report was referred to the committee on lire, water and police. After the council meeting Building In spector Wlthnell said: "I consider tho report has many good points In It, but I have nothing to say Just at this time about it or what action . I shall take in regard to the building." Details of Floor Teats. The. report states that the plans of the building call for a ten-story structure, of which four stories have been erected. The Investigation covered the structure as now completed and as It will be when t the en tire ten stories are built. The floors of the building are of a type known ar the "Rapp system," the report said, and after going Into the details of the construction It said a test was made of ono of the fin ished arches. A load of 2,000 pounds was placed on an area of 8x8 feet over the middle section of one panel. Considering this load as carried by a width of ten fevt to the arch It Is equivalent to a uniform distributed load of 240 pounds per square foot of floor surface. This, together with the dead weight of the floor, makes a total load of 840 pounds per square foot or 50 per cent greater "'than specified loads for the floors. Tlte dettoction ' under this test load was We-qurfrter at an Inch. , ." The hoard then TecernmemU that another test be made or another section . of the floor, which, under the plan, proposed for the test, should have a deflection of not to exceed three-eighths of an Inch after the oad has been In position for twenty- four hours. Should tno floors stand the tests proposed y they should be considered safe. In discussing the floors further the report says: The arches as designed may prove to be sufficiently strong to carry the specified loads it the supporting beams are firmly held In position to resist the thrusts or the arches. We. And that sufficient tie rods have not been provided and we therefore recommend, before approving these floors, that in each, end panel of the floors snd each end panel abutting upon openings in the floor there shall be provided a total net sectional area "of the rods of six and one-half mum re inches of steel. In all other panels we recommend that there Shall lie provided a totl net sectional area of tie rods of three and one-half square Inches of steel. All tie rods to be of structural steel having an ultimate tensile strength per square Inch of section within B.OfiO pounds of 60,000 pounds per square Inch, snd en elongation In eight inches of 26 per cent. . Foandatlon Conditions. v Of the foundation the board reoorted that the bearings on the soil under the foundations of the Interior columns wss 2.1 tons per square loot for the four-story building, which the board considers to be safe, but the reinforced concrete .footings under these columns are, in the opinion of the board, not strong enough to dis tribute the loads produced by tne four atory building, and should therefore be (Continued on Second Page.)
