Kikrkt Featiikiis is the name of the tailgate keeper on the Frederick turn pike, one mile below Eliicott City, Md. He has been there for 10 yenrs, every day at his post of duty except Fourth of July and Christmas in ench year. It Is asserted he has never slept in abed In all that time, but managed to catch naps sitting In a chair, rcudy to come at a moment's notice to collect his toil and let the traveler pass through. It is rather amusing to find the two republics of South Africa, with a com bined white papulation of less than 800,000, issuing proclamations annex ing sections of the British colonies and changing the names of towns in Natal and Cape Colony in honor of Iloer lead ers. The sensation is a novel one for the British empire, which Is accustomed to take the lead in the annexation busi ness, and not to have its own geogra phy disturbed in the least. A OET-nicii-vuiCK operator calling herself Mrs. Kate Bradford worked up big business in Brooklyn in 194 by offering to pay interest on deposits nt the rate of from 60 to 240 per cent a year. When (200,000 ahead of the game of paying dividends from deposits she disappeared and has never been heard from since. One man lost 803,000, but Mrs. Bradford was not above small re turns, for she absorbed all her cook's wages except 81 a week. The register of Cornell university for 1819-1900, just published, shows a gain of 302 students over the figures in the first edition of last year's register, the total to date being 3,240, as against 1038 at this time last year. A corre sponding increase In the faculty brings the number of teachers at Cornell uni versity up from 281 last year to 814 this year. Just about one-half the enroll ment is from New York state, which furnishes this year 1,304 students. Another cherished theme of the col lege orator and essay writer the swift extinction of the American Indian receives a shock when studied in the light of statistics, the figures in the ease coming from the annnal report of the secretary of the interior. Accord ing to that document there are now 867,417 Indians in the Uuited States, while the census of 1890 showed a to tal aboriginal population of 249,473. "I'oor Lo" has evidently taken a fresh grip on life and calmly and with ex ceeding stubbornness refuses to "pass away with the buffalo." Among the victims of a railroad wreck in Paterson, N. J., was Sterling S. Smith, a nephew of Gen. Joseph Wheeler. One of Smith's legs was caught between heavy iron and wood work and mangled. When the rescuers reached him after they had cut through the roof of the car in which he wns im prisoned, he said, although suffering excruciating pain: "Don't bother about me. There are women below me. Gut them out first." This instance of hero ism serves to remind us in these days of brilliant naval and military exploits that those engaged In war have no monopoly of courage. Tbk New York Mail and Express con tained an editorial on the death of Vice President Ilobart which differed in one respect from all the many other arti cles on the ssme subject printed. Hob erf C Alexander,- editor of the Mail and Express, composed an editorial on the vice president when it was first thought the latter was at death's door. Mr. Ilobart rallied, however, and Mr. Alexander was suddenly stricken and died before his article became unli able, preceding to the other world the man whose obituary he had penned. It ia a striking exsmple of the uncer tainty of life aod death.

Oiks Petal IrtklNi Austin, Tex., Dee. li Dlscttsslng the president's recent message U) eon gross, CoL W. t. Bryan said: "I am not very much aurprlsed at the tenor of the message, for nothing else could be expected from President M Kinley. He is the exponent of a party that has ever fostered trust and who, ia the waging of the war of conquest, has ever operated on the theory that might la right. "In reviewing kts message it can readily be seen that on the money question the president adopts the views of Wall street. By tracing his expres sions along this line it is shown that he has not diverged one iota from the principles adopted and followed by the Wall street crowd in their views and practices on the financial question. "When the president takes up the trust question he makes it very clear where he and his party stands. lie confines himself to condemnation of the trusts without suggesting a rem edy. "Not until he reaches the Philippine question, however, does the president express himself so clearly that none can inlsnuderstand him. In discussing this question be plants himself upon the monarchical ground that the strong have a divine right to take care of the weak, and that the weak should be killed if they object"

The gold standard legislation may be more ex peditious than even its friends have anticipated. Before adjournment on the 2Ut for the holiday recess the bill will have passed the house and will have reached the senate. This part of the programme was foreshadowed some days ago, but until now the sup position has been that the bill might drag along for months in the senate. Such, it is now known, will not be the case. The "deliberative body," ac cording to the understanding just reached, will probably break all recent records for prompt action upon mone tary legislation.
