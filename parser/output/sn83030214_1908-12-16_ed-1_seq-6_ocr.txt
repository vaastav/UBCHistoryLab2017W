Ti7E WALL trrXEWT COMMISSION. Governor Hughes in naming a com mission to rlnrtttifiate Wai] Street ■ti and suggest IVgbdarifin to remedy its abuse? has followed I ihe nietiod he. adopted so successfully last year Ijn regard to t-tnue nkiag legislation. It is !«opexior to a legislative Investigation because 'f<Mfh a commission as this on spec ilatkm an<l 'ibat ft last year on tanking is : ,ade up of men -witlJ a greater knowledge of the subject aritJi 'rwhich they have •o deal than could be found lemons tJbe legislators. Its members ir free. 'moreover, from any .]'- to make a sensation -V»r to find political capital, and their conclusions trill !>e sounder than my likely to be reached » ilrr 3 legislative committee. There was ■ pie opportunity in the state bank and trust company situation ns it ex- Jeted laf-t fall for a prodigious sensation, but the Hepburn commission proceeded quietly, •without unsettling such aftdence as existed «ir disturbing business conditions, already suf ficiently precarious. t<> frame, from their own knowied?*- <»f affairs and after consultation •nith bankers, really noteworthy sujr^estions for the reform of the banking- iws, the result l»ein? that this state now _■•...■. «*ode in the country. That was a del which !t is evident the Governor Intend* to have this cwnmisEion follow. The membership la ■toons, eT: , inspires confidence that its i Btkma will .fee Fare and conservative. I Speculation has Its uses and abuse-;; and ii •will be the part <>f the commission to in>c*t legislation to end its abuses and I'ntaliy to teach the public its uses. It will be almost ai much qf a public gain to hsve the uses of specu latSou m«de«lear as it will be" to have '•■ abuses Stopped. The legitimate business of this coun try cannot get on without the aid of specula tion. The grain dealer, the flour maker, the manufacturer of cotton goods cannot make fut ure contracts without having the best advance Information about what the raw material he VilJ require wili sel! for when be ne«ds it to . ."fulfil -bis contract and without beinc able to * protedL iJuM&H in th«- "future" market. Tha i organization of business into corporations coiil* | not have gone on in the way it has without an I open and active market in which tb* prices of ' corporate shares were constantly established. 'and it Is Fpeculatlon which gives to the stock j market the requisite activity to make Its quota- I tions useful. i That, roughly, Is the MB of speculation, but : It Is obvious that to be of renl value these quo tattona must be genuine, the result of real trad ing reflecting exactly the opinion of traders re pirding the value of stocks. To use,the stock market to create flctftious quotations either nnove or below the real value is an abuse. xlnx ln rther words, thousands of persons II over the country want to know, need to know and have i a right to know what stocks or irrain or cotton ; futures ere actually selling for. When in place ! of the results of actual sales there are put j before them the results of fictitious sales. In ! which one person is both buyer and seller, spec . ulatlon is abused. When such dishonest meth j ods are used to create a fictitious appearance j of activity on the exchange in order to induce ; the public to come in so that wash sale opera ! tors can '•unload" on them, the public is .lus tified in crying out for protection. If tills commission shall succeed in putting an end ] to the abuses of Wall Street while freeing the | public mind of some of its prejudices, It may ! save this state from such mistakes as Germaxiy 1 made in its attempts to regulate speculation. ! The Investigation will be made byj sensible, j practical men. It forestalls an Investigation by agitators. "THE PLAP AT THE GOVERXOR." Says "The New York Evening Post," apropos of the "slap at Governor Hughes", involved in the appointment of Otto Kelsey as Deputy Con troller: "There Isn'r ■ little politician or petty ! "boss in TS'etr York nowadays wno wouldn't love "to do something for Otto Kelsey. They just "enjoy making horrible faces at the Governor. "It frightens him so.- "Making horrible faces" would exactly describe such an attempt to 1 humiliate or annoy the Governor, if that were what It was. But can any one Imagine that •'little politvclans" find "petty bosses" would not have even a dim suspicion of the chlMUaimess of such a proceeding when "The Evening Post" perceives it instantly? . "The slap at Governor Hughes"! is bo obvious a failure that it Is im possible to suppose it was seriously Intended as j such. Any one possessing the least familiarity with f the usual processes of politics can see other rea i sons for Mr. Kelsey's appointment, doubtless 1 controlling ones, albeit prosy and undramatic. If the Governor had never disapproved Mr Kel sey as Insurance Commissioner and tried to remove him. provided it was understood that the Governor did not intend to reappoint him, he would doubtless be made Deputy Controller just as be to to be now. and for two reasons, namely, because Mr. Gaus would be looking for an experienced assistant and therefore would select him as an ex-Controller, and because there, would be the same disposition in the organiza tion that there is now to "take care of" Mr Kelsey. whose term would be about to expire j a disposition so common in political circles as to be the occasion of no surprise. i BRITISH POLITICAL PROSPECTS. Mr. Asquith has adopted the policy of "filling the cup." Of that we have heard before. In Mr. GladstoneTs later years nnd at other times. The foremost Issue in politics, the Prime Minister holds, is the conflict between the two houses of Parliament, which has just been particularly accentuated by the action of the House of Lords ' in rejecting a measure which had been passed by the House of Commons. Of course, the Commons mieht forthwith appeal to the country in n new general election, and if the country again returned n strong -Liberal majority, that fact would he accepted as a national mandate for the Liberal policies, and the Lords would yield and would accept the bills which they now reject. But Mr. Asquith declines tr, do that. He will not "dissolve Parliament at the dicta tion and caprice of the upper chamber." Tn-. stead, he will remain in onVe and go on passing bill after bill which the Lords will reject, and n hopes thus to fill the popular cup of wrath* against The Lords to overflowing, so that at the next genera) election there will be another over whelming Liberal majority, nnd also n majority fo? mending or ending the House of Lords. Mr. Asqnith is nn astute political leader, and this plan of campaign, which he has doubtless adopt ed after careful consideration, will be accepted by his party as being not only Strategically, wise, but such hs to serve the welfare of the nsrtion. There ar» those who differ fromaathn, liow ever. and who seem to have some ground for so doing. Th*»y discern in the political tendencies of th<^ day an accelerating drift away from the Liberal party which, if continued for threo years more, will mean defeat for that party r.t the next general election, and they accordingly think that it would be wisefMo appeal to the country now. while there is still reasonable hopv; of another Liberal victory. This view seems to be supported by the record. In tie nearly three years sines the last general election, at which there were returned 512 Ministerialists (374 Liberals, M Nationalists and 54 Labor! tes) and 138 Opposition members (131 Conservatives and 27 ITnionlsts), there have been 7(5 by-elections, pretty evenly divided among the three years — 23 in ISM, 27 In l!»07 and 26 i* 1908. Of th.rte only 00 have been contested, and of these only 4."» have Involved contests between Liberals and Unionists (the latter t°rm comprising also Con servatives i. In 85 of these there was no politi cal change in the result, in 9 there were Union ist gains and in 1 there was a Socialist gain. There was a total gain of 25.785 Unionist votes, and there was a loss of 35,483 Liberal votes, j and a Liberal gross majority of 54,451 was transformed into a Unionist majority of 6,810. | Now, those figures are unfavorable to the gov j ernnient. but they do not prove that It would be in danger of defeat in h general election j now or in one three years hence. The Minis terialists have lost and the Opposition h-is I gained 10 Beats out of 76. At the same ratio In I a gnneral election for 070 members there would be a change of Bfi, reducing the Ministerialists I from 512 in 1906 to 424, and Increasing the Op positlon rSB to 246, and leaving a government I majority of 178. Ii will be observed, however, that there were only 45 contests between Liberals and Unionists, , In which the former lost and the latter gained '■ '.>. or one in five. If that ratio were applied to the 556 contested seats in a general election, there would be a change of 111. which would reduce the purely Liberal 374 of 1906 t<> 203, and would Increase the Unionist (and Conserva tive) 158 to 269, thus giving tba latter a ma jority over the former and making the present 1 Opposition the plurality party. That Is the mate on the present basis. If the electi-m should be postponed until near the end of th« J ttltutional term, the outlook would be still j worse for the government. Tor the Ministerial j losses and Opposition gains have neon increas ing yearly. In tbe 28 by-elections of 190»J the I Liberals lost 7,571 votes and one seat, and the j Unionists gained 1,241 votes and one seat. in the 27 in 1907 the Liberals kwl 8,03Q votes and two seats, and the Unionists gained f.910 rotes and one seat, the Socialists al><» gaining one seat. In the 26 In 1908 the Liberals nay« loel 10.^4 votes and 7 seats, and the Unionlsu bave "gained 21 898 votes sad 7 seals, If tbe increase of leases and gains should continue for the next three years to grow yearly as it has in the last year, there would be l/tle left of the Liberal party. It apeak* much for Mr. Asquitu's cour age and resourcefulness that In the face of such posstbilitles be decides to bold 1 bis grosjnd. Tlie next work of prime Importance which the

It hi understood, will b»» done on decidedly radical IhMB, M ns to provide n jrreatly Increased revenue, to meet the cost of old ape pensions nnd other Radirnl and pemi- Sotiallst measure?, wlthowt resorting to a i>ro tective tariff. There are Btrong hints that this end WIH be nttnlned by Imposing I anbttantial tax upon land In place of the light one which has stood unchanged since Pitt's lime, and. if this Is done, there nre those who expect that the Ix>rds will. reject the budjret Beyond doubt, that would cause a constitutional orisK Theo retically, the I/ords have a right to aSMBi or reject a' budget Practically, they do not ex ercise that right. For more than two centuries the Commons have claimed the sole power of dealing with all financial measures, nnd hnve insisted that the Lorda are bound to accept my such measure which the Commons pass. To that the Lords have never assented in terms, but «*o far as the budget is concerned they have not disputed It. The last occasion on which they rejected a financial measure passed by the Commons was in 1860, when they threw out the bill repealing the paper Ux. The Commons con tented themselves with waiting until the Bit year, nnd then including that measure in the budget, when the Lords accepted It without demur. For the Lords to reject the whole bod get next year would doubtless cause an instant dissolution and an appeal to the country on the sole Issue nf "ending or mending" the upper house. But we should | greatly doubt if the Lords would pursue such a course, which would be playing into the hands of their foes; unless, Indeed, they were themselves, inlent upon promptly' effecting a radical reorganization of their house, perhaps on some such lines as I lose suggested the other day by Lord Rosebery's committee. MR. IyGERAOLL'S EETIREUEyT. The retirement of Mr. Ingersoll. chief en ; gineer of On Bridge Department, may or may not be. a tub thrown to the whale en account •of The Queensboro Bridge scandal. It Is said flint, ever since the failure of the Bridee I»*' partment to know the condition of its own work : became public through the reporta of the px perts that the Queensboro Bridge was being greatly overstrained, in spite of the asMrances of the Commissioner that it was all right when the charges were first made, there has been much friction between Commissioner Stea nnd his chief engineer. Be thnt as If may. th» retirement of Mr. Tngersoll doe* not change the situation or diminish the necessity for action by the Mayor to fix the responsibility for the engineering blunders oc the one hard nni to safeguard the Interests of the taxpayers in fh*» matter of payments for the work on the orher. T-hf> r p is no dispute about the fact that sssoe body blundered in building the bridge. P->nie body caused, a waste of 510.000.000 of the tax payers' money Who was it? It has also been shown that sums largely in excess of those called for by the original contract and the sup plementary authorization of fhe Board of Alder men have been paid, contrary to the advi<e of the engineer of the Finance Department, or the strength of a most astonishing opinion from the Corporation Counsel, which ignored the express terms of the contract which ir professed to in terpret Apparently the Controller «»*» for a long time unconvinced by this opinion, for the payments were held back many months, but whtlp the experts were making the examination, pending which the Controller had announced that he would make no payments, the pressure apparently became too strong and the money was handed over, thereby perhaps releasing the contractor's bond, although responsibility for the blunders In tbe bridge as between him and the Bridge Department has not yet b^en reter mined. What Is the Mayor going to do about this? Is he going to take any steps to gee if n oney can be saved for the imx payers, or must some citizen bring a taxpayer's Cll 't for rhe protec tion of fhe people whose interests the and Controller are set to guard? THE CANAL PURCHASE. The simple facts relating to the Panama Canal purchase, which we rehearsed in brief yesterday, and every one of which had been published again and again, not only in ci hem eral journals but in permanent and standard books of reference, were ample to destroy the charges and insinuations which had been made. The I'resi.leiit's terse and vigorous narrative, contained In his special message, corroborates every Item »vith unanswerable forte. It was the America.n Congress which fixed the price which was to be paid to the French company for its -unfinished canal, nnd which directed the President t$ make the purchase if he found the title good. The President obeyed Congress. He found the tirle good, and he paid the pur chase price. It was no concern of his, as he well says, or of any officer of the executive department, to inquire what the French com pany did with the money. As n matter of fact, however, the evidence is absolutely overwhelm- Ing that the French company honestly nnd equitably apportioned the whole sum, after pay ing necessary and reasonable expenses, among the hundreds of thousands of its own rtock holders and the creditors of the former company to which it had succeeded. A distinguished but somewhat dogmatic pro fessor. In discussing abiogenesis, frankly ad mitted that such a thing bad never been known to occur, and was quite incapable of demo issra tion; "and yet," be said, "it must be so, for "otherwise we should have to admit the exist "ence of a Creator!" Tt may be thnt some mis guided persons in the present case, while forced to admit that there Is not the slightest proof obtainable or discoverable of the cl arges which they hnve uttered against their own gov ernment nnd its good name, will y. r ob stinately declare that it must be so, for other wise they should have to concede th'H the American government, was honest nnd tl at Ns dealings with the Panama company had been honorable. Truly, a dire alternative! 

PERVERTED HI .I/O/?. A smilf vow and then, one of the ol«i-fash ioned facial kind, is a good thing to take even though it may be difficult to take the joke thai caused the smile. But the trouble with much of the humor at Inrge nowadays is that it Isn't at all funny. It may be thnt tliis is largely due to the fact that all the really funny jokes are beginning to show signs of age, and in straining for new ones the would-be Joker for gets that the essence of humor Is kirn) Ittess. Whether ns hns frequently b«en Insisted, the development of the American "foniic" is re sponsible for tiie distorted views possessed 1 by some persons on the subject of humor, oi m lether these perverted attempts at funninesa are merely outcropplngs of the playful spirit which led Horn' 1 of the later Roman emperors to pro vide human torches for their chariot races, may be open to question In the papers recently have nppenred ■ num ber of articles relating tha activities of those pests who possess minds so disordered that they can find satisfaction In the pain that, must be caused to another when ho receives a aotica of the death of a relative or friend.
