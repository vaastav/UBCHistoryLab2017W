THURSDAY, DEC G, 1888. 1 It is thought that Catholic bishop for North Dakota will be appointed, now, before a great while. George Washington was first in augurated March fourth, 178!. Harrison will be inaugurated March 'fourth, 1889, making the centennial president. Young Blaine having deserted his M'ife and child and gone to JCurope, the young woman now says she will go onto the stage. Mme. Modjeska "at one time encouraged her in the idea of adopting the dramatic pro fession. The sugar trust has just shut down two of the largest refineries in the United States, throwing 700 men out of employment at the be ginning of winter, all for the pur pose of decreasing the supply and maintaining present prices. This is made possible by the two cents per pound tariff. The latest reports indicate that President Cleveland's plurality on the popular vote is 100,000. The ulna of voting for president by states and -voting for United States senators through legislatures, is a good deal of a farce, the latter especially. The laws ought to be changed and the voting done directly for tlie candi dates. It is said that one illustration of the way "trusts" work is furnished by the great oat meal mill at Daven port, Iowa, the propi ietors of which are paid $18,000 a year to keep it idle. Hut then this is a "private affair," according to lilaine.and the consumers of meal who pay lliis large sum are not concerned in the matter. Coal is sold at extortionate prices in the northwest, and yet seven thousand poor miners have just been thrown out of their pittance in the shape of employment along the Monongahcla river, that the monopolists may enjoy the full fruits of this important deposit which God Almighty has placed in the earth for the benefit of his whole people. President Cleveland delivered his last message to congress, Monday of this week, and he gives the country the plainest talk it ever got on the subject of the usurpation of the money power. The president is unquestionably on the side of the people as against the money power, and time will justify, he says, the people's cause. It is a great mes sage, and we will publish same next week. (4 It is said that in lOtil a Jesuit priest in Massachusetts, while com piling the bible into the Algonquin Indian language, consulted an old parishioner as to a proper transla tion of these words, viz: "Xot to think more highly of himself than he ought to think,"' was at once ad vised to use the word "mugwump." From that time 011 the word has been occasionally applied to men in New England, taking prominent shape in the campaign four years ago. IswPfl Railway companies centering into Chicago from the west, have, since j||| republican success instituted a sig nificant trust to be known by tlx innocent name of clearing house, located at that city. The scheme is to form such an association of the !•',$/* western railway companies and in corporate such rules governing the trust-as will break down the inter f:'. state commerce law governing rail 5 ways,.allowing the corporations to name such tariff on freights as they please. There is no doubt of trust stocks taking a forward leap at the close of the late campaign, and cor tainljr no one blames the money powers for this since the people got right, to the front in emphasizing the idea that the 0 a right to corporations have do this" sort of thing. matter of legislating power and $ values out of the hands and inter- of thecoinuion people oifgthe into those money/power and a central- iifcdgovernnientia a cardinal plank in ttoplatformof the victors,—an4 Ji- *rt«fnly they will makc the most One of the greatest trusts forming in this country is the dressed meat trust of Chicago, headed by Armour, Swift, Morris and others. The com bination now has the meat trade so completely under their control that they arc enabled to dictate what shall be paid for live stock and what dressed meats shall bring in the markets of this country. One instance of their method is now seen at Finley, Ohio, where the Chicago pool had men doing a meal, trade, getting into a fight with local deal ers at once got instructions from headquarters to put the price of dressed meats down from !0 to 50 per cent., and that unless the local dealers complied with their wishes, and that was to buy meats of- the latter, to freeze them out of the business, with the implica tion of course, that when the local dealers were used up, the corporation would restore the old retail prices. Yet, the pompous re publican bosses assure us that these trusts and combines, building up huge corners on the necessaries of life, are merely private affairs with which the general public lias no con cern. The people ask for broad and the virtuous Republican monopolist and boss hands out a stone, and at the same moment descants in 11 loud tone upon some feature of the bloody shirt and a solid south. Col. Plummet-- -1 have been sail ing in a sea ol' glory ever since the campaign opened.'and since tin election have been visiting friends in Maine and my daughters in Toledo, Ohio. On the evening be fore Thanksgiving I called to see President-elect Harrison and had a very pleasant hour's talk with him. lie is genial and approachable and very entertaining in conversation. The republicans are now 111 power to stay, and you will hear 110 more of free trade in this country. [Fargo Republican. We would be pleased to see Col. l'lnmmer gain a good position un der the administration. Fie is not only a whole sou led. good hearted and able man but he has earned a lucrative position, if he wants it. Hut when the colonel says we shall hear no more about "free trade" in this country he makes a rather startling statement. We doubt the republicans'ability to reform in the matter of speech. There is little hope for them, especially when it is claimed they will cry "free trade"' 110 more. Such reformation is un expected. We rather expect they will keep up the absurd bloody shirt refrain and the silly free trade scare just as long as the people persist in listening to them, as was done in the late campaign, with the hope that the former may continue to vote to the republican bosses that political patronage and the manipu lation of the commercial affairs of the American people, the like of which the world has never before seen. These are ilush times with the mo nopolist boodlers, and that they will not undertake to keep the thing going as they gained the last vict ory, is incredible. "Blocks of Five." W Yowk, Nov. 28.-—The World this morning publishes an interview it had with Senator McDonald, of Indianapolis, last night at the Fifth Avenue hotel. The senator said that he believed Mr. Dudley wrote the "Blocksof Five" letter and that he will lie arrestedas soon as he enters Indiana. Fully $1,000,000 was nsed in Indiana for illegitimate purposes and the openness of the bribery was something unprecedented. The democrats of Indianapolis will make a strong effort to convict. Dudley. "There is no doubt of his guilt. The first, paragraph of the letter is evidence of the criminal intent of the author. His offense is against the federal law and not the state law, and the prosecuting attorney is, •if course a democrat, lint the ease will be tried before a republican judge. The penalty is fine or im prisonment, or both, but under the circumstances I suppose he will get off with a fine." The expression "blocks of live lias this meaning: Dudley wrote a letter instructing his ariny of ward workels all over Indiana to arrange the voters especially the floaters. (floating population) in block* of live, and appointing a man with each block to guide it. to the ballot box, seeing to it that the right ballot was deposited, then back to the dis pensing agent who should pay each in his/turn for the vote cast. Ni:\v Yoitiv, Nov. 28. The Tri bune this morning, referring to a reported formation of a general 1 WMM hjt fjH? com­ bination of railroad companies for the purpose of maintaining profita ble freight rates, says the clearing house scheme has been suggested to the principal roads west of the-Miss issippi river and approved by them, including the Atchison, Topeka Santa Fe, the St. Louis & San Fran cisco and their associate lines in the west the Union Pacific, the Mil waukee and the Sticknev road in the Northwest. The scheme covers all the territory between the Miss issippi river and the Rocky moun tains. outside of the transcontinen tal and international, traflie assoc-ia tians. C. P, Huntington of the Southern Pacific is said to have been the first one to suggest this est en isiyeplan. 4 Vf 

WASUINOTOX, Dos, —The Nor thern Pacific road will gain about 4,000.000 acres by the decision of the attorney general in the case of the indemnity hinds. Of this nearly 3,000,000 is confirmed to it in the socond indemnity belt as settled by the attorney general to be possessed by the road. It will gain about 1,000,000 acres by the decision allow ing the company to take indemnity in Dakota lor lands lost in Minesota. It is said that Senator Sabine and Ignations Donnelly have combined nallv is to throw his full strength to Mr. Sabin. and that in ease it wins, _____ Mr. Donnelly is to have some good appointment. Che la-publican party tjW! adjournment of the house The other day Conklin's Dakotaian ot Watertovvn called attention to the fact-that some of the millers ot South Dakota were moving in the interest of a territorial or state trust to control the price of Hour, deprecating the idea of trusts when the Yankton Dakotaian hop ped on to Conk I in with both feet, declining tljat the Dakota millers had to coinbi-ne to hold their own against the' Minneapolis millers' trust. N'ow. if this "spat" shows anything it is a strengthening of the idea that the cwinnercial affairs of this country are Jtjeing usurped or "gobbled up" by gi%it-corporations, and that the bravado of the Yank ton sheet defeats itself. Trusts and combines are just wlut Conklin un dertook to rebuke, and that the domineering, high sounding defense of the Jilaiue doctrine, that trusts are merely private affairs with which the public has 110 concern, constitutes a living issue and will scarcely hold out for all time. The people will surely get the better of their prejudice after awhile. Canada ami the Union. The Republican bosses realizing the shallowness of their great claims about a "home market" and "pro tection to American labor," are turning their attention to the propo sition of the consolidation of the union tt^HfcCanada. It is notorious that CaiiliJni under her present pro tective laws is unable to hold out against or compete in furnishing homes with this country and herself make any progress. She is of too small commercial proportions, and being unable to stand her present strain of "protection to home in dustry-' and a "home market," finds her population melting away, na tional debt and common hardships ol her people multiplying upon those who cannot get away, and it is indeed conceded that she must, make a shift for the better and that is, ultimate union with the United States. This would undoubtedly at once afford Canada relief, and it might cause a loosening up in com mercial circles of this country, for some features of our gorged "marts might find relief in supplying that Section which has been held: aloof bv means of Canada's retaliatory protective laws, passed a dozen or fifteen years since. The lesson, then, the present aspect of affairs teach is that so-called protection does not save Canada unto herself— to a government of her own and that it she should agree to consoli date with the union- ami England should admit of such a thing--it would be just contrary to what, the people iiiere have always advocated, would he a matter of commercial expediency and not or.e of narrow bounds hampered by high protection. We think the people of this country would, under consolidation, have no cause for apprehension of complica tion, everything would move, on se lenely. the acquisition being more apt to lean toward conservatism among the people than toward the present tendencies of centralized power. One would have as much hope in the new territory i,"i"g right on great popular questions as can now be hail of faith in the cen tral and western states, who seemed to lose their head in the late con test, or at Jeast failed to conie to their senses: the bloody shirt and a solid south might not so worry the new territory as it seems to worry sections of the middle ground. In truth this prospective consol idation which so savors of destiny does not carry out the idea that narrowness and contraction source of wealth, but leans toward the breaking down of imagi nary walls and lines, affording a wider range to commercial affairs, and it is in the Democratic faith to allow these things to come to pass. :s a more JJ&vl 4 j/ The House Passes a Bill of Great Importance to Des Moines River Settler*.

The hill was one to quiet the title of settlers on these lands, and was brought up as priv ileged matter by Mr. Payson. of Illinois, from the committee 011 public lands. The bill declares all lands improperly certified to Iowa by the department of the interior under the act of Aug. 8. 1846, to be public lands of the United States, and it confirms and makes valid the title of all bona fide settlers under color of title from the state of Iowa and its grantees, or the United States and its grantees, which does not come in conflict with prior bona fidepre-emptior or homestead claimants. It also con fines and makes valid the claims of all persons who in gftod faith, with intent to obtain title under the pre-emption or homestead laws, had remained upon any tract of laud prior to January. 1880, CONGRESSIONAL PROCEEDINGS.! The Senate. WASUISUTOX, Dec. (5.—At the conclu sion of morning business 'in the senate, the tariff bill was taken up and read bv sections for amendment. Senator Harris said that to test the sense of the senate he would move to lay the finance com mittee's amendment to the house bill on the table. The yeas and nays being called for a vote was taken with the re sult that the senate refused to lay the finan.ee committee's substitute on the table—yeas 19, nays 26. The division was on party lines. The substitute was then read by sec tions for amendments, and thirty pages of the bill were disposed of. Senator Dawes introduced and the sen ate adopted a resolution calling on the secretary of the interior for information concerning the alleged outrages on In dian females and others in Alaska, and the action, if any, taken by the depart ment to protect the persons of females in Alaska from outrage, violence and re straint of liberty. Mr. Dawes said that lie had 110 other information on the sub ject than that contained in the public prints, but that if these stories were true and the department of the interior had adopted no measure to correct the r&t rages. the matter was a great public scandal. Tile Huuxr. WASHINGTON. Dec. 6.—Mr. Oates, of Alabama, introduced in the house a bill providing that no alien shall be admitted into the United States who is an idiot, insane, a pauper or liable to become a public charge, or who has been legally convicted of a felony or other infamous crime or misdemeanor, or who is a pol ygamic, Anarchist or Socialist, or who is afflicted with any loathsome or conta gious disease, or who has entered into contract to perform labor.
