THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. The message of President Harrison is affirmatively strong in presenting his ad ministration as having in the best manner and most actively conserved the highest interesU of the country. Generally, it reviews the condition of the nation in detail and compares the fis cal year just closed with preceding years, to show that the United States enjoys a higher degree of prosperity now than at any previous period. Our export trade, he shows, has exceeded that of any year in our history, excepting only one. This ex port trade has been mainly of agricultural products, fully $100.000,0.0 of the $11., --000,000 gain over 1888-1) being of that class. The bu.iuess failures have been .00 less and the liabilities of trade §-000,000 lielow those of the preceding fiscal year. Upon this head the President dwells at considerable length, maintaining with much vigor that our industrial, product ive and financial conditions are upon a present high plane of prosperity, and premise for the future all that can be reasonably desired. Concerning the recent disturbance in fiuancial circles, he asserts that it was not due to any want of faith in American se curities, but to the need of a foreign mar ket to realize upon them, which induced their return to us. He dwells upon the Barrundia affair but little, simply saying that -Minister Mizner exceeded his author ity, which necessitated his recall, as he was not warranted in interfering, as re quested, to aid in the taking of Barrundia, who was in transit and charged with po litical offenses. The Bekring Sea matter is referred to as unsettled pending negotiation for abasis of permanent settlement. But the Presi dent indicates that the policy of the Gov ernment will he adhesive to the claim that (ireat Britain must recognize our property right in the sea, as acquired from Russia, and which right in Russia and the United States has been for more than eighty years undi.-pt.ted. Portugal was brought to satisfactory arbitration of the Delagoa Bay affair, in which the rights of an American investor were involved, who claimed our protec tion. With all nations our relations are peaceful, and the early future promises as to several of them much closer commercial and more reciprocal relations than now exist. The Nicaragua Canal he r . .rts as pro gressing satisfactorily under American en terprise. And such is our connection with Mexico that he advises the raising of our mission to that country to the rank of the first class. Consular supervision is urged, as heretofore, and especial stress is laid upon the importance of this subject ns demanding immediate legislation. The silver legislation lias been faithfully car ried out, and with satisfactory results. He warns Congress, however, against im pulsive legislation that may neutralize the advantage our large supply of gold gives us, and prevent what he believes will be consummated, the free use of silver as an international agency. The financial condition of the nation is set forth in totals, and the President finds it to be entirely satisfactory, and to reflect credit upon his administration. Coast de fensive works of magnitude have hi., ap proval, and he points with pride also to the growing proportions of the new navy, to the general improvement in the army, and urges greater liberality by the Fed eral Government in promoting the effi ciency of the organized militia, which Le well terms the real army of the United States. He points out that the internal revenue during the last fiscal year increased about $12,000,000, but that the cost of its collection was effected by $90,017 less than in the preced ing year, and at less cost than ever be fore. He credits the policy of the admin istration with having increased the circu lation of money $93.880,814, or about .1 -Vi per capita, and adds that only about 57, --100,000 of this is to be attributed to silver legislation, The administration of the Postal and Agricultural Departments is warmly c- jin . mended and much space is g';, cn to cita tions to show that new jmJ profitable fields are opening to the farmers, as for in stance in the culture of the sugar beet, and that agricultural products are receiv ing augmented prices. Attention is called to the fraud-; perpetrated in naturalization, and Congress is asked to pass iaws to re quire severer inquiry iuto the claims of applicants for admi.-sion to the privileges of citizenship. A hint at the cause of the threatening attitude of the Sioux tribes of Indians is given in the statement that Congress neg lected to appropriate sufficient money to enable the Government to keep the con tract solemnly made with the tribes, by which the cession of certain lands were made to the United States. While be comc-ends the attitude of the head of the Mormon Church regarding polygamy, he warns Congress that that church has not agreed to refrain from teaching the doctrine of plural j marriage, but only to refrain from its prac tice. A national bankruptcy law is ad vised, and early legislation in favor of arid lands. He would have the United States survey aud prevent the occupancy of water rights, and so legislate as to enable all actual settlers to avail freely of sources of water supply to reclaim arid lands. Coming to the tariff question, he insists with emphar.is that the new tariff law is not chargeable with the rise in prices, and declares that the proof of this is that, prior to the passage of the bill, there was a legitimate upward tendency. He insists tha. the bill should not be judged until it has had fairer and more extended trial, especially, he add*, as some of its provisions have not yet gone into effect. It i_ signifi cant that the President dwells upon the question of reciprocity, and very frequent ly returns to it as a policy that is not to be limited to any particular nation, or that is to be circumscribed by sentiment. In less we wi.ti.ke the real tenor of the Presi dent's expressions—read in telegraphic manuscript—upon this topic, there is a decided drift in the message towards the establishment of reciprocal commer cial relations with any nation, when we can secure full compensating advantages in a foreign market, for the admission free to our own of the products of that foreign country which we do not produce to the best advantage. While the President de fends the recent tariff legislation, and be- lieves that it haa been unfairly assaulted, and much misunderstood, it is clear that he considers reciprocity the curative for most tariff ills complained of, and that he is preparing the way for a very broad read ing and practice of the reciprocal policy. In this connection he urges with force such extension of aid to American steam ship lines carrying the United States mails as will bring this nation into harmony with the tradition of Great Britain, that ''trade follows the flag." His advice upon this topic is fortified by frequent references to the necessity for liberality in this di rection as an efficient means of carrying out a policy of reciprocity. Congress is told very plainly that, in President Harrison's opinion, an electoral supervision law for all elections involving Federal offices, which the Democracy terms "a force bill," is a necessity; that it will not be a new departure; that it will not invade the jurisdiction of honest Election Board., nor deprive electors of any right or privilege, or cow or hamper them in the exercise of the supreme act of sovereiguty. Upon this subject the Presi dent wSxes not only eloquent, but plainly manifests his indignation over the criti cisms with which the Lodge bill has met. lie explains how the marketing of our meats in Europe has been conserved by tbe appointment of veterinary surgeons by the United States, to inspect the arrivals of our meat exports abroad. With this inspection in the foreign port, and inspec tion at home, not only is the liability of the shipment of diseased food effectually prevented, but the animus of any foreign complaint against such products wiil be revealed. These are the main topics treated in the messpge, which is a rather full and ex tended review of the business and policies of the country, and which, without being a great state paper, is a straightforward understandable presentation of the condi tion of the nation and the views of the Administration concerning the national policy. Consideration ol the document in a critical spirit is reserved. THE 

CITRUS FAIRS. The Record-Union yesterday extend edly set forth the reasons why the two citrus fairs should be located respectively at .Marysville and Los Angeles for this season. Further consideration of the sub ject emphasizes the conclusions then reached. The fairs will, we trust, be placed at the points indicated, (lood faith in the one case as well as other wise reasons relating to citrus fruit culture, and the plainly evident wisdom of selecting Los Angeles in the second place, for com mercial, transportation and natural rea sons, lead us to hope that the State Board of Agriculture will act to-day wisely in locating the expositions. If it does, Marysville and Los Angeles will be selected for the reasons we set forth in de tail yesterday and which to us seem irre sistible. The - President's message, which we present in full this morning, was for warded to the press with the compliments of the Associated Press, William Henry Smith, General Manager The favor is duly appreciated, and the promptness of its transmission acknowledged. It was sent over the wires hy the Western Union Company, and taken by the Sacramento operators with clearness and furnished in I excellent form for publication.

At 11 o'clock a large number of Representatives had arrived on the floor. Every one seemed in good humor and the Democrats and Republicans bandied jokes and mineled together good-naturedly. The Democrats, of course, twitted their opponent* about their defeat in the recent elections, but the latter took it all in good humor aud every body seemed happy aud eager for the coming fray. Absurd as it may appear, it really seemed as if the crowded galleries were waitiugfora matinee or a prizo-light or a baseball game to begin. No oue seemed conscious of the fact that the popular legislative body of the greate.-t Governmeut on earth \va3 about to set agoing its ponderous law-:i:aking machinery. Most of the leaders on both siies were in their seats. SENATE. Wa-hingtos, December Ist.—There was an unusually large attendance ol fccnators at tne opening of to day's session.

The stairs leading to the wide portals were utilized ns resting-plsccs and the opening doors fur nished "standin?room<mly" io belated arrivals. A dull, leadeu sky, which overhung the city, served to ma c tbe hall rather gloomy, but the gloom was almost dissipated by roars of laughter which cmc from the cloak-rooms and by the animated conversation wbich took place upon the floor. The Democrats 6p_e__..y \ v ere joyous, and the Republicans were obliged to put up with a great deal of goodunlured badgering with smiling countenances. A ta«-e --fnl pyramid of flowers adorned the Speaker's desk. At noon Speaker Reed entered the hall and a rap of the gavel instantly restored order. After prayer by the Chaplain, the Clerk pro ceeded to call the roll by States. The call dis closed the presence of -_7 members and the Clerk was directed to inform the Senate that a i.uorum of the House appeared and the body was ready to proceed to business On motion of Cannon of Illinois a resolution was adopted for the appointment of a committee to joiu a similar committee on the part of the Senate to wait upon the President and notify I im that Congress was read/ to receive any communication he may see fit to transmit.
