Belief for Soldiers' Families. ' Mcssrt. EJUon: Permit me through your paper to state a few facts, with refer ence to the County Relief Fund of this Co. There are those who, either wilfully, or through ignorance, grossly misrepresent the design, amounts and power of the County Commissioners to grant relief from this Fund ; thereby causing much trouble to the soldiers' families, and thoee who have to disburse the money. The Legislature of 1860-61 passed an act au thorising a levy for this object, of one-half mill on thn dnllnr nf ell iha faveKla erty of any county in the State, by the County Commissioners thereof. The Commissioners of this County, anticipa ting the authority thus given, (and from the pressing necessities and demands of the families of volunteers for relief,) bor rowed from the County General Fund, and commenced disbursing even before the above act became a law. The levy of the one-half mill raised about five thou sand and seven hundred dollars ; this amount was paid out to these families, long before it was collected from the tax- duplioate, and the Commissioners found themselves entering another long, cold winter with our three hundred soldiers' families upon their hands, expecting and demanding assistance, with no relief mon ey In the Treasury. Hoping, however. that the Legislature would again relieve them, they borrowed from the Connty General Fund as before, and have contin ued their disbursements to the present time, except a few months in the summer that is just past. The Legislature au thorizedalevy of six-tenths of a mill, which will raise a fund of a little over six thou and dollars when the present tax-dupli cate is collected ; but the Commissioners have already borrowed and paid out over 4,000 dollars of this amount, leaving but about two thonsand dollars to be dis bursed to nearly four hundred families, consisting from one to ten members each. It requires no intricate calculation to demonstrate that this sum, though doled put never so me.inly, will not last half the coming winter. Says one, "borrow as be fore from the Connty General Fund." This cannot now te done, as that Fund - has just furnished twenty thousand dol lars to pay the bounties to soldiers, offer ed by the County, and is now so exhaust. ed as to be unable furnish anything now for any purpose, except the one for which - it is legitimately raised. Thus it will be seen that something must be done beyond what is in the pow- ri ui mc wvmuiy vuuiuiissiuuers iu uu lur them. That many of them are very des titute there is no question; that they r v. r r ? j must have help from some source, or suf fer, is equally unquestionable ; and will we let them want the necessaries of life while their husbands or brothers are fight. ing the battles of our common country for us ? - Breasting- the leaden hall, or burning steel, . And all the woe of soldier! feel. I know that many say when called upon to cive.that these families Are now receiv- . a ' ing more money than they ever had be- lure luai mey uu ziui nia&e juuicious use of what is given them, 4c, ie. Sup .1 1 L V ' " " pose these objections do exist ; does it ex cuse any one for withholding from them the necessaries of life ? for steeling his heart to the wants of the families of the men who are now protecting him in the enjoyment of his quiet home, and the very property of which they now ask but a pittance. The necessaries of life are very dear now ; fife dollars will not buy any more than three would a few months since, yet the soldier gets no more pay than he did then. How it must wilt the courage and stifle the patriotism of the soldier to learn that his family is neglected and suffering at home, and he by the tern fates of war deprived of ministering to their wants. "Brave Boy are they. Gone at their country 's call." and they should be made to feel that they are not onlr sustained by the pray ers and well wishes of their friends at home, but by "the more substantials . of this life, such as food and clothing, to 'their families. Suppose you were starv ing, and your neighbor had plenty, would you thank him to pray night and morn ing that you might be fed, and yet refuse to feed you. Impious are the prayers of him who will not answer them himself, when in his power so to do; let us look at this matter practically. What are our homes and property worth if this Govern ment is not sustained, and its authority re-instated? We of the Free States do sot begin to feel the horrors of this war, we are pursuing our various avocations in comparative quiet. Why are we thus se cure and peaceful ? Because the soldier has driven the invader from our soil, and is now bearding the lion in his den, and are we under no obligations to him, for thus protecting our lives and property, except the thirteen dollars per month, and clothing allowed by the Government? Legally we may not be, Imt morally we are bound to sustain him, and his family, for thus jeopardizing his life for the gen eral good. Let each .township organize itself at once, and prepare to take care of these families within its limits. Let each neighborhood have its wood-bees, and supply them with their winter's wood. Let each family be visited at least once month, and supplied with what they are needing, and if there is one (who has an abundance of this world's goods,) that will not give to this object, I care not what may be his excuses, even though he may consider it unconstitutional, may the ghouls of secessioni-ts and traitors haunt his stingy soul, until he shall discharge his full duty to these families. Let each one then interest him or herself on this subject, and it will become a pleasure, rather than burden, thus to contribute. And when the chuigor of arras shall have ceased, and the roar and dire of battle, shall have passed away. you may welcome to his quiet home the cire worn and bat tle scarred soldier, and each shall feel un der mutual obligations to the other. You tt him for having ieriled Lis life in de fence of our common country ; and he to you for having sustained him and his fam ily while thus engaged. The County Commissioners have dis charged their dur;" - his matter faith fully, regardlp r or favors of any one, as a consequence, nave oeen charged with all manner of petty crime, and assailed with all the unpleasant epi thets that imaginary wrong could extort from afflicted women. They have never theless gone steadily forward, disbursing the money, according to their best judg ment ; they may have erred in some in stances, 'to err is human.' But if they have erred in this distribution, we have the consolation of believing the errors are of the head, and not of the heart. They now ask the people to take this matter off their hands, and that each township, as above suggested, provide liberally for the families within its own limits. O. L. 

WOLCOTT. From Burrow's Battery. Jackson, Tenn., Nov. 21. Dear Chronicle: Since my last letter nothing has occurred to vary the same ness of camp life. We have gone into "Winter Quarters" and that the winter may be passed as comfortably as possible, the Battery has erected eight log cabins and two domicils of slabs in which all are well housed. These habitations are chinked and daubed in the most approved rustic style, and fitted up as they are, with bunks and conveniences for fire, are a most efficient protection against the coming wintry blast. At evening these pioneer dwellings resound with laugh, jest and song till the inevitable "Taos" sounded bv "Nate" or "Chapman," both men of original and peculiar genius, tells the time for retiring, when, to quote from "Battery Orders" lights must be put out and the camp in a state of repose. Daring our fifteen months service the Battery has been favored by two Picnics by the ladies of Champion and Bristol, received before leaving Camp Wade. A munificient donation of goods and pro visions valued at seventy-five dollars from the Cleveland Aid Society, presented by their agents Mr. Cory and Mrs. Noble, whose courtesy made the gift doubly welcome, reached us shortly after the bat tle of Shiloh, together with a box of pro visions from the ladies of Austinburg. As these things were given to us while "still in the wilderness" before Corinth when, the Commissary stores consisted only o hard crackers, bacon and beans, you may be sure thev were as "a feast of fat things." For all these tokens of remembrance I made due acknowledgments through the Chronicle, but never have seen any copies of the paper containing them, do not know whether they everreached you, and hence give them a brief mention again The above remarks were suggested by the recent reception of two boxes of pro visions sent by the Warren Aid Society last August, which have finally reached us after three months of wandering and de lay. One box, by some mistake was sent on to Bolivar and has not yet returned. With the exception of two cans of berries every thing was well preserved. For these gifts mentioned below we would return thanks to the following ladies: ' Honey and Cherries Mrs. Stnll Molasses and Butter (extra) " 1 Gallon Elderbery Wine " Harmon Dried Meat and Fish " Douglass Dried Peaches Catsup and Syrup Dried Currents 3 Kegs Catsup Onions Parks King " Harsh Aid Society Miss Cellaneous The articles were very timely and all will testify most acceptable. . We can as sure the Secretary of the Society that the evidence of feeling alluded to when that Catsup was made is duly appreciated. As your old correspondent "Artillerist" has been spoken to about giving thanks I may safely leave the work of laudation to him and regret that but one young lady fig ures on the list to inspire muse. Elevation in rank having ever been the official recognition of military nieritb, I am glad to notice the promotion of Cor porals Parker and Wright to the post of Sergeants and also of privates McCord and Haynes to the promotion of Corporals. They have been perfect patterns of the faithful soldier and it is universally con ceded that a more fitting and acceptable selection could not have been made. The result of the election was generally-un-looked for, and had a dispiriting effect for a tune provoking a great deal of con temptuous and angry comment. Had the soldiers had the privilege of voting not a single scurvied peace man would have been lifted out of his proper obscu rity. Though there may be a sprinkling of peace Democrats in the army, I have yet to meet with one, even of that kind, who does not indignantly deny that he has any affilation with Vallandingham or his school, which seems to be almost too low for contempt. Taking into view the lack of moral stamina exhibited by the Republicans in the defeated. States in not making an issue in favor of those progressive prin ciples to whose advocacy the party owe its existence and vitality, their following in the blind leadership of exhumed po litical fossils, this temporary repulse can hardly be looked upon in any other light than as a just judgment upon their folly. It is but a tidal wave in the ebb flow of the political sea. In effect it will be but an application of the brakes of foav to check the ou rushing of the train of Progression, or, at most, its turning aside upon a conservative switch. It will avail little, the momentum may be impeded but not fully checked, for the track still bears onward and southward and from New "Years, that dvy of blessed promis the people will chant the glorious refrain, "llo! the ear Emancipation Rides majestio through the nation. .Bearing on its train toe story Liberty's a nations (lory." Our "peace men at any price" will then see that they have played as vain a part as so many mules in a Ferry Boat, not to mention other long-eared relatives who brace their feet and pull back while the Boat moves majestically on. Doubtless Yandalscamp, remembering his ignomin ious reception at the hands of Ohio troops will continue to vex the souls of good men by an increased assurance in his asinine utterances, but the dog has had his day and will soon give way to a better m in.

This place has been made a great ship, ping point for cotton, and several thou sand bales have been sent from here to the North. It is now in the midst of the "cotton picking" season, and every day it is being brought in by the quantity from a distance of fifty miles in many cases. Great fortunes have been and are till being made by dealers in this article, who are Jews to a very great extent. Somehow these eagle beaked Israelites have a remarkable success in insinuating themselves into the sunshine of official favor and monopolizing the places of prof- I have yet to meet with a Jew in the ranks or in any place of danger. Their retreat to the rear is a sure indication of "breakers ahead," and their flight is very precipitate. Though they do not stop to make adieus, they always make sure of their "monish." While these hale, able bodied harpies are reaping a golden har vest our own gallant braves who have been maimed by wounds, or disabled by disease, can often only obtain some de tailed position in the service as hospital nurse or assistant, ambulance driver, or tome petty post, at twenty-five cents ex tra pay per day, or perhaps the privilege of peddling apples, papers, pies or station ery. How long must this imposition be borne? Some of our most prominent officers with an eye to the main chance have dab bled extensively in the cotton traffic. The head of the Military Department of Arkansas is said to have made the enor mous sum of $3,000,000 1 Uf the military movements below us we hear but little, though there is a uni versal belief and expectation that success only awaits the movement southward of the western army, whose prestige will ren der it well nigh invincible. Vicksburg assailed simultaneously, as it doubtless will be, above and below on the river and in the rear by land, will be in our posses sion by Christmas. It will, I trust, be razed to the ground. A like fate should be visited upon Rich mond and Charleston, our American So dom and Gomorrah. They should be sub jected to a fiery rain of bomb, shot ami shell, and like the fire from heaven which overwhelmed their ancient prototypes, the cities of the plain, so these two un godly resting places of treason should be blotted from the earth they have so long disgraced. For this result let all good men pray and traitors gnash their teeth and wail. Too long have the energies of the na tion been criminally wasted and thrown away in a vain endeavor to conquer reb els without striking at the cause of the rebellion. No sooner has a General achiev ed brilliant success than he was at once removed from command or assigned some other field of labor, but in spite of this official disfavor, the army has never lost faith in its chosen, leaders Fremont, Sigel, Mitchell or Pope. Their presence by a return to their old commands, would be bailed as a sure harbinger of triumph and would awaken a perfect furor of accla mation. This is an enticing theme on which I would like to dwell, but my letter has al ready exceeded its limits, so easy does it become to multiply words, and I will wait till another opportunity offers to give vent to ideas which might render this commu nication tedious if written now. And so again FarewelL And if forever, still Fare Bernch Letter From Capt. Barrett—the 6th Ohio Cavalry. CHANTILLY, Nov. 28, 1862. Dear Chronicle. It is the close of a dull dreary Sabbath, with the Cth O. V. C uur camp situated on the western edge of a tract of woodland, exposes us to the fury of the wind which comes howling down from the Blue Ridge as though it were in league with Stuart, or Stonewall, to drive us from the State. Since I last wrote we have been ranging far and wide through this section of the State. After lying in camp at Centerville till we began to despair of ever moving again, an advance movemant was made. We took the lead down the Orange and Alexandria R. R. driving in the rebel pickets and patrols,, and scouting and picketing on the front and flanks, day and night. Thus passed the time till we reached Warrenton Junction, when we received an order from Gen. D. E. Sickles, under whose command we were, compli menting us for our vigilance and daring, and expressing a desire that we should have a short time rest, and truly we need ed it. For seven days and nights we had been almost constantly in the saddle, and many of us had slept none at all for three consecutive nights. J ust as we were about to go into camp congratulating ourselves on the prospect of a good nights rest, up came Gen. Sigel's Body Guard, fresh horses and fresh men, with an order for us to ac. company them on an expedition we knew not where. There was no alternative. "Ours not to reason why." We went but there were curses loud and deep. All night long we sped away through the pine forests of eastern Vir ginia. 1 he night was black as Erebus, its darkness relieved only by the falling snow which whitened the narrow fields over which we occasionally passed. Toward morning we learned that our destination was Fredericksburg. We in tended to reach it by daylight, but through the drunkenness, or incompetency of our guide, we did not reach our destination till two hours later. We found the tide up and the water fire - feet deep on the usual ford. We were ordered back from the river to await the falling of the tide, but the guide dis. covered a narrow and difficult nassape higher up. Supposing that there were but sixty of the enemy across the river, the body guard slipped off privately, tak ing with them come ten of our men who had been left to guard the ford, and made a dash into town. Soon a party of them came back reporting that the enemy were six hundred strong, and that the body guard had been all killed or taken pu'so ners. They advised us to leave if we wished to avoid capture, and three or four of them, including a Lieutenaut and Sur geon ingloriously skedaddled, reaching camp a day before us, and reporting that we were all taken. Though we numbered but sixty men, Major Steadman refused to withdraw, hop ing to save some who might yet straggle off and escape. Soon we had the satisfac tion of seeing our friends return and cov ering their retreat across the river. They had had a desperate encounter. The en emy were some four or fire hundred strong, but not daunted by their num ber, our boys charged and drove in all di rections. They captured some thirty or forty prisoners and two carts laden with uniform cloth for the rebel army. Our lost was one killed, and three or four prisoners, but we left eight or ten dead rebels in the streets of the city. When the body guard came back, we learned for the first time that orders had been sent for us to cross and assist them. ' It may have been so, but certain it i that no one could be found who had brought any such message. I notice that a one sided account of the affair has been published in the X. Y. Tri bune, and that some blame is thrown up on the 6th, for neglecting to obey orders. Had any such order reached us, or any in timation thnt is were wanted, we would not have been slow in haatening "to the rescue. The truth of the matter is, that the Guard expected to find a small force to oppose them, and finding more than they bargained for, they sought to escape cen sure for their rashnes and to set their bravery in a stronger light by claiming that we refused to assist them. They did a gallant deed, but their injustice lower ed them much in our estimation. Since then we have been scouting along the eastern base of the Blue Ridge and Bull Run Mountain?, and are now with Sigel. near Centerville, waiting to defend Washington, should the rebels venture to make an attack in the absence of our main army. Yours Truly, N. A. BARRETT. Letter from Col. Hall. The following letter from Col. Hall was not intended tor publication. It was written to F. P. Green, of North Bloom field, but as some stories respecting CoL Hall have been afloat, as an act of justice to him, and his regiment, the gallant 105th, the letter should be puplished. Headquarters 33d Brigade, ) Muxfordsville, Kt.,Nov.5,'G2. J Dear Sir: I have delayed writing to you for a long time solely for the want of an opportunity. It has become apparent to you, no doubt, before this, that neither myself or my regiment has bad much leisure since we left Cleveland so sudden and unexpectedly. From the letters I am receiving I am inclined to believe that the people at home have been most fully, if not truthfully, informed of our doings, treatment, sufferings and general condition. I propose iu this letter to speak of the lies that have been told, but briefly, trusting as I do that with the in telligent and good they will work their own correction. It is not to be disguised that I am annoyed by their stories, not on my own account, but for my dear wife, who thought she suffered enough in the fact of my absence alone. She writes me that there are, at home, meu who claim to have been taken prisoners and paroled on the retreat from Lexington, telling the most horrible stories of my cruelties to my men, and making the most alarming statements of their individual suffering. I propose to speak of these men, and wish first to say, that I had really gallant men who were taken prisoners in Lexiug ton being then in Hospital. These sto ries have not come from them. On the 25th of August we arrived at Lexington by railroad and lay in Camp 3 miles south on the Nicholasville pike till the night of August 30th, when we were ordered to march immediately, by forced march to the relief of our forces at Richmond, 26 miles east of that city. We marched 14 miles to the KentuckyaRiver by daylight, learned that our forces were all captured, and then formed in line of battle to prevent the enemy from crossing. We stood to arms till 3 P. M.t when we were ordered to cover the rear, on the march back to Lexington. When we faced for Lexington the enemy advanced. We reached Lexington late in the night, and by a personal visit to Generals Gilbert and Wright I succeeded in getting my writ ten orders so changed as to take my regi ment off from picket that night, (a very rainy one) and sheltered it in a market in the city. At 8 o'clock the next morning I was or derered out on the Nicholasville pike, to protect the city, till the Quarter Master's stores could be moved and the town evac uated. On the Richmond road skirmish ing took place all that day and the 94th Ohio lost some 50 men, the enemy was pursuing as fast aa they could, and threw a force of cavalry around to the north of Lexington to get between us. and Ver sailles. All that afternoon the evacuation was going on, and the last regiment or- dered to leave was, mine and we passed through the city at eight P. M., and marched all night, covering the rear.- There was an immense train in the col umn, a large drove of mules, and horses, very deep dust and great lack of water, as it had nat rained west of Lexington to any extent. Every man in the command knew of the Richmond defeat, knew that we were retreating from an advancing enemy flushed with a great victory, the or ders given us were of the strictest charac ter to permit no straggling or falling to their rear, as all such would be captured by the enemy. To effect the execution of this order a heavy rear-guard was or dered to bring up all stragglers, the Sur geons and commanding officer of each regiment, and company, marched in rear of their respective commands. The men were notified of the danger, of the orders, and directed not to leave their companies without the permission of the Capt. and the Captain's we directed to give every fatigued or sick man a written leave to fall behind, till the Surgeon came up; the Surgeons examined every man so report ed, or who fell back in sight of the col umn, and if he need to be carried, teams were ordered to be pressed to carry them all. And this was done without excep tion, for every man who reported to the Surgeon as be waa ordered. Not one of them was left behind. But there were those who knew if they could hide from the Rear Guard, they could be taken pris oner! i n a tew liours. be paroled and go home, and some 20 men of the Regiment in the night inarches, hid away in this manner, and deserted ns. Deserted us too, when it' was expected every day, that a fight would take place. Gone home in stinging disgrace, these cowarJt and tlinkt, have sought to cover their dis honor by lying about their officers. This march was a hard one, one of the hardest known to this rebellion, it was conducted and ordered by three Generals, Gilbert, Jackson, and Terrill, and I brought up the rear, no pleasant task, but one that had to be performed at all hazards, with Sur geons at either hand, I made every man march whom they said waa able to march, and transported every man they decided o need it. Many a man came back to that rear guard who said, be could go no further, but when toe Surgeons said, "ha trivet no Hul.i,ri,... i , ii. '. . .. , el on, and kept my transportation for - those who needed it. This was the un. pleasant duty of nu officer charged to "bring up the rear." Not an officer of my command but walked, with myself, ma ny and tunny a mile, to give our horses to those who were in a condition to need them. Day after day and niiiht after night we marched thus in the sight of the enemy, and by the most exhausting labors that were evtr upon me, at the end of 4 days and five nights marching, we reach ed Louisville, and not one man was gone who had obeyed orders and reported him self at the rear where he could be provi ded for. Can it be possible that men who thus deserted their gaPaut comrades can be able to injure those who labored to pro tect them ? Friend Green," large boun ties got some cowards to enlist, some men who never intended to do the duties of a soldier, some who have boasted in their companies that they intended to le taken prisoners and go home; with the bounty and pay. When the advance was order ed Oct., 1st there was another sifting the white liver and fear of bullets, again made its appearance, and some were sick from that cause alone. We left them' behind. and the Doctors have discharged them. many of them will be seen to rapidly re cover after getting home, you will soon who were really or permanently dis abled. But it was the clear stuff, the genuine soldiers wno were leic in me ranks, no man fell out, or desired to, on the march towards the enemy, there was no need of a rear guard, and not a soldier left his place on any pretense unless order ed, and their conduct at the bloody sac rifice of Perryville evinced the true metal of which they are composed. In all this rebellion no 600 men have stood such a shock, maintained such or der, and acquitted themselves with more honor, than the 600, of the 105th, at Per ryville. The regiment & entitled to a na. tion's plaudits, and would have had the most flattering announcement of gallant ry, but for the pro-slavery newspapers near us, who desired to advance their own friends, and had resolved that no regi ment should receive praise at their hands. if it refused fo deliver up fugitive slaves. Dear sir, had it not been known in Ken. tuckv. that the Slave hunter could not pass the lines of the 105th Ohio, the Lou isville papers would have borne Northward such an especial notice of my regiment as would have gone far to soothe the sorrows which our losses inflicted, as it is they content themselves with the single sen tence, "the 105th and 98th Ohio conduct ed themselves with great coolness." care nothing for myself, I did not come into this servive for promotion, but my gallant men, who faced death, and obey ed orders amidst the most terrible car- nage.of war's bloodiest bou-, deserve more than this passing notice. By the suffer ings of the Lexington march, and the bloody memoirs of rerryville, my heart is bound up with the interests of that gal Iant band, and it crushes my spirit to see that praise witheld from them, after they have won it at such costly sacrifice. The death of Generals Jackson and Terrill, left me in command of the 10th Division, from which I was relieved on the 18th and ordered to the command of the 34d Brigade, 1 left Crab Orchard, on that date and rejoined my brigade which I had left at Danville, on the 19th I was ordered by forced march 28 miles to Leb anon, made it in 18 hours, and on the 21st, I was ordered here via Sommerville, by forced march, all this to keep Morgan from these points. But the 105th can march now, no regiment can excel it, they have learned the secret, having made nothing but forced marches since we en tered the service. They have to day as many men as most of the new regiments, who have never seen a fight, or marched three days in suc cession. Tell the old patriots at home, to kick the cowards who have deserted us, and suspend judgement on us till those who enlisted to fight, are heard from. My brigade consits of the 105th, the 123rd and 80th, Illinois, the 101st, Indi ana, and the 19th Indiana Battery. I am commanding this Post, the most import ant bttween Louisville and Nashville, and think I shall remain here some time. The 105th", has no colors, the Government issues none, I know if thiswas understood at home, colors would be given them with "Perryville" for an inscription. We car ied a borrowed flag on that occasion and six of our color guard were stricken down. What an outrage that the army has not been permitted to vote ! It must be au thorized at once, you cannot tell the feel A. S. HALL. Pall and Extraordinary Escape. J On Thursday morning, about 11 o'clock a colored boy named Charles Brown, about 14 years old, employed at ttie Angler House, was sitting on the bannister in the fourth story of the hotel, swingiug his teet. JJy some means he over bal anced himself and fell backwards, falling headforemost down the well of the circu lar stairs. distance of fifty feet. He touched the corner of a step once in his descent, and on nearly reaching the bot tom struck the back of his head against the corner of another step. At the bot tom of the stairs, on the ground lloor, is a table where candlesticks are laced in the evening. Ou this table the boy fell, striking full on the top of his head, and bounding off to the floor, where lie lay on his face. Mr.' Bedell picked the boy up and placed him on a chair, the blood flow ing in a stream over his face and neck, and spirting out against the wall behind him. A bystander remarked that the boy's neck was probably broken, at which he put his hand up to his neck, and cool ly remarked, "I can't soe it." Then, to the astonishment of every one, tho boy got up, walked off, washed his face and head, and went about his work as if noth ing had happened. To-day he is going about just as well as ever, with the ex ception of a slight cut on the back of bis head. Brown is a remarkable lad. ' He is a na tive of this city, and when he 14th Bat tery went South he went with them as a servant to Lieutenant Smith. He was at the Battle of Pittsburgh Landing, and re mained in attendance on his master dur ing that light, as unmoved es if only on a dress parade. He came back from the South a short time since and has been in the Angier about two weeks. He says that coming down stairs at such a very rapid "double quick," and marking time with his head on the steps, will do for once.butit is hardly the thing to practice veryoften. Clev. Herald.

Our cavalry have captured a number rebels along the river below this place. Matters at New Orleans. Nov. 18. A owerful squadron was concentrating in the Mississippi. There were already more vessels at New Orleans than at any other time since its capture. A large number of river boats have been armed. There is a great activity in military cir cles preparatory to offensive movements. A general inspection of arms and men was about to taken place. Guerrillas infested the river banks above and below the city. One naval vessel has been fired into and had returned the fire with grape and can ister, but thick brushwood enabled the assailants to escape. No vessel unless well armed now leaves the city. Gen.

Are such says the New York Post, will materially affect the condition of the American press. If they continue the newspapers must either raise their prices or ston altogether. To show how works, we may say that such of the morn ing Journals of this city as have a circula tion daily of fifty thousand copies loses the recent rise, not less than one hundred and fifty thousand dollars per year. If New York daily has a circulation of one hundred thousand copies, its loss, if paper continues at present prices, would be the end of the year not less than three hundred thousand dollars. Ut course this would be ruinous to any business en terprise. No doubt the morning Jour nals dislike to raise their prices, but they must do so. unless some change takes place to bring paper back to its old price. The t-jieedy opening of the Mississippi river would probably help us to cot ton, considerable quantities, but this staple would be appropriated at once for cloths, and would effect but little the price paper for some time to come, we look more to enterprises by which other and now unused materials may be brought the service of the paper maker. Atlantic and Great Western R. R. We have already noticed the opening of this road to a point seven miles beyond Meadville, in the direction of Akron, which is expected, will be reached before the close of the year. The Atlantic and Grrat Western connects with the New York and Erie, and is in reality but an extension of that line. The capital to build it was furnished by the British bond holders of the Erie road, in order to ren der that line independent of the Lake rout, which is dominated by the New York Central. The road will shun the two leading cities of Pennsylvania Pitts burgh and Erie and is inimical to the State, Philidelphia, yet it will, perhaps, benefit Meadville and a few other villages in Western Pennsylvania, by making them way station on a great through route between' New York City and the West, and it will give an increasd value to all the land on the line of the road. Phil adelphia will also be put thereby in more speedy comumcatiou witn coin, oy ine Pittsburg and Erie road and the Philadel phia and Erie, both of which cross the Atlantic and Great Western the one near the Ohio border, and the other near that of New York State. The Pittsburgh and Erie will be purely a Pennsylvania road, and of great use to Erie, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, as well as to the coun try traversed by it. Pittsburgh Chronicle.'
