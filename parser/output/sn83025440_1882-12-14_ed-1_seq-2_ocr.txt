iifs '111 1 Yj N^-JAT. I I 1 ,toacate. CANTON, DAKOTA. C. W. HARMON, Proprietor. COMMISSIONER KAUM thinks that the receipts from internal revenue for the year, at the present rate of taxation, will be $146,000,000. He urges a re duction of at least $60,000,000 per an num in the revenue of the govern ment, leaving untouched the taxes on liquors and tobacco, but striking off the duty on sugar. 

THERE is a bill pending in congress to guarantee $75,000,000 of the bonds of the Nicaraguan Canal Company. It ought to be promptly squelched. If the ghost of the last river and harbor bill still stalks about the corridors of the house, let the ominous sound of its skeleton foot warn the defeated members not to take any stock in such expensive measures. INTEBNAL RRVEXUE COMMISSION BE KAUM is eminently sound when he recommends that there be no reduc tion of taxation on distilled ^spirits, malt liquors, tobacco or cigars. He is of the opinion that these articles of luxury should not be released that they are |proper subjects for taxation, and that there is no popular demand for their exemption. Congress will do well if it heeds Commissioner Raum's sensible advice in this respect. I A CABLE dispatch from Cairo, Egypt, eays Arabi Pasha, on trial before a military court, pleaded guilty to the charge of rebellion, and was sentenced to death. The khedive subsequently commuted the sentence to exile for life. Arabi's demeanor before the court is represented to have been dignified. The other chiefs of the late Egyptian rebellion will be similarly disposed of. It is reported that Arabia will be sent to the Cape of Good Hope. H'OME of the papers continue to speak of Senator David Davis as "Vice President." He is no more vice presi dent than is any other senator. He is president pro tem. of the senate, ap pointed to that place by his brother senators. The vice president of the United States is elected by the people of the states, and David Davis has not been so elected, and there is not a woid in the constitution or the laws which recognizes the president pro tem. of the senate as the vice president under any circumstances or contingency, what- 

ARABI KEY migkt have much worse luck. He gets off with a sentence of perpetual exile. The sentence was ap parently prearranged Arabi pleaded guilty to the charge of treason and was condemned to death by the court mar tial assembled to try him. The khe dive then commuted his sentence to im nrisonment for life. Arabi took the medicine without making a wry face. Though the khedive figured as the angel of clemency, Ihe rebel is un doubtedly indebted to the interposition of the British for his mild punishment, He will requite the favor by going to live in the British dominions. BY placing sugar on the free list, the internal revenue commissioner esti mates that the people of the United States -would realize an aggregate sav ing of about $45,000,000 per annum. That is a good recommendation. All the necessaries of life, and all articles that enter into the daily use of the peo ple, except those that are legitimately classed as luxuries, ought to be made as cheap as possible to the consum er. That is the rule which ought to guide congress in the revision of the tariff lawB. It is founded ou common sense and sonnd principles of politicil econ omy. The Sioux Indian commission is meeting with extraordinary success in treating with the bands that occupy the great reservation we3t of the Mis souri, and if their efforts are promptly seconded bj' the executive and [con gress, at least 12,000,000 acres will be added to the public domain early next season. They have already treated with three Southern agencies, and with the Indians at Standing Rock. Only three more agencies have to be seen. They found an uniform willingness among the Indians to make the con cessions asked, and a singular eager ness existing among the tribes lately wild, to profit by the advantages of of schools and to learn the arts of civ ilization. If the reeommendations of the commissioners in the directions of aiding,the Sioux to become farmers and cattle raisers are folio wed, along step will have been taken towards ren dering these troublesome wards of the government self-supporting and cut ting off tue supplies of the Indian ring. President Arthur's message to con gress contains the usual review of our foreign relation* and the department reports. Its principal featuies, which will most deeply interest the public, briefly stated, are as follows: (1) A recommendation that silver coinage be suspended (2) that exten sive reductions be made in taxation by a revision of the tariff and the abolition of all internal revenue save that de rived from distilled spirits (3) that the public debt be less rapidly extin guished than during the past year (4) that the coast defences be increased (5) that no more river and harbor bills be passed by the present session (6) that the constitution be 30 amended that the executive may disapprove of a portion of an enacted bill and that the balance of it shall Btand as a law (7) that hereafter all large appropriations be made in separate bills (7) that the navy be strengthened by the substitution of steel for iron ships (8) that methods of reviving American ship building be considered by congress (9) that the postmaster general's scheme for the reduction of postage to two cents on letters be adopted (10) that a bank rapt law be passed (11) that measures be taken to relieve the country of ''some of its alarming illiteracy (12) that congress regulate internal com merce to the extent necessary to pro tect the people from unjust discrimi nations (13) that the forests be pro tected (14) that the civil service be regulated by some law involving many of the main features of the Pendleton bill (15) that a law to prevent the levy ing of compulsory political assess ments be passed (16) that the consti tution be so amended as to fully pro vide for counting the electoral vote, and to clearly set forth the duties of a' rice president. ii telegraph ticks.

(Second Session of tbe Forty-Seventh t'onjerees-Personnel of the Two Houses—The Week a Dull One and Many Members Absent. MONDAY, DEC. 4. Senate.—No opening day of congress has been more uninteresting to the casual ob server than that of to-day. Although the city is full of strangers, the attendance at the capitol has beea about what would be found any Hay when congress was in ses sien. The chief interest centered on the senate side. Perhaps it was the new fur niture there that drew the crowd, and it may have been that strangers regarded the senators as better objects for gratify ing their hero-worshipping curiosity. The house contained so many rejected or tech nically dead members, that the capitol wags spoke of it as "the morgue." At noon when Vice President Davis rapped his gavel in the senate the galleries were thronged with a brilliant audience, many of whom had an hour before been making a pretty pictufe on the house side of the capitol. The diplomatic gallery had five occupants, two of whom were members of the Japanese Fmbassy, and on the floor of the chamber Secretary Teller and the new senator from Georgia, the Hon. Pope Barrow, were conspicuous. Don Cameron was in his seat, and seemed posing for the benefit of the galleries, unmindful of his recent Waterloo. Neither Mahone nor Wade Hampton were present to gratify the curious, and Senator Mitchell was also absent. Business began in earn est after the chaplain finished hia short prayer, Senator Hale, of Maine, opening THE 

BILL CAMPAIGN with a measure relating to pilot fees. The usual routine was then gone through with and while awaiting the return of the spec ial committee to wait on the president, Senator Ddmunds called up the calendar, The first bill considered involved a claim for a considerable amount, and was allow ed to go over till to-morrow, being BUC ceeded by a bill to restore H. M. Beebe, Jr., to a second lieutenancy in the army. Three-quarters of an hour was consumed over this proposition, which was antago nized bv Senator Edmunds, and eventual ly indefinitely postponed, after which a re' cess for half, an hour was agreed to. Pres ident Arthur's message came first in order upon reassembling, and during its read ing a majority of the senators remained in their seats. Gentleman George Pendle ton smiled serenely when the paragraph relating to his civil-service hobby was reached. Senator Brown, of Georgia, called attention to the death of his col league, the Hon. Ben Hill, and the senate then adjourned till to-morrow at 11 o'clock. 

MONDAY, DEC. 4. Huse—When the house was called to order at 11 o'clock, because the early hour of meeting was not changed through over Bight when the last session expired, the galleries, with the exception of the diplo matic one, were completely filled, but not crowded. Two hundred and ten members responded to the roll call. The most con spicuous object in the hall was the desk of the dea'l Updegraflf, late member from Ohio. Upon the black cloth rested a handsome bouquet of white flowers. Sev eral numbers had bouquets upon their desks. In many instances the flowers rep resented a tribute of respect to the mem ory of a fallen statesman. Sam Cox had in front of him a huge basket. Speaker Keifer had a satirical bouquet on his desk, cruelly made into the shape of an anchor, the emblem of hope. His desk had also been repaired so that the gavel resounded upon a solid surface instead of dully tapping on a trough of splinters. Of Mr. Keifer it is said that he only main tains order by making a noiee at his desk to drown out all opposition. He will go out of his office with the reputation of having ronnded two desk tops into bits and with having worn out two gavels. Nearly all the prominent faces were seen in the bouse collection this morning. Robeson, the rotund, was one of the earli est. He was dressed in black, with frock coat buttoned tight around his bulging figure. He carried about with him a huge pair of glasses attached to a kind of razor handle, as he went around explaining how he was left. Judge Kelly, red-eyed and grim, Kasson, the precise and diplomatic, Robinson, of Massachu setts, clean-faced and judicial, were at their desks from the first. By the side of the draped desk of the late Mr. Updegrafi sat Dingley, of Maine. Dingley has the complexion of a tallow candle. His hair, eyes, moustache and beard are as black as if painted with lampblack. By the side of the draped desk he looked like the chief mourner or an undertaker in wait ing. It was on the democratic side that one had to look for genuine cheerfulness. Over there the various candidates for the speakership were the tpecial objects. Carlisle was in his seat near the middle aisle. He was in black. His clean face showed the fatigue of his railroad jour ney, as he only arrived this morning. Randall, also in black, tilted back into his chair and leered out in his shortsighted way, shaking hands with everyone who who came near him, but never rising. Sam Cox and Bill Springer were more active, going about doing much hand shaking. Blabkburn, who has been a candidate before now, generally stands back and will support Carlisle. The one dismal face upon the democrutic side was that of Abram S. Hewitt, ong visaged, hollow-eyed and round-shoulder ed. The adviser of Sam Tilden looks the myrtyr of dyspepsia and nervousness. On the floor the liveliest scene prevailed and gr3at confusion resigned. Members went about shaking hands with great cordiality, and the BOISTEROUS HILARITY ON THE DEMOCRAT IC SIDE contrasted strongly with the more subdu ed manifestations on the republican side, giving the occasion a political tinge. The republicans, in fact, presented a fun eral aspect as a whole, which was helped out by the black-draped desk of Upde graff, surmounted by an exqusite floral tribute, and the unusual mirth of the other side. Noiv and then members gathered in little knots, loudly chaffing each other on the good and bad results of the recent election. The words "majori ty," "political cyclone," etc., afforded the galleries a clew to the subject of the con versation. RANDALL, CARLISLE. AND BLACKBCRN. When Mr. Randall entered, he was hailed by his adherents with "Good morn ing, Mr. Speaker." The officials about, the Speaker's desk repeated the salutation "Good morning, Mr. Speaker," and the object of this subtle flattery smiled com placently, as if he liked it, bowing right and left. He waa immediately surround ed by a coteiie of democratic statesmen and the leader of Pennsylvania democra cy began a laborious process of hand shaking which was only interrupted by the Speaker's gavel. It must not be un derstood, however, that Randall was the Bright, particular star. Mr. Carlisle was all the time surrounded by his admirers, who hovered about his seat and hedged him in on every Bide, while the nervous Springer, for once assiduously courted favor. The burly Blackburn seemed to act as lieutenant for his colleague, and the two were the central figures of at traction from the galleries. More re publicans clustered there than in the Randall party. It was evident to the most casual observer that the contest for the next speakership had actively com menced to-day. Mr. Rind all looked fresh and more than usually, well dresed, afiable, and confident. MB. BOBEEON'S APPEAEANCE was the signal for a good deal of good-hu mored chaffing, and this was borne by bin with joliy indifference, his cloaely-buttoD ed, rotund figure shaking occasionally at his own happy repartee. The veteran Kelley sat grimly beside the fat-faced Reed, of Maine, the outline of the two men being no greater contrast than their voicts, which rose occasionally above the din. Major Calkins, who comes into the next house by his eyelids, as it were, sat moodily apart and took little interest in the scene. Paul, the readjustee who al ways wears cheap broadcloth with the gen eral appearance of having been slept in, seemed to be contemplating his own pros pective contest in the next house. Smalls, the South Carolina negro, frisked about the fireplace on the repnblicanvide. Horr, of Michigan, had no jokes to crack, but buried himself in private correspondence. The lazy-looking Hiecock sprawled in his chair, and,Russell Erretf, looking more like BOM Tweed than ever, discussed the cam paign that left him in the lurch, rom a quiet nook in a corner. It was an inter esting sight when the gavel fell to see the statesmen hustling into their seats like schoolbojrs. No business of importance was transact ed. As soon as the clerk had finished reading the president's message the house adjourned. 

TOSSDAY, DECKMBKB 5. i- Smote.-—Sen. Beck offered a resolution setting forth the law against levying po litical assessments and instructing the ju aiciol committee to investigate bow much •'money was collected daring the recent election how it was sprat and whether there in any anrplns also, to ascertain the: number of persons dismissed from public Eervice since May and how manr of them failed to contribute. The reso lution requires the committee to report before Feb. 1st, The senate at 2 pi m., adjourned as a mark of resppct to the late Representa tives Updegraflf and Lowe. J? owe—The house accomplished noth ng. The expected raid of the high pro tective tariff men on internal revenue was inaugurated through Mr. Kelly, from the ways and means committee, who re ported a bill to abolish all internal rev enue tax on tobacco, snuff, cigars and cigarettes. Referred to the committee of the whole, and' the minority .granted leave to file their views on the subject. Andrews, of Kentucky, asked that the bill be read, whereupon Kasson, in ex planation, stated that the tax is taken ofl tobacco in all its forms, to take eflect July next: that only a small minority dissent ed from the provisions of the bill. A message from the senate announced the death of Senator Hill, and after touching remarks by Mr. Hammond, the house, as a mark of respect to the memory of the deceased, at 1:30 adjourned. WEDNEESDAY, Dec. 6. Senate—The senators did little else bat discuss the political situation and did not have a session of more than halt an hour during the day. Sen. Sherman, presented a petition of the citizens of Ohio for the passage of the bill to increase pensions to those who lost an arm or leg in the ser vice. Sen. Ingalls presented a similar peti tion from the citizens of Kassas. House—The house was worse than the senate. Here a continuous wrangle was kept up almost the entire day. Robeson, Williams, Page and others were feeling vejy mad over the recent defeat, and ap parently wanted to chastise some one for it. The only business of importance was a resolution similar to that offered in the senate yesterday by Beck, directicg the committee on civil service reform to in quire into the details of alleged political assessments ide upon government em ployes during the recent election. THURSDAY, Dec. 7. Senate—Sens. Voorhees, Sherman, Mc Dii), Ve?t, Ingalls, Chilcott and Miller, of New Yorfc, presented petitions for the passage of the bill to ircrease the pen sions of one armed and one legged roldiera. At the close of the morning hour, Sen. Beck called up his resolution for invetti gating into political assessments during the last canvass, but the republicans fili bustered and would not let it come to a vote, and the senate adjourned. House—The only work accomplished by the house was the passage of an old bill, .to re-imburse the state of Georgia in the sum 135.555 for supplies bought during the revolutionary war. FRIDAY, DECEMBER 8 Senate—At the clo3e of the morning hour, Beck called up his resolution for inquiry into political assessments upon government employes. In the discussion which ensued, Hale said the democratic party had placed wealthy men upon their committee in or der to induce them to contribute money for political purposes, and had levied large assessments upon the liquor dealers' association, and the investigation, if en tered upon at all, ought to be extended to both sides. Sen. Beck finally modified the resolu tion so as to omit the names of pension claimants, hut discussion continued until two o'clock, when the bankruptcy bill was taken up. Home—Mr. Burrows, of Michigan, from the committee on appropriations, re ported the consular and diplomatic bill Referred to committee of the whole. It appropriates $1,258,255, being $79,600 less than the appropriation for the current year, and $132,500 leas than the estimates, Burrows gave notice he would ask for ac tion on the bill to-morrow. The house, at 12:20, went into commit tee of thu whole on the private ca'endar, SOME HOME-MADE FCLFIS. KugKCBtiong of a Few Things That Any Clever 1'erson May Manufacture. From the Newark Advertiser. If a present is needed for a gentle man there is a novelty in shaving caaes, in round cardboard sides, which can be hand-painted or decorated, edged with lace or gimp and mounted upon a gilded stock, the effect being both novel and pretty. So, too, are little shaving mats, of Japanese canvas, embroidered in silks. The latest novelty in mats is that known as the "pond lily mat, which is very easily made of colored tissue paper and i3 admirably adapted as lamp mat. Different shades of green and yellow tissue paper are se lected, which are cut out in the shape of a pond lily in graduated sizes, the largest forming the foundation and the remainder being placed successively one apon the other. Theleaves are very easily curled with the fingers, result is very pretty. A pretty present for a lady is a dress ing gown, slippers and combing jacket, all en suite, of pale blue silesia. Cut cretonne roses out as a border and ap pliqua on with silk. The roses should be on the cufli, pockets and down the front. The slippers have a few rosea on the top. The shape shoald be cut at first in paper, then out of silesia and lining next applique the flowers on and then sew on the cork soles. A sachet for night dress is al3o'pretty, cut in the form of a large envelope, with a cluster ol flowers below the flap and a similar one above. This work will be found very fascinating and quite worthy the time and labor bestowed on it. A lovely cuff and collar-box, either for the use of a lady or gentleman, can be made by taking for' the foundation a square box made of heavy card board or thin wood, and this smoothly covered on the outside with velvet, plush or satin of any preferred hue. Dainty sprayes of flowera are hand painted or embroidered in graceful curves upon the sides, front and back of the box, and a prettily made bow of ribbon fastened in each upper front corner. The box is lined .with quilted satin of some delicate or bright color, ann a hollow cylinder of card-board of the depth of the box is covered with a contrasting color in plain satin and permanently fastened in a central po sition in the bottom of the box. This cylinder provides a commodius recept acle for the cuffa and the collars are ar ranged ariand it. The lid is smoothly covered and lined to correspond with the box, and a graceful cluster of flowers decorates its upper side. The bows at the back corners of the box arc formed of ties sewed to the corners of the box, and lid, thus connecting the two ornamentally in hinge fashion. Tlie National B. andE. Association. 

MILWAUKEE, Dec. 7.—At the second day's session of the national butter, chesse and egg, association, P. Hules hoff, delegate of the Russian depart ment of agriculture was introduced. The gentleman is making a tour of the country for the puipose of investigating the American system of agriculture. Jonathan Pinnion?, of Illinois, ad dressed the convention on hay and grass,: and questions butter flavor ing, which he considered due to tho kind of grass fed. The jreat reputation of Pennsylvania butter for fine flavor is owing to the grasses of that region containing ben zoic acid. The time would come when butter would be flavored artificially. Seaman, of New Fork Harris, of Stratford, Canada Seymour, of New York Bontello, of St. Louis Hoard, of Fort Atkinson, and Bunnell, of Lit tle Falls, N.

Tho woman was old and ragged and gray And bent with the chill of the winter'* day, The street was wet with a recent anow, And th* woman'f feet were aged and alow, She stood at the crossing and waited long," Alone, UDcared for, amia the throng Of human beings •who passed her by, Nor heeded tha'glance of her anxious eye. Down tbe street with laughter and shout, Glad in the freedom of ''school let out," Came the boys like a flock of sheep, Hailing the enow piled white and deep. Past the woman so old and gray Haster.ed the children on their way. Nor offered a helping hand to her So meek, 9o timid, at raid to stir Lest the carriage wheel or Ihe horse's feet Should crowd her down in the slippery street. At last came one of the merry troop— The merriest laddie of all the group He paused beside her,*and whispered low, "I'll help you across if you wish to go."

Then back again to his friends he went, His young heart happy and well content.

And "somebody's mother" bowed low her head In her bome that night, and the prayer she said Was, "God be kind to the noble boy, Who is Eomcbody son and pride and jov Harper's Weekly- THE SECOND LOVE. "Isn't she lovely?" Tom Charlesworth spoke enthusiast ically. He wa3 a nature not often stir red, but very deep and earnest and Fernand Wallace looked into his face and wondered, with a half 6mile, how it would seem to feel things below a mere surface depth. He was very handsome, this Fer nand Wallace, with soft, treacherous eyes, features like the Apollo Bolvi dere, and a lute-sweet voice and Tom Charlesworth, who read every one ac cording to the key-note of hi? own noble nature, loved him as if they had been brothers. "She's well enough," Baid Wallace, deboniarly. "Nose just a trifle too short, and the lips too full, but other wise what the world calls beautiful. So you're hard hit, my boy, eh?" "1 love her dearly," said Tom, in a quiet, unimpassioned voice that meant so much, "and, God willing, I will be a good husband to her and you'd better remain to be my best man. It's hardly worth while to return to Exeter for three weeks." "Well, perhaps your right, old fel low," said Fernand Wall ice but any one a trifle n»ore observant than Tom would have noticed that the handsome, restless eyes evaded his gaze with strange subtlety. "Do you hear, Elsie?" said Charles" worth, exultingly. "Fernand will stay to our wedding. I knew we would persuade him." Elsie Modaunt looked sudddenly up from her fancy work, and something wild and piteous in her gaze attracted Tom's attention. "Elsie, are you ill?" Elsie laughed a little hysterically. "No—whatnonsease, Tom I'm well enough. Don't get any absurd notions into your head." The night before the wedding Tom Charlesworth strode over the fields to wards Elsie's home. The little room where she was wont to sit and wait for him was dark, and the window was open.. Tom leaned his elbows on the casement and looked in. "Elsie—darling!" But there came no answer. Elsie was not there. He went around to the orthodox en trance, feeling a little disappointed he scarcely knfew why. Mrs. Mordaunt met him in the hall wtth a white, scar ed face. "Oh, MA Charlesworth, we were just going to send for you?" she cried. "To send for mel" Tom's lips blanch ed. "What has happened? Is Elsie ill?" Mrs. Mordaunts lips trembled, but gave forth no sound, as she placed in Charlesworth's hands a note stained with her own tears—a brief note writ ten by Elsie: "Don't blame me, mamma, nor let him blame me, because I could not help loving Fernand the best. Tell him not to feel bad for indeed, indeed I was not worthy of his love, and he will be happier without me—"poor Tom!" And it was 6igned with the one word, "Elsie." Charlesworth quietl gave back the note and walked forth into the starry silence of the night. No eyes but those of the All-seeing should witness the 83cret anguish of his heart? "Mother thought you would come, sir, if—if you knew how poor she was, and that fathei was dead, and—" A burst of tears checked the child's vaice as she stood, with drooping head and hands tightly clasped together, in Mr Charlesworth's library. "But my child, you have not told me who your mother is, nor who you are." "I am Margaret, and mother is is call ed Elsie Wallace." Mr. Charlesworth arose and took the child's hand in his. "Come, child, and take me to your home," was all he said. It was Elsie—pale, sallow and wan, the ghost of her former self, her voice interrupted by a cough, her hands trans parent and hot with fever—yet Elsie still. "You have forgiven me, Tom?" Oh, Tom, I could not have died without your words of pardon." "I forgave you freely, long ago, Elsie." "I have explained my folly on the altar of repentance. Oh, Tom, he was a fiend in human shape," she added shuddering, "but how—" She mutely: motioned toward the scantily furnished room, the dying fire in the grate, and the child shivering in her rags at the foot of the bed. "It is not for myself," she faltered, "Heaven knows I have not long to suf fer, and I am well inured to it but my poor little Margaret, what is to become of her?" "Shall I take her, Elsie?" "For yonr own?" "For my own." Tom answered quiet ly. MI S 'h CHICAGO, Dec. 7.—The tobacco manu facturers of Chicago held a meeting tc-day, the representatives of 2,000 operatives being present, and drew np a petition to congress asking immedi ate action on the tax question on' the ground that continued agitation WAS ruining their business and depriving operatives of their subsistence. They favor a total abolition tax, und suggest in case it is done that a Rebate be al lowed on all unbroken packages of manufactured tobacco as a matter of have neither wife nor child and for the sake of what you once were to me, Elsie, I will love the child and be kind to her." Elsie drew along sigh of ineffabe re lief, as her fevered fingers closed on Charlesworth's hand. "I can die in peace now." When the sods had been laid upon poor Elsie's coffin, Margaret came to Charlesworth's luxurious home, a 6hy, timid child, with big, hare-like eyes, and brown skin, and a nervous way of starting when anypne.spoke to her" "Margaret," said\ he/ stroking her jetty hair, "wnat shall" do with you?" "I should like to go to school," she said, wistfully "and learn te be like oth er girls. Papa always spent all the money, and mamma could never send me." "Well," said Charlesworth, "that's a very sensible idea of youra, do yon know, little girl? To school yon shall go." Three years afterward Margaret came back, royally, beautiful as Cleopatra. Mr. Charlesworth had sent a little brown irl to school, and, to his surprise a ra iant butterfly floated into his pres ence! "My little girl," he said, fairly con founded and taken by surprise, "how levely you are!" "Ami," she said, demurely, 'T »m •o clad.",, ,, "Little vanity.*' To," said Margaret, "I dont think it is altogether vanity but you know I wanted you to love me." "You have no idea of what you are saying," replied Mr. Charlesworth, half sadly. As the weeks and months rolled by the young girl became the light and sunshine of Tom's life. "Margaret," said Mr. Charlesworth, one evening, "I have found a husband for you What do you say?" "That I will take him, sir, if he is the right one," laughed the girl. Tem felt a keen pang at his hear, but he kept a brave countenance. "Well, it is Harry Montague," he said, striving to speak cheerily. "Tell him no." '"You don't like him?" "No, Mr. Charlesworth." •'But he is young and handsome." "And the man I love is not young nor particularly handsome." "Margaret are you in love?" "Yes, Mr. Charlesworth, and so are you." "You have no right, Margaret, to look into the sanctuary of my heart." "She came up to him, and, putting both her hands on his shoulders, look ed him full in the faca and said: "But suppose, Mr. Charlesworth, I looked into the sanctuary of my own heart and see your enthroned there?" "What do you mean, Margaret?" "Ah you are not so accomplished a dissember as you may suppose, sir," said the girl, nodding archly. I have discovered that you love me, but you are too modest to fancy, until I tell you so, that—" "That what, Margaret?" Pale and eager he waited for an answer. "That I love you! Oh, Mr. Charles worth, my mother's treachery blighted your youth let my love and affection atone" in this golden prime of your days." "Margaret, will you really be my wife?" "If you will have me."

Oftlrcr Clarence K. Wright, of Cltira co, Shot to l)eath While at His Cost of Maty. Officer Clarence E. Wright, of the Desplaines Street Siation, Chicago, 111., was foully murdered at 6:45 o'clock Saturday evening by a colored despe rado named Bill Allen, familiarly known as the "Colonel," whom he WJ«JB attempting to arrest. The scene of the murder was in one of the tumble-down rookeries on West Washingt©n street, near Canal street, used as a lodging house and tenement by low colored and disreputable white people. Officers Wright and T. Folev had been detailed by Captian Bonfield to assist Detective John Fletcher, the celored "fly" at Central Station, in arresting Allen, whose desperate character was only too well known by thelofficers. They were trying to get in his room at No. 97 West Washington street, and while Allen's woman, known as Annie Hut chinson, was insisting that Ailen was not there, the later suddenly threw the door wide open and fired directly at Wright, who staggered back and fell dead, with two bullets in the head. The other officers immediately drew their revolvers, and a number of &hots were sent after Allen as he went down the stairs on the jump and cscaped. An attempt was made to follow him, but without success. The body of THE MURDERED OFFICER was removed to the Desplaines street station, and on examination it was found that one bullet id entered the right temple and the other just under the outer corner of the right eye. The bullets had Loth lodged in the brain and death was almost inst-antaneoua. This was the second murderous aflray in which Allen had participated during the day, and the murder of Officer Wright resulted" from the at tempt to arrest Allen tar the fift affair. Alien and another colored man named James Smead, who had been employed on Pullman palace cars on the Ctiicago & Northwestern railroad were dis charged on the charge of stealing but ter and provisions from the Pullman company. Allen was employed as a waiter and Smead as a cook. In the same working gang with them was William Jones, a colored waiter, whom the other two suspected of being the cause of their discharge. In fact, they had but little doubt, and while Jones was at work in one of the Pullman cars at the Chicago & Northwestern depot, corner Wells and KiEzie streets, they made a murderous assault upon him. Allen haf-1 a carpenter's hammer in his hand, and he thrice struck Jones viciously with it on the head, knocking him senseless. LEATIKG HIM FOE DEAD, with a fractured skull. The murderous pair then ran out of the car and escap ed. Jones was laid out on one of the berths, and Dr. I3ham, the company physician, was immediately summon ed. In dressing Jones' injuries he took ten splinters from the wounds. The Larrabee street patrol removed the in jured man to the County Hospital, where the physicians in attendance ex amined the wounds and pronounced them exceedingly dangerous, probably fatal. Steps were immediately taken for the arrest of Allen and Smead, and the warranto intrusted to Detective John Fletcher. Not knowing Allen per sonally, though he had heard of his reckle&mess, he secured the assistance of William Hizsr, of No. 174 Harrison street, ho knew Allen, to point him out. Tbey proceeded to the locality where Allen lived, and, after a short watch, woe rewarded by seeing Allen enter the house. They saw him enter room 11, No. 37 West Washington street, and knew they had their man caged. Leaving Hizer to watch, the detective then made application to Captain Bonfield for assistance, feeling that Allen would not be easily taked and would MAKE A DESPERATE TIGHT. Officers Wright and Foley were sent, and returning to Hizer, they learned that Allen was still in the house. Leav ing Foley down stairs, Fletcher, Wright and Hizer went up stairs. Wright rapped at the door, the other two Btanding slightly to one side. The Hutchinson woman opened the door, and in response to the officers inquiry for Allen, said he was not at home. Hizer, who knew different, insisted that I he was in the room, and as the officers made an attempt te force open the door, it being then but slightly open, 1 it was suddenly thrown back, exposing Alien with a cocked revolver. He com menced firing immediately, the first two bullets bitting Wright in the head. As he staggered back he interferred with Fletcher, Hizer being unarmed sprang back as Allen continued firing and gave him a free path down stairs. Fletcher emptied his revolver after Allen but, as far as known, without ef fect. On reaching tbe sidewalk Between one and two o'clock yesterday afternoon a colored woman brought word to Jerc Mulvehili'g sa loon at 48 North Halstead street, that BUI Allen. was at WiHuun Lunbart'a house, 184 North Helstead street, and that he was getting ready to leave. The saloon man summoned his broth er Patrick, who is a member of the police force. Both armed themselves with pistols, and they hurried to the place designated. Officer Patrick Mul vehill stationed himself in front and ordered his brother to cover the rear exit. As the latter was executing the move, Bill Allen, the fugitive, who was in the kitchen, discovered he was be sieged, and, dashing to one of the win dows, fired at the saloonman. Then immediately seeing the officer ap proaching from the front he opened fire on him. SHOOTING ANOTHER OFFICER. Allen fired three times, Officer Mulvehill answering the fire. The thircfrshot from the negro's pistol buried itself over the policeman's left eye, when the negro dashed out of (he door, and although the prostrate officer I and his brother tirad at him, he escap-" ed through the gate, ran down Green street, and was lost in the Northwestern railroad yards that begin at that point. Within two minutes after this shooting the vicinity was black with people ana a score of policemen were on the spot, brought there in patrol wagons. The injured officer was at once carried to the Des Plaines street station and the officers and crowd, filled with amaze ment at this last exhibition of the des perate character of Allen, scattered in all directions in search of him. The tracks of the Northwestern and Pan Handle, railroads, which cover a large plat of ground in this neighborhood, the lumberyards at hand, the brick yards and the entire territory for blocks away swarmed with policemen and civilians from this time for an hour. The outhouses, the flag men's houses that dot the railway, and all the hiding places that could be thought of were peered into, searched and researched. The police officers took the lead with drawn revolvers, but amob hung on their rear. For an hour the search was unsuccessful. Po lice Officer Wheeler entered a large chicken-coop that stood on the edge of the Pan Handle track, not more than 300 feet from the house on Halsted street where Officer Mulvehill had been shot, and whence Allen had made his escape. DISCOVERY OF THE MURDERER. The bearch of the officer was not very thorough. He entered the coop, looked around, saw no one, and made his exit. An 'urchin who formed part of the mob following the officers enter ed the coop after the officer had made his exit. A large dry-good9 box stood in one cerner. The boy tilted it. and there was a movement. Tbe boy leap ed outside the coop in alarm and call ed the officer, who was marching away. Policemen Wheeler returned re-Entered the chicken-coop and tilted the box. There was a struggle and then Bill Allen leaped out, but while the fugitive was freeing himself from the weight of the box the officer leaped out side of the coop, slammed the door and called for aid. The negro reached the door before it was quite snut and there was a terrible struggle, but two officers wero on tho spot and Officer Wheeler with his aid closed the door. Then drawing his revolver he fired through the thin door. "I's got enough," was shouted out by the caged negro. Twice more the policeman fired when the pushing from within ceased, and the fellow was heard to fall. The door was opened and the negro was pulled out. Each shot fired through the door had taken effect, but whether he was dead or dying, no one knows certainly. So soon as the fellow was pulled out, prostrate and apparently disabled, the mob, which now num bered thousands, made a rush for the body. "Hang him," screamed a score of voices as the crowd rushed in. The officers in the vicinity gathered in, and, in the crowding and excitement that followed this rush, two more shots were fired into the body as it lay in the cen ter of the raelee. ATTEMPTING TO. HANG A CADAVER. Somebody tied a clothes-line about the neck of the negro, and the mcb tugged at it while the officers dragged at th^body. A dozen officers, wi'i their clubs, were defending the body of the prisoner from a crowd of several thousand. The officers were crowded upon so terribly that even if they had been disposed to drive off the mob .by hammeriog the skulls of those nearest them they could not have succeeded, The men nearest the body could not have retired if they desired to. A pa trol wagon filled with officers arrived and they could not reach the center of the mob for nearly an hour. This crowd, which grew angrier and angri er, surrounded the dozen or more of ficers in possession of the body, and the police on the outside tried to work their way to the rescue, without going to the length of shooting people. Upon the arrival of the Desplaines street captain the officers were ordered to draw their revolvers and the driver of the patrol wagon was ordered drive through the mob. This order was executed. The body was reached, lifted upon the patrol wagon with the rope around its neck, and a start made towards the station. The mob fol lowed, growing larger and larger every minute. Tho station was reached, the body was hastily carried within. The house was surrounded by the mob, which s'noutfed lynch him I" lynch him and became every mo ment more ard more disorderly. The announcement was made that the murderer was dead. We don't be lieveit!" was shouted back and the disorder was increased. EXHIBITING THE BODY. Finally, in order to dismiss the crowd, which was threatening trouble, the body of the dead negro was stretched out ou a board with the head at the window, and the crowd ordered to file past and view it. Police officers were sent outside to hasten along the line. For two hours a line of people passed the window at which lay tbe dead body of Bill Al ien. A single glance was allow ed and the line was kept upon a sharp walk, almost upon a trot. Then 4he body was moved from the window and the streets were cleared as well as they could be of curiosity-seekers. Ever since Wednesday night it seems that Bill Allen has been hiding in the city. He first went to 134 North Hal sted street, whence he fled just before bis death. On Thanksgiving day he told Lambert that he was not the Bill Allen who had shot Officer Wright. On Friday, however, he made a confident of Lambert, and admitted that he was the man the police were looking for. Lambert says that he must go, and up* on his going ordered his girls not to ad mit him again. He called, however, to-day, and Lambert said he was afraid to order him away. 4 1 ALLEN TURNED AND FIRED directly at Hizer, who was following^ bat did not hit him. He then ran north through the alley between Clin ton and Canal streets, and it is believed afterward got to the South through the Washington street tunnel. The police are making strenuous efforts tojeapture him, bat up to midnight had been un successsnl. As he has many friends on the various Pullman cars running out of the city, the police fear that he might have got out on one, and have telegraphed a full description of him to the neighboring cities. The murdered offlcet was a fine looking man, about 28 years old, and the picture of physical health, and though but six months on the force, had done some excellent work and gave promise of being numbered among the best men of the force. He was the son of A. L. Wright, and lived with his parents and brothora and sis ten, of whom he had eight, at No. 3885 Indiana avenue. LAXBB—THE VILLAIH8 HORRIBLE FATE. erce Fire In Lendon.

COLFAX ON LINCOLN. Home Anecdotes of the Martyred President. A touching meeting with the neat president was that after the battle of the Wilderness, when he said to Mr. Colfax, "Why are we called upon to suffer defeat after defeat, and reverse up on reverse? Could we have avoided this blood struggle? Was it not forced upon us? Will it ever, ever end?" But shortly he brightened up, saying in a less hope less tone, 

"GRANT WILL NOT FAIL UZ. On him now rests tha hope of the na tion." And a half iiour later he was tellisg stories and cracking joke* to conceal his great anxiety. Another story was of the application Mr. Colfax, then a congressman, piade for the pardon of a soldier, chuved with desertion, imprisoned in Indiana, and eentenc&d to be shot. The interview in which the request was made took place in the evening. The president Baid: "Some of my generals blame me for pardoning too many. But it rests me, when, after a hard day, I have a chance to pave some poor fellow's life," and be signed the pardon, saying: "I shall sleep happier to-night, when I reflect upon this poor soldier's joy." Si Some of the aceodotes, related were very enjoyable. One remark of Lin coln's was particularly appreciated. When he was confined to his room and threatened with small-pox, he one day said, referring to the office-seekers, "Tell them all to come now, for I have got something I can give every man of em." I 1 if The incident was told of "General" Tom Thumb's visit to the white bouse, and of his arrival at a time when sever al prominent generals were closeted with Lincoln, who, to the great surprise of his visitors, ordered the dwarf ad mitted, and began an earnest conversa tion with him. Finally, one pompoiu military gentleman marched up, and said to Tom, "Well, sir you call»our. self a general, ,but you area mighty small one." True," said the president "but, judged by the results, some of mine are still smaller." 

WNCOIJJ 8 MBBCY. Lincoln's well-known disposition to be mercirul, which prevented his sign ing the death warrant found by coartl msrtial, WAS aptly illustrated by several stories, and the facts stated that it wss for this reason that congress so mpd- ned the law toward the close of thenar that death warrants from the coarta martial oould be executed by the order of a commanding general in the add. An instance or this trait was found in the pardon of one of Butler's wo rn and. When: the condemned msaf father called at the white house to tof his son's life, the president had just re* Ceived a telegram from Generai imploring Una notto interfere with judgements of the court-martial. He would latterly ruin discipline ef tbe general's command. When this dispatch wss read to the old petitioner, he fell at tbe president feet heart-broken. Lincoln looked down at him a moment, and 5 then aefcng P*n and paper, be said: "Ben Batfer or no Ben Butler, here goes."
