AMERICAN DUTY TODAY. Today tho voters of this city will do claro whether they wnnt; tho taint of priestcraft to romnin upon the public schools of this city, or whother they want tho schools to bo vitalized by a breeze of puro and vigorous American uir. They will decide whether "a preju dice against polygamy" is a cause for criticism and obloquy, and whether a teacher is to bo denounced for having such a "prejudice." They will decide whether tho inter ests of the Mormon church nnd the bo gus claims of tho priesthood of right to meddlo with and mar tho public , schools, shall prevail or bo stamped out. They will decide whether or not the schools shall bo made purely and wholly institutions of education and learning, or shall bo tho vehicles through which prejudice in favor of outgrown condi tions shall be kep alive. Thoy will decido whether or not it is obnoxious for teachers to stand by and uphold tho law, and whether they shall be denounced and reviled for not teaching lawbrcaking and breach of faith. It is of tho utmost importance that the people of this city shall vindicate the true office and purpose of tho pub lic schools. These must no longer bo at the service of tho lawless and lecher ous leaders of a sect, but must be tho pure and undented source of instruc tion whence shall come stalwart, honest minded, law-abiding, patriotic citizen ship. There is an irrepressible conlli'ct "be tween the reactionary element hero and the progressive element. Tho reac tionaries desire things that would crip ple tho schools, and make tho vast sums applied to their support a vain tax up on the community. Tho progressive citizens desire to have tho schools brought up to the highest standnrd of efficiency, and kept there, without any intrusion upon them of sectarian teach ing influences or overshadowing de pression; they deplore the black inti mations in the background, that the teachers must- make themselves ac ceptable to the lawless and lecherous "persons of prominence" who insist upon having their views recognized and upon the tolerance of their iniquities. Tu proportion as these iniquities are great, those guilty of them must keep their hands off the schools and their evil counsol out of ihem. The patriotic, earnest people of this city should rail- unanimously to the support of the American schools' today. They should wipe off the tarnish that evil influences have besmirched them with in this city. They should make this city a congenial homo to the re fined, pure-minded, skillfully trained teacher, whether of home breeding or of Eastern or "Western training. , Let the schools be tho best, the highest, the most loved and best guarded of our public institutions, and all will be well. THE BOAST AND .THE MOTIVE. The organ of the Mormon church is constantly disparaging the motives which actuate the men and women of Uiah who demand the enforcement of tho law, the keeping of the pledge made to the Nation, and the duo observance of the plain letter and spirit of the Con stitution of this commonwealth. In any other community in' tin's' country the motives of men whose struggle is to this end would not be questioned, for the work itself is ample proof of the propriet- of purpose which animates it. If perchance in any other State, a pub lic journal or preacher should deride the motives of the men who are stand ing for Constitution, law, and sanctity of covenant, such derision would be im mediately visited by public condemna tion pronounced upon its author. Uore, however, the "Dcseret News, appealing to its own class alone, is tbjo to mys tify things and to sustain the belief of its dupes by its incossant' falsehood to 'the effect that the opponents of law breaking are engaging in a work of persecution' of others for their own ad vancement. And this basic error lies at the bottom of mnch of Utah's trou ble. For tho bravo men and the splendid women who have risked -much in tho controversy in Utah to secure a bettor order of things, no apology or defense is f needed. Their work is known to conscientious and intelligent people and is supported as a labor of sincere de votion lo the public weal. The mero fact that they do not parade their mo tives in high sounding phrase, con stantly declaiming of their own holi ness and their love for their fellow men, does not detract from the sanctity of that work. It is a poor public causo which must bo protected by the inces sant boasting of its dovotoos. A war of righteousness conducted to nttnin righteous ends in a righteous way needs none of the sanctimonious profession which the hj-pocrite uses for tho pur pose of misleading., Leave that' kind i of cheap mothod to tho Dcsorot News, to Joseph P. Smith, to the law-breaking crowd in gonornl and tho covenant breakers in particular. It is enough for tho Amorican uion and womon of tho community to make their fight for civic uplifting; thoy uro merely performing their duty as men and women; and in the years to como the self-sacrifice and tho dovotion which aro incident to the full observnnco of that duty will bo known and cstoomed. Joseph P. Smith boa3ls in pulpit and in public print that if there is a man in tho world possessing more of the spirit of God than ho himself docs, he would like to soo that man meaning thereby that he novor heard of such a person and docs not believe that ono exists. Thai, sort of blasphemous self praise is necessary for the chief hier arch who breaks tho laws of God and man dcfiantl' and is characteristic of the cult of which he is the leader. Thoy arc obliged to cover their evil motives 1)3 a protended sentiment of holiness; while tho men whoso work is really for tho good of the world can afford to leave that work to speak for itself. ASPERSING COURAGE. As was expected when J. P. Gibbs wrote his letter to Tho Tribuno in which ho announced his dovotion to tho American party, an insidious attnek is being mado upon him by tho secrot servico of tho Mormon church. Ho has boon charged with turning his back upon tho religion of his parents, with having -cast aspersion upon tho priest hood of his church, with having vio lated tho sacred covenant of socroey which ho voiced in some eacrod place. It is insinuated against him that ho was unworthy of membership iu the church and that he should havo been cast out from its communion long ago. As a final, conclusivo and utterly an nihilating argumont against him the inquiry is made: "Do you want to fol low an utterly unknown, unimportant and useless croaturo like Gibbs or tho prophet of Almighty God?" It is noticcablo that in these various assaults upon Mr. Gibbs thero is no successful attempt to controvert any one of his statements of fact nor is thero any logical escape from his ar gumont and his terrific arraignment of tho falsifying, law-breaking priests of tho church, nor is there nny real an swer to his sublimo appeal for honor and integrity in political and commu nity affairs. Ho stands hej'ond the roach of his dotractors, but tho coward ly whisper goes out just the same. And what does it amount to? First, tho chnrgo Hint Mr. Gibbs has depnrtcd from tho religion of his pa rents tho Mormon faith by joining tho American pnrt-y, is a distinct ad mission that in the Mormon church view politics and religion aro one, with tho creed as the one. - The very asser tion, authoritatively made, that a man cannot exorcise his political-froedom without religious apostacy is proof of the entire charge mado against tho hierarchy. Furthermore, if it bo rep rehensible to depart from the faith of one's parents, what shall bo said of the founders and many of tho shininc lights of Mormonism, who not only left the churches in which their parents held membership, but immediately turned on those churches and announced them as being the machinery of the devil apostate from God and His truth and destined, with all tho people who belong to them, to meet tho oler nal fate of the wicked? If it were not such a sorrowful evidenco of imbo cilitj', it would bo amusing to hear somo of the Mormon priests advising the young peoplo that common decency nnd loyalty rcquifo them to stand by the religion of their parents right or wrong when, in many instances, theso same priests havo deserted the religion of their own fathers and mothors and have devoted their. lives to abuso of tho churches and the faiths to which their parents had given years of devotion. Mr. Gibbs is not the originator of the aspersion upon tho priesthood of tho church. Ho has simply denounced tho c'hiofs of ' the-hierarchy with violation, of tho law and their covenant, and in doing so he has but to quoto the sworn testimony of Joseph F. Smith and others. Neither ho nor any one else is able to add one jot or tittle of in fanvy or aspersion to tho boasts and confessions of tho prophets, seers, and rovelators themselves. Think of this kind of confession from a .pretondo'd prophet, and then ask yourself, intelli gent render, if an' one could asperse such a creature! In the Smoot investigation at Wash ington, when Joseph F. Smith was on the witness siiaud under oath, tho fol lowing colloquy occurred, as shown by tho official report: Mr. Taylor But do you mean to say you, nt your pleasure, obey or disobey the commands of Almighty God?' Joseph V. Smith Yes, sir. Mr. Tayler Communicated to you? Joseph F. Smith L obey or disobey at my will. Mr. Tayler Just as you please? Joseph F. Smith Just as I please. That is tho nice, sclf-Bacrificing, gen tle Christian whom Gibbs is charged with aspersing. As to tho insinuation that Mr. Gibbs has betrayed confidences reposed in him, thero is not the slightest, evidence of the fact, so far as the public has learned. What makes the priests so fearful that somo. man from within the church will tell what ho knows? Mr. Gibbs has loo much self-respect to violate his own word of honor, and thero can be no reflection upon him for anything he has said. If the deeds and words of the priests have been so dark and wicked that it injures them to havo tho world know qf their utterance and action, surely tho fault is not with Mr. Gibbs for ho has, been . a protest ant against evildono under religious. guise. This and no moro is his respon sibility in this respect. J. F. Gibbs was warned, by men who had walked tho red-hot plowshares, of tho fato which awaited him if he darod to assort- himself' ao a citizen in this community. Charles A. Smurthwnilc told Mr. Gibbs in detnil of the barba rous treatment accorded to him by the chief hierarch, bocnueo ho would not submit his business affairs to the con trol of a falso prophot who sought to immolate Smurthwaito and Taylor's salt works lo make gain for his own monopoly. Mr. Gibbs know that ho would bo traduced; ho knew that tho anathoma of priestcraft would bo pro nounced upon him; ho knew that every insidious agency of tho church would bo set in operation to injure his re pute, to ostrncizo him in society, to destroy" his worldly welfare, and to make of his manly struggle for freedom a crucifixion. But he did not falter; ho met his fato with unsworving eyes; and although ho niny bo pursued by all tho hateful vindietivoncss which priest craft can direct, he is doubtless a hap pier man evon in tho midst of his suf fering that ho would havo been to re main a silent defender of a lie and tho passive supporter of blusphemous law brcaking by sonsunl priosts, who uso the name of . God with which to servo tho devil. A few moro men liko Mr. Gibbs, out spoken as he, nre needed in this hour of Utah's woo. Thousands there arc who believe as he, hundreds thero aro who speak his sentiments in private conver sation; and all that is requisite is that from among these shall emerge a band of heroes who will dare to speak the truth in tho very teeth of tyranny as thoy fool that truth in their inmost souls. THE ANNUAL REVIEW. The annual review and tho annual prognostication which taken together constitute tho usual Presidential mes sage, although a weariness and vexa tion of spirit to many people, arc wor th' of careful consideration. The -document which just comes from tho Whito House is quito up to tho usual order. It will repay perusal and it should be carefully preserved as a comprehensive showing of tho current trend of tho countr'. The Presidential opinions are so well known and this message so closely fol lows his former public utterances on subjects of importance that the reader will find nothing to startle., while much to interest his attention. After commending the work of tho present Congress so far. President Roosevelt recommends legislation pro hibiting political campaign contribu tions by corporations, a subject upon which probably, a majority .of- citizens are affirmatively agreed. To tho pro posal for a law conferring upon . tho Government tho right of appeal in criminal cases on questions of law Mr. Roosevelt devotes considerable atten tion, relating recent experiences in tho rebating cases and pointing out tho practice of setting aside judgments upon tcchnicalitj'. He opposes tho abolition of the injunction in labor oases, but ) recommends safeguards against an abuso of the power of courts in this direction. A preventive against lynching is suggested in swift, orderly punishment of known crime by law , and the avoidance of unnecessary legal delay. As to tho difficulties nrising between capital nnd labor, the Presi dent holds agitators and h3'sterical preachers of discontent to be largely responsible. He urges that tho hours of railroad emplo3'ees be regulated .by law and the gradual and general intro duction of the eight-hour day for all workingmen, and ho advocates a thor ough investigation of child labor and the labor of women. Ho also advises that tho emplo3'ers' liabilit' law should be mado lo plae th.e entire risk of the trade upon tho emplo3er, so that the entire communit should bear the bur den in the added cost to tho people of trnde production. Retention of coal Innds 1)3' the Government and their working b3 private individuals on a ro3'aliy basis is advocated, involving the withdrawal of these lauds from sale or entr3r. The Presideut believes in the good effects to be expected from the rate law and the pure food law, but considers that perhaps the practical operation of, these should be awaited in order to tost the expediency of such legislation. Graduated inheritance and income taxes aro advocated as a meth od of equalizing to a considerable ex tent tho burdens of government. Tech nical . and industrial training, agricul ture, irrigation and forest preservation aro treated along tho lines of alrcan.y established polic3 A National mnr riage and divorce law under a Consti tutional amendment is proposed. Tn this connection tho President alludes to pol3'gani3'and advocates tho care of this question b3 "the Federal Govern ment (belioviug that it should not. be left to tho' several Slates), regnrdloss of whether a Constitutional amendment shall bo carried to cover tho cntiro questions of marriage and divorce Tho Mossage makes no direct refcrenco to Mormon church, poiygani3- by name, but. unquestionabb' it is intended to cover this especial subject. There will bo much local congratulation to find tho President so clear on this matter. JSvidcntVy he has seen a great light. Hereafter it will scarcely lie in the power of tho hicrarchs to use his great name as a shield for thoir infamous practices. The development of Ameri can shipping is asked for; and curren cy refrom is spocinlly urgod, but the President does not put forward an3' particular plan to this end, except as his. mention of .the Rcheme of the pres ent; Sccretaiy of tho Trcasur- ma3r bo considered . to bo a, recommendation. Ho- cither wauls a tariff law or abso- lute free trade for tho Philippines, and devotes attention to Porto Rico, Ha waii, Alaska,' and Cuba, reviewing tho into American intervention in tho last named conntiy. Our foreign relations are all friendl3' and the United Statos navy is designated as the surest guar antor of peace. The Message is characteristic of its riuthor discursive and outspoken. Mr. RooRovolt is recognized 1)3' his admirers aa being competent in nearly all the departments of human experience, and ho evinces his confident acceptance of this high opinion by tho decisive way in which ho determines in this Mes sage all tho problems of our National life. IT 

DOES KNOW. The organ of tho Mormon church insists that it does not know of pol3'gamous marriagos with the sanc tion of tho church since tho mani festo. This denial of knowledge it makes in answer to tho assertion of Tho Tribune that the Deserct News was full awaro of the frequenc3 of plural marriages within the church, and with the support of tho hierarch-, sinco tho manifesto. Out of innumerable cases it 13 onl3' necessar3' to quoto ono to demon strate that tho Doscret News falsifies when it denies guilt3' knowledge. Tnko tho combined case of Apostles John W. Taylor and Matthias F. Cowlc3 The Descret News knows that these men each entered into plurul ninrriages after tho promulga tion of the manifesto, and after the petition for amnesty was issued, and after that amncBt' was granted. Tt is well aware that theso new mar riages woro known of tho hierarch', and it knows that theso men were sus tained in their positions as prophets, seers, and rovelators, and as members of the apostolic quorum. Thq News knows that, notwithstanding their law brcaking, theso two men wore up held as promulgators of the word of God; as men whoso precopt was to bo obo3,ed,and whoso example was to bo followed by the members of tho church; nnd that no action was takon against them until after tho world found out their offenses and' charged tho church with rosponsibil-, j-ear in and year out, in conference after conference, theso men were sustained in their high positions, and it was only when Reed Smoot 's seat in tho Scuato was imporiled that the' wero dropped from their apostolic nuthorit3'. This case, therefore, is sufficient to disprove the claim of ignorance put forth 1)3' the Deseret News. But thero are scores of others. The Tribune did not overstate tho case when it as serted that since the manifesto, and until the American part3' began its active warfare against it here, polygam' in the Mormon church wns agniu rampant. The church has never initiated any proceedings against nny man. ongnging in new pol-gamy; it has never punished any such individual "03" excommunication, and it has taken cognizance onl' in the cases of Ta3'lor and Cowlc-. and that at a belated hour and for tho palpable purpose of protecting Smoot. THE UTAH MINING MAN. Salt Lake obtains treble advantage from the operation of the mines and smelters within the borders of this State and from the operation of mines owned 1)3' Salt Lako people in contigu ous tcrritor3'. This great combined in dustr3' opens an cxtiaustless field for emplo3'mont of labor. Not an industri ous or ablo-bodied man who must beg in vain for work and wages. That is the primar3' good which conies from our greatest industry-. Second-, the divi dends which result from the successful operations largely reach the Salt Lake banks and pass into circulation here. Thirdb', tho Salt Lake mining men aro lo3al to Salt Lako and the3' expend their mone3' here upon substantial busi ness propert3, upon beautiful residences and upon tho maintenance of cultured home living. Unlike somo of our neigh boring States whose rich men havo car ried their wealth away to squander in New York and Paris, the profit-gaining Utah raining man is a profit-sharing Utah citizen, loj'al to the city and the State, and he gives back to the State tho benefit of the wealth which he draws from its bosom. After Nevada had produced one and one-half billions of precious metals, her assessed valuation was only twenty three millions of dollars; that was be cause her rich men. sent awa- their riches as thoy oxtracted them, and when the stream became feeble they followed their money olsewhere. But U'tnh holds her own; 'and holding her own, there is the great certainty that the State and the cit3' will go on multipl3ing in wealth and grandeur so long as the product of Utah mines is held here by Utah's loving and lo3'al men, TO SATISFY A GRUDGE. Sir Thomas Lipton. apropos of bach elorhood and marriage, said in an after-dinner speech in Chicago: 'Bachelors, I admit, aro villains, but it is a shame to play such tricks on them as it is customarv everywhere to do. "A nasty' trick: was. plaved on a bachelor friend .of mine at a "dance. A lady was reproaching, him- for never having married, when her husband, a little bored, perhaps, said grufflv: " 'Ho 9a-s he :could liave cut me out and married you if he had wanted lo. ' , "Tho lady started. "'Indoed!' she cried. 'Why didn't he do it, then?' " 'Ho snj-s ho owed mo a grudge,' the husband explained with a chuckle." Rhyollte Excursion. Only $25.00 round trip.

The Swiss' public and press aro aroused at the extraordinary action of a magistrate presiding at tho criminal session at Weinfoltten, in tho commune of Thurgoris, who has sentenced a child barelv three years of ago to throo and a hnlf months' imprisonment for fhett.. The child, who is the son of a labor er, saw somo penny toys dnngling from tho doorway of a shop. He seized two of them and took them home, and an hour later was "arrested" by a tall gendarme on a charge of theft. In response lo the magistrate s ques tions the little fellow laughiugh' admit ted that ho look the toys. Ho could not speak plainl', and, it was with dif ficulty that the gendarme, who acted as intermedial'', was mafic to understand that he wanted thorn, "as ho did not have any tovs like other boys." "Three and a half months' imprison ment," said tho magistrate, sternly. The gendarme, who was much affect ed, carried tho child out of the dock and placed him in the arms' of an as tonished warder. 

FISH IN INCLOSBD WATERS. 3'hlladclphla Record. Mnuy people, not without education and a general knowledge of natural history, aro m-stificd by tho presence of fiefi in inclosed waters. For man' years thero was open-mouthed wondor over tho perch, bream and cra3'fish found in the ncwl3'-cut dams near tho Marguaric river in New South "Wales. In somo cases tho water had scarce' settled after the rain had filled the dam than the fish were observed, and the Australian farmers started a theor- of spontaneous production. This ob tained, and gained wide credence until a Sydney professor chanced to pick up a wild duck nnd found its brenst feath ers and webbed feet well dotted with fertile and almost hatched fishova, on which the "spontaneous production" theory was promptly withdrawn. A FUTURE STYLIST. Kansas City Star. This editorial from the weekly paper of the Missouri University shows what higher education docs for 'lucid writers: "Somotimcs during the 'car there arise certain occasions whose circum stances are peculiar in that all of them forco the onlonlicr to the same conclu sion. That is, a person is not enabled to consider the various phases of such questions, and then announce it as his belief that the matter has two sides, and that as such is tho case he intends keeping the affair off his mind as much as possible. On the contrary, this typo of situation can allow of but oue opin ion, for the reason that ever motive exists for adopting one course as right, and decrying tho other as wrong." SQUTBREL ROBBED THE MAIL. St. Paul Dispatch. Tho robbing of the United States mail by a squirrel was a most unusual incident which occurred in Winona. Martin Daszkowski, one of the oldest mail carriers in the city,, was on his regular rounds and had among his mail to be delivered an advertising card to which was attached a large walnut, in side of which was the matter adver tised. A little squirrel, of which there are many in Winona, seeing the nut, jumped upon Mr. Daszkowski s should er and, running down his arm with lightning speed, took the nut and card from his hand and then climbed a uearb' tree, where it investigated tho contents of the nut. Fortunatcl-. upon discovering that the nut was not the kind it wanted, the squirrel dropped it and the card without damaging either and they were later delivered to the proper address.

Philadelphia North American. The most polite man has been found in Robert Wilder of Clarksburg, W. Va. He has never been known "to say a cross word to auybody, and he is re spected highly by his relatives, which is saying a great deal. When Wilder was held up bv a high wayman near Dugan's dam. Mr. Wilder handed over $13.25 and apologized for not having more with him. Wilder "smilos when a person tramps on his corn, and congratulates his wife on her discernment when she calls him names. Taken ill one dav, he insisted upon telephoning the undertaker, expressing regret at the trouble he might causo him. LOVING KINDNESS. Independent. My doc tried to bite me.
