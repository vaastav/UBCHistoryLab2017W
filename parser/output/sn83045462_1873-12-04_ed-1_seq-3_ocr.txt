EVENING star CWMBT ft. HIITB. Ur?fst Circalitiow ia the District Beading Matter on Every Page. WASHINGTON CITY: 1 HIKKBAT ItfrfmbtT I, 1H7?. The Presiiient's message seems to be rather exceptionally well received by the pre*-*, though there I* conriderable discrepancy of ojenion u to the points in It most worthy or commendation. The New York Tim't retard* the financial portion as being most deserving of approbation, and says no one expected that cen. Crant would discuss the subject from the standpoint of a theorist, and he does not, but '?a remarkable pertinence and directness are noticeable in hi* suggestions, and his principles are extremely sound " The Tribimt, on the other hand, does not And much to endorse in the President's financial riews, bat concedes that the President represents the Cuban case "very fairly, and treats it with such dignity and calmness as will meet the approval of Congress and the people.'' The H-ral'i regards the mes sage in the light of a dispassionate record, and believes it was written simply for the purpoeeof I refenting, as briefly a* deemed possible. the Acts of the Administration during the past year, and the legislative measures which the Kxeeu tive thinks necessary or expedient upon our foreign and domestic affairs for the general welfare, and having thus discharged his duty, with his mind relieved, he leaves the work sug gested to the consideration and the discretion of Congress. The AVa naturally has no admi ration to bestow upon anything coming trom the President, hat admits that it presents "a lair view of the condition of the different de partments of the Government." The Philadel phia Prtst praises the condensation shown in the message, "considering how much the Presi dent hail to say," and says "it is a satisfactory s'ewanlship on the whole, and he givesauthori ty to what was previously believed."' The Rich mond Ih'pa'cA says the President "seems to be anxious to do his duty," but that "his failure to refer to Louisiana stands in striking contrast to his solicltnde for the negroes in Cuba, who are not more truly deprived of their rights than are the white people of Louisiana." The Baltimore Sun notes as an unusual omission that the mes sage contain* no allsion t > Divine Providence. #?? ? It is im|K>rtant in every aspect of the case i that the name of Georgetown should be merged and extinguished in that of Washington. The two cities are one and should be one in name. Georgetown having ceased to l?e a separate mu nicipality and forming now an integral part ut' . the city of Washington, governed by the same laws, an l represented by the same constituted authorities, and every day becoming more and more identified by the increasing facilities of . transit and inter-communication, this nominal distinction is a positive and manifest disadvan- ' tage in manifold respects. It is opposed to a thorough and cordial unity and fusion of social and commercial interests. It creates a vague idea of diversity in substance, as well as in form, fosters a sentiment of local estrangement ; and rivalry, and repels the inri'ix of population trade and wealth. It reduces Georgetown to a suburban grade and obscurity, to a sort of t'rra incognita to the world at large, while she is justly entitled to a share of the civic rank and prestige of the national Metropolis, and to be endowed with its postal and all other incidental benefits. It re-iuires the supreme authority of , Congress to etlect the new baptism with this il lustrious and venerable name. Minor details may safely t>e left to the legislature of t ae Dis trict. The popular voice is unanimous In rop TitfU of the proposition. Murmurs of dissent t-OTn the iiffice-holder*. of course, are to be ex. lH, ud. Prompt and decided action before Congress is necessary by the friends ot the i measure. ? . i Housekeepers in this se -tion, where anthracite coal is much u>ed for domestic purposes, will be ; glad to bear from Pennsylvania that the coal < combination is said to be breaking up. A special to the New York Tim's from Phila delphia siys that the disturbance in the com bination is owing to the declaration of inde pendence by the Pennsylvania Coal Company, a powerful corporation, which controls almost exclusively the Pittston coal region. The Penn sylvania company, although not properly be longing to the coal league, has always combined with it so far as prices were concerned, but has now made a reduction of fifty and sixty cents in all sizes ot coal for December, while the other companies connected with the combina tion hold to the prices made in October?the figures being neither increased nor lowered. Combining this with the fact that the trade Is unusually dull for the season, those best informed say that there must be a reduction of prices at an early date, and a consequent breaking up of the combination. As >ome indi cation of the coming collapse, the Philadelphia ?Dd Heading Company, which has been recog nized as the leader of the combination, has announced a partial closing of their collieries in Schuylkill county, as well as a reduction of ten per cent, in the wages of all the employes of the company. There is a disposition on the part of many democratic journalsof influence in Virginia to treat President Grant fairly, and to give him proper crcdit for the desire on bis part for the restoration of perfect good feeling between all ftectionsof the country. The Virginia Sentintl, a conservative journal, takes the Petersburg It.-lrx an*t An#cl to task for its arraignment of the President and his administration because of the anest in Montgomery county. Virginia, recently, of certain parties charged with vio lating the election laws. After saying that the administration was, probably, no more respon sible for those arrests than the writer of the strictures himself, th3 S*nfiw</adds: ??Let the .1 jj*eJ seek other cause of 'tu^rrel. Or. rather, let it condemn the unjust judge or wooden headed jury who encourage these thing* but, at the same time, rerl ict that such cases of inuividual outrages will continue to happen everywhere, but that the rulers, who exc< ute laws, art* not res|>onsible for them. And let it thus seek to allay the bad pa?sion?, which cause them, and uphold the President in his desire and purpose, which he has plainly indi cated, to wipe out the rankling memories which encourage and promote them." ___ ? ? ? The experiment of woman suOrage In Wyo ming territory is prononnced a success by hlgU authority. Gov. Campbell, in his late animal message to the Legislative Assembly, tha* gives the measure his unqualified indorsement: "The experiment of granting to woman a TOice in the government, whicn was inaugu rated lor the tirst time in the history of our rcuntiy. b\ the Legislative Assembly of Wyo jis;, fas uow been tried for four years. 1 have heretofore taken occasion to evpress my views in reg-aru to the wisdom and justice of this meas ure and my conviction that its adoptiou had been attended oi.'v by good resalts.
