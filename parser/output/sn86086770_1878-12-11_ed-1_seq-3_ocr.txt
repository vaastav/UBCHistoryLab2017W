THK SOUTHERN QUESTION. The permanent paclfleatlon of the country by the , ..aiplete protection of all citizens In every civil .mil political right, continues to be of paramount interest w ith the great body of our people. Kvery 4.. p in tills direction is welcomed with public ap proval ami every Interruption of steady and mii ;mi progress to tbe desired consummation awakens general uneasiness and wide-spread con iiMiaation. The recent congressional elections e furnished a direct and trust worthy test of the .ilvaneethus far made in the practical establish ment of the right of suffrage, secured by the con 'Utiithm to the liberated race In the south ern states. All disturbing Influences real t imaginary had been removed from all of these 'talcs. The constitutional amendments, which con t rr.'.l freedom and equality of civil and political lights upon the colored people of Iho South, were i.lopted hy the concurrent action of the great body fgood citizen who maintained the authority of mi ' aal government and the integrity and perpetuity ! the union at such a cost of treasure and life, as a vhe and necessary embodiment in the organic law of ■■ ited results of the war. The people of the former • :iv."holding stales accepted these results and gave a, .-very practicable form assurance that the iffth, dill and loth amendments and laws passed in pur - nice thereof should, in good faith, be enforced rig mid .impartially, in letter and spirit, to the end that the humblest citizen, without distinction uf ra . or color, should, under them, receive full and ■ pul protection in person and properly and in po i. al rights and privileges. Hy these constitutional mini.lnn nts the southern section of the union ob imii 'Ja large increase of political power in congress and in tin-electoral college, and the country justly ex -1 I T that elections would proceed as to the en frati. lilsed race upon the conditions of legal and lehunional freedom anil protection which obtained ther states of the union.

I can but repeat what I said in this con ne.-tion in my last message: that whatever au tbority rests with me to this end 1 shall tint hesl it'' lo pm forth, and I am unwilling to forego a •enewcii appeal to the legislatures, the couits, 'lie executive authorities, ana the people of the -'.i'es where these wrongs have been perpetrated. flour assistance towards bringing to Jus /" the offenders, and preventing a repetition of • rimes jto moans within my power will be S ired to obtain a lull and fair investigation of .ii' H. .-red crimes, and to secure the conviction I, ‘ l ’ ion punishment of the guilty. ■ ' -to he observed that the principal appropri .'

Our p*'Pupation in this international competi tion ror the favor and the trade of the world may be expected to produce useful and important re sults in promoting intercourse, friendship and commerce with other nations. THK INTBKNA IONAL SILVER CONFKBEKOE. In accordance witn the provisions of the act of congress of Feb. 28, JBTB. three commissioners were appointed to an international conference on the subject ol adopting a common rate between go and and silver. for the purpose ol establishing internationally, tho use of bimetallic money and seeming flxlly of relative value bet ween these metals. Invitations wore ad dressed to the various governments which had ex pressed a wililtignes* to pai tbdpate tn Its delibera tions. The conference had Us meeting In Pai ls In August last The i eiKirl of the commissioners here with submitted will show its results. No common rates between gold and stiver could be agreed upon by the conference. The general conclusion was reached that It la necessary to maintain In the world the monetary functions of silver as well as of gold, leaving the selection of the use of one or the other cf ihesetwo metals or of both to be made oy each stale. THAT LITTI.K W..W0.000. Congress having appropriated at its last session the sum of s.Vk*i,(kK to pay the award of theioint rommiss on ;it Halifax; Its after correspondence with the British government on the subject of the conformity of the award to the requirements of the treaty and to the terms of the question the ehy submitted to flie commission, the president shaft deem it his duty to make the payment. Com munications upon these points were addressed to the British government through the legation of theC.S. at London failing to obtain the eoneur rence of the British governn cut In the views of this government respecting the award, I have deemed It my duty 10 tender the sum named wMi In the year fixed by the treaty, accompanied by a notice of the grounds of the payment and a pro test against any other construction of the same, The curies pun d‘e nee upon this subject will belaid before you. END OF THE CUBAN REBELLION. The Spanish government has officially nnnouuced the termination of tic insurrection in Cuba and tin* restoration of peace throughout that island. Couth derl expectations are expressed of a revival of trade and piosperity, which it is hoped may prove well founded Numerous claims of American citizens for relief for injuries or restoration of properly have been among iho incidents of the long continued hos tilities. 80me of these claims are in-process of ad justment by Spain and the others are promised early ami careful consideration. THE TREATY WITH ITALY. Tim treaty made with Italy in regard to reciprocal consular privileges lias been duly ratified and pro claimed. OTHER POWERS. No questions of grave importance have arisen w ith any other of the European powers, THE JAPS. The Japanese government has been desirous of a revision of such parts of its treaties with foreign powers as relate to commerce, and, it Is understood, has addressed to each ot the treaty powers a request to open negotiations with that view. The V. 8. gov eminent has been inclined to regard th matter fa vorably, Whatever restrictions upon trade with Ja pan are found injurious to that people cannot but affect injuriously nations holding commercial inter course with them. Japan, nftei a long period of se clusion, has, within the past low years, made rapid strides in the path of enlightenment and progress, a* and not unreasonably is looking forward to the time when her relations with the nations of Europe and America shall be assimilate 1 to those which they hold with each other. A treaty looking to this end has been made which will be submitted for tie* con sideration of the senate. THE CHINESE. After an interval of several years, the Chinese gov ernment has again sent envoys to the t inted States. They have been received and a permanent legation is now established here by that government It is not doubted that this step will be of advantage to both nations in promoting friendly relations and re moving causes of difference. SAMOAN ISLANDS. The treaty with the Samoan Islands has been duly ratilied and accepted on tho part of both piv eminent* and is now in operation and a survey and soundings of the harbor of Sego Pago have been made by a naval vessel of the United rtatea, with a view of the United dates occupation as a naval sta tion, if found desirable to the service. MEXICO. Since the resumption of dlplouialie relations with Mexico correspondence has been opened and still continues between the two governments, upon the various questions which at one time seemed to en danger their relations. While no formal agreement hasbeen reached as to the troubles outlie border much has been done to repress and diminish them. The effective force of United stales lioopson the Hlotirande by a si rlet and faithful eontplianee with Instructions has done much to remove the source of dispute, and it Is now understood that a like foree of Mexican troops on the other side of the river is also making an energetic movement against marauding Indian tribes. This government looks with the greatest satisfaction upon every evidence of strength In the national authority of Mexico, and upon every effort put forth to prevent or pun ish iueurslims upon our territory. Iteluetaut to as sume, any action or attitude for the control of these Incursions by military movements across!he border not Imperatively demanded for protection of 11 v cs and property of our own citizens, I shall take the earliest opportunity consistent with the proper discharge of this plain duty, to recognize the abil ity of the Mexican government to restrain effect ively violations of our territory. It Is proposed to hold next year an International ex hi It lon In Mex ico, and it Is believed Dial the display of the agri cultural and manufacturing products of Urn two nations w ill tend to a better understanding and In creased commercial Intercourse between lltelr people. SOUTH AMERICAN STATUS. With llrazil and the republics of Central and South America, some steps have been taken toward the development of closer commercial Intercourse. Diplomatic relations have been resumed with Co lumbia and witli Jlolivia. A boundary question between the Argentine Hepubllc and Paraguay, has been submitted by those govern ment* for arbitration to the president of the United Stales, anil I have, after careful examina tion, given a decision upon It. A naval expedi tion up the Amazon and Madeira rivets nas brim'lit back information valuable both for scientific and commercial purposes. Alike expe dillon is about visiting the coast of Alnca and the Indian Ocean. The reports of diplomatic and consular officers In relation to the development of our foreign commerce hate not only furnished many facts that have proved of public interest, but have stimulated to practical exertion tne en terprise of our people. THE THE A SL'itS It'S KKI’OUT. The report of the secretary of the treasury fur nished a detached statement of the operations of that department ol the government and of the condition of the public finance. Tho ordinary rev enues Irorn all sources for the fiscal year end ed June 3Utb, 1878. were $367,763,878.70. The or dinary expenditures lor same period were $336.- 964 836 hu, leaving a surplus revenue for the year of #21.899,Kit.1)0. The receipts (or the present 11s cal year ending June 30. 1879, actual and esti mated. are as follows: Actual receipts for th" Ist quartercomm .icing July 1, 18T8, $73,389,743.43; estimated receipts lor the remaining three-quar ters of the year, 1191.110,396.57 Total receipts for the current fiscal year, actual and estimated, $364,500,UU0. The expenditures for the same peri od will be. actual and estimated, as follows: For the quarter commencing July I, 1878, actual ex penditures. #73,344,573.27, and for the re maining three-quarters of the year the expenditures are estimated at $166,753,438.73, making a total expenditure of $340 100,000, aid leaving an estimated surplus revenue lor the 5 ear ending June 30.1879, of $24.400,000. The total receipts during the next fiscal year, ending June 30. 1890. estimated according to existing laws, will bo $764,900,000, and the estimated or dinary expenditures for the same period will be $336.3:0,413 68. leaving a surplus of $38,179,987.33 for that year. In the foregoing statements of ex penditures. actual and estimated, no amount is allowed for the sinking fund provided lor by the act approved February 35, 1863, which provides that ore per cent, of the entire debt ol the Unit ed States shall be purchased or paid with each fiscal year to be set apart as a sinking fund. Itcre has been, however, a substantial complt • ance with the conditions of the law. liy Its terms, the public debt should have been reduced, be tween 1863 and the close of the last fiscal vear, $918,361,8(6 38. The actual reduction of the as certained debt In that period has been $730,644,- 73961. being in excess of the redudlon required by the sinking fund ad $303 383 933 33. The amount of the public debt, less cash In the treas ury Nov. 1, 1878, was $3,024,300.08318. a reduc tion since the same date last year of $33,150,617.- 39. The progress made during the last year in refunding the public debt at lot and rates of inter est is very gratifying. The amount of 4 per cent, bonds s-dd dating the present year, pr-or to Nov. 33. 1878, is $100,370,900, and 6 per cent bends, commonly known as 9 30s, to an equal amount have been, or wiil be. redeemed as culls mature. It has been the policy of the department to place the 4 per c*nt bonds within easy reach of every citizen who desire* to mvc t hit savlujpt whether small or (rrst, m these securities The secretary of the t easury recommends that mo law be so modified that small sums may be invested. and that thiough the postotßcos or oilier agents of the government the freest opportunity may bo given In all part* of the country for such inves'- mcnts. The best mode suggested is that the do partment be author-zed to Issue certificates of de posit of the denomination of Sill, beating interest at the rate of S 5 per cent, per annum, and con vertible at any lime within one year after their issue into the 4 percent- bonds authorized ov the refunding act, and to be issued only In ex change for U. 8. notes sent to the treasury by mail or otherwise, Buch a provision of law, sup ported by suitable regulations, would enable any pcrsou, read.ly, without cost or risk, u> convert his money into an interest-bearing security of the United Slates, and the money so received could be applied to the redemption of the 6 percent, bonds. The coinage <>l goldduV ing the last fiscal year was Jsi 7ffß i>Bfi. the coin age of silver dollars under the an passed Ke ■. 38. 1878. amounted to including one-third of Nov. 1878, $lB 61,455. of which amount f4.t4M.P47 ar.< in circulation, and tbo balance Jl4,BJP,ihi;i is still in the possession of the government. With re gard to the act under which the coinage of silver proceeds. It has been the purpose of the secretary to faithfully execute the law and to alford a fair trial to the measure. In the present financial condition of the country, 1 am persuaded that the welfare ol legitimate business and industry of every description will be bc“t promoted by ab staining from all attempt! to make radical changes in existing financial legislulton. Let It be understood that during the coming year the business of the country will be undisturbed by governmental interference with the laws affect ing it. and we may confidently expect that the re -umptlon of specie payments, winch will take place at the appointed time, will lie successfully and easily maintained, ami Uial It will be fo low ed by a bealihlul and enduring rivival of business prosperity. Give the Inherent energies of our people and the boundless resources of our country a fair opportunity, and relief from the present diflicnlty will surely follow. TilK

The receipts, Including sales nf stamps, money order business and official stamps, were I'.*!). 277,.Mb,!C. The sum nf $290 d.Vi !>0 included in the loregomg statement ol expenditures, is chargeable to preceding years, so that the actual expenditures lor the lin eal year ending June 30. 1880, are estimated at $:fii,571,90J, and the receipts from all sources #3O 84,023 90. leaving a deficlcncv to bo appro priated out of the treasury of J.VJOT.STIi.IO. The reiiort calls attention to the fact that the compen sation of postmasters and of railroads fur carry ing the mails Is regulated by law, and that the failure of congress to appropriate the amount required fur these purposes does not relieve the government of the responsibility, but necessari ly increases the deficiency bills ’which congress will lie called upon to pass. In providing for the postal service, the following questions arc pre sented: bhoiild congress annually appropriation sum for Its expenses largely in excess of its reve nues? or should such rates of postage lie estab lished as will make the department self-sustain ing? or should the postal service be reduced by excluding from the mails matter which does not pay its way? or should the number of jiost routes bo diminished? or should some other methods be adopted which will in crease the revenues or diminish the expense ol the postal service. The international postal con gross which met at Tans in May, 1878. and con tinued In session until June 4 of the same year, was composed of delegates from nearly all the civilized countries of the world. Jl adopted a new convention t i take the place ol the treaty concluded at lierne Oet. 9. 1871, which goes Into effect on the Ist, id April, 1879, between the coun tries whose delegates have signed it. It was rat ified and approved by and with the consent of I lie president Aug. 13,1878. A synopsis of this uni versal postal convention will be found In the re port ol the postmaster genera , and the full text in the appendix thereto. In Its origin the postal union comprised 23 countries having a popula tion of 300,UU0,0U0 of people. On the first of April next it will comprise 43 countries and Colonics, with a population of more than hoO 

OOO,OOO of people, and wl.l soon, by the accession of the few remaining countries ami colonics, which maintain organized postal services, constitute in fact, as well as in name, as the new title indi cates, a universal union, regulating, upon a uni form basis of cheap |iostuge rates, the postal in teicourse between all civilized nations dome em barrassment hsaaeisen from a conflict between tbe custom laws of this country and the provision of the postal canon in regard to the transmission of foreign hooks and newspapers to this country iiy mail. It is Imped that congress will he able to d vise some means of reconciling the difficulties which liave thus b-.on created so ns todo justice to nil par ties involved. Tilt JUDICIARY. Tlie business of the supreme and of the courts in many of the circuits has increassd to such an extent during the past years that additional legislation is imperative to relieve and prevent the delay ol Justice an 1 possible iippresston to suitors, which is thus oc casioned. The incumbered condition of these dock ets is presented anew in the report of the attorney general and the remedy suggested is earnestly urged for congressional action. The creation of additional circuit judgee, as proposed won.d afford a complete remedy, and would involve an expense at the present rate of salaries of not more than pi ,000 a year. THE IXTr.tlltlß OKI'SBI.MI,.ST. The annual report of Ihe secretary of the interiorjand of the commissioner of Indian affairs, presents an elalsiratn account of the present Condition nf Indian triis-s and of that branch of the public service which ministers to their interests. W hile the conduct of Indians generally bad been orderly and their rela-j lions with their ne| K hbors fjiendly and peaceful, two local disturbances have occurred, which were] deplorable in their character but remained happily j confined to a comparatively small uumlier of In- j dians. The discontent among the Bannocks which j led first to some acta of violence on the part of some members of the triim and finally to an outbreak, appears to have been caused by an insufficiency of food on the reserva tion, and this insufficiency to have been owing to the inadequacy ol the appropriations made by congre-i to the want of the Indians at a time when the Indiai s were pervented from supplying the deficiency by hunting. After an arduous pur suit ty the troops of the United Stales and sev eral engagements the hostile Indians were re duced io subjection and the larger part of them surrendered themselves as prisoners. In this connection I desire to call attention to the rec nmmcndatlon made by the secretary of tbe inle rio . that a sufficient fund ho placed at tbe dis posal of the executive, to be used with proper ac- countability at his discretion. In sudden emer gencies of the lailtuu service. The other case of disturbs nee wastliM or thesb.mlotmd Northern Cheyennes, who suddenly left their reservation in the Indian Territory and marched rspldlv through the states of Kansas and Nebraska tit the direction of their old tmhtlng grounds, eom nmtiug murders and other crimes on ihclr wav. Prom documents accompanying the report of the secretary of the iiuerior.il appears that a disorder ly band was as inlly supplied with the necessa ries of life as 1 lie 4 Ttw other ludiaus who remain ed quietly on the reservation and that the dis til'b.nee was caused by men of a restless an t mischievous disposition, among the Indians themselves. Almost the whole oflhls baud li,ve surrendered to the military authorities, and it is a gratifying fact that when some of them hud taken refuge lit the Cain p of the lied t'lou I Bioux with whom they bad been ou friendly relations, the Moux held them as prisoners ami readily gave them up to the officers of the United Mates, thus giving new proof of the loyal spirit which, alarming rumors to the contrary notwithstanding. ■ 1,. lutvo uniformly shown ever since the wishes hev cxpie.-ted at the council of Sept 1877, had o. en compiled with. Uoth the sec retary of the Interior ami secre tary of war unite in the recommendation that provision be made oy cougre-s lor the organ ization of a corps of mourned Indian auxiliaries, to he under the control ol the army and to lie nsed for the purpose of keeping the Indians on their reservations and preventing or repressln disturbance on their pail I earnestly concur in ; 'liis recommendation. 11 is believed that the Organization of such a body of Indian cavalrv, reeeiv.ng a moderate pm from the government! 1 would considerably weaken the ruthless element 1 among the Indians b\ withdrawing from it a 11 miller of the voting men and giving them con genial employment under the 'government, it I being a inatlei of expernnee that the Indians In our service, almost without exception, are faith I ful in the perlorinuncc of the duties assigned I 1 1 them. Such mi organization would materially j mid Hie in my in the accomplishment of a la-k for \ winch Its numerical strength is sometimes found 1 insufficient. Hut while the employment eta loreo lor Hie prevention or repression of Indian I troubles Is of occasional necessity, and wise preparation should be made to that end. greater I reliance must be placed on humane ami civiliz ing agencies for the ultimate solution of what Is called the Indian problem. It may be verv I'llll cult, and require much palUtit effort to curb the unruly spirit of tno savage Indian to the re straints of civilized life, hut experience shows thut it is not Impossible; many of tbe tribes which are now quiet and orderly and self-sup poiting, were once as savage us aiiv that at ptes •■nt roam over the plains or In the mountains of Hie tar west, and were then considered Inareestibie to civilizing influences It may be Impossible to raise them fully up to the level of the while population ol the l ulled .States hut we should not forget Hint they are tin-abori gines of Hie country ami called the soil their ovv u on which our people have grown rich, powerful and happy. He owe It to them as a moral (liltv to help then) In iiltalnlng at least that degree ol civil ization vv It tell they are ahlelo reach. 11 Is not only our duly. It Is also our Interests to do so. Indians who have become agriculturists or herdsmen and feel an Interest In property will llienevf rill cease to be avv arllkc and ilNlmrlng cl.uiicul. Ills also a well aiillieiiHi aled fuel Ilia) Indians are apt to lie peaceable and quiet vvlien their children areal school, and I am grallfiisl In know from I lice \ pres slonsof Indians 1 lieiusi Ives and from many con eiirrlng reports, that I here Is a strongly Inc reasing desire even among Indians lu-'oiigliig to eomparn t Ively vv lid tribes to have their ehlbireii edllealed. I 1 11 v Ite ultout lon to the reports of the secretary of i the Interior amt the commissioner of Indian'af fairs touching Hi* experiment recently Inaugu rated in taking fifty Indian children, lion ami girls. 1 nun different tribes to Hie Hampton normal agricultural Institution In Virginia, where they are to receive an eleinenlarv Kngllsh ediiealloii and training In agriculture and 1 Hot useful w .rk to he returned to their tribes after the completed course as Interpreters, instructors and e\i tuples It Is reported Hull nicer ch urged with I tie se lection of lln se children might ha v e had I lion amis of young Indians - i-nl vvlili him bud il been pos sible to make provision for Ibt-m.

The question of whether a change la thu control oft 0 Indian service should be made, wa- at the Inst session of congress referred 11 a eoiiiuillleo for enquiry and report. Without desiring to uiit.lclpnlo that re port, I venture") express the hope that In the decision of so Important a question the views ex pressed above may not bo lost sight of, iind that the decision, whatever It may he, will arrest the further agitation of this subject, such agitation being apt to produce a disturbing effect of the service as well us on the Indians themselves.

OMISSION. In (lie enrollment of the hill making nppropria tions for sundry civil expenses, nt the lasi session of congress, that portion which provided lor ihe continuation of the Hot Springs commissioner was omitted. As Ihe commissioner hud com plained of the work of inking testimony on many coiillicilng claims, suspension of the labors be fore determining the rights of claimants, threat ened for a time to embarrass the interest, not on ly of the government, but also of a large number of the citizens of Hot Springs, who were wail ing lor Muni action on (lode claims before con templated improvements. In order to prevent serious difficulties wbli h were apprehended, ami at the solicitation of many leading citizens of Hot Springs, and others Interested in Ihe welfare of the town the secretary of the In terior was authorized to request lln Inti-< oniniN .-.loners to take charge of lln records of I heir pro ceedings and to perform such work us could prop erly l>e done by them under siiclt ein ninslanci's to facilitate tin' future adjudication of tin 1 claims at an early day, and to pre-eve Ihe Mains of the claimants until their rights shnnbl be finally determined. Tbe late commissioners compiled with that request and report that Ihe leslinoney In all rases has been w rillen <.ut, examined carefully anil so arranged as to facilitate an early settlement when authorl/.isl by law. It is recommended that requisite authority In' given at as early a day In the session as possible and that a fair cmnpi nsa tloil be allowed Hie late commissioners for the ex pense Incurred amt labor performed by limn since 2Alh of June last. TIM unit LANDS. 1 Invite Ihe attention of congress to recommen dations made by I he secretary of the Interior with regard to preservation of timber on the piddle lands of (lie United males. The protection of public property Is one of the first duties of the government. The department of the Interior should therefore be enabled by sufficient appropri ations to enforce the laws In that respect, lon tills matter appears still more Important as a question nt public economy. Thu rapid destruction of our forests is an evil liaught with Ihe gravest consequences, especially In mountainous dis tricts where the rocky slopes, once denuded of their trees, will remain so forever. There the Injury once done, cannot lie repaired. I fully concur with the secretary of 'in interior in the opinion tied tor this reason letlsialion touching the public timber in the mono alnoiis stales and territories of the west should be especially well considered, and that existing lews in which the destruction of forests is not suflrlemly guarded against, should be speedily moduli and. A general law concerning this important subject appears to me to be a matter of urgent public necessity. AGRICULTURE. From the organization of Hie government, the Importance of encouraging, by till possible means, the increase nf our agricultural produc tions, has been acknowledged and urged upon the attention of congress and the people ns the surest means of increasing our substantial ami enduring prosperity The words of Washington are as applicable to day us when, in Ins eighth annual message, he said : “It is not to he doubled that with refeieiice. either to individual or national welfare, agriculture is of primary im portance,” in proportion as nations advance in populatlou and other circumstances of ma turity, this truth becomes more apparent, and renders the cultivation of, the soil more and mure an object of public patronage. Institutions for promoting It grow up supported by the public purse, and to what object 'an It be dedicated with greater propriety? Among the means which have oeen employed to this end none have been attended with greater sitccc s that the establish ment of boards composed of proper characters, charged with collecting and diffusing Informa tion and enabled by premiums and small pecuni ary aids Pi encourage and assist the spirit of dis covery, and Improvement !■ this species of establishing and con tributing doubly to Ihe Increase of im provement by stimulating to enlerpriae and ex periment, and by drawing to a common centre the lesults everywhere of individual skill and ob servation, and spreading them thence over the whole nation. Kxperience accordingly hath shown that they are very cheap Instruments of immense national benefit. Ihe great preponder ance ol agriculture over any other interest enti tles it to all the consideration rlaiiued for It by W ashingtoti About one half of the oopulat on of the United .Slates is engaged In agriculture. The value of the agricultural products ol tbe United Slates lor the year 1878 Is estimated at $3000,- 000,000; the exports of agricultural products for I ho year 1877, as appears fiom the report of the bureau of statistics W<-r $024.K,. 00. The great extent of our country with its diversity of sad mid climate, enables ns to produce witbiu our own borders and by our own labor not only fh necessaries but most of tbe Ia Juries that are consumed in civilized coun tries. \et, notwithstanding our advantages of soil, ( climate and water communication, it appears from i tin* In th report of the com ; miMiuDi-r of ugAcvltnrv, ‘tlmt <• lm|w.rl mu n*l| v | 110,11 Mi>i*n liimln many million* i.f Uurt |, nrialucla uliU’h roulil l>u raimnl in oui dm n cuuutrr.
