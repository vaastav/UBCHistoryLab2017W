The recent fall in copper stocks has been something of a surprise to the Montana public, and the cause has been a profound mystery. With cop per selling at about 17c and the mines paying the usual dividends no ade quate reason has been given for the sensational crash in copper. The Daly estate has disposed of its holdings of Amalgamated and the last quar terly dividend of that company was slightly reduced. The litigation in which the companies are engaged has also slightly increased, but all of these causes combined are not suffi cient to explain the remarkable shrinkage in the value of copper stocks. Amalgamated has fallen from 130 to G5, while Anaconda and other stocks have suffered in proportion. The Amalgamated was organized for the purpose of benefiting the pro ducers of copper by maintaining both the price of copper and of copper stocks, and considering the vast re courses of the promoters no one doubts their ability to carry out the undertaking, which fact adds to the mystery of the recent slump ip stocks. It seems most probable that the promoters of Amalgamated desire to remove some obstacles to the final consummation of their plans and that the present squeeze is a means to that end. The Helena Independent and other Ilcinze organs in the state have been playing into the hands of the manip ulators of Amalgamated by making a concerted attack upon that company, and tlie "1 did it" tone of those organs reminds one of a bantam rooster upon a sleeping elephant. When the squeeze has reached the proper point and sufficient slocks have been gath ered in. the program will probably he reversed and stocks will go soaring, while the bottom drops from the price of copper. When tais seesaw game has ac complished tlie purpose of the manip ulators the old conditions will be re established minus the disturbing factor. The Montana public is interested because one of the weapons used in the fight has been reduced production of copper, which always means idle workmen and dull trade. A loser for whom little sympathy is expressed is the speculator on margins. Such people must take the gambler's chance. The small owner of copper stocks will probably loose nothing in the end. Altogether the Montana public will be glad when the fight is over and normal conditions have been restored. Montana has hut little love for trusts, hut the kind to which there is the least objection are those which keep up the price of Montaua products. THE 

RAILROAD TRUST. The evils to be feared from tlie consolidation of the Northern Pacific and Great Northern railways are not so much increased cost of transpor tation or other extravagances hut the power which the pew corporation will have in all political affairs as well as in all matters relating to the judiciary. It is not to he suppocsd that the great corporation will sit idly by and allow any legislation to he encted which is going to be in any way detrimental to its interests. The Northern Pacific in the past has exerted an unwholesome influence both in elections and in the legisla tures in the states through which the road extends. A great deal has been said about the saving in expense that will be effected by the consolidation, but the corporation will see to it that the public gets no dividends by rea son of such savings and when it is attempted to enact laws to control and regulate the corporation such laws will only be passed, If at all. against tlie bitter opposition of the trusts. Men not in sympathy with the railroad trust will stand but little chance of going to the United States senate, while the same influence will he exerted to nominate and elect men acceptable to the corporation for judges and members of the legisla ture. Not more than one per cent of its earnings wnl need to he used by the trust to carry out its political schemes. The only method of fighting the trust effectually is through the legis lature and tliis can onlv he done by making the laws that are wanted an issue in tlie campaign. When members of the legislature are elected without pledges on such matters, experience shows that it is not difficult for the corporations to control legislation, hut when members are elected on platforms pledging them to tlie enactment of certain laws it is not so easy for the corporations to control. No person who has the welfare of Montana at. heart will be in favor of harsh or unjust legislation against the railroads, hut whe'i the railroads have combined so as to wipe out all competition, in self defense the peo ple will be compelled to combine for their own protection. AGAIN THE TARHE. As predicted by the Bee when the president's message was published, there is to lie no change in the tariff laws at tliis session of congress. The leading republicans have announced that the policy of their party will he to let well enough alone. From present indications the tariff is destined to he the rock on which the republican ship is in most danger of being wrecked. No longer will the republican party he solid for high pro tection. Many of tlie republican lead ers are wise enough to see that when tlie country reaches that stage of in dustrial development which produces a large surpluus for which we need an outside market that protection is a hindrance instead of a help. The question in many lines of man ufactures is not to preserve the home market hut to find au outside market for the surplus product. There is a large and growing element in the re publican party which believes that tlie tariff should he maintained on such articles as are not produced in excess of the home demand, hut should he removed both from such ar ticles as wo are now able to export and from the raw materials out of which they are made. Tliis element, however, is not in control of the party and it is highly improbable that any changes will he made in the tariff at the present ses sion. But while they are pot in control they probably form a large minority of the party and they are apt to make a vigorous fight because their interests are at stake and be cause they are directly in line with the policy recommended in President. McKinley's last speech at Buffalo just before his assassination. It seems most i rorable that the tariff will he one of the leading issues in tlie next presidential eompaign, and possibly it may he the paramount issue. Any division in the republican party on tliis issue will inure to tlie direct benefit of the democrats, be cause that party has always main tained the same position that is now being taken by- the McKinley repub licans. Upon investigation the 'Bee has learned that the subpoenas for wit nesses in the case against the gamb lers in Judge Sullvan's court last week wore promptly served by the officers, hut tlie case was dismissed before tlie witnesses could get into court. The Bee is glad to record that all gambling i,n Kalispell has been ■sum marily stopped, complaints having been filed by County Attorney Oliver against the parties implicated. That officer is to he congratulated on his prompt action in the matter and his course in stopping the games will re ceive the hearty approval of every law abiding citizen in the county. However, we do no*, believe that the ends of justice require or that the people wish to see an active prosecu tiou of tlie charges against the men arrested. They are men of many ex cellent qualities, too good, in fact, for the business in which they are en gaged. and to some extent have been the victims of custom which through the apathy of tlie press and people of Kalispell has amounted almost to a license. The ends of justice will he met and the people satisfied if the complaints are aiowed to stand as a guarantee that no gambling games will he opened in the future. 

COPPER STOCKS. New York, Dec. 10.—While the general market has displayed an un ; | j ! I dertone of strength throughout the week. Amalgamated Copper has again been a distrubing influence. This stock made a new low record Satur day, and it was reported In Wall street that the hear interest had finally attained the vurpose for which it had been organized. The fight in copper has resolved itself* into a conflict between two groups of insiders and it is reported that the hulls have practically ad milted their defeat and are ready to surrender on the liest terms obtain able. it was, stated on excellent auther ity that the National City bank is now lending on Amalgamated at GO. If this be true it lends color to a report that the fight is virtually at an end. AS TO JAMES J. HILL. While Mr. James J. Hill is not a poseur—he is too much of a schemer for that—he is certainly not averse to the creation, or the dissemination, of tlie impression that he has been a public benefactor; that without him deserts now ready to bloom would have remained in hopelss aridity; that his enterprises have been largely for the public; that he has the great est foresight of any railway manager in this or any other country and that his influence, not only has been, but will continue to be, benign. Granting truth in the claim that Mr. Hill lias done much for the north west it is not amiss, now that the president of the Northern Securities company seeks to become a dictator in the transportation field, to assert that, there is another side to the pic ture. This poor Canadian lad h^s grown into the man of many millions, of great power and of ambitions to which there would seem to be no limit. The railway system that he controls has never voluntarily reduc ed tariffs, has never won the loyalty of employes, has never retained an important executive for so long a term of years that he became really valu able and in touch with the people, has never failed to interfere in poli ties with a view to the protections of its own interests, has brow-beaten legislators, representatives, govern ors and United States senators, has never gained a loyal friend, since il'ie time it started west from Larimore. Never since the possibilities of the Northern Pacific were made clear to Mr. Hill has he wavered in hifihdeter mination to control his competitor, and it is of record that in the early nineties he was the chief instrument inforcing the road into bankruptcy, his intent being, of course, to obtain control when securities had depreci ated and all faith in the future of the road, on the part of eastern capital ists, was lost. Mr. James J. Hill is feared in the northwest. There are plenty who will kotow to him and not a few editors among them who will grow almost hysterical in panegyrics over his ca reer. There are thousands who will say: "This great man has been of in istimable value to this country," and (here are hundreds of politicians who are willing to be used by that they may profit in the usage. But this Col ossus of roads, this man who would tomorrow ruin the Northern Pacific to keep the credit of the Great North ern inviolate, has not a reliable or disinterested friend, has never been aide to keep the business friendship of capitalists with whom he dealt, lias an unfortunate habit of losing his temper at crucial points. It is very doubtful whether Mr. Morgan or Mr. Harriman have ever given Mr. Hill their full confidence. They are shrewd men and recognizing the shrewdness that lias brought Mt. Hill to his pres ent undenied altitude, are. and will continue to be, on their guard lest his wits prove keener than theirs and this to their detriment. It can not be made too plain nor reiterated too often that Mr. Hill's ambitions are for himself and for his property and are not for the public. He can be benign if it serves his pur pose, malign if malignity better suits, or lie thinks it does. Any one who knows northwestern railway affairs and the politics thereof, knows that it is a motto in all circles, "Beware of Jim Hill. He will use you and east you aside. He is selfish, ruthless, dangerous."—Journal. 

CROKER TO QUIT. Says He Is Getting Old and Worn Out. New York. Dec. 5.—In an inter view with Richard Croker the Even ing Post today quotes the Tammany leader as saying; "You won't see much more leading on my part in the future. I am get ting old and worn out. and I can not be a field horse for everybody any longer. I admit tbtt the leader of Tammany hall should stay in New York all the year round, and I can not stay here for more than a part of the year. If I tried to stay here all of the time I could do no work at all. "Ail tliis talk about me being state leader and trying to dictate in na tional politics is nonsense. I am in no condition to do any kind of lead ing. but of course I will, always take deep interest in Tammany, the best I can." When asked if he was training any body to succeed him as leader he re plied: "Oh. I have not come to that yet, and I have not planned my future, except that I will go to England in January or February. The Tammany executive com mittet will meet next Monday, and you may hear more of the matter then."

Sir Christopher Furness of London, the largest shipowner and builder in the world, has just arrived in New Orleans for the purpose of inspect ing the port and to look into the erec tion of a large smelter and refinery. Jerome K. Jerome seems to have forsaken England, except as a place to visit occasionally. After a long visit in London, he is off for Brussels, where he is to spend the winter. He has been at work on a long novel, which he wishes the public to take seriously. It is said that the most wonderful marksman i ; n Washington is Senor de Assis-Brasil, the Brazilian minister. Senor de Assis began his apprentice ship in shooting on his father's ranch, where as a lad he was the constant companion of the vaqueras ajid hunt ers, whom he soon excelled at their own craft. Dr. Kuyper, the present prime min ister of the Netherlands, is by calling a Calvinist pastor of the most ortho dox type. He was brought up for a literary career, and ascribes his aban donment of the latter and his en trance into the pastorate to the in fluence exercised upon him by Miss Yonge's "Heir of Redclyffe." M. Marcelin Barthlot, a distin guished French chemist, after dis cussing the merits and demerits of the systems of capital punishment now in vogue, pronounces in favor of carbon dioxide, a gas used for the destruction of stray dogs. He says tliis is a quiet and painless death and one that does not shock the sensibil ities. Curry Gang in Evidence. Cheyenne, Wyo., Dec. 9.—Details of the plot to hold up the convict train last night and secure the release of Bob Lee, the Wilcox train robber, came to light today by the discovery of a camp of desperate men west of Laramie. The authorities are making an ef fort to arrest the members of the gang, but it is believed they have made their escape. The plan was to lay in wait at some convenient point between Lara mie and Rawlins, hold up the train, arm the convicts and stand off the guards or any force sent against them. The number of the despera does is unknown but they are known to be desperate men and are thought to belong to the Curry gang. The time for removing the convicts is being kept secret by the authorities. The Conrad National Bank OF
