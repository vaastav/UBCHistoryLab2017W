I It. M. KEAMS, J tai,ors- All ommnnlcntiiiiix, of whatever nature should bo addressed, ' ' . . STANDARD PUB. CO. . XeX.SXVlL TENNESSEE. Saturday, Dec. 9, IS82. President's Message President Arthur's meesnge to Con gress is an interesting document and we would be glad to give it in full to our readers, but it is entirely too lengthy. We have given the pnrts which we deem most interesting to our readers, pertaining to the two leading questions Wore the country, viz. : the Inter nal Revenue and the Tnrifl question. These two questions are likely to be the leading ones tor this and the next Con gress. It will be seen that the Presi dent has recommended the repeal ot all the Internal Revenue taxes except on distilled fpiiits. We have not seeu the report of the Tariff Commission, but it is Srtiil the Commission lias reoom ineuded many important changes, re ductions and modifications. 'The late elections have had a won derful effect on the minds of the party in power, and may have had much to do in shaping the report of the Turill Commission. Already Judge Kelley's bill to abolish the tax on all forms of tobacco and cigars 1ms been favorably reported upon by the committee on Ways and Means, by a vote of six to five. This bill, if passed, would reduce th taxes S45.000.000. These reforms and reductions in the taxes and tariff are demanded and ex pected, but Congress should not run from one exti erne to the other. Let them be made carefully and gradually, in such way as to protect individual in terests and not injure the commercial and manufacturing interests of the country. If the tobacco tax should be abolished to take effect et once, the government would have to refund taxes n such good as taxes had been collected in the bunds of manufactur ers and dealers. So with other classes of goods similarly afli-ctcd by the re duction or abolition of taxes.- These rsforros and reductions are necessary and should be made, but the work should be done carefully and in such way as not to disturb individual inter ests or the geueral prosperity of the country. Iu our last issue we mentioned the fact that the Railroad authorities had advanced the rates on green apples from this and other points on this road to point South. Such was tho fact, nd feeling an interest in the matter, iu common with other shippers, we made our complaints knoAn to the proper authorities, and are pleased to nay that freights were at once restored to former'rates, nnd are, so far as we know, satisfactory. We are informed that the recent advance was made by ome misunderstanding of some of the clerks in the Nashville office, and not by the order or knowledge" of Mr, Knox, General Freight Agent, as he claims. To Mr. I). B. Carson, our polite and efficient agent here, nnd to Mr. Knox, General Agent, Nashville, we are greatly obliged for the prompt ness with which .they corrected the mistake, and restored the former rates Beport of the Tariff Commission. This document is said t: be very vol uminous, containing in manuscript bout 2,000 pages. They recommend a substantial reduction, averaging about '20 to 25 per cent. Iu many instances they recommend a reduction of from 40 to 50 per cent. The repot t is said to bo a surprise both to the friends and opponents of the tariff nnd not at all atisfactory to protectionists. To Poultry Kniitera. "The Complete Poultry Book, a Manual for the American Poultrv Yard," by C. E. Thorne, is the title of a new work just from the press. It is beautifully illustrated and handsomely bound in cloth, containing 224 pages. It is truly a complete poultry book, giving all the necessary information on that subject, and will be quite valuable to any one engaged in poultry raising. Price $1.00. Sample copy can be een at J. B. Ritchey'sDrug nnd Book Store. We will give a copy of the book to any one sending us four new nubscriber to the Standard, with 84 in cash. According to the reports from New York the wholesale prices of coffees are lower than they have been since the pauic of 1857. The decline is said to be due to the overcrowding of the Bra zilian market, where there is a supera bundant supply and very low prices. The stuck in this country, to the con trary of being excessive, is now 3,250, 000 pounds lew thau it was a month The Prrsidi'iiti Message. The President' message was read in both houses of Congress Monday. It is quite a lengthy document, and we can ouly give room in our columns to two items of it the reduction of Inter nal Revenue and the Tariff: 

INTERNAL REVENUE. Upon the showing of our financial condition at the close of the last fiscal year I felt justified in recommending the abolition of internal revenue tuxes except those upon tobacco in its various tonus and upon distilled spirits and fer mented liquors, and except, also, the special tux upon the manufacturers and deulers in such articles. I venture now to Euggest that unless it shall be ascertained that the probable expendi teres of the government for the coming year have been underestimated, all in ternal taxes save those which relate to distilled spirits can be prudently abro gated. Such a course, if accompanied by a simplification of the machinery of collection, which would then be easy of accomplishment, might reasonably be expected to result in diminishing" the cost of such colections by at ieast two million and a halt of dollars and the retirement from office of from fifteen hundredrto two thousand persons. The system of excise duties has never com mended itself to the favor of the American people, and has never been resorted to except for supplying defi ciences in the treasury when, by reason of sjM'cial exigencies, the duties on im ports have proved inadequate for the government. The sentiment of the country doubtless demands that the present excise tax be abolished as soon as such course can be pursued. It seems to me, however, for various reasons, so sweeping a measure as the total abolition of internal taxes would for the present be an unwise step. Two of these reasons are deserving of special mention : First It is by no means clear that even if the existing system of duties of imports is continued, without modi fication, these duties alone will yield hiiHicient revenue for all the needs of the government. It is estimated $100, 000,000 will be required for pensions during the coming year, and it may well be doubted whether the maximum annual demand for that object has been reached. Uncertainty upon this ques tion would alone justify the retention for the present ot that portion of the system of internal revenue which Is least ol'jectionalile to the people. Second A total abolition of excise taxes would almost inevitably prove a serious if not an insurmountable objection to the thorough revision of the tariff and toany considerable execu tion in im ported u ties. THE 

TARIFF. The present tariff system is in many respects unjust. It makes unequal dis tributions both of its burdens and its benefits; this fact was practically rec ugiiicii uy a iiiHjtiriijr Oi euuu uouso ui Congress in the passage of an act cre ating the tariff commission. The re port ot that commission will be placed before you and will, I trust, afford you such information as to the condition and prospect of the various commer cial, agricultural, manufacturing, mining and other interests of the coun try, and contain such suggestions for a swlutary revision, as will practically aid you in your action on this important subject. The revenue from customs for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1879, amounted to 8137,000,000. Il has in three succeeding vears reached first $180,000,000 then 8198,000,000, and finally as has already been stated 8220, 000,000. The increase from this source for the fiscal year which will end June 30, 1883, will doubtless be considerably in excess i f the sum last mentioned. If the tax on domestic spirits is to be retained, it is plain, therefore, that large reductions from the customs reve nue are entirely feasible. While rec ommending the reduction, I am fur fiom advising the abandonment of the policy of so discriminating, in the ad justment of duties, as to afford aid and protection to domestic labor; and the present system should be so revised as to equalize the public burden among all cla ses and occupations nnd bring it into closer harmony with the present needs of industry. Without entering into minute detail which under the present circumstances is quite unneces sary I reccomniend an enlargement of the free list, so as to include within it numerous articles which yield incon siderable revenue; n simplification of the complex and inconsistent schedule ot duties at certain manufacture, par ticuarlury those of cotton, iron and steel, and a substantial reduction of the duties on these articles, and on sugar, molases, silk, wool nnd woolen goods, If a general revision of the tariff' shall be found to Iw impracticable at this ses sion, I express the hope that at lenst some or the most conspicious niequali ties of the law may be corrected before your liual adjournment. One of them is specially refered to by the secretary in view of the recent decision of the Supreme Court. The necessity of amending the law by which the duties standard of color is adopted, as a test of succhraine strength of sugars, is too obvious to require comment. Why .Simula They. No man or woman can do satisfactory work when the brain is dull, the nerves unsteady, the system relaxed and they feel generally wretched. Why should my bod v drag through their work in this condition when a bottle of Tarker's Ginger Tonic will at a moderate cost give them the strength and will toper form their duties satisfactorily. Ex. Manufacturers of nails at Wheeling intend to begin making nails from steel instead of iron, claiming it is a better process and cheaper. Credit often ruins both debtor and ertitr.

If preferred, instead of one of the books, we will send an extra copy of the Standard one year to any one sendiugus a club of five new subscri. hers. Reading Novels. Bad enough for young girls to read. vm ovt.11 wvaov fur maiitril wiviitcu. These novelists pander to the prurient taste of ladies for such, and coin from their brain heroes ideal characters and make them companions for our ladies. And we venture to assert"! hat misery has come into many a home when the husband found that his wife cared more for companionship of novels than she did for his wardrobe, or for household duties. Of course she eoon sighs that she did not have such a hero for a hibband, and becomes lonely, and the step to hatred of him is not a long one. Not much wonder, then, that lie like a fool, seeks pleasure in dissipa tion, and the twain are no longer bone of one bone and flh of one fle.h in (spirit and happiness, We do not say that ladies who itch for the companion ship of such Lotharios, and sigh tor husbands like them, would turn ou Camillas, but we do say nuch literature does much harm and no good. It is calculated to make fools of young girls, and to make married wuinou neglect their husbands. And, beside this dan ger, we do know that in muny of these novels and continued stories are found details of love intrigues, amours, jeal ousies, which even the woman who reads them with avidity, would not permit to bo Raid to her by her gentle man associates, and which they would not say in very fear of a brother or husband, or father, calling them to serious account. But, we suppose it shows the taste and liking of the reader, and the novelists pander to the sume, knowing his vicious love-venom will find ready sale. Winchester Home Journal. "Now is the whiter of our discontent" approaching, when neuralgia makes the jaws crack and the head throb and ache, and rheumatism with screws of vice-like tension twinges the joints with direful agony. Red flannels won't keep off these invaders of the body "nary a bit," though puffed up to do so. But Edward Wilder's Sarsnparilla and Potash will. Rheumatism is a blood disease, and red flannels wil no more clear the blood which is disinte grated with unhealthy particles, than waving "the bloody shirt" will resusci tate the famous Governor Morton. The relief must be radical. Besides this, if scrofula troubles you, this is another blood disease where this extra ordinary combination of medicine is the conqueror of the age. Try it if your blood is depraved. If you yell with rheumatism, groan with neural gia, or pine with scrofula, try it and be relieved.
