We are Of Gardner. getting along very well with war at a distance and we need very little in the way of agitation towards militarism In this country. The people at Wash ington, congressmen included, know the state of our defenses. If we need to strengthen ourselves in any partic ular let it be done, but the nation will b happy to forego the slobber and misrepresentation that would attend a spectacular treatment of the sub ject such as Representative Gardner proposed. The subject of national defense li a matter for sane and careful . con sideration. It is a poor topic for pol itical debate and Gardner was trying to play politics, not patriotism. It is certainly true that a rural credit system is needed in this country and those interested directly Overdoing or indirectly in agrlcul jiio tasc. ture win wish the move all speed. But that does not mean the present situation should be misrepresented as Is plainly done by the professor of economics of the University of Texas when he says a tenant farmer in his state has to pay 20 per cent interest No farmer in Texas or elsewhere pays 20 per cent Interest. No man could afford to pay such a rata of Interest unless he was borrowing money to pay a fine that would keep him out of Jail. If Texaa farmers have been paying an interest . rate approaching 20 per cent then that professor of economics has neglected Ms duty In not letting the money lend-t-rs of the world know of that rich loaning field. There are plenty of valid arguments in behalf of a rural credit law and there -is no need to resort to exag geration or falsehood. Orpgonlan always a bootwlper for privilege, sings the very same song. In other words our torles would rather have the country spend money n wamhlps than In the extension "of our commerce. It Is the typical tory viewpoint. Anything like government ownership In any form always comes in for their attack because it may mean some move against the sacred rights of the man who sits on top of the pile and lives off the work that other men do. Their belief in mili tarism Is also typical because pluto cracy Is always fearful. They should not be taken seriously for they exag gerate the danger, Just as does the man who Is so afraid of getting wet he won t so walking in the sunshine without an umbrella. The surprising thing is not that a series of fire-proof" factory build ings should burn. A $7,000,000 "Absolutely fire Joke on Edison, proof buildings of every type and de sign have a way, when subjected to severe testa, of promptly falling back Into the "slow-combustion" class. The bewildering thing Is that "fireproof building put up by Mr. Edison himself require the quotation marks the same as the handiwork of lesser men. These structures represented the last word In indestructibility to the great In ventor, who for 10 years has been promising us a "poured"' house to be Immune to fire and storm. Evidently he will have to start new research work In last words. It is as if his own private lighting plant refused to work or his own pho nograph obstinately declined to grind out popular music or his own tele phone line required the perpetual ser vices of the trouble man. A $7,000. 000 Joke is a pretty serious Joke, even to the wealthiest invention of whom . . i history makes mention. St. Louis Pott Dispatch. When commi.-wion houses contract for wool months before shearing they bet that the price will be higher later; the grower need not hesitate to take the same chance. Considering that these are quiet times Pendleton's building record is nothing to be ashamed of. Unfortunately, figures are lacking! to show Just how much they have spent In wastefulness and riotous liv ing, and no estimate Is possible of the extent to which their swollen prosperity has demoralized them, as various economic alarmists were sure It would. But judging from what they have done with the bulk of their additional income, the "moral ruin to which they have been exposed Is of! a kind which most American work men could stand Indefinitely without serious detriment. Given the surplus to it in the bunk' or pny for a home. It 1 quite as likely to be devoted to the uses as to extravagance or the saloon. The best rart of the Ford plan Is that It Is teaching its beneficiaries the way to Independence through saving.

Only the heroic can set aside n fixed sum from the week's or month's pay against a rainy day, whereas the art becomes simple with o bonus or dividend received over and above regular wages.

TELL ME NO MORE! O, tell me no more of the glorious fame That comes to the victor in battle, Where men for the sake of dread his tory's name Meet death mid the fury and rattle; Where lovers and sons In the carnage are strewn O'er the field of confusion so dire Unmarked by a stone for remem brance hewn, Left to rot In the hideous mlre! For such was the h,rave, fearless lad die o' mine. Who loved me so dear when we parted. Who rode to the front with a cour age divine, And left me alone, broken-hearted: He vowed when he left me he soon would return, With tears then our bosoms did sever, But now all in vain for his coming I yearn, My laddie Is gone, and forever! The battle has taken my laddie from me, Tia but for his love I am pining. My heart's ardent spirit that once was so free. By night and by day is declining: So tell me no more of the glory and fame Attending the wounded and dying. My bosom but leaps at the sound of his name. My heart for my laddie Is crying!

He was acting as a messenger for the ad miralty (naval headquarters), while the rest of his troop were serving as coast guards. He appeared very much interested in what the Ameri can scouts were doing, so I showed him some photographs of our boys. As I also held in my hand some pho tographs that I had taken of the German boy scouts, I said: " 'I don's suppose pictures of Ger man scouts would particularly Inter est you at this time.' "Like a flash he answered, with best Rood humor: " 'Why, of course, I would like to see them.

Den nis McKenna, owner of orange groves In California, met a stranger In Los Angeles. The man wanted an or ange grove. "I've got valuable property In Kan sas City that I'll trade you for one of your orange groves" he told Mc Kenna. "It's a five-story building at Nos. 615-17'1 Oak street takes up a whole block." The proposition sounded good to McKenna and he asked T. A. J. Shaf- er, who was coming to Kansas City, to Investigate the property. Shafer wanteder Into the Criminal court building, looking for Nos. 515-17-15 Oak street. "There's your property, right over there." James "McCormlck, a deputy marshal, told Shafer; "but It hap pens to be the court house." "Guess McKenna won't want to trade," declared Shafer as he left. NOT RUINED BY PROSPERITY.

WOMEN OF ILLINOIS ARE PLANNING LEGISLATION CHICAGO, Dec. 11 A three day conference of Illinois women to for mulate a tentative program of legis lation In the interests of women of the state, opened In the Congress ho tel today with Indications that the attendance would exceed 1000. The conference was called at the sugges tion of Lieutenant-Governor Barratt O'Hara, head of the Illinois senate welfare com m Union, whose activities In investigating the causes of vice aroused national Interest eighteen months ago. "The delegates represent women of all classes from the wife of the mil lionaire who studies civics as a mat ter of culture and humanltarlanism to the working girl who has been forced by necessity to solve the prom lems of existence," said O'Hara. "The rest thought of the woman hood of Illinois Is represented here today. If the Illinois legislature adopts the prtgram laid out here it will place Illinois In the van of all states In progressive action for the benefit of women and girls. "The more Important subjects to be considered at the conference are: A minimum wage law for women, maximum work day of perhaps eight hours, vocational education, and abo lition of the system of fining girl vice victims." "I believe this conference marks the beginning of a new era In Illinois when office -iholders. Instead of pass ing laws that suit themselves, will be, advised by conferences of this kind." BIG FRENCH GUNS OVERMASTER FOES' BERLIN, Dec. 12. Today's offi cial communication issued by the German army headquarters staff as serts that a French attack, resumed in the Forest of Argonne, was repuls ed, the allied forces losing heavily. The text of the statement reads: "In the district of Soualn, the French yesterday confined themselves to heavy artillery firing. "A renewed French attack on Ro crol and Courcullles did not make any progress. The attack broke down un. tier the fire of our artillery, the en emy suffering heavy loss. . "Yesterday three of the enemy's aviators dropped about 10 bombs on a town situated outside the range of operations, the town of Freiburg (Baden). No damage was done. The Incident merely shows again that an open town not situated within the range of operations has been attacked with bombs by the enemy." WRONG BODY SHIPPED TO MOURNING PARENTS KELSO. Wash., Dec. 12 A few days ago word was received here by Mr. and Mrs. J. M. Gumm that their son, Lucien was dead at San Fran olsco and the body was being held at an undertaker's parlors there await ing orders for Its disposition. What caused death or when was not stat ed. Word was telegraphed to ship the body here and a casket containing a body was received here and taken to the undertaking parlors of Marx & Ball. When the casket was opened it was discovered by the relatives and Lucien Gumm, but that of an entire stranger. To all appearances it was the body of a Scandinavian of light complexion, light hair and apparently about 27 years old. How the mistake came to be made Is not known. Up rb the present no further word has been received by Mr. and Mrs. Gumm regarding their son's death. tlculurly great Importance a this time because a great flood of Immi gration Is expected at the close of the present European war.
