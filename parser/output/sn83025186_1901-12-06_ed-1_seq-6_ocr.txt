A comprehensive synopsis of President "Roosevelt's message to Congress is given be* low: To the Senate and House of Representatives: "The Congress assembles this year under tt« shadow of a great calamity. On the sixth «f 'September, President McKlnley was shot tr *n anarchist while attending the Pan •American Bxposition at Buffalo, and died In that city on the fourteenth of that month. "Of the last seven elected Presidents, he is tt« third who has been murdered, and the Iwre recital of this fact is sufficient to jus tify grave alarm among all loyal American «ttisens. Moreover, the circumstances of this, the third assassination of an American Presi dent, have a peculiarly sinister significance. iBoth President Lincoln and President Gar 'field were killed by assassins of types unfor -*unately not uncommon in history. President Lincoln falling.a victim to the terrible pas sions aroused by four years of civil war, «od President Garfield to the revengeful van ity of a disappointed office-seeker. President McKinley was killed by an utterly depraved •criminal belonging to that body of criminals who object to all governments, good and bad ••like, who are against any form of popular liberty If (t is guaranteed by even the most Jut and liberal laws, and who are as hostile •*o tin upright exponent of a free people's amber wUl as to the tyrannical and irresponsi ble despot. "fUi not loo much to say that at the time «f President McKlnley's death he was the •soet widely loved man in all the United States while we have never had any public taaa of hie position who has been so wholly free from the bitter animosities Incident to mubUc lite. There could be no personal Batred of kirn, for he never acted with aught |rat consideration for the welfare of others. HO one could fall to respect him who knew him In public or private life. The defenders of those murdererous criminals who seek to mewt tiieir criminality by asserting that it Ss exercised for political ends, inveigh against -wealth and irresponsible power. But for this Assassination oven this base apology can sot be'urged." The President speaks in the highest terms of the personal and public virtues of Mr. Mc Klnley. Describing the nature of the assas sination and the motive that inspired It, the •message continues: Motive of the Assassin. "The blow was aimed not at this Presl deot, but at all Presidents at every symbol of .government. The anarchist, and especially •the anarchist in the United States, is merely one type of criminal, more dangerous than *Boy other because be represents the same 4Sepravity in a greater degree. The man who •^advocates anarchy directly or indirectly. In •may shape or fashion, or the man who apolo gizes for anarchists and their deeds, makes Kimseif morally accessory to murder before .-«he fact. The anarchist is a criminal whose -''V toerverted instincts lead him to prefer confu «on and chaos to the most beneficent form S so a or is of on or iworklngmen is outrageous In its impudent Vfe.jivii Ealsity for If the political institutions of this •RSlp 'Country do not afford opportunity to every "fconest Mtifl intelligent son of toil, then the jdtoor of hope Is forever closed against him. "The anarchist is everywhere not merely the •enemy of system and progress, but the dead ly foe of liberty. If ever anarchy is triumph ««nt Its triumph will last for but one red moment, to be succeeded for ages by the gloomy night of despotism. «M Stedit -V ..4 v' Would Exclude Anarchists. earnestly recommend to the Congress Aat in the exercise of its Wise discretion it «bould take into consideration the coming lb this country, of anarchists or persona pro fMdK -principles hostile to all government aad justifying the murder of those placed authority- No matter calls more urgently -far thti wlsest~-tbought of the Congress. •*The Federal courts should be given, juris •dktioB over any man who kills or atleapM^ to kill the President or any man who by the .*VenatituUon or by-law is In line of succes sion for the Presidency, while the punishr jMBi for an unsuccessful attempt should be proportioned to the enormity of the offense ^against oar Institutions. ".Anarchy is a crime against .the whole %unan .race: and all mankind should band ^against the anarchist. His crime should be .made an offense against the law of nations, like plrney and that form of manstealing known as the slave trade for it is of far Macker infamy than either. It should be so declared by treaties among all civilized pow- ... The Trust Problem. -"The tremendtfus and highly complex .industrial development which went on with «*er accelerated rapidity „durijag the latter lialf of the nineteenth century brings us face to face, at the beginning of the twentieth, & a -laws, and the old customs which had almost 'the binding force of law, were pnee quite wnfftrlrnt to regulate the accumulation and distribution of wealth. Since the industrial changes which have so enormously increased -the productive power of mankind, they are no longer sufficient. "The creation of great corporate fortunes lias not been due to the tariff nor to any other governmental action, but to natural irsv -causes in the business world, operating in -other countries as they operate in our own. "It is not true that as the rich have grown ?*ichcr the poor have grown poorer. On the -contrary, never before has the average man. the wage-worker, the farmer, the small trad er, been so -well off as in this country an1 at the present time. There have been abuses •connected with the accumulation r! wealth it remains true that a fortune accumu only on condition of conferring im niense incidental benefits upon others. Suc cessful enterprise, of the type yrhlch benefits .*11 mankind, can only exist if the conditions sure such as to offer great prizes as the re -wards of success. "The captains of industry who have driven 3 the railway systems across this continent, •who have built up our commerce, who have 3evei6ped our manufactures, have on the mbole done great good to our people. Wltb out them the material development of which fjJii .! we are so justly proud could never have Xaken place. Moreover, we should recognize :S r'A-the immense Importance to this material development of leaving as unhampered as a ,r da compatible with the public good the strong *nd forceful men upon whom the success of business operations inevitably rests. Caution Is Urged. "An additional reason for caution in deal •Bg with corporations is to be found In the International commercial conditions of to '4fisy. The same business conditions which Jbave produced the great aggregations of cor porate and individual wealth have made them wi»ry potent factors in international commer «lal competition. America has only just tx*gun to assume that commanding position to the international business world which we fcelieve will more and more be hers. It is of the utmost importance that this position -be not jeoparded, especially at a time when the overflowing abundance of our own natu rat resources and the skill, business energy, S- ,:s «nd mechanical aptitude of our people make cr a a on -jflitions it. would be most unwise to cramp or to fetter the youthful strength of our Nation. 4 "Disaster to great business enterprises can ~jnever have its effects 1 Lciited to the men at the top. It spreads throughout, and while It S i' ts bad for everybody, it is worst for those farthest down. The capitalist may be shorn of his luxuries: but the wage-worKcr may 1» deprived cf even bare necessities.

It should be as much tho aim of those who seek for social betterment to rid the business world of crimes of cunning as to rid the entire body politic of crimes of violence. Great corpora tions exist only because they are created and safeguarded by our Institutions and it. Is therefore our right and our duty to see that they work in harmony with these Insti tutions. Publicity Remedy for Trusts. "The first essential in determining how to deal with the great industrial combinations is knowledge of the facts—publicity. In the interest of the public, the government should have the right to inspect and examine the workings of the great corporations engaged in interstate business. Publicity Is the only sure remedy which we can now Invoke. What further remedies are needed In the way of governmental regulation, or taxation, can only be determined after publicity has been obtained, by process of law, and in the course of administration. The first requisite Is knowledge, full and complete—knowledge which may be made public to the world. "Artificial bodies, such as corporations and joint stock or other associations, depending upon any statutory law for their existence or privileges, should be subject to proper gov ernmental supervision, and full and accurate information as to their operations should bo made public regularly at reasonable Intervals. "The large corporations, commonly called trusts, though organized in one state, always do business in many states, often doing very little business in the state where they are Incorporated. There Is utter lack of uniform ity In the state laws about them and as no state has any exclusive Interest in or power over their acts, It has in practice proved im possible to get adequate regulation through state action. Therefore, In the interest of the whole people, the Nation should, without in terfering with the power of the states In the matter Itself, also assume power of super vision and regulation over all corporations doing an interstate business. This Is espe cially true where the corporation derives a portion of Its wealth from the existence of some monopolistic element or tendency in Its business. There would be no hardship In such supervision banks are subject to it, and in their case it Is now accepted as a simple matter of course. Indeed, it Is probable that supervision of corporations by the National government need not go so far as Is now the case with the supervision exercised over them by so conservative a state as Massachusetts, in order to produce excellent results. "I believe that a law can be framed which will enable the National government to exer cise control along the lines above Indicated profiting by the experience gained tbrouga the passage and administration of the Inter state-Commerce Act. If, however, the judg ment of the Congriss Is that it lacks the constitutional power to pass such an act, then a constitutional amendment should be submitted to confer the power. "There should be created a Cabinet officer, to be known as Secretary of Commerce and Industries, as provided In the bill Introduced at the last session of the Congress. It should be his province to deal with commerce in ita broadest sense including among many other things whatever concerns labor and all mat ters affecting the great business corporations and our merchant marine. Restriction on Immigration* "With the sole exception of the farming Interest, no one matter is of such vital mo ment to our whole people as the welfare of the wage-workers. If the farmer and the wage-worker are well off, it is absolutely certain that all others will be well off, too. It is therefore a matter for hearty congratu lation that on the whole wages are higher to-day in the United States than ever before In our history, and far higher than In any other country. The standard of living is also higher than ever before. Every effort of leg islator and administrator should be bent to secure the permanency of this condition of things and Its improvement wherever possi ble. Not only must our labor be protected by the tariff, but it should also be protected so far as It is possible from the presence in this country of any laborers brought over by contract, or of those who, coming freely, yet represent a standard of living so de pressed that they can undersell our men in the labor market and drag them to a lower level. I regard it as necessary, with this end In view, to re-enact immediately the law excluding Chinese laborers and to strength en It wherever necessary In order to make its enforcement entirely effective. "So far as practicable under the conditions cot government work," provision should be made lo render the enforcement of the eight hour law easy and eertaln. In all indus tries' carried on directly or Indirectly for the United, States government women and chil dren 1il6\ild be protected from: excessive hours of labors from night work, and from work under unsanitary conditions. "The most vital problem with which this country, and for that matter the whole civ ilized world, has to deal, is the problem which has for one side the betterment of so cial conditions, moral and-physical, in large cities, and for another side the effort to deal with the tangle of far-reaching questions which we group together when we speak of "labor.' Very great good has. been and will be accomplished by associations or unions of wage-workers, when managed with fore thought, and when they combine insistence upon their own rights with law-abiding re spect for the rights of others. The display of these qualities in such bodies ts a duty to the Nation no less than to the associations them selves. Finally, there must also in many cases be action by the government in order to safeguard the rights and interests of all. Under our Constitution there Ib much more scope for such action by the state and the municipality than by the Nation. But on points such as those touched on above the National government can act. "Our present immigration laws are unsat isfactory. We need every honest and effi cient immigrant fitted to become an Ameri can citizen, every immigrant who comes here to stay, who brings here a strong body, a stout heart, a good head, and a resolute pur pose to do his duty well in every way and to bring up his children as law-abiding and God-fearing members of the community. But there should be a comprehensive law enact ed with the object of working a threefold Im provement over our present system. First, we should aim to exclude absolutely not only all persons who are known to be believers in anarchistic principles or members of an archistic societies, but also all persons who aro of a low moral tendency or of unsavory reputation. This means that we should re quire a more thorough system of inspection abroad and a more rigid system of examina tion at our Immigration ports, the former be ing especially necessary. "The second object of a proper immigra tion law ought to be to secure by a careful and not merely perfunctory educational test some intelligent capacity to appreciate Amer ican institutions and act sanely as Ameri can citizens. This would not keep out all anarchists, for many of them belong to the intelligent criminal class. But it would do wnat is also in point, that is, tend to de crease the sum of ignorance, so potent in. producing the envy, suspicion, malignant passion, and hatred of order, out of which anarchistic sentiment inevitably springs. Finally, all persons should be excluded who are below a certain standard of economic fit ness to enter our industrial field as com petitors with American labor. There should be proper proof of personal capacity to earn an American living and enough money to in sure a decent start under American condi tions This would stop the Influx of cheap labor, and the resulting competition whk-h gives rise to so much of bitterness in Ameri can industrial life and it would dry UR the springs of the pestilential social conditlous in our great cities, where anarchistic organ izations have their greatest possibility of growth. Question of Reciprocity. "There Is general acquiesence in our pres ent tariff system as a national policy. The first requisite to our prosperity is the con tinuity and stability of this economic policy, ivothing could be more unwise than to dis turb the business interests of the country by any general tarlfT change at this time. Doubt, apprehension, uncertainty are exactly what we wish to avoid in the interest of our com mercial and material well-being. Our expert- «a«s in tha pest has show* that sweeping revisions of tha tariff ai* conditions closely approaching panic business world. Tet It is not only possible, but eminently desirable, to comblae with tha stability of ow economic system supple mentary system of reciprocal and obli gation with other nations. Such reciprocity is an Incident and result of the firm estate lishment and preservation of our present economic policy, it was specially provided for In tha present tariff law. "Our first duty is to see that the protection •ranted by the tariff In every case where It is needed is maintained, and that reciprocity be sought for so far as It can safely ho done without Injury to our home industries. Just how far this to must be determined accord ing to the Individual case, rememtterlng al ways that every application of our tariff pol icy to meet our shifting national need* must be conditioned upon the cardinal fact that the duties must never be reduced below the pout that will cover the difference between the labor cost here and abroad. The well-being of the wage-worker is a prime consideration of our entire policy of economic legislation. "Subject to this proviso of the proper pro tection necessary to our Industrial well-being at home, the principle of reciprocity must command our hearty support. The pheno menal growth of our export trade emphasises the urgency of the need for wider markets and for a liberal policy in dealing with for eign nations. Whatever is merely petty and vexatious In the way of trade restrictions should be avoided. The customers to whom we dispose of our surplus products in. tho long run, directly or indirectly, purchase those surplus products by giving us some thing in return. Their ability to purchase our products should as far as possible be secured by so arranging our tariff as to en able us to take from them those products which we can use without harm to our own industries and labor, or the use of which will be of marked benefit to us. "We have now reached the point in the development of our interests where we are not only able to supply our own znarkeU but to produce a constantly growing surplus for which we must find markets abroad. To secure these markets we can utilize existing duties in any case where they are no longer needed for the purpose of protction. or in any case where the article is not produced here and the duty ts no longer necessary for revenue, as giving us something to offer in exchange for what we ask. The cordial re lations with other nations which are so de sirable will naturally be promoted by the. course thus required by our own interests. "The natural line of development for a policy of reciprocity will be in connection with those of our productions which no long er require all of the support once needed to establish them upon a sound basis, and with those others where either because of natural or of economic causes we are beyond the reach of successful competition. "I ask the attention of the Senate to the reciprocity treaties laid before it by my pre decessor. Our Merchant Marine. "The condition of the American merchant marine is such as to call for immediate remedial action by the Congress. It is dis creditable to us as a Nation that our mer chant marine should be utterly insignificant In comparison to that of other nations which we overtop In other forms of business. "American shipping is under certain great disadvantages when put in competition with the shipping of foreign countries. Many of the fast foreign steamships, at a speed of fourteen knots or above, are subsidized and all our ships, sailing vessels and steamers alike, cargo carriers of slow speed and mail carriers of high speed, have to meet the fact that the original cost of building Ameri can ships Is greater than is the case abroad that the wages paid American officers and seamen are very much higher than those paid the officers and sesmen of foreign competing countries and that the standard of living on our ships Is far superior to the standard of living on the ships of our commercial rivals. "Our government should take such action •as will remedy these inequalities. The Amer ican merchant marine should be restored to the ocean. "The Act of March 14. 1900, Intended un equivocally to establish gold as the standard money and to maintain at a parity therewith all forms of money medium In use with us, has been shown to be timely and judicious. The price of our government bonds in the world's market, when compared with the price of similar obligations issued by other nauons. Is a flattering tribute to our public credit. This condition it is eminently desir able to maintain. "In many respects the National Banking Law furnishes sufficient liberty for the proper exercise of the banking function but there seems to be need of better safeguards against the deranging influence of commercial crises and financial panics. Moreover, the currency of the country should be made responsive to the demands of our domestic trade and commerce. Reduction of Revenues. "The collections from duties on imports and internal taxes continue to exceed the ordi nary expenditures. The utmost care should be taken not to reduce the revenues so Uiat thre will be any possibility of a deficit out, after providtng against any such contingency, means should be adopted which will bring the revenues more nearly within the limit-of our actual needs. "I call special attention to the,need of strict economy in expenditures. The fact that our national needs forbid us to be niggardly in providing whatever Is actually necessary to our well-being, should make us doubly care ful to husband our national resources, as each of us husbands his private resources, by scrupulous avoidance of anything like waste ful or reckless expenditure. Regulation of Railroads. In 1837 a measure was enacted for the reg ulation of Interstate railways, commonly known as the Interstate Commerce Act. The cardinal provisions of that act were that railway rates should be just and reasonable and that all shippers, localities, and commo dities should be accorded equal treatment. A commission was created and endowed with what were supposed to be the necessary pow ers to execute the provisions of this act. "That law was largely an experiment. Ex perience has shown the wisdom of its pur poses, but has also shown, possibly that some of Its requirements are wrong, certainly that the means devised for the enforcement of its provisions are defective. "The act should be amended. The railway Is a public servant. Its rates should be just to and open to all shippers alike. The gov ernment should see to it that within its juris diction this is so and should provide a speedy, inexpensive, and effective remedy to that end. At the same time It mast not be forgotten that our railways are the arteries through which the commercial lifeblood of this nation flows. Nothing could be more foolish than the en actment of legislation which would unneces sarily interfere with the development and operation of these commercial agencies. The subject is one of great Importance and calls for the earnest attention of the Congress. The message points out the value of the American forests and the necessity for their conservation, and urges the construction and maintenance of reservoirs and irrigating systems for the reclamation of the arid lands of the West. Of the water rights It says: "'In the arid states the only right to water which should be recognized is that of use. In irrigation this right should attach to the land reclaimed and be inseparable therefrom. Granting perpetual water rights to others than users, without compensation to the public, is open to all the objections which apply to giving away perpetual franchises to the nubile utilities of cities. A few of the Western states have already recognized this and have incorporated in their constitutions the doctrine, of perpetual state ownership of water. Development of Hawaii. "Our aim should be not simply to reclaim the largest area of land and provide homes for the largest number of people, but to create for this new Industry the best possible social and industrial conditions and this re quires that we not only understand the ex isting situation, but avail ourselves of the best experience of the time in the solution of Its problems. A careful study should be made, both by the nation and the states, of the irigatiop laws and conditions here and abroad. Ultimately It will probably be neces sary for the nation to co-operate with the several arid states in proportion as these states by their legislation and administration show themselves fit to receive it. "In Hawaii our aim must be to develop the territory on the traditional American lines. We do not wish a region of large cltle3 tilled by cheap labor we wish a healthy American community of men who themselves till the farms they own. A11 our legislation for the islands should be shaped with this end in view the well-being of the average home maker must afford the true test of the healthy development of the islands. The land policy should as nearly as possibje be modeled on our homestead system. "It is a pleasure to say that it is hardly more necessary to report as to Porto Rico than as to c.ry state or territory within our continental limits. The Island is thriving as never before, and It is being administered efficiently and honestly. Its people are now enjoying liberty and order under the pro lertipu of tho United States, and upon this f:\ft we congratulate them and ourselves. Th' irnterial welfare must be as carefully and jealously considered as the welfare of kl°X any other portion of our oountry. We have UM tSTiraat gift of *2 their products to tha markets of tho United Statesf I ask the Attention of the Con«r«" to tha need of legislation concerning the pub lic lands of Porto Rico Pi gross In Cubs.

In the case of Cuba, however, there are weighty reasons of nwrallty and tional Interest why the policy should be held to have a peculiar application, and 1 J"®** earnestly ask your attention to the wisdom, indeed to the vtt*l need, of Pro*Jd'"*,'®r(,? substantial reduction In the tariff duties on Cuban imports Into tha UniIted States has in hsr constitution affirmed what we de sired, that she should stand, matters.

Tho Philippine Problem. "In the Philippines our problem Is They are very rich tropical Islands, inhabi ted by many varying tribes, representing widely different stages of progress toward civilization. Our earnest effort is to help these people upward along the stony and au ficult path that leads to self-government, we hope to make our administration of the is lands honorable to our naitlon by making of the highest benefit to the Filipinos them selves and as an earnest of what we intend to do, we point to what we have done. Al ready a greater measure of material prosper ity and of governmental honesty and effici ency has been attained In the Philippines than ever before In their history. "In dealing with the Philippine pwple we must show both patience and strength, ror bearance and steadfast resolution. Our aim is high. We do not desire to do for the is landers merely what has elsewhere been done for tropic peoples by even the best foretgn governments. W hope to do for them what has never before been done for any people of the tropics—to make them fit for self government after the fashion of the really free nations. "To leave the islands at this time would mean that they would fall into a welter of murderous anarchy. Such desertion of duty on our part would be a crime against hu manity. The character of Governor Taft and of his associates and subordinates is a proof, if such be needed, of the sincerity of our ef fort to give the Islanders a constantly in creasing measure of self-government, exactly as fast as they show themselves fit to exer cise it. Since the civil government was es tablished cot an appointment has been made in the islands with any reference to consider ations of political Influence, or to aught else save the fitness of the man and the needs of the service. "There are still troubles ahead in tho is lands. The insurrection has become an affair of local banditti and marauders, who deserve no higher regard than the brigands of por tions of the old world. Encouragement, di rect or indirect, to these lnsurrectos stands on the same footing as encouragement to hos tile Indians In the days when we still had In dian wars. As we will do everything In our power for the Filipino who is peaceful, we will take the sternest measures with the Filipinos who follow the path of the insur recto and the ladrone. ,, "The time has come when there should be additional legislation for the Philippine. Nothing better can be done for tho islands than to Introduce Industrial enterprises. Nothing would benefit them so much as throwing them open to industrial develop ment. It is therefore necessary that the Congress should pass laws by which the re sources of the islands can be deyeloped: so that franchises (for limited terms of years) can be granted to companies doing business in them, and every encouragement be given to the incoming of business men of every call your attention most earnestly to the crying need of a cable to Hawaii and the Philippines, to be continued from the Phil ippines to points In Asia. We should not defer a day longer than necessary the con struction of such a cable. It is demanded not merely for commercial but for political and military considerations. "Either the Congress should immediately provide for the construction of a govern ment cable, or else an arrangement should be made by which like advantages to those accruing from a government cable may be secured to the government by contract with a private cable company. Recommends Nlcaraguan Canal* "No single great material work which re mains to be undertaken on this continent Is of such consequence to the American people as the building of a canal across the Isthmus connecting North and South America. While its beneficial effects would perhaps be most marked upon the Pacific coast and the gulf and South Atlantic states, it would also greatly benefit other sections. It Is em phatically a work which it is for the interest of the entire country to begin and complete as soon as possible It Is one of those great works which only a great nation can under take with prospects of success, and which when done are not only permanent assets in the nation's material Interests, but stand ing monuments to its constructive ability. "I am glad to be able to announce to you that our negotiations on this subjcct with Great Britain, conducted on both sides In a spirit of friendliness and mutual good will and respect, have resulted In my being able to lay before the Senate a treaty which if ratified will enable us'to begin preparations for an Isthmfan canal-at any time, and which guarantees to this nation every right that it hft* erer asked in connection with the canal. In this treaty, the old Clayton-Bul wer treaty, so long recognised as inadequate to supply the base for the construction and maintenance of a necessarily American ship canal. Is abrogated. It specifically provides that the United States alone shall do the work of building and assume the responsi bility of safeguarding the canal and shall regulate Its neutral use by all nations on terms of equality without the guaranty or Interference of any outside nation from any quarter. The signed treaty will at once be laid before the Senate, and if approved the Congress can then proceed to give effect to the advantages it secures us by providing for the building of tho canal. "The true end of every great and free peo ple should be self-respecting smi-barbarous "This same peace conference acquiesced in our statement of -the Monroe doctrine as compatible with the purposes and aims of the conference. "The Monroe doctrine should be the car dinal feature of the foreign policy of all the nations of the two Americas, as it is of the United States. The doctrine is a declara tion that there -onust be no territorial ag grandizement by any non-American power at the expense of any American power on Amer ican soil. It is In no wise Intended as hostile to any nation in the old world. Still less is it intended to give cover to any aggression by one new world power at the expense of any other. It is simply a step, and a long step, toward assuring the universal peace of the world by securing the possibility of per manent peace on this hemisphere. "This doctrine has nothing to do with the commercial relations of any American power, save that It in truth allows each of them to form such as it desires. In other words, it is really a guaranty of the commercial In dependence of the Americas. We do not ask under this doctrine for any exclusive com mercial dealings with any other American state. We do not guarantee any state against punishment if it misconducts itself, pro vided that punishment does not take the form of the acquisition of territory by any non-American power. "Our attitude In Cuba is a sufficient guar anty of our own good faith. We have not the slightest desire to secure any territory at the expense of any of our neighbors. We wish to work with them hand in hand, so that all of us may be uplifted together, and wo rejoice over the good fortune of any of tnem, we gladly hail their material prosper ity and political stability, and are concerned and alarmed if any of them fall into Indus­ we 4 4 peace and this nation most earnestly desires sincere and cordial friendship with all others. Over the entire world, of recent years, wars between the great civilized powers have become less and less frequent. Wars with barbarous or peoples come in an entirely different category, being merely a most re grettable but necessary International police duty which must be performed for the dake of the welfare of mankind. Peace can only be kept with certainty where both sides wish to keep it but more and more the civilized peoples are realizing the wicked folly of war and are attaining that condition of just and intelligent regard for the rights of others which will in the end, as we hope and be lieve, make world-wide peace possible. The peace conference at The Hague gave definite expression to this hope and belief and mark ed a stride toward their attainment. *iti-,/,''A '&»?*£}>+ trial or political chaos.

Unless our commerce is always to be carried in for eign bottoms, we must have war craft to protect it. "So far from being In any way a provoca tion to war, an adequate and highly trained navy is the best guaranty sgalnst war, the cheapest and most effective peace insurance. The cost of building and maintaining such a navy represents the very lightest premium for Insuring .paece which this nation can possibly pay. "Probably no other great nation in the world is so anxious for peace as we are. There Is not a single civilised power which has anything whatever to fear from ag gressiveness on our part. All we want Is peace and toward this end we wish to be able to secure the same respeict for our rights In return, to Insure fair treatment to us commercially, and to guarantee the safety of the American people. "Our people intend to abide by the Mon roe doctrine and to insist upon it as the one sure means of securing the peace of the Western hemisphere. The navy offers us the only means of making our insistence upon the Monroe doctrine anything but a sub ject of derision to whatever nation chooses to disregard it. We desire the peace which comes as of right to the just man armed not the peace granted on terms of ignominy to the craven and the weakling. "It is not possible to improvise a navy after war breaks out. The ships must be built and the men trained long in advance. In the late war with Spain the ships that dealt the decisive blows at Manila and San tiago had been launched from two to four teen years, and they were able to do as they did because the men in the conning towers, the gun turrets and the engine-rooms had through long years of practice at sea learned to he "It was forethought and preparation which secured us the overwhelming triumph of 1898. If we fail to show forethought and prepara tion now, there may come a time when dis aster will befall us instead of triumph and should this time come, the fault will* rest primarily, not upon those whom the acci dent of events puts In supreme command at the moment, but upon those who have failed to prepare In advance. "There should be no cessation In the work of completing our navy. It is unsafe and unwise not to provide this year for several additional battleships and heavy armored cruisers, with auxiliary and lighter craft in proportion for the exact numbers and char acter I refer you to the report of the Secre tory of the Navy. But there is something we need even more than additional ships, and this is additional officers and men. To pro vide battleships and cruisers and then lay them up. with the expectation of leaving them unmanned until they are needed in actual war, would be worse than folly It would be a crime against the nation. "To send any warship Need for Powerful Navy. "The American people must either build and maintain an adequate navy or else make up their minds definitely to accept a sec ondary position in international affairs, not merely In political but in commercial, mat ters. It has been well said that there is no surer way of courting national disaster than to be 'opulent, aggressive, and unarmed.' "It Is not necessary to increase our army beyond its present size at this time. But it Is necessary to keep' It at the highest point of efficiency. Every effort should be made to bring the army to a constantly Increasing state of ef ficiency. When on actual service no .work save that directly in the line of such service should be required. The paper work in the army, as In the navy, should be greatly re duced. What is needed is proved power of command and capacity to work well In the field. Constant care is necessary to prevent dry rot in the transportation and commis sary departments. "The Congress should provide means where by it will be possible to have field exercises by at least a division of regulars, and if possible also a division of national guards men, once a year. "Only actual handling and providing for mon in masses while they are marching, campiug. embarking, and disembarking, will it be possible to train the higher officers to perform their duties well and smoothly. "A great debt is owing from the public to the men of the army and navy. They should be so treated as to enable them to reach the highest point of efficiency, so that they may be able to respond Instantly to any demand made upon them to sustain the interests of the nation and tho honor of the flag. The individual American enlisted man is prob ably on the whole a more formidable fighting man than the regular of any other army. Every consideration should be shown him, and in return the highest standard of use fulness should be exacted from him. It is well worth while for the Congress to con slder whether the pay of enlisted men upon second and subsequent enlistments should not be increased to correspond with the in creased value of the veteran soldier. Militia Laws Obsolete. "Action should be taken In reference to the militia and to the raising of volunteer forces. Our mllltla law is obsolete and worthless. The organization and armament of the Na tional Guard of the several states, which are treated as militia in the appropriations by the Congress, should be made identical with those provided for the regular forces. The obligations and duties of the Guard in time of war should be carefully defined, and a system established by law under which the method of procedure of raising volunteer forces should be prescribed tn advance. It is utterly impossible in the excitement and baste of Impending war to do this satisfac torily if the arrangements have not been made long beforehand. Provision should be made for utilizing in the .first volunteer or ganizations called out the training of those citizens who have already had experience un der arms, and especially for tho selection in advance of the offlcersi of any force which may be raised for careful selection of the kind necessary is impossible after the out break of war. "That the army Is not at all a mere in strument of destruction has been shown dur ing the last three years. In the Philippines, Cuba and Porto Rico it has proved itself a great constructive force, a most potent im plement for the upbuilding of a peaceful civ ilization. Eulogy of Veterans. "No other citizens deserve so well of the republic as the veterans, the survivors of MiSSlSlS .^,f»A«.iMW .«IBii»J^vi» against a competent enemy unless those aboard it have -been trained by years of actual sea service, In cluding incessant gunnery practice, would be to Invite not merely disaster, but the bitter est shame and humiliation. Four thousand additional seamen and one thousand addi tional marines should be provided and an increase in the officers should be provided by making a large addition to the classes at Annapolis. Our Present Naval Force. "We now have seventeen battleships ap propriated for, of which nine are completed and have been commissioned for actual serv ice. The remaining eight'will be ready In from two to four years, but It will take at least that time to recruit and train the men to fight them. It is of vast concern that we have trained crews ready for the vessels by the time they are commissioned. Good ships and good guns are simply good weapons, and the best weapons are useless save in the hands of men who know how to fight with them. The men must be trained and drilled under a thorough and well-planned system of progressive instruction, while the recruit ing must be carried on with still greater vigor. "The naval mllltla forces are state organl ations, and are trained for coast service, and In event of war they will constitute the inner line of defense. They should receive hearty encouragement from the general government. "But in addition we should at once pro vide for a National Naval Reserve, organized and trained under the direction of the Navy Department, and subject to tne call of the Chief Executive whenever war becomes Immi nent. It should be a real auxiliary to the naval seagoing peace establishment, and of fer material to be drawn on at once for manning our ships in time of war. It should be composed of graduates of the Naval Acad emy, graduates of the Naval Militia, officers and crews of coast-line steamers, longshore schooners, fishing vessels and steam yachts, together with the coast population about such centers as life-saving stations and light houses.

"For the sake of good administration, sound economy, and the advancement of science, the Census Office as now constituted should be made a permanent government bureau. Thii would Insure better, cheaper and more sat isfactory work, in the interest not only of our business but of statistic, economic and social science. k!»t Merit System Endorsed. ''Th* »»®rit system of making appointments Is in its essence as democratic and Am*rtM.V. as the common schools system Itself It «im ply means that In clerical and other' position where the duties are entirely non-politicii all applicants should have a fair field anfl no favor, each standing on his merits as ha ts able to show them by practical test Writ where mean8, yet the best present means of get ting satisfactory results. "It Is important to have this system ob tain at home, but it is even more important to have It applied rigidly in our insular pos sessions. The administration of these islands should be as wholly free from the susp cion of partisan politics arf the administration of the army and navy. All that we ask from the public servant In the Philippines or Porto Rico is that he reflect honor on his country by the way in which he makes that coun try's rule a benefit to the peoples who have come under It. This is all that we should ask, and wo cannot afford to be content wlt less." Treatment of Indians. The message points out the defects In our present consular service, and recommends ths passage of bills now before Congress that will increase Its efficiency. Of the Indian problem it says "In my judgment the time has arrived when we should definitely make up our minds to recognize the Indian as an Individual and not as a member of a tribe. The General Allotment Act is a mighty pulverizing engini to break up the tribal mass. It acts direct ly upon the family of the Individual. Undei its provisions some sixty thousand Indians have already become citizens of the United States. We should now break up the tribal funds, doing for them what allotment does for the tribal lands that Is, they should be divided into individual holdings. A stop should be put upon the indiscriminate per mission to Indians to lease their allotments. The effort should be Steadily to make ths Indian work like any other man on his own ground. The marriage laws bf the Indians should be made th« same as those of th* whites. ,' "In dealing with the aboriginal races few things are more important than to present them from the terrible physical and moral degradation resulting from the liquor traf fie. We are doing all we can to save our own Indian tribes from this *vil. Wherever by International agreement this same end can b« attained as regards races where we do not possess exclusive control, every effort Bhould be made to bring it about. "I bespeak the most cofdlal support from the Congress and the people for the St. Louts Exposition to Commemorate ths Qne Hun dredth Anniversary of the Louisiana Pur chase. This purchase was tte greatest in. stancl of expansion in our history. It def initely decided that we were to become a, great continental republic, by ^.r the fore most power in the la registra .extended There are, of course, places where the writ ten competitive examination cannot be an. plied, and others where It offers by no means an ideal solution, but where under existing political conditions it Is. though an Western Growth of Postal Service. "The remarkable growth of the postal ser vice Is shown in the fact that Its revenues have doubled and Its expenditures have near ly doubled within twelve years. Its progres sive development compels constantly increas ing outlay, but in this period of business en ergy and prosperity its reefctpts grow so mucb faster than its expenses that the annual de ficit has been steadily reduced from $11,411, 779 in 1897 to $3,923,727 In 1901. Among recent postal advances the success of rural free delivery wherever established has been so marked, and actual experience has mate Its benefits so plain, that the demand for its ex tension is general and urgent. "It is just that the great-agricultural popu lation should share in the Improvement of tha service. The number of rural routsa npw In operation Is 6,009, practically all established within three years, and there are 8.000 appli cations awaiting action. It ts expected that the number in operation at the close of the current fiscal year will reach i.60Q. The mail will then be dally carried to the doors of 5,700,000 of our people who have heretofore been dependent upon distant offices, ana one third of all that portion of the country which is adapted to it will be covered hy this kind of service. Second-Class Mall Matter. "The full measure of postal progress which might be realized has long been hampered and obstructed by the heavy burden Imposed on the government through the Intrenched and well-understood abuses which have grown up In connection with second class mail matter. The extent of this burden ap pears when It is stated that while the sec ond-class matter makes nearly three-fifths of the weight of all the mall, it paid for the last fiscal year only $4,294,445 of the aggre gate postal revenue of $111,631,193. If the pound rate of postage, which produces the large loss thus entailed, and which was fixed by the Congress with the purpose of encour aging the dissemination of public Informa tion, were limited to the legitimate news papers and periodicals actually contemplated by the law, no just exception could be taken. That expense would be the recognized and accepted cost of a liberal public policy de iiberately adopted for a justifiable end. Bui much of the matter which enjoys the privi leged rate is wholly outside of the intent of the law, and has secured admission only through an evasion of Its requirements or through lax construction. The proportion of such wrongly included matter is estimated by postal experts to be one-half of the whole volume of second-class mail. If it be only one-third or one-quarter, the magnitude ot the burden Is apparent. The Postoffice De partment has now undertaken to remove the abuses so far as is possible by a stricter ap plication of the law and it should be sus tained in its effort." "We view 'with lively interest and keen hopes of beneficial results the procedlngs of the Pan-American Congress, convoked at ths invitation of Mexico, and now sitting at the Mexican capital. The delegates of the United States are under the most liberal Instructions to co operate with their colleagues in all matters promising advantage to the great family of American commonwealths, as well in their relations among themselves as in their domestic advancement and in thelt intercourse with the world at large. The occurrences arising from the "Boxer outbreak tn China ars reviewed In detail, an4 the steps taken to Becure to the United States its share of the trade of the Orient are ex plained. The message concludes: "The death of Queen Victoria caused tn« people of the United StateB deep and heart felt sorrow, to which the government gavs full expression. When President McKInlej died, our nation in turn received from every quarter of the British empire expressions of grief and sympathy no less sincere. The death of the Empress Dowager Frederick or Germany also aroused the genuine sympathy of the American people and this sympathy was cordially reciprocated *jy Germany when tho President wa3 assassinated. Indeed, from every quarter of the civilixcd-. world wo re ceived, at the time of the President's death, assurances of such grief and regard as to touch the hearts of our people.
