WASHINGTON. D. C, Dec 2. "There is but one cloud upon our horizon. That has shown itself to the south of us, and hangs over Mexico. There can be no certain prospect of peace in America until Gen. Huerta has surrendered his usurped authority in Mexico; until it is understood on all hands, indeed, that such pretended governments will not be countenanced or dealt with by the government of the United States." This is the way president Woodrow Wilson deals with the Mexican situation, in his message to congress, read in person before that body today. Continuing, he says: "We are the friends of constitutional government in America; we are more than its friends, we are its champions; because in no other way can our neighbors, to whom we would wish in every way to make proof of our friend ship, work out their own development in peace alid liberty. Mexico has no government. The attempt to maintain one at the City of Mexico has broken down, and a mere military despotism has been set up which has hardly more than the semblance of national authority. It originated in the usurpation of Victoriano Huerta, who, after a brief attempt to play the part of constitu tional president, has at last cast aside even the pretense of legal right and de clared higiself dictator. "As a consequence, a condition of affairs now exists in Mexico which has made it doubtful whether even the most elementary and fundamental rights either of her own people or of the citizens of other countries resident within her territory can long be successfully safeguarded, andwhich threatens, if long continued, to imperil the interests. of peace, order, and tolerable life in the lands immediately to the south of us. "Even if the usurper had succeeded in his purposes, in despite of the con stitution of the republic and the rights of its people, he would have set up nothing but a precarious and hateful power, which could have lasted but a little while, and whose eventual downfall would have left the country in a more deplorable condition than ever. But he has not succeeded. He has for feited the respect and the moral support even of those who were at one time willing to see him succeed. Little by little he has been completely isolated. By a little every day his power and prestige are crumbling and the collapse is not far away. "We shall not, I believe, be obliged to alter our policy of watchful waiting. And then, when the end comes, we shall hope to see constitutional crder restored m distressed Mexico by the concert and energy of such of her leaders as prefer the liberty of their people to their own ambitions." President "Wilson, rend his messaged to congress at a Joint session ol both branches, at 1 o'clock In the house chamber. The message, among the briefest documents of Its kind from any president, about 3000 word. long, required less than 30 minutes for read ing, though it treated .upon a variety of subjects. Galleries packed with a brilliant ffompnny of officials and their fami lies greeted the president -when the Joint session got down to business. All present stood and a deafening roar of applause swept the chamber as Mr. Wilson took his place behind the desk and began to read at 1:0S o'clock. The president read easily and clearly in his usual pleasing tone, which 'carried his words to the doors of the chamber. o program for the trust legislation was presented, farther than the men tion of the deslrabDHy of an early amendment to the Sherman law, "to prevent private monopoly more effect ually than it has yet been prevented," and announcements that the president would later address a special message to congress dealing frith that subject The rest of the message follows: Leads in Peace Negotiations. Tte T'nited States, the president sa'd, stands at the front In peace ne gotiations with the nations of the world. "It has been the privilege of tp department of state." he said, "to rr ,it thp accent In nHnHnlf nt no less than 31 nations, representing four- fths of the population of the world, to the negotiation of treaties by which it shall be agreed that whenever differences of interest or of policy ' r.se which can not be resolved by the ordinary processes of diplomacy they shall be publicly analyzed, discussed, and reported upon by a tribunal

VILLA SAYS THEY GOT, HIS MONEY JUAN N. MEDINA, chief of staff of Gen. Pancho Villa, is in the EI Paso county jail, charged with bringing stolen property over the value of $50 Into the state. The complaint was fijed in the court of justice of the peace E. B. McClintock Tuesday morning, following which Medina was transferred from the city jail by dep uty constable J. W. Brown, to the county jail. t In the complaint signed ty city de tective Fred Delgado. it Is charged that the defendant had taken $7000 gold, and $14,000 Mexican money, the per sonal property of "Villa. Medina de clares that the charges are false and were trumped up by enemies. Medina was arrested at 604 Upson avenue Monday night at 7:45 o'clock by chief of detectives Jesse C. Stan sel Detectives N. Wood and O. W. Smith were with Stansel. The money claimed to have been takn has not been located. Medina was arrested-by Stansel on a cotnplaint charging him with a viola tion of the neutrality laws. Villa Causes Arrest. According to detective Stansel, Villa telephoned him at 5:30 o'clock Mon- i day afternoon and Requested mm to come to Juarez. "Through an inter preter," said Stansel, "Villa told me that Juan Medina had skipped out with something like $14,000, gold. He said .that It was Impossible to ascertain the exact amount, as every paper which had been kept by Medina in his office had either been destroyed or had in some way disappeared. Medina, Villa said, had received the money in the nature of hospital funds. It had been sent to Juarez from Sonora. and was intended to be expended in taking care of the, wounded and sick rebel sol 'dlers. "The missing money. Villa told me. was "all in currency, ranging in $20 bills to $100 bills. There were one or two $1,000 bills in the lot. "When I arrived at the house on Upson avenue, Medina was there. Sev eral Mexicans were there and there were four or five women in the house." YillR.ilnyTe.tIfy, The date of the examining trial be fore Judge McClintock has not been set. There is talk of trying to get the war department to allow Villa to come to this side to testify in the case when it comes up for trial.

Cootes came to the police station Tuesday morning when he was notified of Medina's arrest, but Medina had been turned over to the county officers. The report is that Medina became more or less angry when it was an nounced by Villa that he would be taken to the front anl Lieut. Col. Me dina Veytia would be left in charge at Juarez. Citizens of Juarez, it is, said, circulated a petition requesting that Medina be allowed to remain. Villa declined and ordered Medina to go to the front. Following this. It Is said that Me dina came to El Paso. After havingH I reached this side the detectives say mai lie wroie out ms resignation ana sent it to Juarez. This is denied by Medina's friends, it being said that be fore leaving Juarez, Medina wrote his resignation and sent it by a messenger to Villa. Others Are Missing. "I was not in hiding at all." said Medina. "I came to El Paso as a pri vate citizen, having resigned from the army. I was not discharged. The charge that I have stolen any prop erty is absolutely false. That is a put up job." Following the disappearance of Me dina from Juarez, Capt. Jose Covarru blas. Lauro Hurtado and twl Ameri cans, Capts. Holmdahl and Poole, are said to have come to this side of the river. All were close friends of Villa, It Is said that Covarrublas, who is a brother of one of Carranza's cabinet officers, has gone to Hermosillo to thresh out the whole matter with Car ranza.

City "Well Fortified. Besides being the capital of the state. Chihuahua, with a population normally of 35,000, is the metropolis of northern Mexico. Neither in the Madero revo lution nor in the present uprising has Chihuahua been taken from the fed erals. Its garrison and the command ing positions for sharpshooters and machine guns afforded by the cathe dral and public buildings, heretofore had presented a formidable barrier to invaders. Had the rebels reached the city and the federals resisted, it was believed that a fight in the city would have resulted in great loss of life and property. Viaduct Reported Destroyed. Conditions in the city were said to be such that life there was no longer en durable. The Spanish viaduct, which conveyed water from the mountains, was reported to have been destroyed and the food supplies exhausted. Gen. Villa last night telegraphed de tails of the evacuation to Venustiano Carranza, at Hermosillo, stating that tne proposed advance of the rebels southward to Mexico City would now be expedited. The possession of the city, he said, would make rebel terri tory of the country straight through to Zacatecas and operations would begin about that city and at Aguascalientes.

Among the besieged citizens at Chi huahua who are now believed to be seeking refuge elsewhere were Juan Creel, a banker and relative of En rique Creel, former supporter of presi dent Diaz: Gen. Luis Terrazas, exgov ernor, and Albert Terrazas, a wealthy landowner and son of the general. Gen. Villa said Federlco Moye, promi nent merchant, had been named civil governor of Chihuahua state, his se lection being based on the belief that he would be acceptable to the rebels.
