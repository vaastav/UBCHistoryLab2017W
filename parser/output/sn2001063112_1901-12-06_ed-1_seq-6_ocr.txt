ROOSEVELT'S MESSAGE READ Buffalo Tragedy Deplored and Eloquent Tribute to McKinley. TO SUPPRESS ANARCHY Apostles of Assassination Must Be Treated as Common Criminals. TRUSTS AND THE TARIFF Publicity Suggested as Remedy for Evils of the Former—Mild Tariff Reform Recommendation Monroe Doctrine. Washington. Dec. 3.—President Roose velt's message was read in congress to day. It is as follows: ir.onth. Of the, last Fevcn elected presidents he Is the third who has been murdered, and this fact is sufficient to justify alarm. Moreover, the circumstances have a pe culiarly sinister significance. Both Lin coln and Garfield were killed by assassins of types unfortunately not uncommon in history, Lincoln falling a victom to the passions of war, and Garfield to the re vengeful vanity of a disapointed office seeker. President McKinley was killed by an utterly depraved criminal belong ing to that body of criminals who obiect to all governments, good and bad alike, who are against any form of popular lib erty if it is guaranteed by even the most Just and liberal laws, and who are as hos tile to the upright exponent of a free peo ple's sober will as to the tyrannical and irresponsible despot. It Is not too much to say that at the time of President McKinlev's death he was the most widely loved man in all the United States, while we have never had any public man of his position so free from the animosities incident to public life. His political opponents were first to bear the heartiest tribute to the charac ter which so endeared him. To a stand ard of lofty integrity in public life he united tender affections and home vir tues. all-important in the make-up of na tional character. A gallant soldier in the '-as President McKinley was a man of mod erate means, \tho had himself belonged I amonk the wage-workers, who had en tered the army as a private soldier. Wealth was not struck at when the pres- I Ident was assassinated, but honest toil. Still less was power struck at In the sense that power is Irresponsible or cen- I tered in the hands of any one individual. The blow was aimed at one of the strong- I est champions the wage-worker has ever had one of the most faithful representa tives of public rights and representative government who has ever risen to public office. No president—not even Lincoln was ever more anxious to represent the wishes of the people his one anxiety was to keep In closest touch with the people— lo find out what they thought and to ex press their thought, after having endeav Vred to guide that thought aright. He iiad lust been re-elected because the ma jority of citizens believed that he had up held their Interests. Crime Without a Parallel. And this was the man at whom the as sassin struck! That there might be noth ing lacking to complete the Judas-like in famy of his act, he took advantage of an occasion when the president was meeting the people generally and advancing as if to take the hand outstretched to him in kindly and brotherly fellowship, he turned I ^reng'th ofTur nation"6"" the noble and generous confidence of the victim into an opportunity to strike th_ fatal blow. There is no baser deed in all the annals of crime. Tho shock, the grief of the country, are bitter In the mi*ds of ail who saw the dark days while the president vet hovered between life and death. At last the light was stilled in the kindly eves and the breath went from the lips that even in mortal agony uttered no words savo of forgiveness to his murderer, of love for his friends, and of unfaltering trust in the will of the most high. Such a death, crowning- the glory of such a life, leaves mand our wisest and most resolute ac- I The anarchist is merely one tvpe of criminal, more dangerous because he rep resents depravity in a greater degree. The man who advocates anarchy or apologizes for anarchists and their 'deeds makes himself morally accessory tn mur der. The anarchist's perverted' Instincts lead him to prefer chaos to social order His protest of concern for working men Is outrageous in its falsity for if the po Iltical institutions of this country do not afford opportunity to every honest and Intelligent son of toil, then the door of hope is forever closed against him. If ever anarchy is triumphant, its triumph will last for but o.ne red moment, to be succeeded for ages by the gloomy night of despotism. Some Remedies Suggested. For the anarchist himself we need not I have more concern than for any murderer Ile is not tlie victim of social or poliiicai injustice. The cause of his criminality is his evil passions and the evil conduct of those who urge hlin on, not in unv fail ure to do justice to him or his. lie is a malefactor and nothing else. He is no "product of social conditions," save as a highwayman is "produced" by the fact that an unarmed man happens to have a purse. No man preaching anarchistic doctrines should be allowed at large any more than if preaching the murder of some specified private Individual. An archistic speeches, writings and meetings Are seditious and treasonable. I earnestly recommend that congress anarchists. Such Individuals as those who gathered to glorify the murder of Hint Humbert perpetrate a crime the law should punish. They should be kept out of this country if found here they should be prompUy deported and provision should be made for the punishment of those who stay. The federal courts should be gix'en juris diction over any man who kills or at tempts to kill the president or any man in line of succession for the presidency, while the punishment for an unsuccessful attempt should be proportioned to tlie enormity of the offense against our in stitutions. Anarchy is a crime against the whole human race. The crime should be made an offense against tb£ law of nations, like piracy and the slave Trade for it is black er than either. It should be so declared by treaties among all civilized powers. Such treat lees would give the federal government power of dealing with the crime. A grim commentary upon the folly of THE 

TRUST PROBLEM. To the Senate and House of Representa tives: The congress assembles this year under the shadow of a great calamity. On the 6th of September President McKinley was shot by an anarchist at Buffalo, and died in that city on the 14th of that tion is to be congratulated because of its Publicity the Only Remedy for the Present During the last live years busines: fidence has been restored, and present abounding prosperity. Such pros perity can never be created by law alone, although it is easy enough to destroy it by mischievous laws. The idle or credu lous, who seek gains not by genuine work but by gambling in any form, are always a menace. If the business world loses its head. It loses what legislation cannot supply. Fundamentally the welfare of each citizen, and therefore of the nation, must rest upon individual thrift, energy, resolution and intelligence. Nothing can take the place of this individual capacity but wise legislation and honest and intel ligent administration can give It the full est scope and opportunity. The tremendous and highly complex industrial development during the latter half of the nineteenth century brings us face to face with serious so cial probletns. The old laws and customs which had almost the force of law were once sufficient to regulate accumulation I and distribution of wealth.

This criminal was a professed an archist, Inflamed by the teachings of pro fessed anarchists, and probably also by the reckless utterances of those who, on the stump and in the public press, appeal to the dark and evil spirits of malice and greed, envy and sullen hatred. The blow was aimed not at this presi dent, but at all presidents at everv svm bol of government. President McKinley was as emphatically the embodiment of popular will as a New Kngland town in what manner it is practicable to apply remedies. All this is true, yet there are real and grave evils, one of the chief being over- evlls- There is springs from no spirit of consider the coming to this country of violence. Great corporations exist only because they are created and safe-guarded by our institutions, and It is therefore our right and our duty to see that they work in harmony with these institutions.. The first essential in determining how to deal with the great industrial combi nations is publicity. The government should have the right to inspect the workings of great corporations engaged in interstate business. Publicity is the only sure remedy we can now invoke. What further remedies are needed in the way of governmental regulation or tax ation can only be determined after pub licity has been obtained, by process of law and in the course of administration. The first requisite is knowledge, full and complete. Artificial bodies, such as corporations, depending upon law for existence or priv ileges, should be subject to proper govern mental supervision, and full and accu rate information as to their operation* should be made public regularly at reason able intervals. The large corporations, commonly called the anarchist position was afforded by trusts, though organized in one state, al the attitude of the law toward this very ways do business in many states, often doing very little business in the state where they are incorporated. There is utter lack of uniformity in the state laws criminal. The people would have lorn him limb from limb if it had not been that the law he defied was at once in voked in his behalf. The government was obliged to exert its full power to save him from instant death. Moreover, his deed worked not the slightest dislocation in our governmental system, and the danger of it recurrence of such deeds would only strengthen and give harshness to the forces of order. No man wiil ever be re strained from becoming president by fear as to his personal safety. If the risk to the about them, and as no state has any ex clusive interest in or power over their acts, it has in practice proved impossible to get adequate regulation through state action. Therefore, in the interest of the whole people, the nation should, without interfering with the power of the states in the matter itself, also assume power of supervision and regulation over all cor porations doing an interstate business. president's life became great, the office This is especially true where the corpor would come to be filled by men resolute ation derives a portion of its wealth from imd merciless In dealing with disorder.

For National Regulation. When the constitution was adopted no human wisdom could foretell the sweep ing changes which were to take place by the beginning of the twentieth century. At that time it was a matter of course that the several states were the proper authorities to regulate the insignificant and local corporate bodies. Conditions are now different and different action I called for. I believe that a law can be framed which will enable the national government to exercise control along the lines above indicated, profiting by the ex perience gained through the passage and administration of the Interstate commerce act. If, however, the judgment of congress is that it lacks constitutional power, then a constitutional amendment should be submitted to confer the power. There should be created a cabinet of ficer, to be known as secretary of com merce and industries, as provided in the bill introduced at the last session of the congress. It should be his province to deal with commerce, including wnatover concerns labor pnd all matters affecting the great business corporations and our merchant marine.

Not only must our labor be protected by the tariff, but it should also be protected so far as it is possible from the presence in this country of any la borers brought over by contract, or who represent a standard of living so depressed that they can undersell our men in the labor market. I regard it as necessary to re-enact Immediately the law excluding Chinese laborers, and to strengthen it. The national government should demand the highest quality of sen-ice from its employes, and in turn it should be a good employer. If possible legislation should be passed, in connection with the inter state commerce law, which will render effective the efforts of different states to do away with the competition of convict contract labor in the open labor market.

CONGRESS IS IN SESSION AGAIN Adjournment Taken Until To morrow After Opening Formalities. NEW SENATORS SWORN IN Dietrich and Millard, of Nebraska and Kittredge, of South Dakota, Take the Oath-Speaker Henderson Re-Elected. Washington, Dec. 4.—The opening of the first session of the Fifty-seventh congress at noon today drew to the capltol a great throng of spectators eager to witness the scenes of anima tion which mark the annual reassem bling of the national lawmakers. Although the actual work of the tws. houses was not to begin until 12 o'clock the historic old structure, now refur nished from end to end, until It shone with marble, gilt and rich decorations, was astir long before that hour. Many ladies were in the throng, including the wives and families of senators and members, as well as many of the fem inine representatives of the cabinet, diplomatic and executive circles. The senators and members began ar riving early in the day, and there was the usual handshaking among old friends and Informal talk of work ahead. Allison an Early Arrival. The veteran senator from Iowa, Al lison, was one of the first to reach the senate wing and resume his work as chairman of the committer on appro priations. Senator Jones of Arkansas, democratic floor leader in the senate, was another early arrival, and soon had a circle of his democratic col leagues in the cloak room discussing the session's program. Speaker Hen derson did not reach the house wing until shortly before the session opened, and remained in his private office con ferring with members during the form alities preceding his re-election as speaker. New Senators Sworn In. Both houses of congTess were called to order at noon, and the fifty-seventh session begun most auspiciously. A large crowd was in attendance and the usual scenes attendant upon the opening of a session were re-enacted. In the senate Dietrich and Millard of Nebraska, Gibson of Montana and Kit redge of South Dakota, were sworn in as senators. After the usual resolu tion, the apointment of a committee to notify the president the senate was in session, a recess of thirty minutes was taken. The senate took a further recess un til 2 o'clock to await the organization of the housfr and tne appointment of a committee to wait upon the president. At 2 o'clock the senate reassembled. Gamble announced the death of the late Senator 'Kyle and. the senate ad journed. House Called to Order. Clark McDowell called the house to order. At the conclusion of the roll call, showing 31S members present, Mr. Cannon of Illinois, nominated David B. Henderson of Iowa, and Mr. Hay of Virginia, nominated Mr. Richardson of Tennessee, for speaker. Roll call for election then followed. The vote re sulted: Henderson, 190 Richardson, 149 Stark of Nebraska, 1 Cummings, of New Tork, 1. Henderson was declared elected and was escorted to the chair by the other three men voted for. He made a brief speech thanking the house for the ex pression of confidence and asked the support of all members. The oath was then administered by Representative Bingham of Pennsylvania and the speaker administered the oath to the members-elect. Several thousand bills have already been introduced in the house, covering nearly every phase of public affairs that has attracted interest in the coun try. They include a Pacific cable, oleomargarine, amending the tariff law, repeal of the bankruptcy law, for a reciprocity commission, the admission of states, the establishment of a de partment of commerce, amending the currency law amending the immigra tion law, etc., etc. 

GAGE'S ESTIMATE. Appropriations for the Fiscal Year Ending June 30. 1903. Washirlgton, Dec. 4.—The secretary of the treasury today transmitted to congress estimates of the appropria tions for government service for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1902, as fur nished by the heads of the several ex ecutive departments. The total appro priations asked for are $610,828,090, $16,000,000 less than the estimates for 1902 and $4,000,000 more than the appro priations for that year.

Dec. 4.—A London cable gram says: It is becoming clearer daily that tne vacillating policy of the British go\ ernmont har. again taken a wide swing, and every effort is now being made to Induce the Boers to accept easy terms of peace. The official declarations of only a tew Vt'e€»ks ngo that unconditional surrender would alone be accepted, and that no shred of independence would be permit ted to the Transvaal, are now ex plained to mean something very differ ent from tho obvious signification of these simple words. The government has. in fact, let it become known that it is quite ready to enter into negotia tions with any responsible Boer com mander on the basis of concession of ultimate local representative self-gov ernment. The greatest significance or this announcement lies in its recep tion by the British public. There has not been a single jingo protest. The extraordinary volte-face of the ministry has been allowed to pass al most without comment. The silence is so general that one is almost compelled to believe it due to one of those quiet official intimations sometimes given to the unionist press in moments of na tional emergency. There is no sign whatever of the spontaneous popular protest which a suggestion would have aroused only a year or so ago. The government, if it wished to convince public cninion in favor of bringing the war to a close on any terms short of conceding independence to the Trans vaal. has reason to be satisfied with the effect or non-effect of its really mo mentous announcement. Next probably will come a definite declaration in the same direction. The impression prevails in authoritative quarters that at the Guild hall next week, when the city council entertains the Prince of Wales to luncheon, Mr. Joseph Chamberlain will make a speech of the first importance, stating in clear language the terms which the govern ment is prepared to give to the Boers. The earl of Rosebery will propose the toast of "Prosperity to the Colonies," at the direct request of the king, an-1 that fact itself is of considerable sig nificance. His majesty, it is well known, is extremely desirous that his coronation year should be ushered in by the establishment of peace through out the empire and if Mr. Chamber lain should announce modification in the terms designed to pla cate the Boers, the credit for the same should be given to his royal master. The campaign in South Africa has become an inscrutable mystery. Nobody ventures to forecast how much time the business of over taking and running down 8,000 or 10.000 guerrillas will require. Nobody under takes to explain how the country can be held and fresh uprising and con spiracies be prevented after the bands now in the field are captured and there is a general release of prisoners. The new taxes, until the budget speech is made, are as much a mystery as Lord Kitchener's campaign. But, while great business interests are more or less menaced by increased duties, and the income taxpayer is staggering under the present burdens, there is no political uprising against the govern ment. 

SAYS HEALY MUST DIE. Roosevelt Paspes Upon Sentence oi Convicted Soldier. Washington, Dec. 2.—President Roose velt has confirmed a sentence of death imposed by a general court-martial convened at Nueva Caceres, Philippine islands, upon Private Daniel Healy, Company C, Twenty-seventh infantry, who was tried for and found guilty of murder and sentenced to be hanged. This is the second instance since Mr. Roosevelt entered upon his duties as president of the United States wherein a death sentence imposed upon an American soldier has been approved by him. In but one case did the late Pres ident McKinley sign the death warrant of a soldier of the United States—that of Phineas Foutz, an Ohio soldier, who murdered his Filipino sweetheart. It is said at the war department that Healy's crime was the shooting of a sergeant of his company while the lat ter was asleep. THE
