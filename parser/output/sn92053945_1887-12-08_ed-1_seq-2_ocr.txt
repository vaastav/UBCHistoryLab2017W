Repab.lritn ComiHentlaUon. Il is ?ery tvidHit thai PrcsHknt Ove Und It? struck a prpulnr rlmrd tltrouli bis rncnnfT it ll Fifiuah rin..re8. The democratic pres of th. country are MDirereally pliasd wiUi it. and large number of lending nod influential n-pub .icon journals do nni hesitate to pro nounce it an able and strung document and really endorse the president ideas of tariff reduction. Asnn indiration of the favor with which the uiefSHiie lias been received, we copy a portion of the editor ial comment of the ChicBK" Tribune, tin leading republiPHii paper of the north west: Tbe message is able and statesman like; luminous in style; perspieu -us in statement; clear in its reamming; and ir refutable in its conclusions. It is moder ate protection doctrine, such as has been exemplified more than once in the public utterances of both the great political par lies. The message is devoted to the discus sion of three eeueral propositions: First, that the surplus revenues are ex nessive and dangerous, aid ought to he distributed back among the people from whim they were drawn. Second, that the system of finance which results in the accumulation in the public treasury of such enormous sums of money not needed for public purposes is unsound and ought to be amended. Thir l, that tbe best method of (list rib uting the present surplus and brining tbe revenues permanently to sn equal. U with the neccsstry expenditures of tbe government aud the requirements of the sinking fund is to reduce the exorbitant taxes upon imports by adding to the free list and cutting down severely the tariff rates on all necessaries of life. During the last fiscal yeat, as the mes sage explains, tbe treasury department could use a large amount of what would otherwise have been surplus revenue in reducing tbe national debt, but all thai is now at a standstill. Every bond sub ject to tall has been called, and the con tribution lo tbe sinking fund lor the present year completed by tbe purchase of all tbe government bonds contemplat ed by the sinking fund art. The presi dent evidently does not think any more favorable of the policy of relief by strain ing the Bpecial depository act than the Tribune does, and does not propose to allow a policy of that kind to become permanent. There is really nothing to do with tbe surplus but to pile it ud Extravagant appropriations atid expedi ents of dubious legality for affording partial relief must not be relied on. There is a way to prevent accumulation of excessive revenue without any exercise of uncertain authority, and if congress does not exercise that power, upon its head and not upon that of tbe executive, will rest the responsibility. That is the tone of tbe message, aud almost its precise language. The surplus waB about 55 millions at the beginning of tha present fic&l year (June 30), notwithstanding the fact that during the last half of the year 3 per cent bonds to the extent of almost 80 millions were called in. The excess for the first half of the current vear was over 55 millions. The water is pouring in, and there being no outlet, a desolat ing flood iB eminent. There are only two sources of internal revenue of anv impor tance in this connection, the liquor and tobacco taxes, neither of which would tbe president disturb, but there are about four thousand sources of impost revenue. Very many articles subject to duty be would add to the fiee list and some others be would materially reduce. He does not go in to details with anv fullness, but he does pay his addresses to the flock masters and their demand that Buch a necessary of life as wool, required all the time in one form or another hy every man, woman and child in the United States shall be taxed and made more expensive for their individual benefit. Their impudent claim to be the "farming interest f tbe country is enough to justify attention from the presidential boot, and it must be conceded tbat the kick is administered with a will. The same trench aut pen that is supposed to have indited tbe more telling of the late Mr. Ti Men's public ut terances and Secretary Manning's last annual report must have drawn this in dictment of tbe flock masters, but who ever did it it is excellently well done and cannot fail to exert a wholesome influ ence. Iowa HortienliurintM. The Eastern Iowa association of Hor ticulturists convened in eighteenth an nual session at Davenport yesterday forenoon.

At the Grand Pacific in Chicago the other night, a numter of the big men of Moline, Rock Island and Davenport were gathered together. In the course of conversation, the Moline man said he had just mailed his wife a check for $20,000, The Rock Island man said he would not be outdone, so he wrote his check for 950,000 and sent it to his wife. The Davennorter was not a bit bashful, and aid the best woman In the world de served a good present, and wrote a few lines to his wife and enclosed his check for $100,000, as a token of love and es teem. The checks all came to band, and what surprised wives there must have been in tbe three cities. These gentle men will find no objection to their going to Chicago as often as they please in the future.

DEALERS IN FLEECES UTTER A VOi CIFEROUS PROTEST Against the President's Treatmeiit of Their Industry Secretary FlrchlltT Contribution to the Tariff Dlscaasloa A IMMqulsltlon on SiWer Minneapolis Men with Their Goats OA. Washington City, Dec. 8. Tbe member of the wool conference here severely criticise he section of tlta president's message relating to the wool question. "There are l,(fcMj,00C wool grower in America," said one, "and free wool means death to tbe American wool industry. The country is putting ifrelf in hnpe to twist foreign aggression by rebuild ing tbe navy, but bow would the country race a war if it couldn't produce the wool tc clothe its soldiers. However, we believe we rtaud better with congress than the president, md tbat fa tha most important part, I see here is talk tbat some of the manufacturers re favoring free wool. The heaviest and tiost representative manufacturers are de--Medly against free wool and with us, for liey know that free wool means free woot im." Tbe following statement was made public Tuesday night by the secretary of the con ereoee of wool growers and wool dfaiers in session here: "T ie wool growers and wool dealers of tha United i-1 tea, r preatm in a capital of over $M0,0l,b 0 . ndatomtituancy of 1,000,000 wool g I'Wers and wool dealers assembled in confers e n Wa lungt- n City, the 7th day of Dtmbe , having read the first an nual me s g ) of tha i raudeut to the Fiftith cong -ess, declure that the sentiments of the .it-swage are a direct attack upon their indus ry, and in positive violation of the national iJemocratic platform of 1884, as ioter ;reted by ttie party leaden, and tccepted by the rank and file of die party ; that the argument made by tbe president for tbe removal of our pro tection against foreign competition Is the old one, repeatedly made by the enemies of our industrial progress, and effectively answered in nearly every school district of our land, and so thoroughly disproved by the logic of facts and demonstration of experience and history as to need no answer from us. "We acknowledge that our smalt holdings, our scattered and unorganized condition, makes us the easy prey of free trade, hut we had a right to expect something different from the chief executive of a nation, at once the moat happy, prosperous, and contented of any of tbe world, made so by a policy of pro tection and development which he now seeks to destroy. We had a right to expect our president would favor the wool growers of tbe United (States, and confess our deep dis appointment tbat instead, he favored the in terest of our foreign competitors. "Justly alarmed at bis position, we make an appeal from his recommendations to tba people to all the people to tha 7,750,000 of our fellow uitizeiw engaged in agriculture, to the millions engaged in manufacturing, to the army of wage-earners whow wages are maintained by tbe protective system, to the tradesmen aud merchants whose prosperity depends upon ours; confident that the judg ment and decision will be based upon justice and patriotism, and therefore for the main- 1 tenance of the American policy of protec tion to which the csuntry is indebted for its unexampled development and prosperity. io demonstrate the injustice of the presi dent's policy, and the fallacy of the remedy he proposes for the reduction of the surplus. we point to the fact tbat if the whole amount of the revenue derived from wool was abol ished it would reduce the surplus ouly about AuOu,00u, or less than 10 cents per capita of the population, while the old war taxes he recommends retained yield over ! I9,000,00o, and was a direct tax per capita of $2 each, and what makes up the great bulk of tha sur plus of Sl40,OUU,OuO, aud which fosters auto dangerous monopoly. W e would further add the following sta tistics in regard to the wool industry: The annual revenuederived from imports of wool Under the tariff of '67 was leas than $1,700, 000. Under tbe reduced tariff of 83 the rev enue last year was over $5,000,000. The dumber of sheep In the country in .HS4 was 60,62o.ti-,iti; in 1S87, 44,759,314 a decrease of nearly 0,000,000, and a diminution of tbe annual wool, product of over 35,000, bOO pounds. Thus showing tbat reduc ing tbe tariff by the act of la83 has increased tbe revenue from imported wools and diminished the number of sheep in the United States about 12 per cent, and tbe amount produced in the same proportion. 1 te president's policy would brine about the destruction of this industry and the same policy of reduction or abolition of tbe tariff would end in disaster to all the other indus trial productive enterprises of the country." 

SUGGESTIONS AS TO SILVER. Secretary Fairchlld on Tariff Reduction and the Big Dollar. Washivotoh Crrv, Nov. 8. The secre tary of the treasury made his report public Wednesdav. He takes the same view in re gard to tbe tariff question tbat the president does, and favors a cut in customs duties. His opinion on this point is summarized in the following extract: "Add to the free list as many articles as possible. rUduce duties upon every dutiable article to tbe lowest point possible; but in ascertaining these pos sibilities tbe present situation of labor and business must always be kept in mind." He expects a surplus of $140,000,000 by June 30, lws, and proposes that tbe cut in customs revenue be so great that there will be a de ficit in the revenues for a few years, said de ficit to be made up out of the surplus. He proposes an amendment to the silver coinage act so as to permit the secretary of the treasury to issue certificates against tbe coining value of the silver bullion bought, in stead of coining the silver into dollars, and to coin only such a number of dollars as may be deemed expedient This is on account of the favor with which silver certificates have been received. He also says that provision should be made against a time when there may be more of the silver dollars thin is re quired for tbe business of tbe country. In this connection he says: There should always be in the treasury enough si Iver besides that held against out standing certificates to enable the govern- nwnt to at once supply any demand for it on tha part of tbe people; but all beld in the treasury in excess of that amount is abso lutely useless for any purpose, and is in fact a menace to the silver wblcb the people hold, and also the United States notes and national bank notes aud to the whole circulating me dium, except gold; therefore, it would be the part of wisdom to prevent any accumulation of silver in the treasury beyond a sufficient needed to meet any demand which may be made for it This can be done hy fixing the amount of such reserve, and pro viding that when it is exceeded bv, say $,000,- 000, tbe purchase of bullion shall cease until the amount held by the government again equals such reserva" The Senate Only la Session.
