PRESIDENT HAUHISON takes grim satisfaction in his annual message to congress in demonstra ting to the democrats in that body and to the country in genenu that this nation hos reached an extra ordinary degree of prosperity under the rule of the republican party. In order that there may be no mistake about it he quotes a long array of figures showing the exact industrial situation of the country at present and the wonder ful progress made in the last few years. He contrasts the condi tions prevailing here and abroad , notes the great increase in the number of our manufacturing es tablishments since the passage of the McKinley bill , calls attention to the flattering record made by the working classes on the books of the saving banks of the country , and declares that work has never been more abundant and the re wards of labor never more ample , whether measured in dollars or in necessaries and luxuries of life , in the history of the government. That this satisfactory condition of things has been brought about without the destruction of our for eign commerce is also clearly demonstrated. He shows that the exports of the fiscal year 1892 were the largest ever enjoyed by the iaticn , reaching the magnifi cent total of ยง 1,030,278,148. The imports for the same year entering free of duty were also the largest on our history , reaching a total of $457,999.65. Of the total imports of merchandise , over one half , or 55.35 per cent , came in absolutely free of duty in 1892 , against 43.- 35 per cent in 1891 , and 33.06 per cent in 1890. The president pre sents these figures in a clear and convincing manner , arguing with his usual ability that the present law is not a "Chinese tariff Avail" but a scientific arrangement of duties for the protection of Ameri can people and the American laborer. The result of the election is al luded to briefly as an order for a reversal of the policy of protection which has given the country so much prosperity in the last thirty years. The president remarks that it would be offensive to sug- f.linf tlio in/wmiTirr orlmi-nic ; tration will not carry out its pledges to substitute a tariff law drafted solely with reference to the revenue it will produce for the present law giving protection to American industries. As the country has reached a high plane of prosperity under the protective laws and is in a most gratifying condition industrially and commer cially at present , President Harri son sees no necessity for making changes , and therefore recom mends that the consideration of tariff alternations to be left to the next congress. The section devoted to the tar iff is one of the clearest and strong est arguments presented during the entire discussion of this great question , but it is not the only in teresting part of this admirable message. Every phase of the work of the government is discus sed with the ability which char acterizes all of the president's state papers , and with his usual thoroughness and good sense. It is strong and clear in every feature , and especiallypleasing to his party on account of the manly way in which it upholds the republican policy notwithstanding the recent political upheavel.
