Haverhill, Mass., was so well satis fied with her Socialist mayor that she reelected him last Tuesday. Eills for the reform of the currency now stand at the head of the calendar In both houses of congress. When congress has expelled Roberts and Clark and Quay, why not keep right on? Doubtless there are others. The situation in Kentucky cannot fail to be discouraging to those gentlemen who advocate self government for our islands. It will take an unusual amount of sympathy to include the entire Roberts family should its head fail to obtain a beat in congress. Senator Pettus has introduced a bill to repeal the war tax. How would the senator raise the money to carry on the government? The fact that the Filipinos are still able to get together in bodies of 800 and attack American troops indicates that the war is not yet over. Did you read the president's mes sage and did you miss something, you are not certain what? Well, it waa the customary reference to the tariff. The sultan is said to be negotiating for the construction of a war ship in the United States. If our ship builders are wise they will deal with the sultan on a C. O. D. basis. The echo of the president's message, in which he called attention to the ur gency of doing something to stop lynehings, had scarcely died out before a negro was burned alive by a Ken tucky mob. It was all very well for the president to call the attention of congress to its duty to do something about the trusts, but what congress would have liked better perhaps would be for him to tell it how and what to do. Roberts talks about the bad prece dent which would be established were he denied the seat in congress to which he was elected. But rt is nothing as compared to the bad precedent which would be established by seating Mat thew Stanley Quay. Married women who hold clerkships in postoflices cannot get a divorce too quickly if they desire to hold their jobs. The edict has gone forth that the places which have known them shall know them no more. This order of the department coming as it does on the heels of the one issued by the Chicago school board that mothers shall not be employed as teachers, may act as a serious drawback to matrimony. Attorney General Griggs thinks that federal judges do not get enough pay. and yet it is not a usual thing for ! gentlemen to decline appointments to the federal bench. The attorney gen oral cites a reason for his position on the matter, that lawyers pleading be fore the court often receive for one case a fee larger than the annual sal ary of the judge. An easy way out of that situation would be for the judge to resign and take up the active work of his profession. Perhaps Senator Clark will have the grace to retire without placing his ac cusers under the necessity of proving their charges of bribery. Such action is not without precedent. A Kansas sen ator once did that very thing. He made a clean breast of the whole affair, and came home. He said he saw a sena torship exposed for sale, the tag on which read $00,000. Being possessed of the required amount in ready cash, and being in no immediate need of it for other purposes he invested without any suspicion that there would be such a fuss about it afterward. Another cherished theme of the col lege orator and essay writer the swift extinction of the American Indian re ceives a shock when studied in the light of statistics, the figures in the case coming from the annual report of the secretary of the interior. Accord ing to that document, there are now 2S7.417 Indians in the United States, while the census of P:n showed a total aboriginal population of 249.473. "Poor Lo" has evidently taken a fresh grip on life and calmly and with exceeding stubbornness refuses to' pass away with the buffalo." Chicago News. The secretary of the interior and the Chicago News man live so far from the home of the red man that they may be excused for not knowing that many of these Indians are merely Indians from a business standpoint and are without a drop of the blood of the aborigines in their veins. 

GLOBE SIGHTS From the Atchison Globe. The last request a woman usually makes to her most intimate friend, is not to tell her age. Before the undertaker's bill is paid. the average widower begins to speak of himself as a "boy." I he usual proof of friendship is the recital by friends of all the scandal they know about previous friends. Tou hear women speak of "helpful sermons," but when you were in genu ine trouble, did you ever hear one? When a man has been sick a week, his wife makes a stealthy visit to the closet, and looks over her black dress. It is all right for people to eat only what is good for them, but the trouble is that hygienic advocates axe usually so disagreeable. When some women invite their kin to visit them, it means that they are going on a trip, and want the kin to keep house while they are gone. One thing people in a small town can't understand is why those in a large town go to church Sunday even ings w hen the theaters are open. Women enjoy so much the telling of the "true story of their lives," it must be a terrible affliction to one of them to have a past she can't talk about. When you see a woman start out of her house after dark in a stealthy fash ion, with a bag in her arms, it means she is on her way to drop kittens into some yard. An unfortunate characteristic of a girl is that if two girls have been faith ful friends for 15 years, a young man they have known but ten days can make trouble between them. An Atchison man and wife, neither one robust, are sleeping in a cold room this winter, in order that their daugh ter may have all the fuel she needs for the parlor stove in the evenings. Church going people are now begin ning to freeze to death when they take their weekly scolding. It is the testi mony of an Atchison physician that four-fifths of the bad colds of a winter season are caught in church. Pome of these days, a busy man will kill a book agent, and public sympathy will lie with the busy man. Book agents have lately taken to demanding that a busy man look at their books, and lis ten to their stories. Pook agents are becoming more impudent every day, and the worm will finally turn. An Atchison woman has been told all her life that she needed a month's rest in the country, and simple country diet, to restore her to health. She took the ail vice last month, and came back a physical wreck. She found that country people do not get home from parties till two in the morning, that they eat pie late at night, and live better than people in town. There should be an end to the talk of the per fect health obtained by living on a farm. POINTED PARAGRAPHS. From the Chicago News. Noah was the original weather prog nosticator. The older a man grows the less he thinks he knows. Grown people tire of their toys just like children do. When a man has a boil he Is apt to keep his wife in hot water. An earthly angel is a woman that other women never gossip about. Said the cleaver to the beef: but meat that I should cut you.' Tis A confidence man refers to a six-foot jay as a specimen of the "long green.'' Some people are never so happy as when they have bad news to tell. When men have more money than they need they think they need more than they have. Samson was the first actor to bring down a house and he was killed in the fall. Woman grammatically speaking, is not a part of speech; she's simply the whole oration. A man of resources is usually one who has ingenious methods of con tracting liabilities. His satanical majesty catches some men by lending them dignity and some by lending them dollars. Diamonds of the first water are abso lutely pure but when it comes to milk of the first water that's different. It doesn't matter how loose the en gagement ring may be, the diamond never slips around out of sight on a girl's finger. The man who is always complaining about his hard luck is usually too lazy to stir himself in time to keep trouble from troubling him. BACHELOR BUTTONS. Prom the New York Press. The worst thing about being fat is that you are so much in your own way. The only thing a man won't forgive a woman he loved for is being abole to live without him. Probably the original idea in giving Love wings was so a man could use them after he got married. Women love men for one of two rea sons either for what they see in them or for what they see in them. The ac cent you put on it makes the differ ence. The man -who gets his rights isn't the one who always insists on having them; he is the man who insists on other people's insisting on his having them. A SURE CURE FOR CROUP. Twenty-five Years' Contant Use With out a Failure. The first indication of croup is horse ness, and in a child subject to that dis ease it may be taken as a sure sign of the approach of an attack. Following this hoarseness is a peculiar rough coutrh. If Chamberlain's C.-iieh Remedy is given as soon as th echil.,1 becomes hoarse. or even after the eroupy cough appears, it will prevent the attack. It is used in many thousands of homes in this broa.l land and never disappoints the anxious mothers. We have yet to learn of a single instance in which it has not proved effectual. No other preparation can show such a record twenty-five years' constant use without a failure. For sale by all druggists. Through Sleepers and Chair Cars to San Antonio via Milano.

Iola Suffering From a Water Famine at Present. The Town Dependent on the Uncertain Water Tanks. A IIIDlOItOUS SIDE. Many Citizeus Miss Their Baths and Clean Garments. Others Go Thirsty Rather Than Drink the Dress. Iola, Dec. 7. This city is suffering from a water famine and the water works building is far from completed. Half the town has to depend on uncer- tain water tanks. The sight of water tanks on the streets is very familiar, as there are i from the ice plant and Santa Fe tanks to residents of the town, whose wells and cisterns have failed. The contin ued drouth and the greatly increased draft on the present source of supply has exhausted two-thirds of the wells and cisterns and water for all purposes is obtained by purchase at so much per tank. The ice plant now requires all the water it has and a number of patrons have been shut off and are compelled to use less pure water. Tiie laundry is permitted to get water there and the other day half a dozen men pleaded with Mr. Newton to sell them a tank, which he had just received from the plant, but he could not. The lack of water makes an expense to people, cre ates a tendency to use cuss words and is in every way demoralizing. Many people have missed their batha, many have gone thirsty rather than drink river water and many are wear ing dirty clothes because ot the drouth In view of all which it certainly be hooves those in authority to hasten the water works building. Having a dry town is well enough, but there is such a thing as too much of a good thing. 

M'CAETY GOT LEFT. He Had a Speech All Ready, But Didn't Feel Like Delivering It. TFrom the Emporia Republican. John McCollum, the big, jolly sheriff of Chase county, who has been in the city for the past week in attendance at the Gillett cattle trial, tells an inter esting story of Emporia's early history in which City Attorney W. T. McCarty is a prominent actor. Mr. McCollum and Mr. McCarty met by accident in the court house the other daji. They were introduced, when the sheriff said: "Oh, yes; I remember you very well, Captain McCarty." "You do? Well I can't exactly place you." "Don't you remember," asked Mr. McCollum. "that Catholic fair of about twenty years ago, in .which you didn't get a chance to deliver that speech?" "Well, yes: I do. But I can't remem ber just what connection you had with it." Sheriff McCollum thereupon proceed ed to unfold a tale of Emporia's early history. It seems that away back in the early days of Emporia, back in the time when the Neosho and Cottonwood were little rivulets, and when the jack rab bits and coyotes held high carnival on Commercial street, a fashion among the churches was to hold big fairs, to which people came from a radius of 30 miles. At the time referred to by Sheriff Mc Collum, the Catholic church of Emporia held one of these fairs. The interest in the matter was great. Among other attractions a gold watch was to be given to the most popular young lady the one who received the most votes. Each vote had to be paid for at a good ly price, and as the interest was so great, plenty of money flowed into the coffers of the church. The two leading candidates for the watch were Miss Specht, of Emporia, and Miss Lantry of Strong City. People could vote as of ten as they wishel, if they paid for each vote. The Emporia girl's friends ap peared to have the most money, and it seemed tnat sne wouiu ootam tne most i votes and the watch. Captain McCarty, : then a young attorney, prepared an elaborate presentation speech, which he would deliver when he gave Miss Specht the watch. He w-as getting ready to give his speech, when a lot of Strong ' City people,, of whom McCollum was one. came in. and with fifteen hundred good dollars, turned the tide in favor of Miss Lantry. A check for $1,200 was given by Senator Plumb for the pur pose of helping Miss Lantry obtain the watch. A SHORTAGE OF $12,000. More Forged Notes Continue to Come Out to Confront McLain. Parsons. Dec. 7. Charles A. McLain, the National Mill collector, who is un der arrest for forgery, is at the county jail at Oswego to await his preliminary hearing. Since McLain's arrest last Fri day, he has been in the custody of offi- j cers and he has endeavored to secure . the seven thousand dollars in bonds re- j quired for his appearance, but totally failed, and he was taken to jail. Mc- 1 Lain's operations were not wholly con- ; fined to the National Mill & Elevator company, but he took advantage of his position as collector of the Royal Ar canum and appropriated funds belong- ; ing to that order to the amount of one j hundred dollars or more. He also roped ( in personal friends for various amounts, ; ranging from twenty-five to seventy five dollars. ! McLain's method of securing money from friends was that "some fellow who didn't care to go to the bank for the money, wanted a short time loan and w-ould pay big interest for the money." 1 The "big interest" usually settled it and McLain got the money, but the men whom he alleged wanted the money, never saw as much as a nickel of the amount. McLain's shortage with the mill and elevator company continues to grow, and his prospects for a compro mise of his troubles grow correspond ingly less. More forged notes are com ing to light as the investigation of his work proceeds, and it is estimated that the loss sustained by McLain's crook edness will not fall much short of twelve thousand dollars. DID HE CONFESS? Amos Phillips Said to Havs Told the ! Story of the Edlin&er Murder. 1 Fort Scott, Dec. 7. Ed and George Smith, of Kansas City, and Amos Phii j lips, of Rich Hill. Mo., are confined in i jail here, charged with being implica ' ted in the Leopold Edlinger murder. Phillips is also reported to have con fessed last night that he was traveling in one wagon, the Smiths in another, and Edlinger in the third: that all i camped together the night the murder was committed and were sleeping un der their wagons, when he was awaken ed by the firing of a gun: that he ran to Edlinger's wagon, where he found the Smiths standing over Edlinger.who was wounded, but not dead, and that one of the Smith brothers struck Ed linger over the head with an ax, and that even then he lived for two hours. Phillips is said to have also stated that he was threatened with death if he divulged the facts, and was forced to haul the body of Edlinger for a long time before it was thrown in the water. OUT OF GYPSUM. Dickinson Cement Mills Purchase Beds In Texas Abilene, Dec. 7. The Dillon cement manufacturing company "of this county has bought extensive gypsum beds near Quanah, Texas, to supplement the beds in South Dickinson, whicll are not prov ing as rich as many anticipated. The new deposit is along a creek in some abandoned lands and has a length of fourteen miles. Work is being pushed on a new mill in the new location and it will be ready for operation next spring. The Dillon mill was in operation last week but it is probable that much of the company's output will be from the new location. The Hope plaster mill is running night and day and is far behind in its orders. The company contemplates building aa addition to the preSent building. Pensions For Kansans. Washington, Dec. 7.

FOOD SiiOW. Plan to Open New Auditorium by That Method. Weber's hall was crowded last evening ..-r. , Vt. ..... .....1 l...f..harc .if the f'itV. The premium stamp business which has j been a bone or contention oetween too merchants, the citizens and the premium stamp company, was again up tor con sideration. This stamp business has been considered many times before but it seems that it can not be satisfactorily disposed of. There are two stamp concerns in the city and they are naturally lighting for supremacy. Nearly every merchant in the city are now giving the premium stamps. At one time when there was only one stamp concern, these stamps were supposed to be quite an excellent way of advertising, but since nearly every mer chant is now giving away these stamps, the novelty of the advertisement has worn oft and as an advertising medium the stamps are now almost a failure. Not withstanding this fact the grocers decid ed that thev would continue the use of the green trading premium stamp for a while longer. Bv a unanimous vote of those present it was decided that the secretary. Wm. Dransneld should write to the represen tatives of Katisas, in Washington, and urge them in the name of the grocers and butchers of Topeka and Kansas, to use their influence to defeat the proposed parcel postage bill, which is to be pre sented to congress, and which will lower the postal rates on parcel postage, thus injuring the smaller concerns, to the up building of the large department houses in the east. The new city license ordinance which is before the city council for passage, was taken up. and discussed from all sides. Opinions were divided as what was best to be done with this ordinance, but it waa finally decided that a committee of three composed of T. M. Hanley, Aaron Sheetz and Frank New-land, should go be I fore the council and ask that the ordi- nance be not passed. This committee is ' i.lf. tn L-eeo in touch with the license bus iness and look after the interests of the grocers and butchers, should another or dinance come up. There are a great many merchants in the citv who are in favor of a license tax on different commodities, but they want every one to be treated alike. They are very" much in favor of the passing of such an ordinance, as it would bring in consid erable revenue to the city and this is just what tiie citv needs. The question of holding a pure food show, together with a chrysanthemum show met with favor. It would be held in the new auditorium when it is complet ed next fall, and would in all probability be the opening of the auditorium. The pure food show which was held a few years ago. was a decided success and the experience which the promoters of the show got from that one. will be of much value when another is to be held. Definite action on this matter was posi poned until the next meeting, and as it is almost a certainty that this pure food show will be given, the members of the ooiation wish time to tiiinK over the ; uiatter. Not all of the errneers and butchers of the city belong to the association and it was deemed necessary that a committee composed of Messrs. Whittlesey. Drans iield and Knox b"e appointed to j?et after those who do not belong and bring them into the association. A special meeting" will be held on next Wednesday evening- at which time it Is urged that every grocer and butcher in the city be present.

In the earlier part of Governor Stan ley's administration when the "exami ners" appointed to investigate insur ance companies completed their work they turned their fees into the state treasury. This was done in deference to Republican criticism of Populist "road agents." In a recent examina tion referred to in Wednesday's State Journal it now appears that the Re publicans have themselves gone into the road agency business. This is in evidence by the fact that two of Gov ernor Stanley's "examiners"have pock eted the fees, just as if they had been working for the late firm of Leedy & McXall. The Knights and Ladies of Security are innocent enough in the matter. They wanted an examination made and didn't care who made it, so that it was thorough and competent and the result was so gratifying that they did not object to the bill. The Knights and Ladies got a good thing and were will ing to pay for it even $20 a day for a few days. The only way the present administra tion can set itself right on this question is to make 'em disgorge into the state treasury every time. The "agents" will then be transformed into "exami ners" again and all things will be se rene. A 

KIDNAPING CASE. Report of TJ. S. Consul Dudley at Vancouver. Washington, Dec. 7. United States Consul Dudley at Vancouver, B. C.has informed the state department that af ter an inquiry into the circumstances attending the alleged kidnaping of the American, Everett, across the Canadian line from the town of Republic, Wn., he has concluded that the man was wrongfully arrested. He has mailed a detailed report to the state department as a basis for action, in this case pro bably a demand for the return of the man to the United States. Everett was charged with stage rob bery and the consul shows that the offi cials of Ferry county, Wn., were chief ly to blame and not the Canadian offi cers for the kidnaping. HAYWARD'S FUNERAL.

Capron, who was a detective under Chief Steele, was arrested by Of ficer Goff today on the charge of as sault.

Matthews and Capron did not agree and Capron or dered him to leave. By way of induce ment he threw Matthews clothes and shoes out of doors so Matthews would follow them and carry out the wishes of the man who threw them by leaving.

Tahlequah, I. T., Dec. 7. The propo sition of Wylie O. Cox & Co., to col lect the $4,300,000 Cherokee claim for 10 per cent, was rejected by the senate last evening by the decisive vote of 120 to 5. W. R. Thrasher has another pro position in the senate to buy the claim for 80 cents on the dollar at its par value, when approved by the president of the United States. This same propo sition was rejected by the lower house yesterday, and it is thought it will fare the same fate in the senate. The proposition of James A. Trout man, of Kansas, is pending in the leg islature for 7 per cent of the claim. It is thought this proposition will be ac cepted, as the people are eager to get this claim and have it paid per capita I about the time the allotment of the I land is made by the Dawes commis sion, thus enaDiing tne poorer classes of people to be able to enter the new order of things in good condition. 

STRIPPED COFFINS. Sew Field Is Opened For Youth ful Thieres. Three boys, ranging in age from 11 to 15 years of age, have been arrested by the police for breaking into the coffin factory on East Sixth avenue and steal ing $200 worth of metal casket trim mings. The boys are John Hicks, Ted O'Hare and V. Jones. The watchman at the factory caught the boys in the building. i All escaped but one, Clif Musick, and ; he was turned over to the police. The other arrests followed, -fhe boys broke j handles and trimmings from caskets to , sell for old brass. The plunder brought ' them $5 at a junk shop, but was worth j $200 to the factory. Gangs of boys have been doing hun ! dreds of dollars worth of damage by stealing brass door knobs, lead pipe, bath tub linings, copper bottomed wash boilers, door bells ana even mass reeas out of an organ. This was all sold at a few cents a pound for old brass while the damage to the houses where the plumbing was torn out and the bath tubs cut up has amounted to a goood deal. The last thefts reported are from G. S. Gordon, in Potwin, who had three brass hose nozzles stolen, and F. A. Warren, at 506 Jefferson street, who had a brass painter's lamp stolen. Several wash boilers have been taken and the copper bottoms cut out and pounded up and sold. If the junk dealers did not buy the stolen metal the thieving would cease.

The Re publicans of Kansas were represented by but two members in the last con gress. In this congress there are seven I Republicans from Kansas. i ne j.an ! sas delegation expects this change to ! work to its advantage in the distribu tion of house patronage.
