If tho determination of Spain to put dawii the Insurrection, tcems but to r:Cmr1i,mmiiiffm'Wrmit v I 4i.ii M .I4. 1 . strengthen with Ihe lapse of time, Is evluccd by her unhesitating devotion of largely Increased malltnry and natal forces to the task, there Is much resson to believe that the Insurgents bavo gained In point of numbers, nnd character, nnd resources, nnd nro noun tho less Inflexible In their reiolve not to succumb without practically securing tin great objects for which they took up nrms If Hpnln Ims not yet re-established her authority, neither have the Insurgents yet made good their title to be regarded ns an Independent state. As th contest woes on the pretense that civil government ex Ists on the Island, except so far as Spain Is nlsjut to maintain It, has been practically abnndoiied Spain does keep on foot such n go, eminent, more or less Imperfectly, In the large towns ami their Immediate suburb Hut, that exception being made, the entire country Is either given over to anarchy or Is subject to tho military occupation of one or the other party. It Is reported, Indeed, on reliable authority that, nt the demand of the com- mnuder In chief of the Insurgent army, the putative Cuban government has now glreu up nil attempt to exerclxe Its functions, leaving that government confessed ty (whnt there Is the best reason for supposing It nlwnys to have been lu fact) a luvernmetit merelj on paper No I'ltchfil Were thu Hpiiulsb nrmles able to meet their antagonists III tbo open, or In pitched buttle, prompt and dcilslr rvsulu might be looked for, nnd the Imuieiisu su porlorlty of the Spanish forces lu numbers, discipline utid cijiilpinent could hardly fun to tell greatly to their advantage. Hut they lire culled upon to face a foe which cuu choose and does choose Its own ground, that from tho nature of the country Is visible or Invisible at pleuiure, aud that tights only from ambuscade uud wheu all the advantages of position uud are on Ita side, III a country whera all that Is Indispensable to life lu the way of food, clothing tud shelter Is so easily obtainable, especially by tlioo Imuii and bled on the soil, It Is obvious tbut there N hardly u limit to tho time during which hostilities of this sort may be prolonged. Meanwhile, as In all cases of protracted civil strife, the pusalous of the combatants grow more uud more luUnmed uud exceases on both sides bveumu more frequent uud deplorable. They nro also purtklputcd In by bauds of tuuruudcrs who, now lu the name of one purty aud now lu tlm name of as tuny bo the occasion, harry tho country at will uud plunder Its wretched Inhabitants for their own advantage. Such a condition of things would Inevitably entail Immense destruction of property, wen If It were the policy of both purtles to prevent It ns far us practicable.

The sure result would mciii to be that thu IndilHlrtal Mil lie of the Island Is fast diminishing and Lu ,itil..h l ii ftti,.j,lv unit chmigf III cAlMIng conditions It will soon disappear altogether. That value consists i tiT) largely, of course, lu Its capacity to produce sugtir, ii capacity alreudy iiiuuh by the Interruptions to tillage which have taken place during the lust two years It Is reliably ns'ortPd that should these j Interruptions continue during the current j Jear, and practically extuud, us Is now threatened, to the entire sugar-producing territory of the Island, so much time aud so lunch money will bv required to restore the land to its normal productiveness that It Is extremely doubtful If capital cuu bo Induced to even make the attempt.

It lies so near to us ns to be hardly separated from our territory. Our actual pecuniary Interest In It Is second only to that of thu people and government of Spain.

I Vrxntluua mid Ctly. I Ilrsldes this Inrgo pecuniary stake In the fortunes of Culm, the I lilted States tltids Itself Inextricably Involved lu the present routes! lu other vvnys Isith vexatious uud costly. Many Cubans reside lu this country and Indirectly promote the through the press, by public meetings, by the purchase uud shipment of arms, by the raising of funds uud by other menus which tlie nature of our Institutions nnd the tenor of our laws do not penult to be made subjects of criminal prosecutions, i Some of them, though Cuban nt heart nnd lu nil their feelings uud lutvrvsts, bine taken out papers ns nam rallied citizens of the I'nlted States, n proceeding rcorted to with n view to protection by this government, and not unnaturally regarded with much Indignation by the country of their origin. I The Insurgents nro undoubtedly encouraged mid supported by the widespread sympathy the people of this country nnd Instinctively feel for every struggle for ttie better nnd freer govern-, nient, and which. In tho case of the more adventurous and restless elements of our population, leads In only too many Instances to active nnd personal tlou in the eonteit. I The result Is tlint this government Is, constantly culled upon to protect American citizens, to claim damages for rles to persons nnd property, now estimated nt many millions of dollars, nnd to nk explanations and apologies for the nets of Spanish olllchils whose zeal for the suppression of the rebellion sometimes blinds them to the Immunities belonging to the unnfrendlng citizens of n friendly power. It follows from the snnio cntttcs that the United States Is compelled to netlvely n long line of senconst njrnlust unlawful expeditions, tin escape of which the utmost vigilance will not always Bulllce to preyent. I l'oaltlvn Intervention. These Inevitable entanglements of tho United States with the rebellion In Cuba, the largo property Interests and considerations of philanthropy uud humanity lu general, have ted to n vehement demand lu Various quarters for some sort of positive Intervention on the part of the I'nlted States. It vvus at tirst proposed thnt belligerent rights should be accorded to the Insurgents n proposition no longer urged because mi untimely and Impractical opera tlon c, :irly perilous unit Injurious to our own Interests. It has since been nnd is now sometimes contended thnt tin Independence of tho Insurgents should ho d. Hut Imperfect nnd restricted ns the Spanish government of the Island may be, no oilier exists there, unlcs the will of tho milltnrr o'lleer In temporary command of n particular district can bo dlgnltled ns n species of government. It Is now also BUggosted that the United States should buy tho Island inggeitlon possibly worthy of consideration If there wera nay evidence of n desire or willingness on the part of Spain to entertnln auch a proposal. It Is urged, finally, thnt, nil other methods falling, the existing luteriieclnti strife In Cuba should be terminated by our Intervention, even ut the cot of wnr between the United Stnten and Spain a war which Its advocates coutldelitly prophesy could be neither large lu Its proportions nor doubtful In Its Issue. The correctness of this forecast need be neither nillrmed nor denied. The United States has, nevertheless, a character to maintain ns a nation, which plainly dictates that right and not might should by tho rule of its conduct Further, though, the United Stntes Is not n nation to which pence Is a necessity It Is In truth the most pacific of powers and desires nothing so much as to llvo In amity with nit the world. Its own nnd diversified domains satisfy nil os-slide longings for territory, precludo alt dreams of conquest, nnd prevent nny casting of covetous eyes upon neighboring regions, however attractive. Our Conduct Toward Hpaln. Thnt our conduct townrds Spain nitf her dominions has constituted no exception to this national disposition is made mnnlfest by the course of our government, not only thus far during the preseut Insurrection, but during thu ten years that followed the rising nt Ynra lu IMS. No other great power, It mny snfely be said, under clrcuuistnuces of similar perplexity, would bnvc manifested tho snmo restraint and the same patient endurance. It may also be said thnt this persistant attitude of tho Uulted States toward Spain In connection with Cuba unquestionably evinces no slight respect and regard for Spain on the part of the American people. They In truth do not forget her connection with the discovery of the western hemisphere, nor do they underestimate the grent qualities of the Spanish people, nor fall to fully recognize their splendid patriotism and their chivalrous devotion to tho national honor. They view with wonder nnd admiration tho cheerful resolution with which vait bodies of men are sent across thousands of tulles of ocenn, and nn enormous debt accumulated, that the costly possession of the (lein of the Antilles may still hold Its place In tho Spanish crown. And yet neither the gorcrntnenttnor the people of the United Stntes hnve shut their eyes to the course of events In Cuba, nor have failed to realize the existence of conceded grievances which hnve led to the present revolt from the .authority of Spain grlevnnces recognized by the queen regent and by the cortcs, voiced by tho most patriotic aud enlightened of Spanish statesmen without even regard to party, nnd demonstrated by refonus proposed by the executive nnd approved by the legislative branch of the SpanNh government. It Is In the assumed temper nud disposition of the Spanish government to remedy these grievances, fortified by Influential public opinion In Spnln, that this government has hoped to discover the most promising nnd effective means of composing the present strife with honor nnd advantage to Spain, nnd with tho achievement of ull reasonable objects of the In surrection, Gsnuln Autonomy. It would seem that If Spain should offer to Cuba genuine autonomy, home rule which, while preserving tho sovereignty of Spain, would satisfy ull rational requirements of her Spanish subjects, there should be no just reusou why tho pacification of the Island might not lie effected on ttiat basis. Such it result would appear to bo in the true Interest of nil concerned. It would nt once stop the coutllct which Is now consuming the resources of the Island nnd making It worthless for whichever party mny ultimately prevail. It would keep Intact the possessions of Spain without touching her honor, which will be consulted rather than Impugned by the adequate redress of admitted grievances. It would put the prosperity of the Island nud the fortunes of Its Inhabitants within their own control without severing the natural nnd ancient ties which bind them to the mother country, and would yet enable them to test their capacity for self-government under tho most favorable conditions. It has been objected on the ouu side that Spain should not promise autonomy until her Insurgent subjects lay down their arms; on the other side, tbnt promised autonomy, however liberal, Is because without nssurance of tho promise being fulfilled. Hut tho reasonableness of a requirement by Spain of unconditional surrender ou the part of the Insurgent Cubans before their autonomy Is conceded Is not altogether apparent. It Ignores featuresof the situation the stability two years' duration has given to tho Insurrection, the feasibility of Its Indefinite prolongation In the nature of things, nnd, ns shown by past experience, the utter and Imminent ruin of the Island unless the present strife Is speedily composed; nbnve nil, the rank nbuscs which nil parties lu Spain, all branches of her government nnd nil her loading public men concede to exist and profess n desire to remove. During such circumstances to withhold the proffer of needed reforms until the parties demanding them put themselves at its mercy by throwing down their arms has the appearance of neglecting tho grnvest of perils nnd Inviting suspicion as to the sincerity of nny professed willingness to grnnt reforms. The objection on behalf of the Insurgets tlint promised reforms cnu not be relied upon must of course be considered, though we have no right to nssunie nnd no reason for assuming thnt anything Spain undertakes to do for the relief of Cnbn will not be done to both the spirit nud the letter of the undertaking. I'ropotltlou to Spain. Nevertheless, nit realizing that suspicions and precautions on tho part of the weaker of two combatants are nlwnys natural nnd not always justifiable being sincerely desirous In the Interest of both as well ns on Its own account thnt the Cuban problem should bo solved with the least possible delay It was Intimated by this government to tho government of Spain somo months ngo, If a satisfactory measure of home rule were tendered tho Cuban Insurgents nnd would be accented by them upon n guaranty of Its execution, tue i uneu Mates wouiu puueuvor to nnu n way not objectionable to Spain of furnishing such gunrnnty. While no definite response to this nintlon has jet been received from the Spanish government, It Is believed to bo not altogether unwelcome, while, as already suggested, no reason Is perceived why It should not be npproved by the Insurgents. Neither pnrty can fall to see the Importance of early action, nnd both must realize that to prolong the present stnte of tilings for even a short period will add enormously to the time nnd labor ' nnd expenditure necessary to bring about the Industrial recuperation of the Island. It is, therefore, fervently hoped on all grounds that earnest efforts for healing the breach between Spain nnd the Insurgents, upon tho lines nbove Indicated, may be at once Inaugurated and pushed to nn Immediate nnd successful Issue. The friendly olllces of the United Stntes.elther In the mnuner above outlined or In any other way roaslstent with our constitution nnd our laws, will nlways be nt tho disposal of either party. Whatever circumstances mny nrlso our policy and our Interests would constrain us to object to tho acquisition of the Island or nn Interference with Ita control by nny other power. Our I'atlrnce May Ho Exhausted. It should be added thnt It ennnot be assumed that tbo hitherto expect ant attitude of the United States will bo Indefinitely maintained. While wo are to accord all due respect to tho soy-' ,v J. relgnty ot Bpaln, we cannot view Ow oonfllct In all Ita features, and properly apprehend our Inevitably clou relations to It. and Its possible results, without considering that by the course of events we may bo drawn Into suoh an unusual and unprecedented condition ad will fix a limit to our pat'mt waiting for Spain to end the contest, either alone and In hor own way, or with our frhndly cooperation. When the Inability of SpVn to denl with tho Insurrection haa become mantfeat and It Is demonstrated that hor sovereignty Is ixtmc in Cuba for alt purposes of Ita rigntful existence, and when a hopeless strjg e for Its ha degenerated Into a strife which tneunn nothing more than the useless aaenflce of human life nnd tho uttor destruction of the very of the conflict, a situation will be presented 1 t"'c." our obligations to the sovereignty or Bpaln wl,l be superseded by h goer which we can hardly hesitate to recoKnlze nnd discharge. Duty or United States. I Deferring the choice of wnys nnd methods until the time for nctlon arrives, we should make them depend upon tho pre-clue conditions then existing, and they should not be determined upon without KlvInK enreful heed to every consideration Involving; our honor and Interest, or tho International duty we owe to Spnln. Until we face the contlnK"ncles suggested, or tho situation ! by other Incident Imperatively d, we should coninue In the line of condtKt heretofore pursued, thus In nil Clrcumstinces exhibiting our obedience to the requirements of public law and our regard for the duty enjoined upon u oy m position wo occupy in tno of nations. A contemplation of emergencies that may arlso should plainly lead ua to avoid their creation, elthor through a careless d I regard of present duty or even an unduo stimulation and Ill-timed expression of feeling;. Hut I have deemed It not umlsa to remind the congress that a time may arrive when a correct policy and ca.ro for our Interests, as well a n regard for the Interest of other nations nnd their citizens. Joined by considerations of humanity and a desire to see a rich and fertile country, intimately related to us, saved from complete devastation, will constrain our government to such actions. . Ths Venezuelan Question. The Venezuelan boundary question has ceased to bo a matter of difference between Great Britain and the United States, their respective governments having axred upon the substantial provisions of n treaty between Groat Britain nnd Venczueln, submitting the Whole controversy to arbitration. The provisions of the treaty are so eminently Just and fair that tho attseiit of Venezuela thereto may confidently bo anticipated. Negotiations for a trenty of general arbitration for all differences between Great Britain and the United States are advanced and promts to reach a successful consummation at an early date.
