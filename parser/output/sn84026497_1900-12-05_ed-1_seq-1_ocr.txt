PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE McKinley's Annual Communi cation to Congress. Many Important Recommendation! Arc Made In the Dornmrut, Wliloh Dead Intelligently and In I'laln Laogiiam With Every Topic In AVliloh the N Hon la Intorvited, ".iniiLMHiiA, ihc. a. ITesiclcut McTnnley's niimial message was rend In both houses of the legislature nt the firsl rtuy's session today. The message in purl is as follows: To th Senate and House of Represen tatives: At the outgoing of the old and the in coming of the new century you be C!n the last session of the Fifty-sixth congress' with evidences on every hand of individual and national prosperity and with proof of the growing strength and increasing power for good "of He publican Institutions. Your country men will Join with you In felicitation that American liberty Is more firmly established than ever before and that love for it and the determination to preserve It are more universal than at any former period of our history. In our foreign Intercourse the domi nant question has been the treatment of the Chlmee problem. Apart from this our relations with the powers have been happy. The recent troubles In China spring from the antl-forelgn agitation which for the past three years has gained strength in the northern provinces. Their origin lies deep In the character of the Chinese races and In the tradi tions of their government. The tele graph and the railway spreading over their land the steamers plying on their waterways, the merchant and the mis sionary penetrating year by year farther to the interior, became to the Chinese mind types of an alien Inva sion, changing the course of their na tional life and fraught with vague forebodings of disaster to their beliefs and their self-control. The sect commonly styled the Boxers developed greatly In the provinces north of- the Yangtse, and with the collusion of many notable officiate of the throne itself, became alarmingly aggressive. No foreigner's life, outside of the protected treaty ports, was safe. No foreign Interest was secure from spoliation. The diplomatic representatives of the powers In Pekln strove In vain to check this movement. Protest was fol lowed by demand and demand by re newed protest, to be met wltM perfunc tory edicts from the palace and evasive and futile asurances from the Tsung LI Yamen. The increasing gravity of the condi tions In China and the Imminence of peril to our diversified Interests In the empire, as well as to those of all the other treaty governments, were soon appreciated by the government, caus ing it profound solicitude. The United States from the earliest days of foreign Intercourse with China, had followed a policy of peace, omitting no occasion to testify good will, to further the ex tension of lawful trade, to respect the sovereignty of Its government and to Insure by all legitimate and kindly but earnest mtnns the fullest measure of protection for the lives and property of law abiding citizens and for the exer cise of their beniflcent callings among the Chinese people. Mindful of this, it was felt to be ap propriate that our purposes should be pronounced in favor of such course as would hasten united action of the pow ers at Pekin to promote the adminis trative reforms so greatly needed for strengthening the imperial government and maintaining the integrity of China, in which we believed the whole western world to be alike concerned. To these ende I caused to be addressed to the several powers occupying territory and maintaining spheres of Influence In China the circular proposals of 1899, In viting from them declarations of their Intentions and views as to the desira bility of the adoption of measures In suring the benefits of equality of treat ment of all foreign trade throughout China. With gratifying unanimity the re sponses coincided in this common pol icy, enabling me to see In the success ful termination of these negotiations proof of the friendly spirit which ani mates the various powers Interested In the untrammeled development of com merce and Industry in the Chinese em pire as a source of vast benefit to the whole commercial world. The president then tells In brief the story of the rescue of the legations, and proceeds: The policy of the United States through a!, this trying period was clearly announced and scrupulously carried out. A circular note to the powers, dated July 3. proclaimed our attitude. Treating the condition in the north as one of virtual anarchy, in which the great provinces of the south and southeast had no share, we re garded the local authorities in the lat ter quarters as representing the Chi nese people with whom we sought to remain in peace and friendship. Our declared aims Involved no war against the Chinese nation. We adhered to the legitimate office of rescuing the im erlled legation, obtaining redress for wrongs already suffered, securing wherever possible the safety of Ameri can life and property In China and pre venting a spread of the disorders or their recurrence. As was then said: "The policy of the government of the United States Is to seek a solution which may bring about permanent safety and peace to China preserve Chinese territorial and admin istrative entity, protect all rights guaranteed to friendly powers by treaty and International law and safe guard for the world the principle of equal and impartial trada with all parts of the Chinese empire." Faithful to those proessioqs which, as it proved, reflected the views and purposes of the other co-operative gov ernments, all our efforts, have been di rected toward ending the anomalous situation In China by negotiations for a settlement at the earliest possible moment. As soon as the sacred duty of relieving our legation and its de pendents was accomplished we with drew from active hostilities, leaving our legation under an adeouate ruard In Pekln as a channel of negotiation and settlement, a course adopted by others of the Interested powers. Over tures of the empowered reprcsentatlvea or the Chinese emperor have been con slderately entertained. The expositiou of the resources and products of the Western hemisphere to be held at I! 11 flu lo next year, promises important results not only for the United States, but for tho other participating countries. It is gratifying that the Latln Americnn states have evinced the live liest interest, and the fact that an In ternational American congress will be held in the city of Mexico while the ex position is in progress, encourages the Itolie of a lalL'er disiilnv nt TtnfTnl,. tlinn might otherwise be practicable. The worn or preparing an exhibit of our na tional resources is making satisfactory progress under the direction nf i!iff..rnn ollicers of the federal government and lite various states of tho union Lave shown a disposition toward the most liberal participation in the enterprise. In my last annual. measure I dwelt at some length upon the condition of affairs in the Philippines. While seek ing to Impress upon you that the grave responsibility o? the- future govern ment of those Islands rests with the congress of the United States, I ab stained from recommending at that time a specific and final form of gov ernment for the territory actually heM by the United States forces and In wnicn as long as insurrection contin ues military arm must necessarily be supreme. Progress in the hoped for directiou baa oeen ravorable. Our forces have skil fully controlled the greater nart nf th lslands.overcomlng the organized forces or insurgents and carrying order and administrative regularity to all quar ters. What opposition remains Is for 1 110 most part scattered. The president snenks nf thn mmnlnt uient of the Philippine commission and uis instructions to that body. He cor. tinues: "Coincldently with the entrance of me commission upon Its labors I caused to be Issued by General Mac Arthur, the military governor of the Philippines, on June 21, 1900, a procla mation of amnesty in generous terms, of which many of thn iniire-ont advantage, among them a number of important leaders. The present strength of the army Is ivu.vuu men, oo.oou regulars and 35,000 volunteers. Under the act of March 2, 1899, on the 30th of June next the pres ent volunteer force will be discharged and the regular army will be reduced to 2,447 officers and 29,025 enlisted men. We have in Cuba between 

B.OOO anil 000 troops. For the Dresent our fiwn In that island cannot be withdrawn or materially diminished, and certainly not until the conclusion of the labors of the constitutional convention now In session and a srovernmenr nrnuiiioi by the new constitution shall have oeen estaonsned and its stability as sured. In Porto Hlco we have reduced the garrisons to 1.636. which in.ino 879 native troops. There Is no room for runner reduction here. We will be re quired to keep a considerable force in the Philippines for some time to come. x rom tne Drst information obtainable we will need there for the immediate future from 45.000 to 60.000 men t m sure the number may be reduced as the insurgents snail come to acknowledge tho authority of the United States, of which there are assuring indications. It must be apparent that we will re quire an army of about 60,000 and that during the present conditions In Pnha and the Philippines the president snoule? have authority to Increase the rorce to the present number of 100,000. Included! In this number authority should be given to raise native troops in the Philippines up to 15,000, which the Taft commission believes will be more effective in detecting and sup pressing guerrillas, assassins and la drones than our own soldiers. I favor the recommendation of the secretary of war for the detail of officers from the line of the army when vacancies occur in the adjutant general's department, inspector general's department, quar termaster's " department, subsistence department, pay department, ordnance department and signal corps. The president speaks of the rapid growth of the postal service and ap proves the recommendation of the sec retary of the navy for new vessels and for more officers and men. The pension roll shows a net Increase of 2,010 names. Action Is recommended in the way of Increasing the number of schools In Alaska. Progress is noted In the edu cational, agricultural and railroad de velopment of the Hawaiian islands. The civil service commission is great ly embarrassed In Its work for want of an adequate permanent force for clerical and other assistance. Its needs are fully set forth in its report. I in vite attention to the report, and es pecially urge upon the congress that this important bureau of the public service which passes upon the quali fications and character of so large a number of the officers and employes of tne government, should be supported by all needed appropriations to secure promptness and elliecieiicy. In our great prosperity we must guard against the danger It Invites of extravagance In government expenditures and appro priations, and the chosen representa tives of the people will, I doubt not, furnish an example in their legislation of that wise economy which, In a sea son of plenty, husbands for the future. In this era of great business activity and opportunity caution is not untime ly. It will not abate, but strengthen confidence; it will not retard, but pro mote legitimate industrial and com mercial expansion. Our growing power brings with it temptations and perils requiring constant vigilance to avoid. It must not be used to invite conflicts nor for oppression, but for the more effective maintenance of tnose princi ples of equality and Justice upon which our Institutions and happiness depend. Let us keep always in mind that the foundation of our government Is lib erty: its superstructure, peace.
