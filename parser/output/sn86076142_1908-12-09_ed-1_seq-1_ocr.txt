(By Associated Press.) KANSAS CITY (Mo.), Dec. 8. In the very shadow of the city hall here and less than a mile from the business center, a riot in which religious fanatics and police were participants in which a hundred shots were fired this afternoon, resulted in the death of one policeman; fatal injuries to three and slight injuries of two other persons. The dead: Albert Dalbow, patrolman. Fatally injured: John Sharp, known as "Adam God," a street preacher; Michael Mullane, a policeman; Patrick Clark, a police sergeant. Slightly injured: Harry Stege, a policeman; George Holt, a probation officer. c The trouble occurred at 4 this afternoon, when the streets were crowded. George Holt, a probation officer of the juvenile court, went to Fifth and Main streets to investigate a case of al- leged abduction which he had heard of. Near that street corner he carne upon Sharp, who was surrounded by his companions, ex- horting a crowd of street loafers. With Sharp were A. J. Sel- zer, a woman and five children ranging in age from 14 to 3 years. The officer's suspicions were aroused by the manner in which the woman attempted to secure money contributions from the crowd and decided that she and her male companions were not proper persons to have the custody of the young children. Holt accosted . the woman and inquired the identity of the children. The woman replied sharply to the officer, "You had better attend to your own business." "Adam God" then threatened the officer with physical violence. Holt, who never goes armed, found himself at a de- cided disadvantage when the preacher and his companions dis- played revolvers. After being struck by "Adam God" with a re- volver, Holt started for the police station for assistance. The po- lice sergeant ordered Patrolmen Dalbow and Stege to arrest Sharp and his followers. , The religionists were within fifty yards of the police station when the. officers stepped into the street. They immediately met a volley of bullets, which the officers were unprepared for. Other officers rushed In the street and a general battle ensued. The streets were crowded and the officers on the scene were un- able to shoot without endangering the lives of innocent persons. In the meantime the riot call was sounded, policemen appearing in all directions. The officers crowded in on Sharp and his fol- lowers, firing as they went, and when the shooting ceased "Adam God" lay fatally wounded, shot through the head and body. The children, who in the early part of the firing tugged at the gar- ments of the officers and tried to hamper their efforts, ran into Poor Man's mission, where tney were later taken in charge by the officers. It was later learned that Sharp's male companion was Louis Pratt, the father of the five children. He is uninjured, but was taken in charge by the police. . The woman and some of the children escaped and fled to a houseboat where they lived on the river. The woman barricaded herself in the houseboat, where she defied the officers, fifty in number. Standing on the porch of the boat with a shotgun, she shouted to the offleers: "Come on, you fiends." Several officers, taking up the challenger, dashed for- ward. The woman dropped her weapon and taking two of the children ran to the back of the boat, cut loose a rowboat and be- gan rowing toward the middle of the Missouri river. The officers called to her to stop, but the order was ignored. Without another warning, the police fired a volley at the boat. One of the shots struck Lola Pratt, aged 13 years, tearing away the greater part of the child's face. She died of the wound tonight. The wo- man finally surrendered. She gave the name of Mrs. Pratt and said that she was the wife of a companion of "Adam God" and mother of the wounded child. C TP 71 TIP I (Associated Trcsa.) . CAttSOX, Pec. 8.

LITTLE DOING ON THE STOCK . MARKET TUESDAY (By Associated Press.) NEW YORK, Dec. 8.--Tbe dimin ishing volume of business and the narrowing range of price fluctuations are evldejice of growing profession alism of 1 the stock market. Another indication of the same state of af fairs is the short duration of price movement In one direction. The presentation of the president's an nual message to congress, being the principal event of the day was seized upon for attempted use as a motive for price movement. Stocks were bid up on the assumption that the effect of recommendations in the message will be favorable to values. Its af fectlveness as a stimulant to new op erations In stocks proved to have been over estimated, as shown by a decrease in activity of dealings after its appearance and a drooping tend ency of prices. Bonds were steady.

FINANCIAL SITUATION. The financial standing of the na tion at the present time is excellent, and the financial management of the nation's interests by the government during the last seven years has shown the most satisfactory results. But our currency system is Imperfect, and It Is earnestly to be hoped that the currency commission will be able to propose a thoroughly good system which will do away with the existing defects. During the period from July 1, 1901, to September 30, 1908, there was an increase in the amount of money in circulation of $902,991, 399. The increase In the per capita during this period was $7.06. Within this time there were several occa sions when it- was necessary for the treasury department to come to the relief of the money market by pur chases or redemptions of United States bonds; by increasing deposits in national banks; by stimulating additional Issues of national bank notes, and by facilitating importa tions from abroad of gold. Our Im perfect currency system has made these proceedings necessary, and they were effective until the mone tary disturbance in the fall of 1907 immensely increased the difficulty of ordinary methods of relief. By the middle of November the. available working balance in the treasury had been reduced to approximately $5,- 000,000. Clearing house associations throughout the country had been obliged to resort to the expedient of issuing clearing house certificates, to be used as money. In this emer gency it was determined to invite B.N i

WATERWAY 9, 1908. ELTS SACdE TO 60Hi cong ' subscriptions for o0,000,000 Pan ama canal bonds, and $100,000,000 three per cent certificates of indebt edness authorized by the act of June 13, 1898. It was proposed to re-deposit in the national banks the pro ceeds of these issues, and to permit their use as a basis for additional circulating notes of national banks. The moral effect of this procedure was so great that it was necessary to issue only $24,631,980 of the Pan ama canal bonds and $15,436,500 of the certificates of indebtedness. During the period from July 1, 1901, to September 30, 1908, the balance between the net ordinary re ceipts and the net ordinary expenses of the government showed a surplus in the four years 1902, 1903, 1906 and 1907, and a deficit in the years 1904, 1905, 1908 and a fractional part of the fiscal year 1909. The net result was a surplus of $99,283, 413.54. The financial operations of the government during this perior, based upon these differences between receipts and expenditures, resulted in a net reduction of the interest-bearing debt of the United States from $987, 141,040 to $897,253,990, notwith standing that there had been two sales of Panama canal bonds amount ing in the aggregate to $54,631,980, and an issue of 3 per cent certificates of indebtedness under the act of June 13, 1898, amounting to $15, 436,500. Refunding operations of the treasury department under the act of March 14, 1900, resulted in the conversion into 2 per cent consols of 1930 of $200,309,400 bonds bear-: ing higher rates of interest. A de crease of $8,687,956 in the annual interest charge resulted frOm these I nnerationa.

BIG FOG CAUSED ACCIDENT (By Associated Press.) OAKLAND, Dec. 8. Losing her course in one of the densest fogs that . has ever been experienced in the bay, the ferry steamer Berkeley early last night ran into a portion of the pier while trying to make the slip at the Oakland mole, injuring eight or ten people, one of them-fatally. As the boat neared the mole and was slowly feeling her way in the fog, which rendered objects a few yards away entirely invisible, the passengers crowded to the forward part of the lower deck, preparatory to going ashore. The Berkeley struck the end of the pier and the force of the collision broke the stanchions supporting one of the forward lifeboats, caushing the heavy boat to crash down upon the crowd below.
