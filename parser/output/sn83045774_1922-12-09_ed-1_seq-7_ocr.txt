MATTER UP TO PREMIERS Germany to Pay Fines and Make Apologies Demanded of Bavarian Towns. By LINCOLN EYRE. Special Cable to Tub New York II era id. Copyright, 19!t, by The New York Hbuld. New York Herald Bureau. ) Berlin. Dec. 8. ( The nature of the German reply to the Entente's demand for apologies and punitive indemnities in reprisal for the Bavarian attacks upon allied control officers is not yet known officially, but it is understood the Central Government will pay the tines. Its importance, however, is entirely eclipsed by the news, now apparently detinue, that Chancellor Cuno is preparing to make a fresh reparations proposal to the Reparations Commission in connection with the allied Premiers' conference in London. j The basis of these proposals, it is I understood, is the flotation c?f a loan in which German industry is expected to participate, and in the proceeds of which France will share immediately. The last point represents an advance over the program for the stabilization of the mark formulated by the Wtrth Cabinet on November 13, and accepted by Dr. Cuno. Since Dr. Cuno assumed office he has been conducting negotiations witii German industrial barons to learn to what extent they w;l!l l^lp frame a reparations policy acceptable to the Allies. Vnitcd States Ambassador Alanson B. Houghton and Senator Medill McCormick also were consulted. It is understood that Mr. Houghton was informed of the nronosltion add was authoried to lay it before Ambassador Harvey and Henry P. Fletcher, United States ^Minister to Belgium, at their meeting In London. Lord d'Abernon, the British Ambassador here, who Is now in London, also was notified, with the request that he submit the plan to his Government.( Ptinnea Dnrka Finn. The plan originated, It appears, with a German industrial group, Hugo StlnJics himself having played a considerable role in-Its initiation. The fundamental idea Is the acquisition of enough casii to stabilize the mark and avert the financial collapse of France. To achieve this Stinnes and his associates, as well as Dr. Cuno and Senator McCormJck, are convinced there must be a comprehensivo readjustment of the reparations system. The schedule of payments must be scrapped and the total German indebtedness fixed at a figure adnflttedl.v compatible with her power of payment. It Is hoped France will accept this course, in exchange for the Immediate receipt of considerable money to be obtained by a loan backed not only by 600,000,000 marks gold of the Reichsbank's reserve, as set forth in the note of November 13, but also partly by Ger- : man Industry.

The Stinnes thesis calls for the establishment of direct contracts between Germany Industry and the French consumer In the devastated regions along the lines laid down by the StinnesLubersac agreement. Germany Is likely to Insist, however, upon complete abandonment of the French threat of military sanctions, and possibly curtailment of Rhlneland occupation, or even lis abandonment. Demand Four Years' Moratorium.*^ The fixation of a four years' moratorium for subser|t^nt reparations payments, of course, will J>e a basic condition of the scheme, as it was in the original proposals fnr the stabilization of the mark. The new plan has been discussed not only by the Central Govcrnment, but by the Federal Prime Ministers, who are understood to have been in accord with the Chancellor. Meanwhile, the answer to the council of ambassadors relative to punitive measures ror the I'awau ana lngoistadt Incidents Is ready, but will not be dispatched until Dr. von Knllling, the Bavarian Chief of State, has consulted his Munich associates and communicated their views to Dr. Cuno. It Is said, however, that tho formal apology required by the Allies will be forthcoming, but that it will bear the Chancellor's signature instead of that of Dr. von Knilling, as the council of ambassadors demanded. Dr. Cuno will point out that Germany's dealings with foreign Powers must be conducted through the Berlin Government, that it is for him as the head of that Government to express the desired regrets, and not for the Premier of one of the federated States. With regard to the fines, totaling 1.000,000 marks gold, imposed upon Passau and Ingolstadt, Germany's plea will be that such a sum cannot possibly be paid by the two provincial towns, and that the Berlin Government will pay. Friction between the Germans and the allied control commission is likely to be increased by the discovery of a large quantity of arms and ammunition at Leipzig, in a municipal building. The store includes 340 rifles. 500 rounds of ammunition, two machine guns, two mine throwers and hand grenades.
