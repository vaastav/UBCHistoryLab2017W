ESTABLISHED IN 1868 TAFT UPHOLDS TRUST WH IN HOUSE MESSAGE Indicates Opposition To Repeal Or Amendment Of Sherman Statute URCES FEDERAL REGULATION States He Will Send Other Message To, Congress . ' Before Holidays Washlugton. Doc. 5, President Taft'a third annual message to Con gress, . demoted exclusively to the .Sherman anti-trust act aud the trust tiucsliou In genera! was read in Congress today. The I'rcsidont defended the Bbaf man act as interpreted by the 8Uy pretno Court of the I'nitod States, indicated pliuly his opposition to tli? repeal or amendment of thin statute, but suggested that Congress pass a federal incorporation law and supplemental legislation that "would describe and denounce meth ods of competition that are unfair." To superils corporations char tered under federal law. President Tall proposed the creation of an ex ecutive bureau.. or commission, with power akin to those of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Speaking of the much discussed dissolution of the Tobacco trust, the President declared that in his opln luu "not in the history of American law has a decree more effective for such a, purpose been entered by a court." Portion-' of Ills message of Jan uary 1 1' 1 1 proposing federal incor poration were referred to In this message. Reviews Trust Recommendation!. "I renew" continued the Presi dent, "the recommendations of the enactment of a general law provid ing for the voluntary formation of corporations to engage in trade and commerce among the states anil with foreign nations. It is even more manifest now than It was then that the denunciation of conspiracies in restrain! "of trade should not. and does not. moan the denial of organ izations large enough to bo entrust ed -with our interstate or foreign trade. It has been made more dear now than it was then that a purely negative statute like the anti-trust law may well be supplemented by specific provisions for the building up and regulation of legitimate na tional and foreign commerce." The supplemental legislation the President desires Is explained in a paragraph. "The attempt and pur pose to suppress a competitor by un derselling him at, a price so tin profitable as to drive him out of business, or the making of exclusive contracts with customers under which they arc required to give up associations with other manufactur ers and numerous kindred methods for stifling competition aud effect ing monopoly, should be described with sufficient accuracy in a crimi ifl statute on the one hand to en able the government to shorten Us tak bp prosecuting single misde meanors instead of. an entire con spiracy, and, on the other hand, to , serve the purpose of pointing out more in detail to the business com munity what roust be avoided." s Asks Federal Incorporation. Mr. Taft did not attempt to set forth the details of the federal in corporation act he recommended but suggested that combinations of capi tal allowed to becomo federal cor porations should be subject to rigid rules as to organization and proced ure. Including effective publicity, and to the "closest supervision" as to stock and bond issues by the pro posed executive bureau or commiss ion in the Cofmcree and Labor De partment. Federal Incorporation, the Presi dent declared, would not exempt, any concern or Us officers from prose cution Under the Sherman act for illegal acts. Such an act. could he framed so as to prevent "vexatious and umuccesuary invasion h)y te states" but yet permit control by the states with respect to purely lo cal business.
