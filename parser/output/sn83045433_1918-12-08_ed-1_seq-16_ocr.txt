Activities of Women Prominent in the Social Life of the Nation's Capital SOCIETY Three visiting royalties within six months! That's going some, even for Washington. To be sure, the only one Who really came to see us was H. R. H. Prince Axel, of Denmark. His equally (and, perhaps, then some!) Royal Highness. Prince Arthur eg Connaught, merely took us In. on his way from hiS| ccyisin. King George, of England, to the Emporer of Japan, to assure the latteT of the very distinguished con sideration of the former in case there was anv* doubt on the sub ject. And His Imperial Higness.

Vice President Mar , shall seems to have the Job wished on him!?and been entertained by him. | A mild comment that If they had to ' so to Mount Vernon and lay a wreath on Washington's tomb, Sun day would be a good day to do It ' brought down on the commentator stern rebuke from one wise in the ways of the State Department, "Why they couldn't poeslbly/do that until ? they had paid their 'respects to the ? head of the government?or his deputy?and been formally received by him!" It would be equally shocking for them to be entertained by their own embassy until the Vice President had had first whack at them. So. when they were delayed and could not reach Washington until Saturday instead of Friday and Saturday after the Vice President had knocked off work for the day?his office closed, ho to speak ?the Japanese Ambassador was obliged to recall his cards for a din ner in honor of his distinguished countryman on Saturday night and make it Monday. The Vice President's luncheon in their honor at the Pan-American Building tomorrow is. of course, a highly official function, but it is not to be like so many of the highly offi cial function*?a stag party. Mrs. Marshall will preside, and other ladles will be Invited. One of them said to me. "I do hope they speak English; the Japanese Ambassador does, you knowTand I certainly don't speak Japanese." The lady may reassure herself?they do speak English. It Is only Uncle Sam who sends out repre sentatives who do not speak the lan guage of the country to which they are accredited. Prince Higashl Fushlml studied both in England and France. And his recent mission to Great Britain I was not his first. He represented Japan at the coronation of King George. He was already pretty well up in the service at the time of the Russian-Japanese War, being second in command of the cruiser "Chitoso." Marquis Inouye. a rather older man. was s*nt to Europe to be educated | when he was only ten years old, and spent ten student years there. He i has served his country in all sorts of capacities, end was when the war: [broke out Japanese ambassador at! London. Gen. Goro Shlba has been military attache at London, end com manded Japanese troops during the ! siege of Pekln at the time of the Boxer rebellion. He attended the coronation of King Edward In 1902. and commanded an Important fort ress during the Russo-Japanese Wai^ Vice Admiral Ogurl has been naval attache of the Japanese Embassy in Great Britain, until recalled to Japan for active service shortly after Ja pan's entering the war. So that there will be no difficulty in con versing with any one of the four more important members of the mis- J sion. It was rather startling to see Gen. | Edwards listed as being of the party i that met the mission on Its arrival in New York, as I had not heard of i his having returned from France. And Gen. Edwards has so many.' many friends In Wanhlngton that it s*ems scarcely possible that he should have returned unannounced and unobserved. It must have been | a sad homecoming for him?for j while he wan heading the Twenty-i sixth Division in very active service (in France his only child. Miss Bessie Edwards, the apple of her father's eye. died here of influenza, contracted while nursing at Camp Meade. It seems rather a pity that the Pres ident should not have been here to receive this distinguished party?but after all he has received so many dis tinguished parties in the last five years that it is barely possible he may enjoy being himself the distin guished party that some one else is receiving. Certainly his departure is the event of the week, completely casting all the other events of a not uneventful week Into the shade. "Well, they're ofT at the post!" It was the expression of an Incon gruously clerical looking man in the crowd that gathered at Union Station to see them off Tuesday night. The President of the United States, the Secretary of state, the American Am bassador to Oreat Britain, the French Ambassador to the United States, the Italian Ambassador to the United States and their respective wives, to say nothing of several score more who are only a trifle less Interesting ?and on the most wonderful adven ture of the ages. Several thousand enthusiastic Wash ington citizens crowded the station to! see them start on this momentous Journey, and several hundred stalwart figures In khaki and in blue?details of soldiers and sailors?were on duty, forming a human lane through which i the Chief Executive and the First I Lady, and her secretary. Miss Edith Benham, whose father was a rear ad miral of the navy, passed from the waiting room to the train. Those were the only three who set forth actually from the White House on this momentous Journey. The others of their immediate party ar rived about the same time from divers places, converging by appointment. Mrs. Wilson was wearing, as she gen erally does, a perfectly good, entirely appropriate but by no means remark able costume; good materia}, well made, but conservative to a degree. It was a coat suit of dark blue, which she has often worn around the Wash ington streets; a semi-fltting coat with deep cuffs and wide, rolling col lar of sealskin, and a well-cut skirt, I not too short, with sealskin bands j edging side panels. She wore with ' this a small black hat with little pointed win*H of the "aeroplane" va riety, sticking out at one side and toward the back. She was wearing a j single lovely orchid?"and a wide j smile," which widened further when I Mrs. L. Mason Gulick, who is in charge of the canteen service at Union Station, to which the President | early in the war turned over his mag- < niflcent private waiting room there. ' offered her a splendid bunch of yellow and white chrysanthemums tied with (forgeous streamers of re.', white and blue. Miss Benh&m was so completely done up in a caracul coat that It was hard to see what she had on under neath, and Mrs. Lansing, who was pacing the platform for ten or fifteen minutes while the others were en training. was equally swathed in seal skin. It was an interesting party. On ! the President's private car, the "Ideal." only his immediate party traveled. There were only himself and his wife. Miss Benham and Dr. (Rear Admiral) Grayson, who goes along in the double capacity of the President's private physician and one of his naval aides, "and attend ants." including E. T. Hoover, who has been head usher at the White 1217 G

She it to be married on Wednesday.. House for a number of years and Iff presumably going along an a sort of sublimated messenger or courier. There were other cars reserved for the President's guests from the dip lomatic circle, the French and Ital ian Ambassadors and their families, with aides and such secretaries as they deemed necessary to their com fort; and yet others for the Ameri can members of the party?the Sec retary of State and Mrs. Lansing, the Ambassador to Great Uritain and Mrs. Davis. Secretary Baker, Mr. Tumulty?the two latter went up to j New York with the President, ? though they did not sail with him, 'and Mr. Henry White, former Am* j bassador successively to Germany 1 and France. I And it was an interesting crowd gathered in the concourse behind the j lines, to "watch great Ca?nar pass i the streets of Rome.' Probably the fact that so many of the diplomatic i corps were included among the President's guests was responsible for so many of the members of the foreign missions being on hand. Their uniforms gave a picturesque note to the assemblage that shouted and cheered as the President pasted through. From all sides came the calls?the respectful "Good-bye, Mr. President; God bless you!" the equally whole-souled "Take care of yourself!" "Come back safe!" the rather more flippant, "Be good to yourself. Woody!" or "Say hello to Paris for us!" to all of which the President responded with smiling camaraderie. There seemed to have been no very definite appointed time for the as semblage of the various units of the party. And of course it was the President the crowd was waiting to set1. It melted away as soon as it had watched t'.ie grinning colored por ter take Mrs. Wilson's bap on board, and the careful deference of the con ductor who V lpod Mr. Wilson up the steps of the car. Though the train would not start until 12:30 and It was then but about a quarter past 10, there seemed nothing left to wait for. As members of the party ar- . rived they went quietly on board and went to be^. to wake up In New York, and embark on one of the most interesting adventures it has e\*-r been given men?and women, mark that!?to undertake. It was Interesting to compare this, ' the President's farewell to the Cap ital, wtth his farewell to the Capitol not quite twenty-four hours earlier. It was the hoi polloi at one. and largely the official world, or such of the hoi polloi as has pull therewith at the other. And Just between our selves. the hoi )>ollol was much more cordial than the official world. Washington, ut. least, the part of the population of the National Cap ital that "counts." or thinks it does, turned out en masse to hear the President's eagerly expected message, delivered before the two houses of Congress. In Joint session at the Cap itol last onday. Mrs. Wilson, with a j large party of Boilings, was in the j front seats of the Executive gai- j lery. Mrs. Wilson has never failed to be in her place when the Pres ident has addressed Congress. Nor have the Boilings. Mrs. McAdoo came down and Joined them, sitting next to her stepmother. She was most attractive In a tailored suit of golden brown, with some cold en brown furs that might have been mink, though as seen across the cham ber seemed rather longer haired ani fluffier, and a little fur toque. i?he so usually wears blue that one had not realized how becoming brown could be to her. Nearly the ent're a roup of "Cablneteers'* were In that little gallery?Mrs. Marshall, whom some one dubbed during Mrs. Wilson's ab sence "the First Lady in America:'* Mrs. l^nsing and her most Intimate friend, Mrs. John W. Davis, whosa husband has Just been appointed Am bassador of the United States to Great Britain (he, by the way. was also there); Mrs. Daniels. Mrs. Lane, Mrs. Redfleld. Mrs. Houston, Miss Agnes Hart Wilson, whose mother has been too much of an Invalid to go any where for the last two or three years, and Jane Gregory and Sydney Burle son. who came in together, apparently representing their mothers, whom I didn't see. I thought I saw Mrs. Gregory lin gering to talk with Mrs. McAdoo the gallery emptied, but I was told afterwards that k was Antoinette Funk, 'leading suffragist from Chi cago. and. next to Mrs. George Bass, the woman who seems to hold the most Important position on the Wom an's Liberty Loan Committee, of which Mrs. McAdoo has been the very ac tive head. Now that Mrs?. Funk has grown stout she might easily be mis taken for Mrs. Gregory. In the adjoining diplomatic gallery were Mme. Jusserand and the Count er* di. C/tller^ aliout Ut ?c slupm&U;;* and the President's gueits for the trip to France, the one American, the other South American born; Mme. Rfcino; Mrs. Colrille Barclay, Mmr Suiter, Mme. Ekenpren. Mme. Zaldivar, Mme. Qulntana?their hus bands. as chiefs of missions, were all seated on the floor of the bouse, and qult^e all that the gallery would hold of attaches and their wives, and some of the State Department's higher officials and their wives, also of course John Barrett, who belongs jn the diplomatic set, though he is ? not exactly of them. In the opposite gallery across the I length of the chamber is the Speak | er's family "pew" but Mrs. Clark had I so many guests that she herself was (crowded out. and sat elsewhere. I i thought she was looking particular ly well; she had on a most becoming ' hat, a small round toque with a . black satin crown and 1 dahlias in , dark red and purplish tones laid flat, .around it. and she was wearing a ' graceful loose wrap?which would ; have been a onpe only that it had sleeves?of black satin with a slight : conventional embroidery design. All across that end of the House the Congressional and Senatorial women were as thick as blackberries, j though there were some who had j yielded their one seat?each member ' of either house is given only one card to the gallery on these occa-1 sions?to some influential constitu ent who was Inconsiderate?or ma- I | licious?enough to be in town. The suffragists were out in force from Dr. Shaw, of the one wing, and , Alice Paul, of the other, down. And | among unofficial notabilities one could ! not but note C. C. Glover, president of RiKKS Bank, which at one time the | administration seemed to be trying to I "break." The officials of the bank [ Insist that the Treasury still loses no [ chance to slam them?and conse quently they were very much on their j mettle during the last liberty Ix>an and put their bank further over the top of what was expected of them | than any other bank in Washington, j One suspected?never before having i sei?ri him at one of these functions? | that the rumor that the President was to be heckled by the rebellious Senate.

They needed a little more i time. I Even the Italian Ambassador caught the idea. He took over as his "secre tary" Mme.

To return to Mrs. f'lark: she 1* re suming her before-the-war Wednes days. She was at home Infor mally last Wednesday and will be. when she is in town for the rest of i the season. She Is the flrst of the official women to get back onto her "before-the-war" social basis. "Cabi net" days, suspended during the war, seem doomed. It was a nice, friendly, democratic sort of an institution, that one day a week when the women of the Cabinet were all at home, fre quently assisted by the wives of their husband's assistants or bureau chiefs, to all comers. But I haven't found any of them ready to commit herself as to taking up the burden again?and it certainly was a burden It wan part of official social rou tine?and the social routine was aban doned as inappropriate while the na tion was at war. Most of the official women would not have had time for it even if they had had the inclina tion. They were rather more than knee deep in war work, for the after math requires scarcely less effort than did active warfare?and it is so much harder to keep the forces together. But it's dollars to doughnuts, that the grind of official calling, as it ?u or ganized before the war. will never be resumed. Several of the cabineteers have individually made declarations of independence. Without speaking for the rest, they declare that hav ing Is Id aside the yoke, never again will they submit to it. One of them asked me what sane woman would again assume a routine that caused her to devote endless hours each day to the absolutely perfunctory busi ness of leaving cards. And I dld/Tt know the answer, do you? I tej^you this war is going to establish human liberty in many quartern with which it would seem to hsve no visible con nection. Perhaps the next most exciting thing after the President's departure is the announcement of a new Cab inet member, which from the social point of view means a new cabinet I hostess and a couple of new Cabinet girls. As a matter of act. however, beyond the fact that there is m Mrs. Carter Glass, and that there are two daughters, one doesn't seem to know very much about them It is very easily explained Mr. Glass has been In Congrees for years, but he has chosen to maintain his home in Lynchourg, rather than at tempt to move it twice a year to Washington and back He has lived at the RaJetg-n when < ongreas was in seaaion. and hit wife and children have joined him for a while when ever they felt like it and it waa con venient. 80 that really Waahingtou haa had very Mill time to makf their acquaintance.
