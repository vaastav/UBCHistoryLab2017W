'Washington.—The sixty-first con gress assembled Monday for Its final session. Almost immediately after convening both houses followed the custom of adjourning for one day out of respect to the memory of those members who have died during the summer recess. Five senators and three representatives hive died since the beginning of sumc er. Upon re assembling Tuesday tie two houses listened to the reading, of the presi dent's annual message. The message was unusually long, running from 30,000 to 40,000 words. In a general way the president urged upon congress the necessity for enact ing legislation to build up the Ameri can merchant marine, to conserve the natural resources of tae country, to provide a new form of government for Alaska, to "supplement and strengthen" the Sherman anti-trust law, to enlarge the scope of the civil service law, to create a national bu reau of health, to provide a legislative basis for workingmen's compensation, for the limitation of injunctions is sued: by federal courts, and to pro mote closer commercial relations with Canada. The president also gave his views in regard l to the further regu lation and control of corporations engaged in interstate business and the regulation of the issue of stocks and bonds of interstate railways. Get Down to Business. After the reading of President Taft's annual message the lawmak ers were able to get down to business almost immediately, as the details of organization and committee changes required little time. The opinion is gaining ground that little else than the passage of the various appropriation bills will be attempted. Statements by leaders of various parties and factions indicate that the short session will do little else than pass the regular appropriation bills. The regular Republicans declare: "Well, we will get the routine out of the way." The routine being the nu merous appropriation bills. The Democrats say: "Well, let's see what the Republicans will do. Our turn come 3 next year." A most suitable gift—A present that every man will appreciate and none be without once having tried them. All the reliatle brands from $1.00 to $7.50. A
