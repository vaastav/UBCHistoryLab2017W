The jingle of tho bell informing the pedestrian of the presence oj-'one of these kettles is heard above the rum ble of the street cars add the noise ot passing traffic in the downtown streets. It Is one of the most, com mon sounds that greets the ear .of the uhoppers, and its effect is becoming . more and more noticeable every day, as tho proceeds of tho day's Jingling Increases with tho approach of Christ mas. "Tho Canton people have not been' stinted in their giving so far, but we are hoping for Increased contri butions with tho progress of the holi day season," Said Ensign Runcle yes terday afternoon.

Krichbaum THREE ALREADY TRIED Prosecuting Attorney Charles C. Upham yesterday morning turned over all of the papers held by him in the Canton State bank cases to Prosecutor elect Charles Krichbaum so as to give his successor plenty of time to get ready the cases he may wish to try directly after the adjourning of the January grand Jury, "As I have only .nineteen days yet to remain In office I thought It ad visable to turn over all the legal documents held by mo in the State bank case to my successor," said Pros ecutor Upham yesterday afternoon. "This will give Prosecutor-elect Krich baum sufficient time In which to get fully prepared to try the cases. Up to the present time only three cases have been tried and there are perhaps ten or twelve more to come up, some of which It Is safe to say will be heard during the January term of court. Since the failure of the State bank three years ago Just three cases have come up for hearing."

KETTLES Christmas to Many Poor Received by Salvation of Previous Years.' .before. "Some of them have gone so far as to double their customary con tribution," he said, "and others are giving us substantial monetary assist ance. There are but few cases whero the business men have ceased to do nate, even though some of them have been hit by tho hard times." Many of the churchqs have signified their intention of aiding the Salvation Army. Alone tho Salvation Army would be utterly unable to meet tho increased demand for succor to the poor during the holidays. Then the "penny-a-day" boxes stationed in many of tho Canton homes are not to .be forgotten. The receipts from these promise to be very helpful. Many other contribution boxes for the Chilstmas fund have been stationed in prominent places, catching much stray lucre. A cooked dinner Is being planned for the regular lodgers at the Salva tion Army barracks on Christmas day. Besides this several hundred baskets of eatables will bo sent out to tho poor families. Tho various charitable institutions of the city have begun to send in their list of names of in digent poor families to the Salvation Army. Ensign Runcle states that he notes a vast increase in the number of names this year. People who have never applied for aid In the history of the Salvation Army in this city, are dolngso this- year, and iJWll be with great difficulty thatjyWrmy of half pauperized cltlzenJWll be taken care of. It Is probable that the reg ular list-of poor families that receive aid from the Salvation Army during the holidays, will be almost doubled this year. 0.4 P. F. AT President, Charles Morton has re turned froin New York city wfiere he appeared before the National Board of Arbitration in regard to several O. & P. playors' claims for back sal ary and to become free agents, says the" Akron Times.

Memphis must now pay the $400 which was the price offered the East Liver pool club or Woodruff becomes the property of East Liverpool agalu. The claim of Player Rapp was disallowed. Rapp claimed ho had not been paid in full. Bailey and Rlerdon, of Canton, both claimed that they had not been paid In full.

I be long to a well known Cleveland or ganization that always thought much of this musical organization and they accompanied us on several occasions. You know this band has a great rep utation and I understand that tho members have sort of laid down as it were of late and that there is noth ing doing.

I know this, too, that this band was paid for Us services on these long trips, while other bands offered to mako tho trips without pay. Wherb is Van Home now? It would bo a good idea if they had a manager like him again. Since ho has dropped the management of the business affairs of this band, I understand that they have no good engagements; is this a fact? In years gone by this band gave pleas ing minstrel performances and a num ber ot seats were always reserved for and afterwards paid for by their Cleveland friends, .but I understand that the giving of such performances have been cut out, too. What delight ful concerts, this organization gave In the rotundas ot tha Cleveland hotels, when we bjui them, there, I pan't quite understand why this organiza tion jshould. be allowed to lag." said the man "as lie Uado farewell to to newshunter.
