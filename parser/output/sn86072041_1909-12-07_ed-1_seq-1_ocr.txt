PRESIDENT TAFT SUBMITS MESSAGE TO CONGRESS President of the United States Says the Country, Generally Is in High State of Prosperity—Says to Leave Tariff Alone—Discusses Nicaraguan Situa tion, Sugar Frauds and White Slavery Washington. Dec. 7.—The first annual message of President Taft was delivered to congress today. It was presented in both houses shortly after 12 o'clock.

Practically all are recess ap pointments that have been announced from time to time, and the greater part of the list is postmasters and census supervisors. Franklin K. Lane was reappointed a member of the interstate commerce commission. Washington. Deo. 7. —President! Taft today sent his annual message to congress. The tariff, the Niear aguan question «»gar trauds. md " White Slavery'" are am.mg the ques tions discussed. Perhaps the most important ques tion presented 'o this administration is that of economy in expenditures and sufficiency of revenue, says the ' president, who discusses the meth ods taken to meet the deficit. The president declares it unwise to at tempt further revision of the tariff until tbe facts are at hand upon which such a revision can properly be undertaken. Speaking generally, he says the country is in a high state of prosper ity. He notes the increase in the coat of living, but says the tariff is not the cause. In those products of the factory and farm there has been no increase in the tariff and in many instances a very considerable reduc tion, the president says. Beginning, the president says: The relations of the United States with all foreign governments have continued on the normal "basis of amity and good understanding and are very generally satisfactory." President Taft says the Zelaya government of Nicaragua has kept j Central America in constant turmoil. It is unnecessary he says to rehearse here the sad tale of unspeakable bar barity and oppression alleged to have been committed by the Zalayan gov ernment. Recently two Americans were put to death by order of Pres ident Zelaya himself. They were re ported to have been regularly com missioned officers in the organized forces of a revolution, and as such, according to the modern enlighten ed practice of civilized nations, they would be entitled to be dealt with aaj prisoners of war." He continues: i "The government proceeded with de-j liberate circumspection to determine the exact truth in relation to the re porta and upon the course in thej premises most consistent with its 1 dignity, its duty to American inter-; ests and its moral obligations to Cen trai America and to civilization." Concerning the far east, the pres-j ident says this government pre serves unchanged its policy of sup porting the open door and adds: "Our traditional relations with I he Japanese empire continue cordial as The arrangement of 1908 for; cooperative control of the coming of; laborers to the United States ha? proved to work satisfactorily/ Reorganization of the department ' of state upOpfl, modern lines in fur therance of our foreign trade and of American interests abroad is recom mended. "Perhaps." continued the message.; " the most important question pre-j sented to the administration is that of economy in expenditures and suf ficiency of revenue. "The report of the secretary shows that the ordinary expenditures for the current fiscal year ending June 30, 1910, will exceed the receipts by $34,070,620. If to this deficit is added the sum to be disbursed for the Panama canal, amounting to $38,000,000 and $1,000,000 to be paid on the public debt, the deficit of ordinary receipts and expendi tures will be increased to a total de ficit of $73,075,620. This deficit, the secretary proposed to meet by the proceeds of bonds issued to pay the cost of construction of the Pan ama canal. I approve this proposal " The president says the cost of en- gineering and construction of the canal, which will be completed Jan uary I, 1915, is $297,766,000, in stead of $139,705,200. as originally estimated. Other expenses increase the cost by $75,435,000 to a total of $375,201,000. The president is advised by the secretary of the treasury that the es timates of the expenses of the gov ernment for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1911—that is, for the next fiscal year—are less by $55,863,000 than the total of appropriation for the current fiscal year and adds: "So (Continued on Page Two.)

WENATCHEE DAILY WORLD, WENATCHEE, WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1909. INTERFERING ID MINI STRIKE DELAYING ERECTION OF STAMP MILL IN SQUIUUCHUCK CANYON ON ACCOUNT OF NON DELIVERY OF LUMBER. H. Leighton. who is in charge of the big mining operations in the Squillchuck canyon, is having con siderable trouble on account of the non-arrival of the big timbers for the stamp mill. He leaves today for Skykomish and the Sound in an ef fort to get these moved. The stamps are already here. There are six 1,800 pound stamps. These drop 110 times per mniute and have a capacity of about 75 tons per day. Mining men who are acquainted themselves with the ore body and the method of treating it on this big property have no hesitancy in saying that if tlw tests that have been made are borne out by the tests of the stamp mill that this will be the biggest low grade property in the world. Foot tests on this give values close to $2 per ton and handled on a large scale, as is contemplated, the cost of mining and treatment should not be over 60 cents, leaving a substantial profit for the owners. Nature has assisted ma terially in the location of this ore deposit. There is an abundant water supply for milling purposes, electric power developed, an endless dump j for the waste and a gravity system for supplying the mill with ore. Were the conditions not absolutely ideal it is safe to say that the own ers would not undertake to handle ore of this low grade. Should the ! tests of the mill prove satisfactory the plant will he increased and put on a strictly labor-saving basis. | Already the new owners in land jnnd mining operations have expend !ed close to $125,000 and expect to j expend a great deal more before the ! mine is on a paying basis. Mr. Leighton is a well posted mining man and does not give the appearance of the ordinary hot-air promoter usu ; ally found around a mining camp, iHe has figured this proportion on a I business basis and as such he is en ! deavoring to develop, if successful, the greatest- low grade proposition jin the world. He expresses himself very grateful to the city council in making concessions for water power, to the county officials for road facili ! ties and to the business men of We natchee for the interests expressed in j his project. Brotherhood Held Meeting. Last evening was held the regular meeting of the Methodist Brother hood, in the church parlors. In the absence of the president. Vice Presi dent Thomas presided. At the close of the business session refreshments were served. The quartette was pres ent and gave two selections. L. V. Wells, who recently returned from Albany, N. V.. where he had been in attendance at the general meeting of the educational and missionary committees of the church, addressed the meeting. He explained the or ganization of the church by which these general committees were con stituted and outlined the work which is intrusted to them. These commit tees disburse between two and three million dollars each year in carrying forward the work of the church. The satisfaction with which Mr. Wells' remarks were received was indicated by extending him an invitation to continue his discussion at some sub sequent, meeting. "Uncle DaaT Tonight. Frank O. Ireson. the eminent act or with a strong cast in the best of all down east plays. "Uncle Dan'll. or the Messenger From .Tarvis Sec tion," will appear in the Wenatchee theatre tonight.

It is a rambling letter but yet contains some wholesome advice to the young. It is as follows: "Editor Daily World: Please pub lish these few lines from me. I am sorry to state that the crime of which I am accused and convicted means that I must go to the penitentiary to serve from one to 14 years for | something that I do not believe that j I ever intended to commit. I never will believe that even though intoxi cated that I ever had any Intention of committing the crime against this little girl. I have been in this jail going on seven months and I have failed to raise money to appeal my case to the supreme court, so I will have to go to the penitentiary for some term of years. I do not know how long as I am a poor boy and T have no relations in this part of the country and I may have to serve the 14 yeaTs. My papa lives at Sand Rivers. Virginia, and my sister lives at Snow Creek, Virginia. My papa's name is J. A. Oakes and my sister's Ella R. Belchrs. T will thank anyone that will write them and tell thera of my going to the penitentiary as my heart is broken and I am ruined for life and have disgraced my poor father and sister by going behind the prison bars for this term of years for being sick and on account of drink ing too much liquor and drugs. My advice to the world is that 1 hope that my case will be a warning to the young boys of your city and country to leave whisky alone. Do not go away and leave your folks where you have no friends, for you can see my end. My days for pleasure are over. I have tried to do right and make my living honest and treat my fellowman right and liquor has damned me to ruin and despair. "S. E. OAKES. "Sandy River. Va." FINDING REFUGE IN AMERICA C.eno.
