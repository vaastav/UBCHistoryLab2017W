Wheeling fUgister. _ DAILY, TRI-WEEKLY, WTCRKLY. Lewin baker a- CO. MONDAY, DECEMBEB 5, 1WO. Congress meets to-day at noon. We will probably have the President's message in to-morrow morning's paper. The State Journal, speaking of a com munication which was published in this paper on the 2Sth ult. over the signa ture "States' Rights Democrat," says: "It is charged that the communication aforesaid, published in the Wheeling Register, was gotten up in that office for political effect." The charge is vt terly false. Berkley Springs, Nov. 21, I $70 FMitors Berkeley Union Dear Sirs : ? The editor of the Mor gan Mercury h an created the impression that I am a Democrat. Permit me to say through your columns that it is in correct. I am a Republican and always have been. Respectfully, Ac., John II. Hovbrm.vie. The above we clip from the Berkeley Union , and simply have time to prove its falsity. In making out the list of Delegates, copied from the Wheeling Jteyitfiv, we changed h^s party initial to R , believing that, notwithstanding ho had his xanie on both tickets, he was a Radical; but, meeting Mr. II. on Fair fax street, we asked him how we should designate him, when he emphatically told us ."the same icay as the Wheeling Register has it.' ? Morgan Mercury. We classified Mr. Hovermale as a Democrat in consequence of information to that effect in letters from gentlemen io counties adjoining Morgan. We don't think he called himself a Radical during the campaign, though perhaps he may have claimed to be a <w?.?rw fire Republican. Yiricitifn V*. W fsl Virginia. The Board of Supervisors of Berke ley county, at a recent meeting, passed a resolution declaring it to be the wish of the citizens of Berkeley to remain under the jurisdiction of the State ol "West Virginia. They also appropriate*! the sum of #.r>0O as a fee to Hon. C. J Faulkner for professional services in the suit now pending in the Supreme Court of the t'nited State* between Vir giniaand West Virginia. It seems that Mr. Faulk xer volunteered in the case about two years ago, and the Berkeley Union says he was "to give his services free of charge;'" the sum of $7500 hav ing been appropriated by the Legisla ture of West Virginia in 1S6S an I Hon Rbvecdy Johnson, Hon. B. Stanton and Judge Lee having been retained a? attorneys. In making the appropria tion of $">0<j for Mr. Faulkner, the Supervisors of Berkeley county ask the Legislature to refund that amount this winter. The case is to be argued some time this week. Is West Virginia ready? The Lrmon of the Election. There are some Dome>crats in this State who, both last winter and during the late political campaign, favored the adoption of the Fi.ick Amendment. They looked upon it as a sort of com promise measure, bv which disfran chisement might be brought to an end in consideration of Democratic assent to negro suffrage. The latter having been already forced upon our people by Federal instrumentality, it was thought that the striking of the word white from the Constitution of the State was not too great a price to pay for the en franchisement of twenty thousand white men. Of course this was upon the as sumption that the Radicals would carry the State in the election this year, and have control of the Legislature of 1ST 1 as they have had of previous Leg:sla tures. A half loaf was better than no bread. Now, however, when it is in the power of the Democracy to perfect the enfranchisement of the whites without the Flick amendment, many ol the gentlemen referred to are willing that that measure be permitted to re main where the negligence of Governor Stevenson has placed it. There is no longer any necessity for being content with the half, now that the whole loal is ours. The people of the State, even while thousands were disfranchised, have pronounced against Radicalism and proscription, but it cannot be claimed by any one that they have voted to excuse and assent to negro suftrage or to erase the word white from our Constitution and laws. The decision of the voters ij. that the rebel? shall vote, and the lesson of the elec tion is also that the people ol West Virginia are opposed to ne gro suffrage. e ask the gentlemen who are pressing the adoption of the Flick amendment by Democrats, whether this is not true. Let us go to work heartily and harmoniously to gether; adopt any of the several legal modes of immediate enfranchisement j and.let the negro portion of the Flick amendment sleep the sleep that knows no waking; knowing that by this course of action we will best obey the will of the people as pronounced on the 27th of October last. The Conntftntionnlltjr ?f thP niv rranchlMlnff Ammilmriu, Editors of the Register: The article over the signature of "T," which you published a short time since, has attracted a gTcat deal of attention, but there in a question in the minds of some as to how to get rid of the consti tutional amendment of 1866, without a decision of the Supreme Court that it is a nullity. All concede the soundness and conclusiveness of the article refer red to. That, so far, settles question that the amendment is void. If void, it has no existence. There are various ways of declaring it void. A voter who is , perfectly qualified to vote in every respect, except that he is obnoxious to that amendment, applies for registra tion; must not the registrar decide upon his oath and upon his re sponsibility to any suit the vo ter may inetitote agaiMt hko, whether he is a legal voter or not? Certainly so. If he decides that under the Constitution he is a voter, there is an end of the matter. He then de cides that the amendment is unconsti tutional. If he is prosecuted in any way for so deciding, must not all the courts say he decided correctly, if 't lfl unconstitutional? Suppose he decides that he is not a legal voter: then the voter prosecutes or sues him in a citi action; must not the courts hold and decide that he acted wrongly, and that his ignorance of the law or hie willing ' new to obey a statute rather than the Constitution as il really is, will not pro tect him and that he is amenable to the penalty or to the damages. Again, a law is proposed in the leg islature. The question is raised that it is unconstitutional. Must not every legislator, on the responsibility ot bis oath and position, determine the ques tion of constitutionality for himself. If such legislator, be he whom he may l>e, knows that great wrong and injury are being done to a class of individuals in consequence ot unconstitutional provi ' sk>ns, or xn unconstitutional provision, and the injury is a continuing one, affecting their" manhood and dearest rights, would he, will he fail in his duty j to pass an act which will relieve them, ' instead of turning coldly around on his i heel and sending them over to the ex pense and delay of a judicial investiga tion, even supposing that they have a fair j and impartial tribunal. If the Amendment is unconf titutional, the way is clear as a legal proposition. That it is unconstitutional all of the Democratic party are convinced. That ?t is unconstitutional all of the Republi I can party, bv their silence, admit, tor not one word has been said in reply to j the argument by the Republican press. They would gladly pass that, by. and foment our discord and division (which will not be) by pressing the Flick Amend ment upon its. They would have us pass that ; have us commit ourselves to i their disfranchising Amendment and tie our hands by our own admission that it ; was legal and valid and that we admit ! ted it could only be gotten rid of by the Flick Amendment; and then jn their court hold that the Flick Amendment was not Constitutional because of want ol publication of the notice for that is the very point decided in the 24th Alabama case cited by "T". Thus they would have two chances for our defeat ; first ! by the election at which qualified voters under the Constitution would be re jected ; secondly, by the decision of their I court who would properly hold that the Flick amendment was void, for the I le^al reason assigned, and to which we were committed by the fo'ly of our I course. Without refering lo any who take a different view on the policy of the matter, for all agree heartily as to the unconsti tutionality of the disfranchising amend I ment, I eommend the subject to the consideration of the legal minds of the State.

Last Sunday evening, as the-wit'e of James Abbott was knock ing about the premises, about a mile and a half from town, she came sudden I ly upon the body of a middle-aged man \\houi she supposed had been drinking and had got about fifty yards away from the path to take a sleep. She ; went to the house and told her husband who proceeded to the plnee and discov ! ered the man to be dead. Squire Rog ers was called, who by the light of a torch found that the man had violent I marks on his throat, and from the trace* | of blood on the ground concluded that the man had Wen murdered. A coro ner's jury was summoned and the body will be brought to this place lor identi tication to-day. P. S. ?

It is supposed to have been the result of carelessness on the j part of the workmen engaged on the j building, who were at work after the : usual hour.

Mr. S was" out hunting, and his grand son was "driving a thicket, " and when he heard the report of the gun, went to the spot and found his grandfather lying dead, and the deer was also dead a short distance off, having fallen from his deadly aim.

An Irishman came to the St. Charles Hotel the other day, and after remaining a day, was one morning IouikI perambulating through the differ ent rooms, and when asked what he was hunting for, replied, "An old pipe which he had lost." This aroused sus picion, and upon examining his person it was found tliat he had appropriated iroui among the boarders, clothes a coat, \eet and pair of pants. Another guest of the house also accused him of hav ing stolen an amount of money from him the day before. A vial of poison was also lound upon his person. The criminal was arrested and is now con lined in our jail awaiting trial ? Parkers burg Times. A Perilous Position. ? Our young friend, Mr. E. G. Jeffervs, met with an accident on last Thursday afternoon which was j?erilous in the extreme, and in which he and two horses that he was driving, came near being drowned in the river near this place. He had hitched up a couple of horses, belonging to General Brown, for the purpose of taking a ride, and drove down to the river, at the regular fording place, in order that the animals might take some water. He had driven into the river a few steps, and when the horses were done drinking endeavored to back them out. One of them became contrarv ami stubborn, and laid down in the water. Mr. Jeffervs endeavored to make the horse get up, when it suddenly sprang to its feet and plungeo forward into the water, and before they could be stopped were in the water up to their backs. Here was a perilous situ ation. The buggy was now in water up to its top, one of the horses tangled in the harness, and the water, which was some twelve or fifteen feet deep was running very swift, and they were now drifting down stream at a rapid rate Mr. Jeffervs, however, retained all his presence of mind and jumping out into the water swam to the horses' heads, and through his exertions kept himself and horses from drowning. After drift ing down stream in this manner for about three hundred yards, help at last reached them. Some men who were in sight at the time, seeing their peril ous condition procured a couple of skiffs and started for their rescue. Thev reached them and dragged them ashore. *ater telDg so very cold the horses as well as Mr. Jefferys, were nearlv ' clnled to death. ? Grafton Sentinel. SnciDE. ? On Thursday last a young man named Oliver Cbipps, residing in Clinton township committed suicide by cutting his throat with a razor. He had been suffering for some time with a tumor on his face, wbich caused him great pain, and latterly had been con fined to bis bed. On Thursday morn ing he remarked to one of the familv he would like to be shaved, and ask oil for the razor. It was handed to him. when he felt its edge and 'remarked that some of the boys had notched it and he would hereafter keep it himself. No suspicion of what he was about to do entered the minds of any of the family. A abort time afterward some of them entered the room and found him in a dying condition. He had g?shed into his neck with the razor un til the jugular vein was cot, bleeding to death in a few minutes. A pott mortem examination was had by Drs. Brock and Mackey on Saturday, which resulted in the discovery of the fact that the tumor in his face had suppurated, the matter passing down his throat and poisoning nis blood to snob a degree that it was : their opinion he would not have lived a j week longer. ?

Habitual Constipation. TJOW To EFFECT A CERTAIN AND PER MANENT CURE. Some occupations of life piedtai>ose to Costiveness, especially those which allow but Utile exercise. Persons who coDtrect this unfoitunate habit of body, under such circumstances, might possibly be relieved by changing their sedentaiy employments forotheisof n mote active kind; but this is by no means cenain. Habitual constipa tion is a veiy obstinate disoider. All the ordinary so-called remedies invariably ag gravate it. Nothing can be more lnjuiions than the conliuued use of en jiig aperients. They at first irritate and finally almost paralyze the bowels? rendering them so torpid that enoimous doses of cathartic medicines have no effect upon them. A mild aperient, combined with agentie stim ulant, is the true remedy; and a combina tion in the happiest proportion of these in gredient is found in Hosteller's Stomach Billets. This famous stomachic invigorates the whole intestinal canal, while quietly removing from its convolutions all impedi ments to a free pissage through them. No mere purgative nas this double operation. No ominai y stimulent effects the desired object. Cases of Constipation abandoned as hopeless by distinguished medical men have been ctire*l in a Jew weeks by the Bitters. To those who have tried all the medicines of the dispensary in vain, we say try this lrre utstiblesiimulant and aperient. There Is no sufficient leason why constipation should he tjie consequence oT sedentary habits. Hosteller's Bitters, by supplying the vigor which would otherwise be derived from ex- I ercise. will in all cases enable the system to perform its excretory function regularly and healthfully.
