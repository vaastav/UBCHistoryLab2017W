KJr inprton ottered" a re-o-luLioo recomniendintt the reappointment of CjlontliLeon Trousdale as State fiuper'u: tendentof instruction, tu? position so ably fill ed by him for tha past two years. Thlt resolution was unanimously passed, and will le inoet cordially indorsed by the people i idemphin, where Colonel Trousdale once r -ided, and where ho in universally estccinn!. The people of Memphis, of Shelby, of Tecntsee.and we may say of the entire State, with lingular unanimity, favor the retention yf Colonel Trousdale in the place he hia filled to satieratcrily. The Callatin Exam iiier lays: The teacher tralit at.: for this conre.ional Oi-Utrt has bt-ca in se.-sion at the courthouse eince Wednesday lust. It is, oi course, un der the immedinte direction of Colonel Irm 'i'rousdide, the Slate supTinUnilent of public inttfruction, and this a fit occasion to ail ule to the great work that has bw n accomplished by Colouel Trousdale during his term ct" rer Ttoe. Ho bas awakenel a general public in terest in the cause of education, without which it could not be eupported by populnr approval. He has ortraniz"d and set iu mo tion in every district of the State educational institutes, whose clject is keep alive the sup port of improvement and public sentiment. Without these powerful efforts of Colonel Trousdale we have no doubt that the school sysfra of IVnnessee would have been a sig nal failure. We hope tna tJovernor Maiki will reappoint lam. Doubtless there are ruauy other pewous in the State fully compe tent to the woik, but they nre untried. olonel Troupdalt has bea tried and is not lound wanting. He has been weighed in the scales and proves a success. This id bo time now for swapping horses. Let well enough alone. If Governor Marks desires his administration to be a success he must 1-nv" tried and competent men about hiui tor ft-- work. New men will have to learn their work. j-uch seems to be the general voice of the oople ot tho Slate. Certainly Shelby counly is solid in favoring tho appcintmeut ot Trousdale. Ho bas every qualification for tlie position, a Lai been demonstrated by his sacccB3 as State superintendent, and he is loved throughout the State on account of his fidelity to friends and principle; his frank ness and truthfulness in all things; his amiability and aversion for causeless corflict; hi prudence of speech and action, end his faultless sense of justice and knightly co ir tesy. Sudt a man is Leon Trousdale, and he nhculd hi retained in the place he adjrns with 1 h f'.iolurly attainments and preut per sonal popularity. RADICAL I.VT1MIOATIO.V, Ten yea i-j ago, a negro in the southern states voted the Democratic ticket at the peril of his life. Tho whites were disfran chised, and if a colored voter intimated a dicpositiJa to tio justice to the whites, by Toting for their enfranchisement, ha was set upon by the black mob and kicked and ab ibed like a dog. There ore several col ored men here ia Memphis who bear upon their persons marks of violence, inflicted be cause thpy were guilty of the crime of votiug tho Democratic tich'-t. Before (he southern people were enfranchised and given home rule, a colored Democrat wa3 ostracised by his race, and if ho voted lfu honest convictions, kicks acd cuffs were the penalty. This practice has njt bien entirely abandoned. We see it stated tht at Society Hill, South Carolina, at the last election a colored man br the name of Granville Tool, who voted with tho Democrat November Mb, has been deposed from his place as a dea con in a colored liaptibt church for his offense. A colored preacher named Kpps, who refused to voto with the Republicans, bas been ordered out of the pulpit and told that he must confers to having corcmilted a sin and must beg forgiveness of the church before being rdlowcd to preach again. At Murfreesboro', North Carolina, a negro who voted the Democratic ticket was terribly beaten by his colored neighbors, and many others have been turned outof theirchurche?. All these are well-authenticated cases end it would be well for candid Republicans throughout tho north to consider them before falling into line with the virulent Republican press in abusing the southern Democracy for alleged wrong-doings. If there have been instances of bulldcz'n? oa thclpart of the Red 'Shirts ot South Carolina and Louisiana, it is only evident that the Republi cs in those States have been guil ty of the same offense, and the score is therefore even. Of course we do not for a moment sympatliizj with any such lawless methods of carrying elections. We believe in every voter being untratumcled and secure in his constitutional right to vote according to the dictates cf his own conscience. But when the northern Republicans take up ru mors of a few isolated caes of election frauds on the part of ii responsible Democrats ia the back districts; and when a Republican Presi dent gives space and credence t3 these ru mors in his annual message to congress, it is about lime for Democrats to bein showing np the other side of the story, and placing a fair share of the responsibility for these south ern "outrages'' where it rightfully belongs upon the shoulders of the Republican patty, JAl'RSOV 

HIBKSAV Every town aftlioted by yellow-fever pre sents a hero. Friars Feint, Mississippi, furnishes one in the person of Jackson Kirk man, the editor of tho Coahomian. Mr. Kirkman is a bachelor, had but lew ties to bind hiui to the community, but, loving bu inanity more than himself, ho breasted the storm of death in taking care of the sick and burying the dead. A9 an evidence of the "unbounded admiration, respect and esteem' which the people of Friars Point entertain for Mr. Kirkman, they held a public meeting a few nights since uud presented him with an elegant watch tnd chain. Mr. Dun Scott, sou of Chancellor Scott, who lived and died in tbij city, was selected as the speaker for the occasion. His eulogy tTpon Mr. Kirkman was as beautiful and eloquent as it was appropriate and deserving. We make tho following extract from Mr. Kirk- man's reply. Gentlemen and friends, it is altoetL.t r un necesiary that I should attempt to (xpreos me artection inspired in my Heart I y tuis manitestation of your regard, lint, ar as is the thought ot your approval of my con duct, flattering as is this demonstration of your affection, dearer, unmeahurably i!i arer, is the knowledge that, in some dejvje, I may have lessened the sting of dw.fli lor friends, and the assurance that my presence and eilorts were a consolation to diNiiessed survivors. 1 do not wish to revive hi r, to night, a vivid picture of tho sad scei.es it was my fate to witnesa. but will merely mention that from each and every one of our I noble dead, in whose funeral rites I assisted, with the exception of our lamented Judge Rucki, who died a tow moments before I reached him, and the sweet lady. Mrs. George Alcorn, whom 1 did not sea living in sickness I ay from each and every one of our nt.ble dea l, wi'h these expptiocs, I had expressions of love and appreciation that will nnir sweetly in the ear of my memory as irng m that lacuity is preserved. uenue uii'u, I a.cfpt our t ntimonial, and hall re-L-ard it. like that from mv doar ladv friends. as my most valuable property. Millions of money could not buy it, nor would 1 utr..-u-der it to force mere willingly than I would my own heat's blood. And yet, I must con'.. I was oppressed with a feeling cf un worthiness while listening to the clcqn-nt and beautiful compliment of my intiuiata and calttmed friend, Mr. IUn Scott, whoji you have selected to repiei-ent yru in jour 'x'n-nie goodness and favor. (' iiti'-mtn, I trunt Ibis beautiful watch, tn- iianced a it is by the love I bear you, may he uext my heart and bt at in consonunce with it, hk'i tautl! ;d drjms, silent marches to an aed grave, but that it shall never indicate the lime when I shall be guilty of a dishon orable action, or forgetlul of your loving kindness. Alter the delivery of his speech Mr. Kirk- man was overwhelmed with the congratula tions ot his friends, who crowded around him to xpress their gratitude. The heroism which Mr. Kirk man displayed during the ep idemic fully illustrates what is often said, and which we can only repeat in substance, that "the bravest are the loving, the tender et ore the daring." At the last Methodist conference Kirkman took the premium for being the biggest sinner in the State. But in the hour of gloom, when death was hold ing high carnival, and when the pious saints fled from danger, the glorious heart and chivulric soul of Jackson Kirkman loomed up in sublime grandeur. Mr. Kirkman "was born with a silver SDOon in hw mouth." He belongs to one of tho oldest, most respects ble and aristocratic families of North Ala bam a. We have known him since he -ore bareleet, and rejoice to know that if time has dnalt harshly with him, and misfortunes have swept from him the opulence of other days, he is still rich in the powession of a bes.rt that throbs for the woes of others. PROSPERITY AXI COSKIUKSCE. A gratifying thing about the present pros perity of Memphis is that it does not come only from what we sell, but from what we save. We used to buy all ouj: corn, oats and hnv from tha west, now a good portion of these necessaries is grown in the country around u. We grind a large portion of the cornmeal we consume, we make a great part of the boies tnd barrels our merchants use in nackinir. we have units a ronsiderable thaie cf the butter, eggs, potatoes, poultry bogs, onions, beans, cabbages, cucumberp, fruit and lettuce, peas, peaches and strawber rits we rcGoit-e, produced in the country around a?. Not only so, but a are eendicg every spring immense quantities of vegeta bles, poultry, eggs, butter, peaches, apples, pluius, potatoes, and very many other things, to the north, a or pearly all these things we used to be dependent on tiii north, and now we are commonly exporting in the siting to places where we used to buy all through the fpricir and the winter. So we go, every year raising more products that we can send north while there 2 demand for early garden-stuff, and what the north does not want re consume at home, instead of sending away cash w bay it. Memphis par-tlz-id! Memphis has within iiwaolt, within the country around her, within the commercia.1 ta&iiitiee her position gives her, resources that defy tuUfoi-tuii tsure prog ress, and make wealth and prosperity every year more certain and more rich than the year before. Memphis believes in going ahead, and she acts on lief creed. The New Ycrk Herald, of Saturday, was very correct when it said: "The south is rising more per ceptibly out of the universal depression than foe north. In spite of the hard times, which have weighed like an incubus on all the in dustries of the country, the southern people, colcred as well ai whites, tiava bee.n ail vauciag in well-being, ia comtort, and they are covji'h'ttt of a prosperous future." With yelow-ffcver added to hard times, Memphis i;a &U that confidence, and with gOOj M&30C. Tbk State debt of Tennessee is the largest of all the southern Stake, with the exception ot that of V.rginirt, which with accrued interest amounts to something like fifty millions ot dolLai'H. In speaking of the Virginia debt the Philadelphia Press says: "It was con tracted before the war, and no portion of it can be charged to the much-abused 'carpet bagger, for at the period these obligations were incurred, none but native-born Vir ginians, sciots of the first families, were per mitted to sit in her legislative councils. The bonds were iosued for the benefit of various woiks of internal improvement, and the corporations becoming bankrupt, were neither able to repay the loan nor to meet the in terest thereon." It is not true that all of this debt was contracted before the war. Much of it was incurred while Virginia was nnder the iron heel of despotism, and the State rnled by adventurers. Even if the whole debt was contracted before the war, that lessens the obligation for paying it, as tho guaranteed property in slaves was abolished and the people of Virginia were losers ot millions of dollars, and thereby deprived ot the facilities for paying. TiiAMrs for want of the means of getting a living, and million? of acres unproductive for want of occupants, is one of the strange phenomena to be found in the United States. In the Netherlands persons able to work, but found begging, are sent to a government farm and made of use; is such a sensible proceeding impossible with us? We should not punish a man because be has not got work, but find him work and make him do it. Ia that way many individuals who have never been taught how to make a living, would acquire that valuable accomplishment; many who are "botches" at what they have learned would become excellent laborers at the plow, in the harvest field, and among sheep and cattle. Tho proper way to deal with tramps, and to help all who want vrork and cannot get it, is to find them work on our unfilled acres and have them do it. Thb New Orleans Times pleads for a full celebration of the carnival when next Mardi- Ura.i arrives, and asserts that those who op pose it were trie runners-away Irom the epi demic; adding: "Why should not the C res cent City throw off the yoke of sadness which has been forced upon her, and re as sume tho olden and gladdening mantle of festival?" and concludes, "Le Hoi jaune est mort! Virele Roidu Carnival!" We dear ly love the Mardi-Graa celebration in Mem puis, ouc our nearts are too heavy and our sorrowing memories too busy to observe it this year. The :sew Orleans Picayune, we ob serve, also favors the celebration as an incen tive to business. It says: "The carnival fes tivities being our greatest attraction to our customers in adjacent cities and States, and to strangers from the north and west, it is not only wise to give them, but extra exer tions should be luada." l ue jjeinoaisi L,nrtsitan Advocate sees in the willingness of some of the Episcopal ministers to condemn the conduct by which their church drove Wesley's followers out of it, a desire to win the Methodists back to the old fold. The Advocate pithily says : ' 'Where would our friends of the Protestant Episcopal church put us? Once in their fold, we would outnumber them, outvote them, change their canons right and left; in short, wholly de stroy their identity," Is California, instead of selling grain by the bushel, they sell it by the cental that is, by the one hundred pounds. The trade committee of the Mew York produce ex change has been called upon to introduce the cental. Cincinnati and St. Louis adopted the cental several years ago, but did nt succeed in carrying it out. It is a much- required improvement. A tOMMt-'NiriT paper, remarking upon the injustice of the rich toward the poor, give?, as an instance, that fact that while thousands of the ill-ussd, starving poor die every month, there is hardly one king dies in a year. That does seem unjust; how is it to be accounted for? T1IK KXT L,M;i!L.ATL'm5 Brat oa It frenchmen t and Reform I.Ut of Bills of tbat Character Already Prepared; to Ue Presented. Nashville Banner. 6th: Having learned that the senator-elect from this county, Hon. Clay Roberts, was engnged in preparing quite a number of bills to be presented for ... . i ia. j: parage to the next general assemuiy lenuing to a reduction ot the current expenses cf the State government, and amendments to the criminal laws ly which a large amount ot costs will be saved to the Staty, we called on that gentleman yesterday and were shown the following bills: To reduce tha compensation of the judges of tha supreme court Irom four to three thousand dollars Der annum. 1 o reduce the compensation oi the circuit judges and chancellor from twenty-hve nun- Ureii to eighteen hundred dollars per annum. To repeal the law allowing the adjutant- general of the State a salary of eighteen hundred dollars per annum. To repeal the law allowing the comptroller a clerk at the expense of the State on a salary of twelve hundred dollars per annum. To repeal the law allowing the secretary of state a salary of twelve hundred dollars per annum. To repeal theliw authorizing the appoint ment of a superintendent of the penitentiary at a salary of twenty-five hundred dollars per annum, and requiring the warden of the penitentiary to perform the duties now lm posed by law on the superintendent without Additional compensation. To repeal the law creating a bureau of noriculturo. statistics and mines, which is now costing the State twelve thousand two hundred dollars per annum. To repeal the law allowing the State geol ogist a salary of one hundred dollars per an num. To reduce the compensation of the supenn tendent of the Capitol from fifteen hundred dollars to six hundred dollars per annum, To reduce the compensation of the State librarian f rom one thousand to six hundred dollars per annum. To reduce the compensation of the superin tendent of public instruction from three thousand to eighteen hundred dollars per annum. To eaualize and regulate the salaries of certain public officers. The bill provides that no clerk of the supreme court, clerk and mas ter of the chancery court: clerk of the crimi nal court, clerk of the county court, collector of revenue, district attorney-general, treasu rer, secretary of state or comptroller, shall receive, directly or indirectly, irom the lees, emoluments or perquisites of his office, nor as trustee, commissioner, trustee or receiver, or from anv position or place ot trust, or em ployment to which he may be appointed by any court or judge, any sum greater than two thousand dollars er pnnum, and requires all the officers enumerated to uako -nder oath and file with the comptroller, on the first Monday in January and July of each year, a true exnioit or an fees received oy them for the previous half year, and pay over to theconiptroller.lit aState officer, and to the county trustee, if a county officer, any amount in excess ot two mousana aoijars, iao ui.i then provides that the judges of the various courts may authorize the clerks to employ as many deputies as are absolutely necessary to pertoiu. :e Unties ot tne omce, ar a salary or not exceeding liltv doil&rc rer month each. A bill civin? circuit and criminal judges discretionary power whether they will hold jurors together .r disperse them during crim inal trials, thn$ saying a heavy expense for boarding jurie. A bill repealing the law compelling the State to pay the cost in crm.inal cases where clerks have taken insufficient securities. A liii requiring parties imprisoned, while waiting for trial, id co to tiio ponty v;ork- house in place or the. au. A bill prohibiting appeals to the supreme court in manvcases where now allowed. Mr.' jtobeiLa ptorrrsus that the amount to which he desired to reatuue iue salaries ot the governor, the judges of the supreme' court, and the circuit judges and chancellors, are the same that were paid them in 1861, at the breaking out of the f -r, find as the cost of living and of transportation va never u'ueiip er than it is at present, he is satisfied that alt salaries should be reduced accordingly. He say3 that until within a few years back nei ther the governor, the comptroller nor the secretary of state were allowed clerks at the expense of the State; that the duties oi these officers are nofc aiore onerous than they were before 1372, and if they desue to hae forae coo to do their work for them it is but just and proper that fcey should bear the expense out of their own pockets. Tbs superintendent of the Capitol now dravs Salary of fifteen hundred dollars per annum, white tii.ea fjre tnndreds of young men in the State worthy"i8d poaipetept po fill the place at lea than half that afaount. In support of his bill to abolish the office of agriculture, statistics and mines, Mr. Roberts informs us that he fully appreciates the value of immigration, and that if Tennessee was out of debt be would go as ikf- as the farthest to encourage immigration; but an the State i2 now unable to pay what she owes, he is not willing to spend twelve thousand two hun dred dollars per annum for this department. He has, by way of amendments to the crim inal code, proposed a bill giving magistrates jurisdiction to dispose pf many small offenses that now go to the circuit and ciujici! courts. Mr. Roberts has also prepared a bill with much care, e&t;Ued "An act to regulate as signments for the benefit of creditore." It prescribes, in substance, that every bSoin ment made by any debtor for the benefit of creditors shall provide for a proportionate distribution of all his personal and real etalo, except what is exempt by law from execution and attachment, among all his creditors in proportion to the amount of their respective claims. Without cowtiiiUinsr ourselves to the sup port ot all these measures, wa present them to our readers, acd particularly to the mem' hers of the general assembly, as matters that will be up tor consideration when the legisla ture meets. he panner has been alive to the importance of economy and retrenchment in the management of State afiairs, and will at all times be found in advocacy of measures tending in that direction. It may be that soma of the bills in question go a little too far, but in every case where legitimate re forms can be affected and unnecessary ex pen ses cut down, the Banner will be found on the sida of economy and reform. - Republican Ktlqaette. VVashington Post: The Preaident and his wife will receive all calls and return none. During the session cf congress stated re' eeptions are given, which all may attend. A morning reception should be attended in the usual morning reception costume, hut it is not considered respectful to appear in less than evening toilet at an evening reception, and for an evening call merely demi-toilette is preferable. When entering, your name is announced by the usher, whereupon the marshal of the district introduces you to the President, and afterward to other members of the family who may be present. It is a vexed question as to whom properly belongs the second place in tha scpial grade the chief-justice or the Vice-President. Much may be eaid on both sides. The significance ot our social etiquette is not personal, but political, and it simply resolves itself to the Question, which is of mora political import ance, the chief-justice or the Vice-President? the hrst named is certainly, in some respects, much more responsible and dignified. He holds the ultimate power of appeal: he can, st times, control the executive, and, holding his omce for Ins. he is a hxed star in the na' tional firmament. The Vice-President, : I 1 " T J L 1 ' I Bimpiy as ice-i reaiuem, nas no spwiai po liticU significance. His greatness is antici patory rather thin actual, consisting in the remote contingency of his becoming Presi dent, and the dignity ot his position arises from his being president of the United States senate. A social congress should be called to settle these weighty matters of the law, and until that is done the dilemma may be met as a distinguished Washington lady meets it by not inviting these two dignitaries to her table at the same time. 1 be fourth planet in our social system is the Bpeaker of the house, who is three removes from the Presidency, and is often a political power of the first im portance. All these dignitaries are entitled to the first visit. In regara io the cabinet, great confusion of opinion prevails a to the question ot social precedence, and though it is a question which needs be settled only on occasion of State dinners or official receptions, the Post would not be fulfilling the whole duty ot man utr less it stated the case t'uiiy. The order to be observed is the priority in which tho offices were created, yiz: The state, the treasury, the war, the navy, the general postofbxe, the interior and the department of justice. The difference of opinion as to who should receive the first visit, the cabinet officer or the sena tor, is gradually being decided in favor of the senator. The "first visit" seems to have been an apple of discord at a very early date, it is ot th's that Mr. Adams's letter, before referred to, chiey treats, and he quotes voluminously from "Mrs. Auass." what she did and did not do. After all it is the wo men who watch the social boundaries, and carry on in Washington parlors the wars of the political arena. iFor this senatorial claim to precedence is based on the argument that the senator represents State sovereignty, while the cabinet officer is simply ap pointed and depends on the confirmation of the senate. Still, the senator is also subject to tho State legislature, and so of course and yet, such K the dignity and re sponsibility of a cabinet officer that well, tho massive brain of the Post reels under una a veightof argument, and can oily fee bly suggest thalotuciai aimng-tabies be made like that celebrated table in John O Groat's house, where eight jealous brothers of the ' bouse oi O Uroat tat down, each one at lb head of the octagon table. The ladies of the cabinet probably work harder through the season than any one else in Washington. The demands upon their time and strength are enormous, and it must require a good deal of muscular Christianity to go through the crush ot a "card reception in the night of the season. XL Ell 

PHIS. The Friendship of Xortta Hlaalaalppl- Tbe Opinions of lta Xewsjpapera. Panola (Miss.) Star: "A stranger who bad never heard of the late terrible epidemic would not suppose, on visiting Memphis now, tbat it had done any damage to the business there at all. The numerous people he would meet clad in the habiliments of sorrow might give an idea ot the sad reality, but the activ ity on the streets and in the stores would c luse him to regard Memphis as she is the Uueen City of the southwest. Here and there a gloomy, despondent merchant may be found, it is true, but these are exceptions. and such may be found anywhere and every where. 1 he merchants generally, however, are in good spirits, and while they are fully aware that a substantial portion of their legitimate and valuable trade has been swept away by the scourge, they have sense enough to know that the same country has yet to be supplied to a very large extent, and that Memphis is the natural fountain from which the supplies are to be drawn. It would be a sad day lor West lennessee, Worth Ala bama and Mississippi that should witness the downfall of Memphis, for all must sink or rise toe-ether. In adversity or prosperity they are inseparably cooncted. and it is the duty and the interest of Memphis to stand by these surrounding communities as it is their duty and interest to stand by her. Let the merchants ot Memphis becneertui and nope t'ul. and thev will all be thoroughly convinced ere long, 'There's life in the old land yet.' " Okalona (Miss.) Times: "n our recent visit to Memphis, we found everybody and everything busy: goods remarkably low, and of quick sale. Judging from the receipts to date, Momphis will handle more cotton this season than she has for years, and perhaps than ever before. The population is increas ing and the outlook is decidedly good. We were told by several gentlemen, who were well posted about the city, tbat the popula tion vas decidedly larger nqw than it was before the occurrence of tho late scourge. Not withstanding the predictions of many.that Memphis would never rise rgain, her exports and imports will prove to the contrary. If a recurrence of the yellow-fever can be pre vented, in a few years she will become sec ond to none along the great Mississippi." The Ieadhea4 Fiend, irom a New York programme: "Give me three for the matinee, or two, say, for the evening. Give them to me! oh, give them to me! I was passing through a corridor of the lu natic a.yluiu on Blackwell's Island, says a writer in Xoah's Times, when I heard the above appeal. It came from a middle-aged man, whose wan countenance and appealing attitude attracted my attention and caused me to halt.' Seeing me, he approached, and, extending one hand, asked in wheedling tones i " Give me two for a matinee." " Can't a man come to the Island for a pleasure tour among the unfortunate without beinsr followed by the tree-ticket iNemesise thought I, and asked the keeper what was the matter witu the m8-".

"Can't yoii get rde fdinf to-mght:'! asked the lunatic, I did not consider this as an evidenco of in curable lunacy, because I had heard the re quest so frequently made by supposed sane people. "No," I replied, "I cannot give you four. but would you like three to the .National the ater. and see the Ilavpv t'lamiluf." lbe lunatic shuddered, his eyes rolled, and ha 8?,id, with a sudden burst or passion, JNo, I don't."' r I remarked to the keeper that I did not be' lieve this man was so utterly incurable as he had sun posed. I left tha H-ene nd the lunatic, who was amusing himself with little pieces of cards, the corners of which wei a cut off. What a terrible lesson there is in this case. What a caution to the great army of bores and "ticket-fiends." They had driven a great many people unto lap verge Qf lunacy by their persistency and cheek in search ot free passes and tickets, but I did not imagine that they were so constituted aB to suiter them selves. This is not only a caution to the so- called ticket-fiends, but to managers who cater to the crowd. SI Oder n Conveniences. Baltimore Sun ; f'At a jneeting of scient ists held in London some three weeks ago a ptper yas read on the subject of neglect in sanitary matters.'' After dPspribuig tha now well recognised rules which must be' conir Elied with to insure the sanitary safety of a ouse such as trapping drains ' and cutting off direct communication between them and the cisterns, sinks, overflow from baths, etc. and the serious danger arising from neg lect in these particularf.it was suggested that he duty should be devolved upon health departments of eaapip; the condition of houses having what is termed ''modern con veniences," and tbat every house-holder be fore taking a house should require from the owapr a certificate from the health authori ties as to ipa sanitary sufficiency. If such suggestion could be carried in practice there can be no doubt that ' it would lead to more skilful plumbing, and would tend very ma terially to lessen the number or cai.es of dip theria in families, as well as of zymotic dis eases generally on this side of the Atlantic. The New York board of health is clothed with power to enforce the correction of bad plumbing whpn ii. ia hov7n that the escape of sewer gas has caused sickness ift the house; but the board has no right to enter a house before a tenant occupies it.

A Colorado mine operator and a ranchman discovered a large deposit of carbonate of lead and zinc blend near the south Arkansas river, about seventy miles south of Lead ville. A dipp-te arose between them, and the ranchman agreed to sell out tq his part ner for six thousand five hundred dollars, it the whole amount of money was paid within eight months. The mine operator actually stinted himself and family the common nec essaries of life to get the money, and paid four thousand out of the six thousand five hundred dollars, but having a large number of unpatented mines to work out the annual as sessment required by law, could not meet the last payment in time. He went to St. Louis, and tried for three months to raise the money by ottering ope-half the mine to any good business man that would join him and pay the 6ix thousand five hundred dollars that the entire share, when fully paid up, would cost, but failed to raise the money, On his return to Colorado, his ranchman-partner coolly told him that his time was np, and it would just take about one hundred thousand dollars to get his share in the mine. During the miner's absence in St. Louis, the ranchman had worked a few feet into the mine, and uncovered as great a deposit of carbonates of lead with silver as has yet been discovered. These gentlemen now hold their property at the snug little sum of five hundred thousand dollars.

" '" "- "Tiint l Certain! V for Me," A row incurred in a leading Chicago thea ter the other day. This is the explanation given by one ot the afternoon papers: "Dur ing the third act, Mr. L?arock, who plays the part of 'Elliot Gray,' so acquitted himself as to be called before the curtain by the plaudits of the enthusiast if a"d;eco. In answer to ibis call he appeared, and, with his hand upon'his breast, jrade a vr-rv grace ful salaam. In the fourth act Mr. L-oarock again so acquitted himself as to draw from hie admirer' a manifestation of their warm approbation. Just ' as Mr. Learock was stumbling over the stage furniture and dodg ing between the scenes to answer the c&Ui he claims t'pat Mr. Siiai g, the manager, rang the curtain ud on the last act, thus cheating him of his anticipated ovation." The Tribune says; " call before the curtain is more to a 'rising young actor' than a thousand dol lars. To 'take the cuttain' is the proud est momept of his life, To be defrauded of that extulsita priviie&e liy an en vious manager, afraid tbat his actors will put on airs over it, is worse than throwir g him into a well. Mr. Learock suffered this ignominy. We all know that beautiful scene in the gypsy camp, and the tableau which follows the recovery of tha 6tolen child by 'Elliot Gray.' The audicnco clap their hands and stamp their feet as the curtain falls upon it, and the curtain rolls up again, and again the audience stamp and clap. If there ghould be o;ie or two e;tra stamps, the prin cipal figure in the. scene the hero says: 'That is certainly for me,' and he 'takes the curtain.' Something of this kind happened several nights, ad the tage manager and the leading man failed to agree as to what the audience meant. Some expressions ot a mutual affection ensued, which resulted in the temporary withdrawal of the 'Elliot Gray' and the substitution of another actor in his place , The whole matter was subse quently disposed of by auiicablo settlement."
