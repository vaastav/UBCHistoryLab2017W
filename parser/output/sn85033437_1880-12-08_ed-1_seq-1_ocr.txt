Dillon to Hon. L. C. Houk and published in the National Republican, announces that Gov. Marks dec-idea the election for a representative in the legislature from Polk and Bradley counties a lie between Joute, republican, and Stew ait, democrat,"and that a vacancy ex ists. We presume another election will be ordered at once. Congressman Cox, chairman of the census committee will, at an early day, introduce a bill for the reappor tionment of representatives in con greea on the basis of 170,000 population to each congressional district. This would leave the number of representa tives about as tt present 293. But it is probable that the number will be increased some tbink to 325. There ia a growing disposition in this country to banish everything like sectarianism from the schools of thn countrv. As they Iccreass in favor the people become more watch ful in guarding against everything that might possibly impair their use fulness. Even in sectarian colleges careistiken by those most popular nd useful, to guard against the teaching of sectarianism in any form that might prove cflkn sive. We are glad this ia true, and above all things, the people are determined that nothing of this kind ehall enter into the manage ment of the free echools of the couns try. Such a thing will not be tolerated and ought not to be. The free school Interest U too sacred to be managed by any such a narrow-minded epirit. We yielded a liberal thare of our space to a synopsis of and extracts from the president's mespage. Line all of President Hayes' tt-.t) papers, it is a plain, comprehensive, common sense document. Public questions are discussed in a dignified manner, and it may be stt down ea certain that hia last annual message will detract nothing from the high rtsptct in which the administration is held by all classes of people. He makes a number of impoitiat recommendations and sug gestions. What he says about polyga my will command the approval of a large number of the very,fcett peopla in the land. His recommendation in regard to the silver dollar will doubt le33 provoke discussion. His views on the refunding of that portion of our securities falling due next year are sound and are doubtless in accord with a mejority of both houses of corgrc-rs. He suggests the creation of a nsw grade in the army for General Grant, which we believe will be endorsed by the country. He makes a number of recommendations it will be teen, all of which touch upon questions of vital importance to the country.

G, Dec. 7. Mr. Ward, of Pennsylvania, intro duced a bill for the appointment of an assistant secretary of war. Re ferred. Mr. Belford, ef Colorado, offered a resolution directing the secretary of the interior to inform the house under what law or warrant oi au thority Douglass, a sub-chief of the Ute tribe of Indians, is connned in the military prison at Fort Leaven worth, and what steps, if any, have been taken by the United States authorities to bring, him to trial for alleged complicity in the murder of Indian Agent Meeker. Adopted. The speaker proceeded to call the committees for reports. Tho call having been concluded without the presentation of any re ports Mr. Bicknell called up, as a question of privilege, the senate resolution relative to the counting of the electoral vote. Mr. Keifer raised to a point of order that the resolution did not present a question of privilege. A debate ensued, m which Messrs. Bicknell and Springer maintained that whatever related to the constitutional right of the two houses to declare the electoral vote was a question of privilege. The house had certain powers relative to the election of President. It, and it alone, must determine when the con tingency arises what was contemplat ed in the constitution and when it must act in the matter and choose a president. Messrs. lieuer and Robeson con tended that a concurrent resolution proposing a joint rule to the pres ent mode of counting the electora. vote was not a question of privilege The president of the senate alone had the right to count the electora vote. The house could not make contingency and then declare that it had arisen and proceed to elect president. The house, they main tained, had nothing to do with the making of the contingency. The speaker replied that the house was tho sole judge of the question of the fact whether or not a contin gency has arisen. It must determine when, under the constitution, it must choose a president, and a president so chosen will be the president of the United States. Mr. Reagan (Texas) argued that the matter presented was a question of privilege and that the president of the senate was merelv a vehir.lA or medium between the electors and the two houses of congress. After some further debate, in which Messrs. Conger, of Michigan, Hooker, of Mississippi, Updegraff, of Iowa, and Whitthorne, of Tennes see, participated. The speakers said the uniform practice, certainly a recent practice, goes to the extent of showing that the two houses do count, and have counted the electoral vote. If the chair were to refuse on tech nicalities to allow an adjournment between the two houses as to the government of the houses when in joint session, it might lead to con fusion, chaos, and perhaps commo tion. In the opinion of the chair it makes no difference by whom the votes are counted. If done by the two houses it is the highest duty they have to perform. If done by any other person it must be done in the presence of the two houses; so that any rule relating to the joint meeting is a question of the very highest privilege, and he must so rule. Mr. Bicknell then demanded the previous question, and the democrats refusing to allow the renublififina un limited time for debate, the latter filibustered to prevent action. For a time it seemed as if the house would come to a dead lock, but Mr. Keifer finally withdrew his demand for the previous queition, and Mr. Keifer delivered a written argument against the pending meas ure, which he characterized aa a measure of usurpation and fraud and one which might lead to blood shed and war. At the conclusion of his speech the subject went over for the present and the house adjourned. WASHINGTON. Washington, Dec. 6. Attorney General Devens in his annual report recommends the establishment of an intermediate court of errors and ap peals to relieve the supreme court and facilitate justice; the exempting of postmasters from personal liabil ity when sued for official ; acts; the repeal of the statute allowing claim ants in the court of claims to verify their petition by agents; payment of United States attorneys by salary in stead of fees; extension of federal election laws to all polls where con gressmen are voted for instead of their application only, po cities of 20,000 inhabitants and upwards; also placing the control of such polls in the hands of federal instead of state officers; the establishment of a United States penitentiary in Arizo na or New Mexico.

At a meet ing of the ways and means committee of the house, this morning, the re funding bill was taken up and, after some discussion of the subject, a motion was made by xiepresentative Tucker (Virginia), and unanimously carried, that the chairman be author ized to amend the refunding bill now pending before congress by inserting three per cent, wherev er the words three and a half occur. It is believed by the committee that the time has arrived when the three per cent, bonds can be floated at par. The committee adjourned till Thurs day at 10:30 a. m. The republican senators held a caucus this morning to determine what changes, if any, should be made in the minority representation on the senate committees for this session. It was agreed that with the excep tion of one or two unimportant changes the republican membership shall remain as at present.
