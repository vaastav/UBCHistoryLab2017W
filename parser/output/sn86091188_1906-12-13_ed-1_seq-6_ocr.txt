They , fad to gtv to the national government sufth ieiillv ample power, through T. nlted States courts and by the use of the army and navy, to protect aliens in the red to them under solemn i.h are the law of the land, therefore earnestly recommend that the criminal and civil statutes of the I nlted States he so amended and added to as to enable the president, acting for the Foiled States government, which I» responsible In our international rela tions tt, enforce tiie rights of aliens un der treaties. Kven as the law now la .something can he «lone by th« federal government toward thi« end, and In the matter now before me affecting the Jap anese, everything that it is in my power to do will be don*, arul all of the forces, military ami civil, of the Tnited States which I may lawfully employ will be ho employed There should, however, be no particle of doubt as to the power of the national government completely to ' perform ami enforce Its own obligations I to other nation«. Th* mob of a single city mav at any time perform acts of lawless violence against some class of I foreigners which would plunge us into ! war. The city by itself would be power less to make defense against the for * eign power thus assaulted, and if inde pendent of this government it would never venture to perform or permit the performante of the acts complained of. The entire power and the whole duty to protect the offending city or the ofTend i n g community lies in the hands of the 1« . ! 'ni ted States government, thinkable that we should continue a pol icy under which a given locality may bo : allowed to commit a crime against a friendly nation, and the United States government limited, not to preventing the commission of the crime, but. in the last resort, to defending the people who have committed It against the conse quences of their own wrongdoing." Cuban Intervention. Tiie rebellion in Cuba and tiie inci dents leading up to the establishment of the provisional government is reviewed, und the president says; "When tiie election has been held and the new government inaugurated in peaceful and orderly fashion of the provi sional government will come to an end. I take this opportunity of expressing upon behalf of the American people, with all possible solemnity, our most earnest hope that the people of Cuba will realize the imperative need of pre serving Justice ami keeping order in the island. The United States wishes noth ing of Cuba except that it shall prosper morally and materially, and wishes noth ing of tiie Cubans save that they shall be able to preserve order among them selves and therefore to preserve their independence. If the elections become a farce, and if the insurrectionary habit becomes confirmed in the island, It is ab solutely out of the question that tho island should continue independent; and the United States, which has assumed the sporsorshlp before the civilized world for Cuba's career as a nation, would again have to intervene and to see that the government was managed In such orderly fashion as to secure the safety of life and property. The path to b« trodden by those who exercise self-gov ernment is always hard, and we should have every charity anil patience with tho rubans as they tread this difficult parth. I have the utmost sympathy with, and regard for, them; but I most earnestly adjure them solemnly to weigh their re sponsibilities and to see that when their new government is started it shall run smoothly, and with freedom from fla grant denial of right on the one hand, and from insurrectionary disturbances on the other." Considerable space is devoted to the International conference of American re Publics end the visit of Secretary Root to Boutli America, and points to the fact that our efforts in behalf of the nations of that country are appreciated by them. On the subject of the Panama canal he promises a special message in tike near future. Second Hague Conference.

Under the guidance of Russia the arrangement of the preliminaries for such a conference has been progressing during the past year. Progress has necessarily l»eèn slow, owing to the great number of coun tries to be « onsulted upon every question that has arisen. It is a matter of sat isfaction that all of the American re publics have now. for the first time, been invited to Join in the proposed confer* tentative The The Army and Navy. ent standard menu the buildin >ear Of the p The y y he and « va! very ti existen an«! the general hoard are essential t The close jects to be taken up by the Red Cross conference hebt at Geneva last summer, and the subjects which naturally would c.une before The Hague conference, made it apparent that it was desirable to have the work of the Red Cross conference completed and considered by the different powers before the meeting at The Hague. The Red Cross conference ended Us la h°rs on the Ht h day of July, and the re vised ami amended convention, which was signed by the American delegate*, will be promptly laid l»efore the senate.
