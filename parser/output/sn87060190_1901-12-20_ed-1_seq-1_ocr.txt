Philippine Tailir Hill Reported to the Senate and Referred to Proper Committee Several Bills Intro duced Washington News. Washington, Dec. 19. After the vote on the Philippine revenue bill, which passed the house 1G2 yeas to 128 nays, there was a general exodus of con gressmen for their homes to spend the Christmas holidays, and Thursday when the house met there were many vacant seats. The session of the house was brief. Some odds and ends of business were disposed of. Mr. Cannon (Ills.) asked unanimous consent for the consideration of a de ficiency bill appropriating $10,000 for furnishing transcripts of records in the general land office. The employes who were doing this work, Mr. Cannon said, were mostly women, and he ap pealed to the house in the spirit of 'iho Yuletide season to pass the bill. There was no objection and the bill was passed. The message- of the president rela tlve to the creation of an Apalachlan forest reserve was laid before the house. Mr. Jenkins (Wis.), who proposed a constitutional amendment to control trusts In the last congress. Introduced a measure of similar character Thurs day, providing for a constitutional amendment declaring that "Congress shall have power to regulate com merce In the United States; that all private corporations, copartnerships and joint stock companies In the Uni ted States shall be under the control of congress; that congress shall have power in the United States to regu late, control, prohibit and dissolve all contracts and combinations In restraint of trade or commerce; that in abey ance of legislation by congress pursu ant to this article, all powers conferred upon congress by this article may be exercised by the several states." Hepburn Canal Bill. Representative Hepburn (Iowa), chairman of the house committee on commerce, made the report of the com mittee In favor of the Nicaragua bill. After stating the terms of the bill the report says In part: "The purpose of this bill Is to concentrate authority and respbnsiblllty for the construction of this great work In the hands of the president. It has been believed by your committee that this course would be safer In carrying out the purposes or the bill, Involving the expenditure of so large a sum of money, all the work and all the expenditure to be made at a distance so far from the capital, than any other method that could be de vised. We have tried to concentrate authority and responsibility rather than to disperse it among many per sons." The report refers to the "ex haustive report made by the Isthmian commission, of which Admiral Walker Is the head, then quotes the declara tions of various party platforms and Presidents McKinley and Roosevelt favoring the canal, and urges the pas sage of the bill. The house agreed to consider the Nicaragua cannl bill Tuesday, Jan. 7, and thereafter until disposed of, the order not to Interfere with revenue or appropriation bills. Representative Pearre (Md,) Intro duced a bill to revive the grade of vice admiral of tho navy, and authorizing the appointment of Wlnfield Scott Schley, William T. Sampson and Charles E. Clark to that grade. As Mr. Pearre represents tho district from which Mr. Schley comes and has been an active adherent of the admiral, the proposition to unite Admirals Snmp ean and Schley and Captain Clark of the Ore'gon In advancement to the rank of vice admiral Is regarded as a con ciliatory step. At 1:45 p. m. the house adjourned till Monday, Jan. 6. In the Senate. In the absence of Mr. Frye of Maine, president pro tem. of tho senate-' Mr. Perkins (Cal.) presided over Thurs day's session of tho senate.

At 12:40 p. m. the senate, on motion of Mr. Hale, went Into executive ses sion, and at 1 p. in. adjourned till Jan. 6, 1902. Philippine Commission Report. In Its annual report the Philippine commission suggests provisions for permanent civil government and legis lation for industrial development of the Philippine Islands. It is claimed that outside of Bataiigas, Samar, Ccbu, Mindora and Bohol there Is peace in the archipelago. It is also stated that the Federal party move ment has spread widely through the islands, and that members of the par ty had done effective work In inducing hostile Filipinos to surrender. As to political future of theFIUplnos, It Is de clared that the theory upon which the commission is proceeding is that the only possible method of instructing the Filipino people In regard to free Institutions and self-government is to make a government partly of Ameri cans and partly of Filipinos, w'th uiti mate control In American hands for some time to come. Less than 10 per cent of the people speak Spanish, and the educated people, under the Influ ence of Spanish teaching, have but a faint conception of real civil liberty and the mutual self-restraints re quired for its maintenance. The com mission has already, however, estab lished municipal suffrage in the paci fied parts of the Islands, and have limited the suffrage to those who can read or write either English or Span ish, who own property to the value of $250, pay an annual tax of $15 or have been elected to hold municipal offices. It is also proposed by practi cal lessons to eliminate from the minds of the mora intelligent part of the community those Ideas of abso lutism In government which now con trol and to Impress upon them the di vision of powers prevailing under the American system. For the purpose of carrying out these views the commis sion outlines a project which, In brief, contemplates the continuance for two years of the existing powers of the commission. Then a representative government is to bo formed composed of a civil governor, a legislative coun cil and a popular asoemoly, the powers of the latter being closely limited so as to prevent it from choking the gov ernment in making the budget, In fits of passion or through Inexperience. The president of the United States would, of course, reserve absolute veto power. The Filipinos should also have the right to be represented be fore congress by two delegates. It is proposed by the commission to settle the vexed question of land titles by by legislation providing for the sale of public lands upon the homestead principle, and the payment through a bond issue of the price of the lands now held by the religious orders. A full account is given by the commis sion of the organization of the system of education which has been going 0:1 so vigorously under Dr. F. W. Atkin son, tho general superintendent. Tho English language is the basis of all public Instruction, and nearly 1,000 trained teachers from the United States already have been put to work in town and cities in pacified districts. 

HERE'S A. HOWD'YEDO. German Ship Company Claims Cinch on Nlcaraguan Canal Route. Washington, Dec. 19. It Is learned that Germany expects to have some thing to Bay about the Nicaragua ca nal because of the interests of a Ger man corporation In a concession that will be Interfered with, and probably destroyed, by the construction of the canal. This interest has been obtain ed through the purchase by the Hamburg-American Steamship company of tho Atlas Steamship company. Tho former Is a German corporation and tho latter Is British. Tho Hamburg American company Is subsidized by tho German governmen and Its ships can be called upon for servlco as aux iliary cruisers of tho German navy In time of war. Under the concession from Nicara gua which the Hamburg-American line has acquired,- It Is asserted by foreign diplomats here, exclusive navigation rights of the San Juan river and of Lake Nicaragua are secured to tho German company. Tho history of tho concession, before It came into German hands dates from bsfore 1877. A company organized under the name of the Nicaragua Mall Steam Navigation and Trading com pany acquired the concession. Subse quently the Atlas Steamship company, a British company running a line of steamers from New York to Greytown and other ports In the Caribbean, bought the steamers, plant and conces sion of the Nicaragua company and applied for an extension and enlarge ment of the contract. This was grant ed by Nicaragua In June, 1897, and the contracts thus obtained were trans ferred to the Caribbean nnd Pacific Transit company, an auxiliary of the Atlas company. The contract gave the Atlas compa ny the exclusive right of steam navi gation in the Silaco lagoon for 30 years, dating from the approval of the contract Sept. 30, 1897, and the exclu sive right for the same time of con structing tramways and railways along the line to avoid the obstacles In the lower part of the San Juan river, mak ing the transit to San Juan del Norte or Greytown more rapid during the dry season. The company obligated Itself to construct within three years a narrow-gauge railroad about Ave miles long from a point on the Silaco lagoon to a point on the San Juan river, near the Colorado Junction, and suitable warehouses nnd wharves at the termi nals for passenger, frelgh't and other service. The road is now completed and In operation. This concession, with all the prop erty of the Atlas Steamship company, was purchased recently by the Hab-burg-American line. HOPES 8T MULATED. Put British War OMre I Warned to Keep a Sharp Lookout. London, Dec. 19. It Is said the war office has come into possession of a cipher dispatch purporting to have been sent by the Boer commandant, Delarey, saying he could not hold out longer than January. According to the correspondent of The Times at Pretoria, Delarey Is believed to be 40 miles northwest of Klerksdorp with about 400 men. The war ofllce is tak ing a more hopeful view of the war than It has taken at any previous time. The correspondent of The Times at Pretoria says the progress of the war Is eminently satisfactory, but care should be taken not to imagine that more has been done than is actually the case In order to avoid subsequent disappointments. It is hoped that before long the cleared area In the western Transvaal .will reach as far east as Mabalstand, but there Is a concentration of Boers under Commandant Kemp between Rustenberg and Zeerast; Commandant Lebenberg Is probably with Comman dant Delarey, near Klerksdorp. 123 miles southwest of Pretoria, and an other body of Boers near Wolmoar mansostad. In spito of the line of blockhouses and constabulary posts in the eastern Transvaal, It Is still pos sible for Boers to pass west. Dec. 15, 150 Boers passed over the Wllge river, but they are being closely pursued, and will probably either be captured or driven out. Blockhouses do not keep the Boers out unless built 600 yards apart with barbed wire entan glements between. The correspondent accounts for about 500 Boers in the Orange River colony, TJesldes Dewet's concentration, which Is divided Into two groups, com prising four commandos. Presidential Appolntmerts.
