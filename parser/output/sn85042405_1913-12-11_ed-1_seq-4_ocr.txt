The condition of anarchy and war fare that now exists in Mexico, and our present, negotiations with that country, together with the events that led up to the treaty of 1848, show a very striking similarity. If history repeats itself, the I'nited States will sooner or later be forced t0' assume control of part, if not all, of ttie great region south of the Rio Grande and the Mexican boundary line, extending to the Panama canal. This may not be brought about by direct intervention in the present war between the factions in Mexico, hut the logic of history and the ne cessities of modern civilization will in some way, force this issue to a vonclusion. Most European governments, plac ed in the same position as the United States, would have long before this found some excuse for war and a conquest of Mexican territory. But the national policy of the United States is of a higher type, .and when this nation assumes responsibilities for the government of an inferior race, it does so peacefully if possi ble, and expects to give and does give great benefits to both the coun try and the people: restores law and order, and offers opportunities to all who deserve it to make homes and get the most out of life consistent with safety ami prosperity of the nation .as a whole. Many good American citizens, while deploring armed intervention In Mexico, still believe that the wis est course will be for the United States in the near future, to take a strong hand in the suppression of the atrocities that are now occurrng in the Mexican rebellion, and which there is no prospect of being perma nently ended, whichever faction wins a temporary victory. The Mexican people as a race are not adapted to or qualified for a modern, progres sive self government. Centuries of education and development will be required for them to reach that stage. The world of today cannot wait on such slow progress. In 1848 the United States was granted by Mexico what is now the states of California, Nevada. Utah, half of Colorado, most of Arizona audi New Mexico. This territory ex tends along the Pacific and eastward more than 1,000 miles, has a greater population today than the entire United States had when it declared its independence from Great Britain, and comprises an area of nearly .700,000 square miles. It equals iu extent all of Great Britain, Ireland, France, the German Umpire, Ttaly, Norway and' Sweden, and has become the home of millions of prosperous citizens. If Mexico had retained it, who can doubt but the same condi tions that now prevail south of the Rio Grande would be seen in the ter ritory ceded to the United States? The d'estiny of the English speak ing race is manifestly to dominate and develop all of North America. The progress of white man's supre macy, operating under the great nat ural law of survival of the fittest, will force this sooner or later. No progressive administration in this country can Ignore this and long re main at the head of national affairs. 

POWERS OF REPUBLICAN NA TIONAL COMMITTEE. The question is being agitated among political leaders of the repub lican party whether it is advisable to call a special meeting of the na tional committee this coming spring or at gome later date. The object, if done, is to discuss plans for a par ty reorganization. The executive eommittee of the national committee in May last requested the chairman of the national committee to call a special convention to be held within 60 days after the expiration of the special session of congress which began in March of the present year. There are manifestly many defects in the machinery of the republican national convention which need to be corrected in the interests of fairness and actual representation. It is possible that a special meeting of the committee will be bad next year, al though there is a divided opinion At to the necessity for it. There is one conclusion, however, that has been announced by the legal committee, which is that the national committee has no authority to change the basis of representation and voting. The committee can change the manner and method of choosing delegates to future conventions to conform with the laws of the several states as they may be passed from time to time, but not otherwise. The national com mittee can, however, call a special national convention of the party. The matter of representation in southern states has been brought to the front by the last two national conventions, and it will have to be adjusted on different basis from what has heretofore prevailed. The Washington, D. C., Star, supposed to reflect the views of many leading members of the party, declares that a special convention should be held next spring for the purpose of re uniting the protectionist members of the party before another congres sional election, which will be decided by tiie issues raised in the recent democratic tariff bill. In this con nection the Star suggests that Orms by McHarg, who did work for the re publican committee in the south and recommended that the votes of that section be given to Mr. Roose velt in the last convention, be made a delegate to the convention, and that the information thus acquired be received, although it was made unavailable by the national commit tee at the last meeting. A certain interest still attaches to the infor mation and conclusions of Mr. Mc Harg, says the Star. Both republi can and progressive factions of the party are by this time probably con vinced that there is only one plan of action that will bring success, both in national and state elections, and that is a united support of the par ty's policy, principles and candidates as agreed upon at a really represen tative gathering of the delegates of the party, or as may be decided by popular choice at primary elections. NOT A 

PRACTICAL REMEDY. President Wilson urges in his message that farmers be given more opportunity to get credit for the bor rowing of money. This he seems to thni'k will restore to the business of farming a certain remedy which is lacking and which has caused the de cay of agriculture in this country as compared with manufacturing, and the building of cities. But it is very evident that farmers with the resources of the average equipped farm can already borrow all the money the value of the property, will justify in the open market. It is not the borrowing of money the farmer needs to makp Mm pros perous, but the prices for his pro* ducts which will give him a profit on his investment and labor. Then there will be no meed of easy bor rowing of money, for that only tends to make anyone careless of the re payment. Easy farm credSts may be all right for the development of certain la tent national resources, but whiat farmers of the country need is a steadily profitable price for what they produce, and which is paid by the consumer, but not to the farmer. Then farmers will not need1 to bor row money. Rural farm credits as they are found in European coun tries, may not be applicable to the United States. From the dawn of history the farming industry has borne the real burdens of taxation ,and has been exploited by every other class. To materially change this fundamental rule of all nations, other means than the easy borrowing of money will be necessary. Unless the repayment is equally easy the process will only put the farmer further in debt and more dependent on the money lend er. Mr. Wilson's scheme of easy borrowing as 4ielp to the farmers may be sincere in intent, but will not be practicable in operation. It is not the solution of a problem that has been made all the harder to solve by the new Wilson tariff bill which throws unfair burdens of raising public revenues on the indus try of farming. THE
