MHNTPF.I.1ER. VT . WEDNESDAY. PECEMKF.H 15 The Messaee. We devote a larre amount of spac to President Grant's annual niessaje which was delivered yesterday to Congress. The ilocuroent ?ieaks plainly for itself, and any reader can easily funl out whi ther its rarious statements are pleasing to him or not. Il is certainly one of the best state pa pers that has emanated frem this admin istration. The South, wo are thankful, is in such condition that the message is occupied with truly national eiTairs, and no one can complain of any part as being sectional in character, unless it is Hrighani Young and his polygamous ad herent". Tin; Cuban .nest'on is di-cussed at length. The President is against recog nizing the insurgents as a nation, and even opposed to recognizing them as b. lligeren.o. lie, however, certainly fore sha lows a determination to have the long war on that unhappy island stopped. No doubt the naval preparations have been icvde with a view of contingencies in wlu.-h 'pain might refuse demands made ,:nh. r. The policy of meddling with the Cuban affair at a!l is one upon which there an; grave ditlerences of opinion, and trie question resolves itself into whether the rights, instead of the convenience, of our eitiz-ns are interfered with by the Spani ard s and ubans. This is a question of fact an.! one which will be thoroughly consid ered, we d.ubt not. before any declaration of war is ever indulged in. The .resident, like Mr. P.laine, proposes to have a guaranty that the state, shall se cure education to the masses, and to have all sectarian use of the schools and school funds prohibited. The school question was put into iolities by the Geghan bill in Ohio and by the proceedings in New York by which, in the days of Tweed, sectarian j schools were fostered. There is now every I indication that it will stay there until it is j settled substantially as the president re commends. I lis hard money doctrine is what all ex pected, and what everybody lias expected since a few men got over the fright they were subjected to last year, when Mr. Gray and the other Boston men were snubbed. The message is a straightforward, sen sible document, and will, as a whole, please the country. IIorSK OinCF.KS At the democratic caucus Geo. M. Adams of Kentucky was nominated for clerk of tin; House on the liftti ballot. .John G. Thompson of Ohio was nominated sergeant at-arms on the first ballot. L. II. Fitzhugh of Texas was nominated'for door-keeper. Fitzhugh was sergeant-at-arnis for the confederate con gress. James Stewart of Virginia was nominated for jrostniasler, and Rev. J. L. Townsend of Washington, Episcopalian, was chosen chaplain. Townsend had to leave Connecticut (luring the war. He was too southern in feeling for the nutmeg folks to hear him. These officers wero all duly elected by the House. We get no intelligent accounts of the progress of the fighting in Cuba. The Spanish government has been sending out a great number of fresh troops, but there are no records of battles, and the contest seems to be reduced, on the part of insur gents, to marauding attacks on sugar es tates and incendiarism. Their poliey seems to be to lay waste the land us far as possible, and the government troops are being distributed over the island in small s mads, as a sort of police force. Cen. Orville E. F.abcock, the president's private secretary, has been indicted by the grand jury at St. Louis, for conection with the whiskey frauds, f.en. Babcock has asked for a trial by court-in.trtial, but that was before the indictment; very likelv he will be tried by both civil and military court. We always supposed Gen. IJ.vb cock could punish a large amount of tht article, but never, that he made money out of it. His telegrams look queer, but he ays lie can prove his innocence. Lir.-i.K Emma. T. W. Park, the X. Y. Trifmrif nnd Minister Schenek are giving inn li lifrature relating to the Emma mice. Schenek sayt he lost about ..jO,Qoo. Th' ra is a good deal of call for his resig nation, hut why f ambling in stocks is any worse than doing so at poker we can't see. The 1 itter don't seem to have prohibited appointments to high office, and it looks like a sudden accession of virtue that the former should cause removals. Mr. Fark intimates that he will sue the Tribunt for libel. Dr. Dunlap. a rival of Gen. Daniel Pratt as a icrpetual candidate for Presi dent of the United States, died at Watertown, N. Y., last Sunday, aged MJ years. A long time ago ho be came possessed of ths idea that he was to be President, and became a constant at tendant at jiolitical conventions, besides passing a large part of his time traveling and canvassing in his own behalf. He was of fine personal appearance, and a f rtune made in early life sustained him in comfort. Ex-Speaker Blaine and M.. Wheele. won a nice little victory in the I louse Monday, on the Louisiana tpiestion, de feating the mot'on made by Wood and sustained by all the democratic leaders except Holman. It was rather laughable to see a House with seventy democratic majority follow Mr. Blaine instead of their own chiefs. Secretary Chandler is purifying the in terior department, turning out a good many clerks. He is trying to get a good man for Indian Commissioner, but Mr E. S Tobey of Boston, and Ex-Gov. Ward of New Jersey, have, refused the appointmeut. The statue of Prince Albert, which is to be placed in the memorial at Hyde Park, is spoken of as not very satisfactory, be ing a sitting figure. A figure with two right angles is rather awkward looking, but the sitting pjsturo was adopted be cause the Queen insisted on having it. Gen. William Wells, Collector of Cus toms, has orders from Secretary Bristow to roduce the pay of his employes an amount equivalent to fifteen per cent of their annual salaries. Seven colored men in the new Congress, three of them have learned to read since emancipation. Tweed Escapes. William M. Tweed has escaped nom durance vile. Exposed in 1871. pursued in the courts till 1873 and convicted that year as a thief, he spent two years as a convict on BlackwcdTs Island. Last June the " cumulative sentences" were over thrown and he left the Island, but was ar rested on civil suits, and there were one or two indictments hanging over him. He has for six months been in Ludlow Street jail, b-ing by the accommodating New York officers permitted now and then to ride out and visit His friends. Last Satur day on one of these visits he disappeared. The story is thus told by Warden Dunham who had him in charge : WeWtthe nns-in a little af'T 1" Vi"'-'. th- "-irtv c-.im'.tinir of T-wct. hiB 'i William. Keeper hdw-nril Hiiran i'I mvlf.

The desired permission was rhnted him. and, as he Ht-pped toward the door leading to the hall way, Mr. Horori went in the sam" direction into he pantrv to wash his hands. I remained in the parlor with voimir Tweed and Mr. J.iu.-lns. When Tto.'an had finished washing his hands he returned to the pirlor and resumed his seat. 1 waited, perhaps, five minutes or a little longer, before I remarked Hint it was time to start for jail, and that they hail bet ter call Tweed d .wn-stairs His son went up stairs, hut shortly came back and announced that his father had not yone up. stairs.

I last saw Tweed at 6 3u o'clock. K Iward lb van, the keeper, looked at the hat-rack and noticed that, while Tweed's hat had disappeared, his overcoat, a very he-avy beaver, was still whre 1p had lett it. Y-.unv Tweed eicitejlv pulled his hair and cried out, in evident anvuisii. that his father had rimed him and his family. The sou-in-law acted like an insane man. - - ; Ika Hakkis. Ira Harris died Fridav.at; his home in Albany, X. Y. Descended 1 from one of the followers of Iloger Will iams, he was born in Montgomery coun ty, X. Y., in 1S02. In boyhood he did farm work during tht; summer.and attend ed school in the winter. He went to Union College, graduating in 121. He then studied law, and was admitted to the bar at Albany. In 181S Mr. Harris be came Judge of the Supreme Court, and held that position for 12 years. He was elected United States Senator in February, Im'iI. Referring to this election, Thurlow Weed says : In Vil. Mr Greclev was a candidate for the 1'nited States Senate, with William M Evarts as his stronv.-st competitor The radical Hteluelit was then rampant in and out of the I.evislature -so st.ouv indeed that Mr. (ireeley's election was confidently anticipated.

J lived to regret it : first, because he proved unw-utliy i the confidence reposed in him: and next, because the ! question ot Mr. Greeley's fitness or uintncss tor the hivh positions he aspired to would, by his election, have been determined." Mr. Harris was succeeded in the Senate in In'j" by Iloseo Conkling, and the same year he became a member of tin; Constitu tional Convention, and since that time he hal lived in comparative retirement. Judge Harris was widely known to the bar of New York State as an able and lu cid expounder of llie law. He Mas for more than 20 years one of tin; professors at the Albany Law School, lecturing chief ly upon Equity. Jurisprudence and Prac tice. Judge Harris was an earnest Chi is tijin and a prominent. member of the Bap tist Church. The Pkf.Sidkxt. Somebody I see has started the story that the president has been ruined by real estate speculations, under the advice of Tom Murphy. It is not true as it is told, being greatly exagger ated. When he sold the stock oil' his St . Louis farm, it was evident that he felt compelled to curtail his expenses some what, and that is true of many other peo ple. He has betMi unfortunate in some of his investments, perhaps, but he is possess ed of a very considerable property still, and representation of him as ruined by speculations, is untrue. His general health is excellent, and while no events seem to affect his spirits, he has been noticeably buoyant since the state elections in the early part of last month. If he is pecuni arily " ruined," he seems V lie quite hap py over it. i). iv. r,., Troy Times. The Whiskey Thiaes. Thne bagged Friday ex-Chief Internal Revenue Clerk Avery, convicted at St. Louis, and Taft and Wiemer at Milwaukee. In the ease of the first, the day M as consumed with hearing the arguments, and the case given to the jury about half-past five o'clock. They were out about lour hours, and re turned with a verdict of guilty on one count of the indictment, the other three having been pronounced bad by the court. Avery's council gave notice that he would tile a motion for a new trial, and he and Avery left the court room, it being under stood that no atdilional bond would be re quired, at least for the present. A colliery explosion in Yorkshire, Eng land, Saturday, destroyed two hundred lives. General Fremont has bought a house on Madison avenue, New York, and intends to make that city his home. The steamer Sunnyside sunk in the Hud son last week, just above PoU"hkeepsie. Eleven lives were lost by the capsizing of the life boat. Rev. Benjamin Larbaree, D.D., ux -president of Middlebury College, has returned to Charleston, N. II., which is his native place, with the intention of making it hereafter his permanent home. The Khedive was educated in Paris, speaks French to perfection, is a capital talker on any kind of subject, and takes an especially keen interest in England and anything English. "If I could arrange for my death," said vice-president Wilson to one of his attendants a few days aro. " I would die quietly in my home, and have the privilege of saying good-bye to my friends, ami be ..tin .ii.'Liy away uuc i nave a premoni-1 tion that I sua 1 die suddeuh ; be snuffed I out like a candle, without an opportunity to say good-bye to any one." His words were prophetic. Senator Cameron of Wisconsin told a j Uuciigo Tost and Miil reporter that he i thought Mr. Kerr would he speaker, that the resumption act Mould be unchanged, j and that Mr. Blaine had the best chance for i the republican nomination for the presi-1 dency. Of Mr. Hlaine he said : " Blaine ; is a splendid man, ami would make a good j president. He is a man of wonderful good sense, and during the coming scs-1 sion he will make an admirable leader, i He is .1 man that is straio-htforwartl Vi w !

Forty-Fourth Cenrresst The first session of the 44th Congress began Monday; the democrats for the first time in sixteen years having control of the House. Monday, Dec. fi. Senate. Mr. Ferry of Michigan, president pro tempore, called the body to order, and the new senators were sworn in. Mr. Dawes among the number, he having recovered from the injury lately received by him. The cham ber was draped in mourning for Mr. Wil son. Ilou.tc. Hon. M. C. Kerr of Indiana, the democratic nominee, was elected speaker. The vote stood Kerr, 17;; Blaine. Km'.; scattering. 15. Speaker Kerr said: "Gentle men of the House of Representatives, I am heartily grateful to you for the honor which you have conferred upon me in calling me to this exalted station. I pro foundly appreciate the importance and delicacy of its duties. I shall doubtless many times need your patient indulgence. I pray that you will grant it and with nothing but kindlv feelings toward every member of the House I promise that in all my official acts I will divest, myself to the utmost of my ability of all personal bias ami observe complete fairness and impartiality toward all, and towards the great and diversified interests of our country represented in this House." Mr. Kerr -was sworn by Mr. Kelley, ni Pa., the oldest member in continuous ser vice. The speaker then administered the oath to the rest of the members. All ex cept 61 southerners took the "iron-clad" oath. Sixtv-one took a milder form owing to their relations or want of relations to the government during the war. Quite a breeze was stirred by the en deavor of Fernando Wood lo prevent Mr. Morev of La. from being sworn in. Morey held Kellogg's certificate while his contes tant.

Besides thi man Spencer had absolutely foreclosed himself by having made himself a contes tant. Wood and Lunar advocated the resolu tion. Mr. Blaine aked Mr. Lamar whether in the history of the House he knew of any case where the credentials of a membi-r signed by a pretended governor who had never been recognized as governor by any department of the United States, or by hi-, own state, had been referred to a commit tee. He trusted that his friend Lamar with his well known moderation would restrain his party from placing on record such an outrage, not only on state rights, ,,i which he, Lamar, was such an examplar and advocate, but on the rule of common decency as well. Finally the resolution was defeated and Morey Mas sworn in as member. Gen. Burt, the F.ostoti postmaster, has resigned, and Hon. E. S. Tobey receives the place. The St'MNEi: Statl e. The committee on design of the Sumner statue have voted uni'tiiiiiotisly to select Mr. Thomas Ball to make a statue of Charles Sumner, to be placed in some public place in Boston. The statue will probably be of bronze. The Suncook Journal says that Lapage, who is charged with the murder of Josie Lai gmaid, and who is confined in Concord Jail, made another attempt to escape, last week. He broke the shackles from his ankles, which were chained to the floor. The discovery prevented further michicf. A Hindoo employed on the Constant Spring estate beheaded five children from religious frenzy. The heads wen; severed at a single blow with a machette. In spite of the cold weather, work on the Burlington and Lamoille railroad is being vigorously pushed forward, and the close of the season will set; the road well along to completion. The Centennial Committee on opening the ceremonies have selected as orator William G. Evarts, II. W. Longfellow ns poet, and a grandson of Richard II.

Eleazer Stockwell had a large buck killed last week, who by appearance of the ground, must have done some tall lighting b fore he succumbed to bruin. The same bear came into the barnyard of Andrew Cox, one night last week. At a recent meeting of the directors of the state prison the charges of Superintend ent Bailey against head keeper Lull, were dismissed, and on account of the irrecon cilable differences between Bailey and Lull, the latter tendered his resignation, which the directors reluctantly acepted, they having tin; fullest confidence in his capac ity and ability, after his experience of six or seven years as an officer of the prison. Further work on the new building has been suspended until warmer weather. Fikes in N'ew England. According to The I'oMnn Journal record of tires during the month of Xoveniber, 1875, the losses by fire in Xew England amount to $1,4'J9, 100.

While conscious that the insurrection iu Cuba has shown a strength and endurance which make it at least doubtful whetner it be in the power of Spain to subdue it, it seems umpiestionable that no surh civil orKaniation exists which may be recognized as an iu- ' dependent Soxernment espi)le. of perHorniinif its in i ternatinnal oblivatlona. and ent.tled to be treated a 6nof thP rowers nf the rartn. A reeovnitiuu under sucti oi rctini stances would Ibe inconsistent with th facts snd would eomrel the'power vrftiitinv it soon to supt.ort by force of the vovernment to which it had reallv viven its onlv real claim nf existence.

A recovnitinn of the in dependence of Cuba Jinv in my opinion impractica ble and indefensible, the unestion w hich next presents itself If thai '' the tnxfTCStirp of t-rll'ifcrent rights in ie parties to the routes; In a former messave to Conirress I had occasion to consider tlii tpiestion, ard reache I the conclusion that the contlic in Cuba, dreadful tand devastatinv as were its incidents, did not rise to the fearful diirnitv of war. Itevardinv it now after this lapse of time. I am imnh'e to see that anv notable success or anv marked or real advauve on the part of the itisurvents I, as essential lv chati -ed the character of the cutest. It has aciuired u-n-iter aire but not vreater or more formidable pro. rtlo.'S. It is possible that the acts of this very mttnre mivht be point 1 at in defence of such recovniti.-ti. but now, as it is in past history, the -T.,to.i st;tes should c-.r.-f u ilv a oia t he fals. livhts which mi--ht lead into the mazes of doubtful law an ) of uncsioiiio'e propriety, and adhere rividly and sterulv to the rule which is ri--bt and honest, and of vood report. The ipiestion of accord in v or of withholding- rights of belligerency must be .iudve.i in eve ry rase in view of the particulnrattendimr facts. I'n Ipss lustificd bv necessity it is always and justly revarded as all unfiiemilv act and a vratuitous de monstration of nioiai support to the rebellion. It is necessary and it isre.piired if the interests and rih of another vovt riunetit oi its people are so far affected bv a pendinv civil conflict as to require a definition of its relations to the parties thereto. Jiut the conflict must he one which will he recoi-nized in the sense of international law as war. iedlit-ercwoe to-dav is is a fact .- The mere CAistence of oontandinv armed Is.tl ies and their occasional conflicts, tlo not constitute war in the sense referred to. Apnlvinr to the existinv con dition of affairs in Cuba the tests recognized by publi cists and writers on international law. and which have been observed bv nations of divnitv. honesty and power w hen free from sens itive, selfi-h and unw-orthy niotives I fail to find in the insurrection the existeno of such a substantial political orvan.zation-real, pal pable and nianitest to the world . bavin v the forms and callable of the ordinarv functions of voverumen' towr.nl its own people and hi other States, with courts for tiie a-ln'.inistrp.tiot. o .-.ur-tp.e, w ith a local habita-) tion iios-cssmv such orvani.ati'.u of force, such ma terial such occupation of territory as to take the contest out of the eatevory of mere rebellions insur rection or occasional skirmishes, and place it tin the terrible footinv of war to which a recovmtion of bclli verencv would aim to elevate if. The contest, moreov er is solely on land The insurrection has not possess ed itselt of a smvle seaport w hence it may send forth Its rlnv. Nor has it anv means of communication w ith foreign powers i xcept thrmivh tiie milltarv lines of its adversaries. No apprehension of any of these sudden and difficult complications which a war ui-on the ocean is apt to precipitate upon the vessels, both cm mertcial and national, and upon the consular officers of the powers, calls for the definition of their relations of the parties to th'-contest Considered a? a liiiestl ui of expediency .

THE QIESTIOS I IF ItKSUMPTIOS. Coming w ithin the review of Treasury.'' JI mean specie resumption. Too much stress cannot be put on this question, and I hope Congress mav be in tltieed at the earliest day practicable to insure the consummation of the act of the last Congress, pass ed at last session to bring about specie resumption. On and after the 1st day of January, ls7',i,at the farthest. It would be a blessing if "this could he consummated. even at an earlierday. Nothing seems to uie to be more certain than that a pennanent re action cannot lake place in favor of the industries and financial welfare of the country until yve return to a measure of recognized, slandai d throughout the civilized world. While we use a currency not equiv alent to this standard, Ihe world's recogi" Uetl stand ard, specie becomes a commodity like the products of The soil, the surplus seeking a market wherever there is a demand for it. Under our present sys tem we should want none, nor would we have any were it not that custom dues must be paid in coin and because of the pledge to pay interest ol the public debt in coin. Theyiciilol precious metals would flow out for the purchaso of foreign protluc tions, anil leave the United States hewers ol wood and drawers ol" water because of wiser legislation on the subject of linance by the nations with whom we have dealings. 1 am not prepared to say that I can suggest the best legislation to secure the end most heaitily commended. t will be a source of great gratification to me to be able to approve of any measure of Cougress looking effectively toward securing resumption. Unlimited inflation would urobablv bring about specie payments more sne.p.l. ly than any legislation looking to.the redemption of legal tenners iu com. cut. n wuuiu ue at the ex. ! pense of honor. The legal teuders would have no value beyond settling present liabilities or properl ilv sneakinz reduciating them. Thcv wonlri nothing alter debts were all ectlled.
