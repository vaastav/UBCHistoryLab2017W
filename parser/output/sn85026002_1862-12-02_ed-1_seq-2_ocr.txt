ABSTRACT OF THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE " to Tk . President ears tb correspondence teachied furtigl affair ahiehhas taiea plajce durine the last rear is herawiia submitted, in oompiianr with the request to that effect. If tb conditio ol oar reiaUens la Iss g rati ty ing tbaa formsrly, it iscertaiuly more salis- laetory thai a nation so anbappilf distracted might have reasonably apprsbeaded. A blockade of 3,0UO mil of lea coast could not be ettablisked aad vigorously enforced ia a season of great eennercial activity like tb present without committing occasional mis takes, and inflicting unintentional injuries upon foreign nations aid subjects. In clear eases, of ikes kinds, I have, so fa as possi ble beard and redressed the complaints by friendly pewera There is, howevar, a lsrss aad segmenting anas bar ofdoubUuluasesu pan upos which tke Qovsromsotis enable to agree witk the ' Oarvarnnent who protection i demanded by the i claimant . There . are more eases in which tke Coiled Stales ot tkeir aitiseas sifter wrongs fross the naval or mili tary aatborities of foreign nations, wbion the Government of ibee Slate are not at one prepared to radresa . I have proposed to son of aba soreigS Stale interested mutual con vent! oaa to examine aad adiuit such com plaints. This has bee neti especially to Qreat Britain, Fraaee. Spain aadi Prassia. In each ease it baa been favorably received, hot aot yet formally adopted. ..... ! . Applicatioaa bare bees made to me by many free Americans of African , desoant to favor tkeir emigration with a view to sash ootouiestion as wa contemplated ia the re cent acta of Congress. . Other parties at home and abroad, torn from interested and other motive have suggested similar measures, while en tb otbar band aaveral of lb Span ish Americas republics have protested against ths sending of inch colonies, to their respec tive urritoriaa Under these circemstances I have declined to move any aueh colony to any Slat witbont first obtaining the consent of its Government, witk an agreement on it part to receive and proteot suck emigrants in all tbeir rights a freemen, aad I have at tbe sain tim offered to the several States situat ed in tb tropic, or having colonies there, to negotiate with them, subject to the advice aad oonssnl Of tk Senate, to favor th voluntary migration Of portion of that Class to their resjieclive territories, upon conditions which shall be equal, just and humane. " '"'' ' ; . ' Liberia and Ilayti are yst the only coun tries te which colonists of African 'descent from here could go with certainty of being re ceived and adopted as citisens; and I regret to say that such person oonUmplating colon ization d aot teem so willing to emigrate to these countries as to some others, nor willing as I think their interest demand. I believe, however, that the opinion is improving, and that ere long there will b an augmented Snd considerable emigration ' to both - these coun tries. Our relation with European States remain undisturbed, and with States of our continent hav improved, especially Mexico, Costa Rica, Ao. Th President speaks of a favored protect. th Atlanlio telegraph, and extending th Pa cific line to conneot with that being extended across tk Russian Empire, thinks tbe mineral resources af jthe Territories ought to be de veloped as rapidly as possible. Every step in that direction would hav a tendency to im prove, th revenue. It is worthy of serious consideration - whether some extraordinary measures to promot that end cannot be adop ted. Tbe means which suggest itself as most likely to be effective, is a ecientiflo ex ploration. Tk vast expenditures incident to the military and aaval operation reqairsd for the suppression of tke rebellion, bare hitherto been met with a promptitude and certainly unasual In similar circumstances, and ths public credit ha been fully maintained. The ooalinuenee ef the war, however, aad tbe increased disbursements made necessary, demands your best reflections as to the best modes or proytdlog the necessary revenue. ' The suspension of sosci oavmant bv ths bank mad Isrg issues ef United States ao.es unavoidable. .In ao other way could the payment of the troops and the satisfac tion of other just demands be so economically or as wall provided last U is extremely doubt- iui wnetner a circulation ot united (States notes, payable fn coin and sufficiently large for the want of the people, can be perman ently, nseiuuy ana saieiy maintained. " Ia there any other mode in which the ne eeeeary provision for the public wants can be made, ana tb great advantages of safe and nnuorm currency secured r 1 know ot none which premises so certain results, and, at tks same tim,o unobjctienable,aa ths organiza tion of banking association pndar a gnueral ae( of Congress, well guarded in its provisions. 10 sues associations tn Uovtrnment mivht furnish circa latiag pot on th seaurit? of 1T,.;,- a,.,-.

A moderate reservation from the iatar-' est on the bond would oompsnssts ths Uniud states lor tne preparauoa and distributioa of tbe notes, and a eeneral knoervision of th system would ii:hte the burden of that part of the publio debt employed as. sscurity, , Th public credit, moreover, would V greatly improved, and tk negotiation ef lev loess greatly facilitated by lbs steady markqt de- iur uovernmeot nonas, wpicb tb adop tion of th proposed system would erea.

" """" ; ' M.' Congress may appropriate money and otherwise provide, for oolonining free colored persons, with tbeir consent at any place with out the United States. . , The President discusses these Articles at some length, snd asks if, then, for n eoranoa object, slave property is to be saori&oed, is it not just that it be done at common charge I and if with leas money, or money more easily paid, we can preserve the benefits of the Union by this means than we can by tbe war aione, is it aot economical to do it? .-!, . Tb proposed emancipation would shorten ibis war, perpetuate peace, insure an increase in pbpulatioa and proportionately, ths wealth of th country.-- H"l"t Th President thes says the pie consisting of these articles, is recommended; not but that a restoration of the national authority would oe accepted wunout its adoption, nor win the war or proceedings under the proclamation of September 22d be stayed because of the. re commendation of, this plan. . lis timely adop tion, I doubt not, would bring restoration, and thereby stay both; and notwithstanding' this plan, the recommendation that Congress pro vide by law for compensating aey States which may adopt the emancipation before the plan shall have - been acted upon, ie . hereby earnestly renewed, i This plan is recommend ed as a means not in conclusion of, but addi tional to all others, for restoring arid preserv ing the national- authority ' throughout the Union, i t .iii.c..;ii.i.i i n jii'jiiu iiv.i. i ,,;( The subject is presented exclusively in its economical aspect , The plan is proposed, a permanent, Constitutional law.
