TOWN STARTED NORTH OF CORDOVA A report was circulated about town today, says the Cordova Alaskan of Nov. 25, that Oscar Breedman had started this morning to put up a build ins at Mile 187. near the ('. K. & X. \V. railway tracks. It is supposed that J VV. Forrester and others have taken up a town site at this location and that it is the intention to establish a town there. It is urged by some that this is the logical location for making the start to the Chisana and the Xizina mining country. It is contended that when the new bridge is put in that a saving of several miles can be made instead of going from McCarthy. And the same argument is advanced for winter travel on the Nizina river. Breedman's idea is that there will al ways be a small town at Blackburn because of its proximity to Kennecott, but that there is not much excuse for the existence of McCarthy, at Mile 191, as the new location has superior ad vantages. At present there is a rail road spur at Mile 197 but inquiry to day does not indicate that any im provements have as yet been started there. NO

HUBBARD LANDED SUPPLIES UNDER DIFFICULTY The steamer General Hubbard arriv din Cordova about 7:30 o'clock on the veiling of the 25th. having landed the lack Oalton party and supplies at the upper end of Cook's Inlet. Although there was some ice flowing Captain Dillegar succeeded in getting to with in six miles of Knik postoffice, says the Alaskan. Everything was land ed there and as quickly as possible for it was late in the season and it was feared that there would be trou ble in getting out. Returning, good progress was made until East Fore land was reached, when serious trou ble was encountered. The steamer was under full steam ahead, with both anchors out, but the incoming ice was so strong that for hours the ves sel was not even able to hold her own. going gradually backward. But with the change of the tide she was able to make better progress and finally succeeded in getting clear of the Inlet. The steamer put in here for fuel oil and continued on her way South late this afternoon. Jack Dal ton will at once start from Knik with horses and take in supplies. After he establishes his camp in the Matan uska fields he will start to haul out rh?> 800 tons of coal that the govern ment has mined. CEMENT 100 YEARS PEACE BY EXCHANGE OF FAVORS At a recent meeting of the board of trade at Vancouver, B. C., it was sug gested that the best way to celebrate the one hundred years of peace be tween the United States and England was the purchase of a tract of land which has been the bone of conten tion, commercially, between the Unit ed States and Canada. The author of the idea said that Pt. Roberts had caused continual friction, for it is th^ place where the fishermen of Washington have their fish traps. It was pointed out that Point Roberts is a small peninsula jutting into the Gulf of Georgia and so curved that a small end of it lies south of the forty ninth parallel, and outside of the inted national boundary line. It was sug gested that Canada either purchase this land or trade an island in the i Straits of Georgia for it. o ? o ? o REGULAR BOAT SCHEDULE UP TO SALMON CREEK Commencing tomorrow there will be a boat leave the Raymond float every day at 11 o'clock for Salmon creek.

MARSHAL FAULKNER HAS NO STATEMENT Marshal Faulkner said today that he had no statement to make in ref erence to the cable news stories pub , lished in the Juneau papers yesterday ; and eminating from Washington D. C. that Attorney General McReynolds had declared that he would ask for ! the resignations of both the marshal and district attorney of this division.! j "I have received no word from any source on the subject," said Mr. Faulk ner, "and know nothing more than I have read in the papers." This is practically the same state ment made by District Attorney Rust gard yesterday and it is easy to in- 1 fer that they regard the cable story of yesterday with some skepticism. Rustgard Denies. District Attorney Rustgard gave out the following in refernce to the statement published in yesterday's dis patch in connection with the press story : "With reference to the statement that I had complained to the Attor ney General that I could not secure convictions owing to the lack of co operation on the part of the Marshal's office, I can say it is untrue. 1 never made any such complaint. The record of convictions secured by my office is not such that 1 was ever called upon to apologize for it. "The other Statement, that 1 had made disparaging remarks ab*>ut the jurors in the MacDonald case, is equally erroneous. 1 have not even expressed dissatisfaction with their verdict. On the other hand. I have stated frequently that, under the view of the law taken by the court, to the effect that the jurors were not au thorized to find a verdict for murder in the second degree or for man slaughter, no other verdict than the one rendered could well be looked for. I have, however, expressed dis satisfaction with the first venire of fifty drawn by the Marshal's office in the MacDonald case, for, although the number contained many of the best citizens of Juneau and many of them my personal friends, it contained a large percentage of men whom I con sidered altogether unfit for jury duty." ABOLISHING SUB PORT WOULD BE A CRIME Speaking of the proposed abolish ment of the Fairbanks sub-port of en try, the Fairbanks News-Miner, of; Nov. 10th says: "Somehow, we cannot take seriously the announcement that there is a movement on foot to abolish the sub port of entry at Fairbanks. It is the story of such an unnecessary crime and unmixed evil, as things stand here today, that it is hard to believe. "To date, we have been unable to think of a single reason why it should be considered advisable to abolish our sub-port. It has only been in exist ence a short time, and during that time our shipping facilities have been most materially bettered. At the same time freights have been so great ly reduced that the benefit to the coun try is immense. The only result from abolishing the sub-port would be to raise freight rates to the interior of Alaska and reduce and constrict our transportation service. No possible good could accrue to the people of Al aska therefrom, and great harm would be the result. That the government is seriously considering such a propo- 1 sition seems absurd, in the face of the government's professed interest in the I welfare of our people and the develop ment of our country. "At the same time, it is good busi ness for the Commercial Club to take j time by the forelock and protest against any such action upon the part of the treasury officials. You never can tell what the Interests are doing at Washington to conserve their I interests in Alaska, and it is no bad I play for the common people to be alive I to their own interests and acquaint Washington with the fact that they | are alive and fighting.

UTAH MINE BANDIT STILL HOLDS OUT ? o? o ? BINGHAM, Pec. ?. ? The fate of Ralph Lopez still remains in doubt, and the question cai only be settled by removing the bulkheads and search ing th< Api-x mine. All night the smudge, pound their deadly gases into the tunm Is while dozens of depu ties natclnd t-ach of the exits ready to shoot the desperado at sight, but his expected dash to liberty has not occurred. It is believed that a search of the mine will be the only solution of the question, its many are of the opinion that Lopez has succumbed to the gas fumes and is either d 'ad or unconscious from them. BINGHAM, Dec. 2 ? Fires were light ed yesterday in the tunnel of the Utah Apex mine, where Ralph Lopez, the Mexican desperado is making his last | stand. With all the exits of the mine, excepting that of the Andy tunnel, closed and sealed with mud, and with poisonous gases floating back into its depth, it is momentarily expected that the bandits will make a break for lib erty and be either captured or killed by the guards. A large amount of dynamite is i stored in the mine, and knowing Lo- i pez could easily blow out one or more j bulkheads, seven sheriffs stationed doz- ! ens of deputies at each of the tunnel i mouths, to shoot him on sight. Ten thousand inhabitants at Can- j yon. a walled mining town with deep snow drifts, are awaiting with tense excitement for the denouement of the ; sensational man hunt, which has al ready cost six lives.

The con struction of the government railroads in Alaska and the development of the resources of that territory upon lines of practical expediency, and not up on elaborate and impractical theories, was the most important domestic fea ture of the President's message, read by President Wood row Wilson to Congress today. Primary Presidential Nomination. Should the suggestions of the Pres ident be carried out, the quadrennial national political convention will ilo nothing more than frame the political platforms, leaving the President to l e nominated by direct primary, without the intervenion of nominating conven tions. In this connection the mes sage recommends that delegates to conventions be composed of nominees for t'ongress and nominees for vacant seats in the Senate, Senators whose terms have not yet closed and candi dates for President themselves. Tin idea being that in this manner plat forms will be framed by those respon sible to the people for carrying them into effect. Unlock Alaska's Storehouse. Of Alaska, the President said: "A duty faces us with regard to Alaska, which seems to be very pressing and very imperative. Perhaps I should say a double duty, for it concerns both political and material development of the Territory. The people in Alaska should be given a full territorial form of government, and Alaska as a store house should be unlocked. Railways is the Key. The key to unlock that storehouse is a system of railways. These the gov ernment should control in the inter est of all who wish to use them for the service and development of the country and its people. But the con struction of railways is only the first step, it is the thrusting in of the koy to the storehouse and throwing back the lock and opening the door. How the tempting resources of the country are to be exploited is another matter to which I shall fake the liberty from time to time of calling your attention, for it is a policy which must be worked out by well considered stages, not up on theory, but upon lines of practical expediency. It is a part of our gener al problem of conservation. Must Use Resources. We must use the resources of the country, not lock them up The re sources in question must be used, but not destroyed or wasted; used but not monopolized upon many narrow ideas of individual rights as against the abiding interests of the communities. That a policy can be worked out by conference and concession which will release these resources and yet not jeopard or dissipate them. I for one have no doubt and it can be done on lines eg regulation which need be no less acceptable to the people and gov ernments of the States concerned than to the people and Government of the Nation at large, whose heritage these resources are. We must bend our counsels to this end. A common pur pose ought to make agreement easy. Concerning Mexico. Concerning Mexico the President said: "There is but one cloud on our horizon. That has shown itself to the south of us and hanps over Mexico. There can be no certain oros pect in America until General Hu*?rta has surrendered his usurped authority in Mexico. Mexico has no government. The attempt to maintain one at the City of Mexico has broken down and a mere military despotism has been set up. It originated in the usurpa tion of Yictoriano Huerta who after < a brief attempt to play the part of Constitutional President has at last cast aside even the pretense of his legal right and has declared himself Dictator. But he has not succeeded. He has forfeited the respect and the moral support even of those who were at one time willing to see him succeed. Little by little he has been complete ly isolated. Little by little every day his power and prestige are crumbling and the collapse is not far away." o ? o ? o
