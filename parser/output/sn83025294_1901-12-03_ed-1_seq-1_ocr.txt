PRICE FIVE CENTS PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE READ First Official Document of Nation's Chief Executive Received in Both Houses -Unusual Interest manifest ed by Senators and Members. VARIOUS PORTIONS ARE GREETED WITH APPLAUSE flections Referring to Re-enaction of Chinese Exclusion Act and Suppressing ^ ^ Of Anarchy Well Received— McKinley Resolutions Adopted. I ' (By Associated Press.) Washington, Dec. 2.—There was a good attendance in the galleries of the house today to listen to the reading of the first message of President Koosevelt. The members gathered early, chatting and discussing prospective legislation. The main topic was the personality of the new president. Keen interest was manifested in what he would have to say in his message. As the hands of the clock pointed to 12, Speaker Henderson called the house to order. After the journal had been read and approved Mr. Cooper (Texas) and Mr. Wood (California), who were not present yesterday, appeared at the bar and were sworn in. On motion of Mr. Payne, the floor leader of the majority, it was agreed that when the house adjourned today it be to meet Friday. Committee on Rules Appointed. The speaker announced the appoint ment of the committee on rules as fol lows: Mr. Henderson of Iowa, Mr. Dal zell of Pennsylvania, Mr. Grosvenor of Ohio, Mr. Richardson of Tennessee and Mr. Underwood of Alabama. The oniy change in the committee was the sub stitution of Mr. Underwood for Mr. Bailey of Texas, who is now a member of the senate. Mr. Bingham of Pennsylvania, at the head of the committee appointed to wait upon the president, reported that the committee, accompanied by a like com mittee from the senate, had performed Its duty and that the president had received their message with pleasure, and said he would at once communicate With' the two houses in writing. Reading President's Message. Two minutes later Major Prüden, as sistant secretary to the president, ap peared at the main entrance and an nounced a message from the president. The message was taken to the speaker's desk, where Speaker Henderson at once broke the seal. "A message from the president of the United States," he said as he handed the document to the reading clerk and di rected him to read it. Ordinarily presidential messages at the opening of a congress are listened to in perfunctory fashion, but today throughout the reading the keenest in terest was manifested. Hardly a member left his seat until the reading was con cluded. There was a slight murmur of applause when, in concluding the recom mendation for legislation to put down anarchy, the clerk read: Greeted With Applause. "No matter calls more urgently for the wisest thought of congress." The murmurs when this sentence was read were followed by a burst of ap plause when the clerk read: "The American people are slow to wrath, but when their wrath is once kindled it burns like a consuming flame." Probably no other portion of the mes sage attracted so much attention as that relating to trusts. No demonstration was evoked by the reading of this por tion of the message, but the recom mendation for the re-enactment of the Chinese exclusion law drew applause from both sides of the house. The reading of the message was con cluded in the house at 2:35. Mr Gros venor then offered the following resolu tion which wts adopted without divi sion: In Memory of Late President. "Resolved, That a committee of one member from each state represented in this house, be apointed on the part of the house, to join such committee as may be appointed on the part of the senate, to consider and report by what token of respect and affection it may be proper for the congress of the United States to express the deep sensibility of the nation to the tragic death of the late president, William McKinley, and that so much of the message of the president as relates to that deplorable event be referred to such committee." 'In pursuance of the terms of the reso lution the speaker appointed a commit tee consisting of one member from each state and territory. The house then, as a further mark of respect, adjourned. Interest in the Senate. In anticipation of the receipt of the first message of President Roosevelt, members of the senate assembled early today in the senate chamber and cloak room. Many of the senators, particu larly the close political and personal friends of the president, were already familiar with the principal features of the message, but the reading of the first Important state paper by the president was marked with unusual interest. Despite the cold and penetrating rain which fell throughout the morning, the galleries of the senate were filled with interested spectators, many of them having a special interest in the mes sage. When the journal of yesterday's pro ceedings had been read, a communica tion was received from the house inform ing the senate that the body had been organized and was ready to proceed with public business. The Message Arrives. Senators Hale and Morgan reported that they had waited upon the presi §ent, In conjunction with a like com mittee from the house, to inform him that congress was prepared to receive any communication he might have to make. The president said he would communicate with congress at once in arriting. Major O. !.. Prudcn, assistant secre to the president, was then recog nized and presented the message of the president, the reading of which was be gun at once by Henry M. Rose, chief clerk. Close attention was given to the read ing of the message by all senators. Printed copies of the document were dis tributed among them, the majority of whom followed the reading from their copies. As Mark of Respect. The reading of the message consumed two hours and fifteen minutes and when it had been completed, Mr. Foraker was recognized to offer the following resolu tion for which he asked immediate con sideration: "That a committee of eleven senators be appointed on the part of the senate to join such committee as shall be ap pointed on the part of the house to consider and report, by what token of respect and affection, it may be proper for the congress of the United States to express the deep sensibility of the nation to the tragic death of the late President McKinley, and that so much of the message of the president, as re lates to that deplorable event be referred to such commute." The resolution was adopted and then, as a further mark of respect to the memory of the late president, the senate, on motion of Mr. Foraker, at 2:28 ad journed.

THREE YEARS BURGLAR CAPTURED BY WOMAN PLEADED GUILTY. GEORGE W. MILLER SENTENCED He Was Captured by Emma Arnold in Her Room Some Weeks Ago— . Man Intoxicated and iii Ä : , Stupid. Another young man pleaded guilty to burglary in Judge McClernan's court this afternoon and was sentenced to state prison. His name was George Washing ton Miller and he was captured by a young woman named Emma Arnold in her room in the Will house, on South Wyoming street, one night three or four weeks ago. Judge AlcClernan sentenced him to three years at hard labor. Miller entered a plea of not guilty when arraigned to plead, hut a few days ago, under the advice of his attorney, Lawyer Grice, he changed his plea to one of guilty and was brought into court this afternoon at half-past one o'clock to be sentenced. "Is Miller here?" the court asked. Prisoner Stands Up. The man stood up and he looked to be about 24 years old. "I understand you have changed your plea to one of guilty?" the court said. "Yes, sir," Miller replied. "Have you any legal reason to give why you should not be sentenced now?" the judge inquired. Miller hesitated, and then said, "No." Then Lawyer Grice and Assistant County Attorney Yancey made pleas for mercy. Mr. Yancey said that he thought the ends of justice would be served by a light sentence, and Mr. Grice said some thing about the sublimity of mercy, after he had described the kind of a burglary Miller was concerned in. When these talks were through, the court said: "Well, Mr. Miller, everybody seems to agree that you're a harmless kind of a burglar, if there is anything of the kind. The court Is not disposed to be severe. The judgment of the court is that you be imprisoned in the state prison for three years at hard labor." Drinks Too Much. According to Mr. Grice's story Miller came Into town the night he was arrest ed; got intoxicated and wandered into the Arnold woman's room. She waked up In bed and grappled and held on to him, while he struggled to get away, and on the stairway of the house others came and captured him. Miller attempted to do no harm to the woman, and was too stupid even to get away. He had taken possession of two revolvers that were In the room, but he made no effort to use them. His lawyer said it was an unpleasant task to recom mend Miller to plead guilty, and there seemed to be reason for the statement. GREAT LABOR CONFERENCE. Gompers Says It Will Be the Largest on Record.

Mr. Yerkes' plan is said to provide the capital for the reorganization as he did for the electrifying of the district rail way company. Mr. Charles T. Yerkes, when showed this cable dispatch announcing that he intended to interest himself in telephones in England, said: "There is no foundation in fact for this.
