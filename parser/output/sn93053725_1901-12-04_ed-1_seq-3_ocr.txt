Presented in Honor of Late President McKiniey. WASHINGTON, Dec. 4. Not in many years have the members of the house listened with such rapt attention to the annual message of a president of the United States as they did yester day to the reading of the first message of President Roosevelt. Every word v;a.3 followed intently from the an nouncement of the tragic death of President McKiniey in the opening sen tence to the expression of the closing wish that our relations with the world would continue peaceful. The reading occupied two hours, but not over a dozen members left their seats until it was concluded. Several times there was applause, and at the conclusion there was an enthusiastic demonstra tion on the Republican side. On motion of Mr. Grosvenor of Ohio that portion of the message relating to the death of the late president was referred-to a committee to consist of one member from each state . to join a similar committee of the senate to consider and report by what token of respect and affection it may be proper for congress to express the deep sensi bility of the nation to the tragic death of the late president. The" speaker ap pointed a committee, headed by Mr. Grosvenor, and then as a further mark of respect the house adjourned. It was not until the session of the house closed that the weary clerks were able to catch up with Monday's deluge of bills and' begin sorting the further deluge of yesterday. ! The president's annual message to congress went In this j-ear for the first time In print. The two copies for the two houses were printed on paper of the same size as that which was used heretofore for the written copies, though the paper is a heavy white in stead of the blue tint which has been inuse. Each copy was richly bound In brown morocco, with stiff covers, with simple gold border and lettering, the words on the front being, ''Mes sage of the President of the United States." The senate listened to the first mes sage of President Roosevelt and adopt ed a resolution directing the appoint ment of a committee to co-operate with a like committee from the house to con sider by what token of respect and af fection congress might express the sor row of the nation upon the tragic death of the late President McKiniey. The message was delivered soon after the senate met. The reading occupied nearly two and a half hours and was listened to with marked respect by the senators. The first portion, dealing with the Buffalo tragedj-, excited the most profound interest in the" senate. At the conclusion of the reading of the message Mr. Foraker, senior sena tor from Ohio, presented the McKiniey resolution, and as a further mark of respect the senate adjourned. A Hereford Won the Prize.
