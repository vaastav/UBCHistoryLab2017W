THE rumor persistently recurs in financial circles in New York that the railroad combine is in tended by its manipulators to lead to Govern ment ownership of all the railways in the country. It is pointed out that the leaders in the movement are not without political influence and have the power to control a considerable section of the press. The process is declared to be simple. Let the Govern; ment acquire the stocks of the lines at an appraised valuation by direct purchase, and then guarantee the interest on the bonded debt and it is done; the roads pass to public ownership and administration. A glance at the operations of the roads will il-, luminate the rumored plan. In 1898 the gross earn ings per mile of road in this country were $6771, and the net earnings o\-er operating expenses were $2111 per mile. Nearly 18 per cent of the gross earnings went for bond interest, and 2 l A per cent for taxes. In that year the net resources of the roads from all sources were $389,666,574. The present capitalization of all American roads is about thirteen billions of dollars; the total national wealth is put at 102 billions of dollars. If the Government take over the entire tystem by an issue of thirteen billions of dollars in bonds at 3 per cent, the annual interest charge will be $390,000,000. It will be seen that when the waste of public ownership and administration is applied to the operation of the roads, there is a prospect of an annual deficit in ad<* : *ion to this annual interest charge, which must out of the taxpayers. That the owne of the roads would make a good bargain on these conditions needs no further expo sition. Their investment would be perfectly secure under the guarantee of the Government, and the peo ple would have the satisfaction of Government owner ship, and paying for it As that experiment in Eu rope has shown an invariable increase of 20 per cent in cost of operation over the cost of private owner ship, and at rates of transportation from three to five times higher than here, it will be seen that such in crease will add yearly $186,400,000 to the cost of operation. But the present owners, with their bonds in their pockets, will b.e free from care. There will be no more bankrupt roads, with bonded debts to be scaled and bondholders to be ruined. Between 1876 and 1899, 842 different railways were foreclosed in court. Their total mileage was 106,510 miles, and their stocks and bonds amounted to six and a half billions. Foreclosure wiped out 36 per cent of the bonds and 37 per cent of the stocks. There will be other hard times and more foreclos ures, if the Government do not take over their prop erties, and none are more interested in running to cover than the enormous investors who will be ex posed to the destruction of a slump. Therefore, it is not improbable that the rumor has justification, and that the fanatics who see in Gov ernment ownership a panacea are their tools and certain newspapers their paid allies. Now that the American people have taken to rais ing money for the relief of the women and children in the British concentration camps in South Africa it will net be long before they will begin to urge the Government to interfere on behalf of the Boers. When the American begins to put his money up fdr a cause he is getting ready to talk business. According to the census reports of the salt in dustry there was produced in 1899 in this country 75,939.095 bushels of salt, and as that is considerably in excess of one bushel per capita for the population it will be seen that as a people we can hardly be ac cused of keeping ourselves too fresh. As might have been expected the longest biography in the new Congressional directory is that of Chaun cey Depew. It contains a list of his most famous orations, but as it says nothing of his approaching marriage there will probably be a sequel. • If Miss Stone, the famous missionary, had a hun dred lives she would have lost them all in the fer tile brains of irresponsible correspondents, who let hardly a day pass without a new report of the ven turesome woman. 

OUBAN DEMANDS. MANY delegations are visiting" Washington from Cuba to insist upon free trade with the island in sugar and tobacco. This demand is varied by propositions to abate the tariff so far be low the Dingley rates, as to deprive domestic"pro ducers of protection. > J' The American sugar and tobacco growers, being agriculturists and to a degree unorganized, are per haps not fully aware that free sugar from Cuba means the gift^f about $260 per acre to the island planters, and that their demand has many American advo cates in Congress and out. These advocates proceed on the philanthropic line. They insist that when we declared war against Spain "we guaranteed the prosperity of Cuba." From that text a sermon is preached that appeals to charity and honor. If we accept the text the premise is admitted and the con clusion must be accepted. But did we make any such guarantee?'- An exam ination of the resolution declaring war fails to find anything that can be tortured into any obligation to make the Cubans prosperous. To have undertaken such a responsibility would have been what Senator Sumner called "a piece of preposterosity." We de clared Cuba to be of right ' a free and independent state, and declared that we would not acquire sov ereignty of the island and would abdicate occupancy upon the institution of a stable government. That is alL No state is free and independent when another has guaranteed its prosperity. The United States is concerned only with the pros perity of its own people, and that only so far as it can be secured by financial stability and their pro tection against the lavish production or cheap labor of other countries. Otherwise they are expected to carve out their own fortunes and dictate their own destiny. It goes without saying" that acceptance of the Cuban pretensions will seriously violate the obli gation of this Government to its own people. As our population increases and its wants grow more complex, the profit of supplying them should be kept at home, to the end that the ever-increasing demand for the profitable employment of land and labor may be met. The production of rice, sugar and tobacco is a much needed means of diversifying our agri culture. Each requires the employment of labor in converting the raw material to human use. l\ that production is left undisturbed and its profit untouched it will grow beyond the domestic consumption and our agricultural and manufacturing labor will be in creased to produce and convert the raw .material for foreign markets, as has been the case in the metal, fabric, wood and leather manufactures. Why, then, is it not the part of wisdom for our Government to retain unabated its power to carry out the constitutional injunction that it shall "provide for the general welfare"? Our taxpayers have contributed hundreds of mil lions to the Spanish war and its collateral results. If any of the statesmen think that they did this for the purpose of inviting lush production and cheap labor into competition with them, to reduce their profits, obsolete their industries and invade their prosperity, they are making a mistake, the serious ' nature : of which will appear when the results become known to the people. Mr. Lawson, the Boston millionaire, is said to have lost more than $11,000,000 in -the copper deal, but inasmuch as he owns all the stock he held at first and has the same copper mines the loss isj nothing more than a Wall-street calculation on the value of the stock, and it may be that the street has calcu lated wrong. At any rate Mr. Lawson has not yet lost anything except a speculative idea. UP TO JUSTICE BROWN. SINCE the decision of the Supreme Court in the so-called "diamond rings case" has followed the precedent set by the court in the decision of the Porto Rico cases last spring, it has occasioned comparatively little comment. In fact it was in the nature of a foregone conclusion. Such interest as exists in the matter therefore turns rather upon what was not decided than upon what was. It was decided that duties cannot be collected upon goods imported into this country from the Philippines as the law now stands, but it was not decided whether or no duties upon goods sent to the Philippines from the United States may be collected at Philippine ports. That and other questions arising from our relations to the Philippines will have to come up sooner or later. What decision will be pronounced upon them is known only to Mr. Justice Brown. On all of these cases he is virtually the Supreme Court. It is up to him to decide. The position of Justice Brown is unique. The re maining Justices of the court are divided on the question of the relation of our island possessions to the rest of the country. Justice Brown holds the balance of power, and he holds it impartially, for he favors one side about as often as the other. He may not be strictly consistent in his views, but he is un questionably fair and gives everybody a chance. In the Dc Lima case decided last spring Chief Justice Fuller and Justices llarlan, Pcckham and Brewer held that immediately upon the ratification of the treaty of peace Porto Rico ceased to be for eign territory and became domestic. Brown agreed with them, and consequently Shiras, White, Gray and McKcn'n.i were left in a minority. In the Downes case it was held by Shiras, White, Gray and Peck ham that Congress has power to impose customs duties upon trade between this country and Porto Rico, and Brown agreed with them, consequently that time it was the Chief Justice and Harlan, McKenna and Brewer, who made up the minority. In the Phil ippine case the relative positions of the Justices re turn to what they were in the De Lima case, and once more it is Justice Brown who' makes the de cision and determines the law of the land. The situation is not" conducive to confidence in the court. It is evident we are. facing problems in which the highest tribunal in the country is so equal ly divided there is no means of forecasting what de cisions will be given upon such new issues as will inevitably arise. Four Justices believe the islands have become a part of the United States and must be governed- by Congress in accord with the constitu tion; that their people. must enjoy full' freedom of trade with other portions of the country. Four other Justices hold: that the islands are not a part of the United States, or at least that they are not domestic territory within the meaning of the tariff act. Justice Brown holds an intermediate position and decides that the islands became domestic as soon as the treaty of peace was ratified, but that Congress can establish a separate tariff for them 'if it pleases. . It has been said by lawyers that the "decisions 'vir tually give us three kinds of territory and three kinds of citizens. First, the States whose citizens are clothed with full powers of sovereignty* and -.self government; second, incorporated Territories whose . , - ■ ■. '.....■ THE SAN 

FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, 10, 1901. citizens are entitled to freedom of trade - with -the' States but are not entitled to vote, for: Presidential electors or to have representation in the United States Senate;; and third, unincorporated territories held, as "appurtenances" to the Union, and whose: citizens have no rights except such as Congress may choose to grant. Out of that complexity there are certain to arise many perplexing questions. At present no one can foresee what they will' be. All that we kno"w is that so long as the membership of the Supreme Court re mains as it is there will be division, and the settle ment of each issue will be up to Justice Brown, who* in such matters exercises a one-man power of the first magnitude. The South American delegates to the Pan-Ameri can" Congress seem to be of the opinion that.inter national arbitration will be a a good ' thing provided there is no attempt made to arbitrate anything that gives promise of war and a chance to upset a Govern ment. 

LONDON dispatches of yesterday announce that immediately upftithe assembling of Parliament - the Ministry will bring forward a plan for abol ishing the concentration camps in South Africa and substituting a better method of caring for the Boer prisoners and refugees.. No information from an of ficial source has been given concerning the nature of the new plan, but it is believed it' will consist of dis tributing the refugees throughout the more settled and pea'ceable districts of the Transvaal instead of herding them together as is the practice now. The movement on the part of the Ministry is. a victory of the moral sentiment of mankind against so-called military necessity. From every part of the civilized world there has arisen a protest against the cruel policy which Weyler introduced in Cuba and Kitchener has followed in South Africa. It is but just to the British to recognize : that they have themselves furnished many of the foremost and most earnest of those who denounce the system. The most effective blow was delivered by Miss Hobhouse, a British nurse who went to the seat of war not to sympathize with the Boers but to serve wherever needed in her professional capacity, and whose report of what she saw in the concentration camps aroused the indignation of humane people in Great Britain as well as in other countries. American sympathy has promptly followed the.dis closures of the condition of the camps., . At the pres ent time in the East no public gatherings are more largely attended than those held for the purpose of raising money for the Boer prisoners, nor is there any cause for which money is more liberally, contributed. This manifestation of sentiment in America may well serve the Ministry as a warning, for on the whole the people of this country have not been at all pre judiced or antagonistic to the British in the war. If there be a change of sentiment now it will be because the change is justified. A recent circular issued by the Chicago Branch of the American Transvaal League presents statistics of the death rate in the camps from June to September,, inclusive, showing that in June the rate was equiva lent to an annual death rate of 190 per thousand. It continued to increase month after month until in September it amounted to an annual rate of 264 per thousand. The death rate among the children in Sep tember is given at the equivalent of an annual rate of 433 per thousand. Statistics coming from the Boer side may be more or less exaggerated, but information from British sources goc,s far to confirm them. The significance of a yearly death rate of 264 per thousand may be estimated from the fact that the normal yearly, death rate in England and Wales is but eighteen per thou sand. The Boers are known to be a robust and hardy race, and it can readily be seen that so large a death rate among them implies a fearful condition in the concentration camps. Clearly then it- is high time for the Ministry to put an end* to them. A report from Princeton says that a protest against the proposed extension of a trolley line has been signed by "Grover Cleveland and other prominent business^ men," so it seems that to pass from the Presidency- to the rank of a "prominent citizen" is easy; but when did Cleveland go into business? THE Democracy proves still unable to rule its own spirit. Mr. Bryan has degenerated into the party scold. He lets go one day at Gorman and the next at Wattersbn. He deifies himself by re ferring to Senator John P. Jones as Judas Iscariot, who has betrayed him, and scarcely suspends his duty on the watch tower. long enough to care for .his anaemic, cczematous, ring-wormed political offspring, free silver. Hill has left Croker to smoke the pipe of peace alone, and the Jackson Club of Omaha has taken up Croker's fight and refuses to invite Hill to dine with it on January 8, >.\ In Missouri the State officers and committcemen of the party are in court telling tales on each other and digging up cashbooks showing large donations from all the corporations, and the corporations remark that as the Democratic platform threatened their undoing by unfriendly legislation they were justified in seeking safety by "cash. They say that the wise corporation only buys 'peace of those that threaten war. The minority in the House of Representatives held its caucus and immediately proceeded to quarrel over every issue in sight. The New York contingent submitted a wordy programme, which omitted free silver, and a Bryanite moved to substitute the Kansas City platform, and then the men who desire to run the Government showed that they could not run their own caucus nor agree upon anything, and the anxious and perspiring leader, Mr. Richardson, secured. ran adjournment without coming to any decision. This leaves the minority to indulge in a go-as-you-piease, and its political course will be merely a guerrilla warfare. The people will not trust a party that is composed of disagreements. It is united in only one thing and that is. opposition to whatever Republicans propose. But that is the policy of destruction.' . The people want a constructive policy. It is a rule of law and logic that he who comes to negative and destroy, a proposition must come with one to take its place! The country is as yet unaware of any feasible Democratic policy not already rejected by the people upon which it can be invited back to power. Its con dition .now . is .worse than', ever in its/history. It ; has received the weakening accessions of Patterson, Heitfelt and Duboise, the. Populists, who .have;car ried into its councils nothing but further discord; and is .worse off than before those Senators •crossed ■ over. Evidently the country must continue to look to -the Republican party for affirmative and constructive' ieg islatioh,. and : the ■ responsibility . of "that -party is" in creased by the irresponsibility \ of its opponent.-; CONCENTRATION CAMPS.
