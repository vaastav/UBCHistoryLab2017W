"So just before they started 1 ask ed him to let me go to town witn them and pick out a dress, but he said as 1 wasn't going to get mar ried my dress would do. Marian went off with tears in her eyes and t well I've been sitting here ever since," and she leaned her head on her hand, spent with the fury of the tempest. IMrs. Hull was silent for a wh:l:. Finally she said: "I have it. You can get the dress yet. You get on your, black dress and hat and come home with me. After we see him drive past our house on his way here 1 will hitch up and talke you to town, (let what you want and charge it. You have credit. Then come to my house an I stay w,hile Marian is away. We will make the dress and get you all fixed up for the wedding." Mrs. Parker sat staring at her as if she saw a spirit. "What would he do here alone?" she breathed. "Whv J) hone he would learn :o appreciate you at last. L-ct h think he has lost you. it will do him good." A wild light shone from the tear stained fare. "I'll do it," she said firmlv rising and going into the house. "And about the wedding," con tinned Mrs. Hull, following her friend. "Why not have her married in the new church parlor? We coul I decorate it, and I will give the bridal feast in my pretty dining room." While she talked she helped the fumbling fingers to fasten the black dress and soon the two women were on the way to the neighbor's house a quarter of a mile np the road.
