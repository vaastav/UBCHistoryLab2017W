Ha has just received everything needed for t}ie Christi inas holidays. See his advertisement in today's paper aud he sure and give him call. The advertisement of Messrs. MeDon. Aid it MeCurry, in to d iy'a p 'per, cannot fail to attract the attention of our reader*. Person* visiting Camden will find it to their interest to give them a call. They hare a good selection and can satisfy the wants of everybodv. Tone and Temper of CongressThe tone and temper of Congress, as exhibited by the proceedings of both branches thus far are decidedly radical. Another indication of this is the passage, by a vote of 107 against 37, of a resolu. tion directing inquiry into the expediency of extending territorial government over the Southern State*. The President's Message. We five nlace to the prolusion nnar. ~r- r *" v* ly everything else, in tbi* is.-tte, to that portion of the President's Metn^e which relates to "reconstruction." Those who believed that it would contain roc ommentations of startling and danger* Otis amendments, and compromises with the dominant Kulicd power, will find that they have been deceived, lie main ?ains steaddy tho same position that he lock in the beginning. The message is clear, able and well written, and devoid of ail bitter denunciations ; but at the same time, concedes nothing, recat'e no thing, and is (inn and temperate from beginning to end. The Legislature. ^Tlie proceedings of this tardy present but very little of general Interest. Tim press ap on our columns this week try advertisers, prevents us giving the proceedings in full. We j condense mc following items : Tlic Hon. ./ohn B. Campbell has been elected United Stated Senator. In the last ballot, | Mr. Campbell received 95 vote* ; Gen. J. H. ' Kershaw, 30 ; Hon ,/ohn L. Manning, 1 ; Hon John A. Iiiglia, 1. The bill t> repeal the u^n ry laws has passed both House*. Mr. Fort introduced a bill to abolish the District Comt* ; also a bill to call a Convention ol the peoplo o' the State. Mr, Moore introduced a toll to ei? tend the number of sureties now allowed on bonds of cominiasioners in equity. Mr. Henry aUo introduced a hill to confer upon Masters and Commissioner* in Kqu:ty, authority to proceed against purchasers failing to comply with bids made at their rules. Signs of the Times. On all sides event# thicken. The throat tened doom is fast approaching. The coining session of Congress promise* to be the most interesting convened since the days of the liepublic. Should the 1 Mongrels try to impeach the President, we think war inevitable ; already the clouda are gathering. Opr troops have taken possession of Mexican territory, and seem anxious to kick up a muss with somebody. England is concentrating forces on our Northern holders. The Fa mans is aaid to have arisen in Ireland.? The negroes are growing less manageable, and consequently, laes serviceable to the South, every day. They have hold meet ings In several Districts and arranged e higher price for labor. The result is easily foreseen ; but very few will get steady employment. Then follows stealing, rab. berr, shooting, and finally insurrection. Evidently events for the next year pro mise to he an conspicuous as for the last five. Ooe of the Great Seals must have been opened when Abraham Lincoln was elected in 1800; for ii has done lot!* else than taiu fire and brimstone ever , since. Wk adverted a few weeks ago to the necessity of a stsam saw mill to supply ' the ready wants of this community with , awed lumbar. We are pleased to leern that onr suggestion Las met with the earnest approval of a company of g*n 1 tleinan who command the cap!tal to make such no eritetprise a perfeet succ**s. The , machinery has already been purchased t nd shipped for this place. * I In connection with this, we may again remind our citizens of the great naad of a grist.mil) in our Village. No little in* t convenience and loss is a sufficient incen- r tive to urge us forward in this matter.? ' It would not only he a benefit to the Vil. 1 lags, but the aurrotindirg country ; be- ^ sides, if property conducted, would pay t bsndsome'y. Who will try it? (, i President's Message. Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Ji'prcsentu lives : Af'er a hrief intervmI the Congress of tlio United States resumes its animal leg isUtive labors. An all*wide atd merciful Providence has hbaled the peattleiic* which visited our shores, leaving its calamitous tr?e?H upon some portions of our country. Peace, order, tranquility, and civil authority have been formally declared to exist throughout the United Slates, i In all^of tha States civil aiilholity Its* superceded the coercion of arms, and the people !>v their voluntary action, are maintaining their governments in foil ae tivitv end complete operation.

An entiie restoration of fraternal fe-lmg mu?l be the earnest wish of everv patriotic heart ; sod we whl have accomplished our grajnles' national achievement when, forgetting the sad^renls of the past, and remembering only their instructive lessons, we resume onr onward career as a free, prosperous and united people. In tttv menage of the 4 h of December, 1 SOS, Congress wa? informed of the met sures which nan n<?cn iu?iuuie<i nv n>?? Executive with a view to tlic gradual re*titration of the State* in winch the itisnr rection occurred to their relations with the General Government. Provisional Governors had heen appointed, Cor.ven lion* called, Governor* elected, Legist* turns assembled, and Senator* and Ke;> resentmives chosen to the Congress of the United State*. Court* had been opened for tlie enforcement of laws long in abeyance. The blockade had heen removed, ctiRlom-hoiise* re established, and the internal revenue law* put in force, in order that the people might contribute to the national income. Postal operation* had been renewed, and efforts wer# being made to restore litem 'o ihe'r former coo dilion of elliciencv.
