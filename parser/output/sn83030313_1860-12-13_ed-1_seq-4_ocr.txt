In Congress yesterday the Senate took up the bill authorizing the is?ue of $10,000,000 of treasury notv?. Amendments reducing the amount to #3,000,000, and pledging the public lands as heeurity for the redemption of the notes, were adopted, and the bill was passed. The conwidera tion of the ecceiwion portion of the President's Message wax then resumed, and Mr. Wigfall, of Texas, delivered u long speech on the condition of the country and the position of parties. In the House, according to agreement, propositions from the \arious States, relating to the disturbed state of the republic, were presented. Massachusetts, New Y( rk, Virgiida, New Jersey, Pennsyl vania, Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, Mis souri, Arkansas and Wisconsin presented plan*, which were referred to the se lect Committee of Thirty -three. The committee has organized, and will enter upon its work to-day. Mr. RonhMB, of Mouth Carolina, a-ked to be ex cused from further service upon the Military Com mittee, as he did not expect much longer to re main a member of Congress. His request was granted. A Deficiency Appropriation bill was re ported by the Committee of Ways and Means. The Committer on Public Lands reported a bill creat ing a land oflice in l>aootah, and providing for the admission of a delegate from that Territory. Mr. Grow said he bad prepared bills for organising Territories, Including Macotah, with provisos pro hibiting slavery, which the House could strike out if they chose. The bill was referred to the Com mittee of the Whole. Philip F. Thomas, of Maryland. Commissioner of Patent*, was yesterday afternoon confirmed by tie Senate as Secretary of the Treasury, in place of Mr. Cobb. The letter addressed to the Presi dent by Mr. Cobb, on the occasion of his rc-dg nation of his nftW. and Mr. Buchanan's reply thereto, are published in another column. A despatch from Charleston states that all the hank* of that city will shortly re-mne specie pay menu. One of them has alr. ady done so. The smallpox is raging with considerable viru lence at Columbia. South Carolina, au<J it is pro bable that the State Legislature will adjourn to Charleston in consequence. The disease has caused quite a panic. The steamship Kedar. Capt. Little, from Liver pool 27th ult., arrived at this port yesterday fore noon. Her udv ices have been anticipated by the Euro r a off Cape Race, but she brings flies three days later than previously received. He publish this morning an important decree from the Emperor of France, and also some in t< r> Mng intelligence concerning the warm China, in which it will be seen that at the last accounts the Allies were within six miles of Pekin, and that the Chinese had gained some important advantages in capturing several prominent personages in the Allied camp, including I/ord Elgin's secretary and the corres pondent of the I/ondon T*o m >re battle* had been fonrht? one at Chang kia wan, an I the other at Ja r ef an. Thirty thousand Tartar cavalry are reported to have been engaged on both occasions. Two thousand of them were killed, while it is stated that only eighteen of the Allies wore wounded. This latter statement appears incredible, unless, indeed, the Armstrong guns enabled the Allies to keep beyond the range of the enemy's fire. The news from Italy Is unimportant, but it shows a stronp fee'lng exi<t* in favor of Garibaldi and against Victor Kmanuel. The Frcn. h Jonr nala state that a reactionary movement had broken out afrash, and in not less than five provinces, with the Abruzii at their head, so that it became necessary to proclaim a state of siege. The steamships Philadelphia, Capt. Brown, and De Soto, Capt. Johnson, from New Orleans and Havana, with dates from the latter port to the ?th Inst., arrived here yesterday morning. The P* Roto made the run from the levee at New Or l< ins to the anchorage at Havana in forty-seven hours. There is no general news of importance from Havana by these arrivals. A meeting was held in the Cooper Institute last ?vening, over which William Cullen Bryant pre aided, for the purpose of devising means to supply the wants of the thirty thousand sufferers by the drought in Kansas. Rev. Messrs. Hutchinson and Denaison, and Judge Wattles, residents of thatTer ritory. gave a detailed statement of the extent of the femfne; a series of appropriate resolutions were adopted, a brief address was made by Pan'el Lord, Esq., and a collection was taken up, which will greatly Increase the relief fund.

The Crisis of the Country? Action of the Metropolis* The action of the city of New York upon tbe present crisis in our national affairs is a matter of the highest importance. In tho city of New York the representatives of the old Thirteen adopted the constitution of the United I States; in tbe city of New York Wash ington look the oath of office and entered upon his duties as the first President of the republic; und ever since that time the city of New York has continued to be loyal to the Union, true to the constitution, firm in its support of the compromises by which from time to time the peace of tbe country has been preserved; and, more than nil, devoted to the maintenance of tho rights of all tho States, as guaranteed to them by the organic law of the nation. While this action on the part of the commer cml metropolis has not been prompted, we verily believe, by any 8ordid or avaricious spirit, it is nevertheless true that we have found it to bo eminently favorable to the de velopement of our resources, the extension of our commerce and the advancement of our city, which now stands prominent among; the great capitals of the world. Within a circuit of twelve miles from our City Hall we have a population of more than a million of people, seven eighths of whom are at this moment actively sympathizing with the South, and ear nestly desiring to find some tangible method by which that fooling may bo expressed. This is putting the case in the mildest possi ble form. The city of New York is now undergoing punishment for the sins of other people. The sectional candidate for the Presi doncy received only one-fourth of the registered votes in thin city: and if the condition of public sentiment could bo tested at the polls to-day. it would be found that the Lincoln vote has already fallen off one-half, and by the 4th of March the black republican party hereabouts will be like the Massachusetts democracy. "conve niently small." Notwithstanding all this, the city of New Vork has already suffered very severely on account of Lincoln's election. Thi panic has spread through all branches of trade and industry. The merchants find that all the money is going out ami none coming in a state of affairs which must sooner or later break the strongest bouses. Manufacturers and matter mechanics have been compelled to discharge a great many of their employes, and the retail trade, which is usually very brisk at this sea son. has dwindled down to almost nothing. Already the distress among the poorer classes ha* been evidenced by a procession of unem ployed working men, to whose numbers we are compelled to notice every day alarming acces sions. And the worst ol the matter is. that be yond this dark hour no man pretends to see the faintest glimmering of the dawn. The panic has been caused by events which may result in one way or another, and human sagacity I- quite at a loss to distinguish upon which side the balance of probabilities lies. One thing is quite certain: the olive branch must be tendered by the North, or the South will never rest easy without a confederacy of it* own. Whence could conciliatory overtures come with a better grace than the city of New York* New England has already shown signs of sorrow. New Jersey ha- taken a strong ( nion ground, and we presume that to .lay tho city of fhila le!,.hia will foll?w jn the same path. I ut the South, mindful of the dan ger of accepting K'fts from her enemies, will look with natural suspicion upon this deathbed repentance, and will pay much more attention to the action of conservative New York In view of this state of things, the voice of New York should be heard at once, and ex pressed in such a manner as to leave no doubt about the real -entimenu of our people.

The Real Imuc KBd Ike PmpMl. Id the numerous propositions of compro mise on the slavery question submitted in the House of Representatives yesterday, the read er w ill peroeive that that which holds the most prominent position is the enforcement of that clause of the constitution which relates to the restoration of fugitive slaves. But in the de bute of the preceding day in the Senate the reader will discover that good faitib in the mat ter of the Fugitive Slave law is not the remedy for the crisis Mr. Iverson, of Georgia, who speaks the pre dominant sentiment of all the "cotton States," in the debate referred to, said: ? MWe have a Fu gitive Slave law which is sufficiently guarded to accomplish all the objects for which it was designed if there was a proper publio senti ment in the Northern States. No better Fugi tive Slave law could be devised by this Con gress or any other. It clothes the judiciary and executive of this government with ample powers to execute the laws." The trpuble does not lie in any defect in the law. "It lies in the fact, to which no man can shut his eyea, that a vitiated publio sentiment in the Northern States is so strong against slawry thai -no enactment (for the restoration of fugitive slaves) can be carried out ichile this state of public sentiment lasts." So much, then, for these Northern Personal Liberty bills. The repeal of all these offensive acts will practically amount to nothing. The seat of the disease lies deeper. "What then ?" the Senator from Georgia in quires. '*Th< n, sir, is it proposed to appease the Southern States by the adoption of the doc trines of the Congressional protection of slave ry in the Territories? I want to know who ex pects kucIi a remedy from this Congress or any other? We know that the republican party are a unit npon that question. It iB the great shib boleth on which they fought this battle and won it. It is the very principle which stands at the bnsis of their political organization. It is that slavery shall not advance beyond its present boundaries, and shall never plant a footprint in the Territories of the United States." And further says the Senator, "We know well that, as far as a portion of the North ern democrats (Douglas men) are concerned, they are as hostile to this principle ? protection of slavery in the Territories by Congress -as the republicans themselves." The con sequences anticipated from this other policy of slavery restriction are, that under it* pressure in the hands of an anti slavery government at Washington, the slave population of the South will goon be crowded from the border States into the eight cotton States, and that then their slave population will soon become so superior in numbers as to have the whites completely at their mercy, and so demoralized as not to show them any mercy. This is the danger, and this is the Southern incentive to disunion, and a separate govern ment, without further loss of time. The Sena tor from Georgia says the late Presiden tial contest has illustrated the feeling of the cotton States; that "it is in favor of Congres sional protection and no amendments of the constitution," and that this protection to sla very in the Territories was the ground oocu pied, not only by the Breckinridge, but by the Bell party, South, in the late campaign. But as Southern men do not believe that this con cession can be obtained, except through fear, and a > any concessions extorted by fear would be of no vaiue, the only alternative left to the South is secession and a Southern confederacy. Is there any escape from this alternative! We have not the shadow of a doubt that Mr. Iverson's views are sustained by an over whelming popular sentiment in all" the cotton Stales, and by a very large and influential body of men in the border slave States, if not by a majority of their people. The ultimatum of the cotton States to the North is the recog nition and protection by Congress of the insti tution of Southern slavery in the common Ter ritories of the United States. It is believed, however, that this concession will not be made because it strikes at the very root ot the repub lican party, and at the root, too, of the !>ou -las democratic party of the North. And this belief is well founded Senator l'ugh. of Ohio, the right-band man of Mr. Douglas, said, in th?. de bate in question, "when the people of any State organization, or Territory, or community, do not desire to have the institution of slavery! my right arm will fall from the socket before I w ill force them to accept it." W ith the republican party and the Dougla? 'ietnoc ratio party organised, ami thm hostile, ngain-t this doctrine of Congressional protec tion to slavery in the Territories, it cannot be accepted as a compromise. It is out of the question But is there no equivalent for thi* ibing? Yea; we are told that the restoration of the Missouri Compromise line and Its exten -ion to the i'aciflc will do. We expect that this experiment will be tried ; but we fear that it will fail. We apprehend that the Kubicon has, indeed, been crossed, and that while our wise men in Congress are tinkering at impracticable and unavailing compromises, the deed of dis union will be consummated, and bevond the restoration of the seceding States to a common government with the North. With a few more risings and settings of the sun, this Union, we tear, will be irreparably broken, and then we ball have only the beginning of the end. Tho ? tat ger thickens. Let all concerned prepare lor the impending convulsion. Tnie I'oi.ur ajwp tiik Gambijeks. A few weeks ago a number of person* were com plained of as keeper* of common gaming bouses, and held for trial before the Court of Specii> 1 Sessions a tribunal which is noted for it- promptitude in the punishment of vagrants, drunkards and petty thieves. We have yet o learn that either of the four alleged gamblers has been brought before the .lustier And perhaps some of thorn may be able to account properly for il.e delay. If not. the Commissioners of Police will notice that complaint has be,n regularly made against certain persons as keepers of gambling bonnes, and that It is therefore the ?'uty of the department to break up the sn?pi rlou, establishments. In another ca*e it has been proven that a captain of police ?? protect ? d" ? gambling hou-e. and failed to complain of its keeper. This officer has since been pro n oted, and we pre-ume that the Commissioners approve of his action In the special case under ??once New. the public, has a right to know wbefber Commissioners of Police fear to do ?heir ?tnty and execute the laws according to their oath* of office The statute affords no loophole out of which thev can escape. They ?re active enough in ordering descents upon street beggars, newsboys and Sab bath breakers, bat there they stop short. It may be doubted whether, in a great city like New York, gambling houses and other es tablishment* of a kindred nature oould be al together suppressed; but that is not a matter for the consideration of the police authorities. It is their duty to execute the laws as they find them; and if we are to go into the business of moral reform let us begin at the root of the matter. There are in this city a number of very good and very influential persons who have been bo far scandalllbd by the irreligious conduct of a portion of our German fellow ci tizens that they have joined together in an ef fort to put down Sunday amusements. Flush ed with victory, we presume that they will not hesitate to carry their crusade still further, and to urge upon the police the necessity of break ing up the gambling bells and bosses of ill fume. Evidence against five alleged gamblers ih already in the hands of the District Attor ney. Five will do very well for a beginning. Thk Umon of tujc Bxrruu Puovtxokh? A Cua.nck you Nkw Enoiom>. ? We see it Ht?ted in the news -by the Kedar that the Daks of Newcastle is actively engaged in the pre paration of a scheme for the union of the North American colonies under one federal govern ment. The feasibility of this plan no doubt occurred to him during his recent vi^it to thin country with the Prince of Wales, lie must have seen in the contrast between its condition and that of the BriMb ]>OKM'SsicuH that the federal system is better adapted to develope the resources of the latter tiiun that of separate Legislatures, each having dii-tinct interests and pursuing a different poli cy from the others. A federation would save a great d?-al of trouble and embarrassment to the Colonial Department in Downing street, and render the task of the imperial govern ment a comparatively easy one. In point of territory it would cover nearly as large an area as the settled portion of the United States. In its relations with the latter there is perhaps no plan that could be devised that would tend more to maintain undisturbed the separate in tert ^ts of the two regions, or to perma nently preserve to Great Britain the allegianoe of her subjects at this side of the Atlantic. On reading the announcement of the Duke's plan we own that we oould not help experiencing a feeling of regret that hi* visit to thia country had not taken place subsequently instead of previously to Lin coln's election. It is probable that if his Grace bad remained a little longer amongst us he would have given his project a wider scope, and included in the proposed Anglo-American confederation the six New England States. The policy and affiliations of the latter have latter ly run entirely in that direction, and our people would be well pleased to see them take themselves bodily to where their predilections lie. We truBt that her Majesty's Colonial Secre tary may be induced to amend his scheme so ns to include the New Englanders in it lie would do them a vast amount of moral benefit, and save us a world of trouble, by linking them in a tight leush with the Arcadian Uluenoses and the Canadian Orangemen.

ANCKM? F.-i T IMA TK.S FOB 1861.? The Comptroller presented a report to he Board of Supervisors on Tuesday, showing the estimates of appropriations required for the expenses of the county for the ensuing year, and be revenues derivable from taxes and other sources. The total estimates are put down at l-l.o77.42Z; the revenues derived from fees of courts and interest on taxes amount to $63,000, leaving the sum required to be raised by taxes, $4,314,422. The expenses for the coming year will exceed those of the present by about three quarters of a million. The Comptroller recommends that the closest economy be exercised in the expenditures of the government, in view of the present dis turbed condition of public affairs, and the large increase in the amount to be raised for ?he yenr 1861, and we hope that the Super \kurs vull be guided by the suggestion. But it v ill avail little to the taxpayers that the counly expenses, under tL ? Supervisors' con trol, be kept down, while v.e have so inefficient and corrupt a city government to swell the (axes up to ten or fifteen millions, as we greatly fear they will do, judging from the organiza tinn of the new Boards of Aldermen and Coun cilmen. Comptroller Haw* draws attention again to I be incomenience and expenw arising from the I ta< tice of completing the a?-est-ments as late as the month of July, and levying the taxes in the latter part of September, thus compelling the county to raise loans for the current ex penditures at heavy interest, which amounts for this year to over seventy-four thousand dollars on county revenue bonds alone, exclu t?i\e of the interest on corporation loans; and he suggest* that the Legislature should provide for any earlier levy. There ia no reason why the tax books should not be placed in the re ceiver's hands in the first quarter of the year, and it is to be hoped that the legislature will so order it during the next session. It will save the taxpayers a vast amount of inconve nience. besides sparing the additional burthen of a heavy interest upon loans.

We have not bus landed business, and we have not discharged a man.
