democratic Advocate. WESTMINSTER, MD. SATURDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1889. The President’s Message. President Harrison's first annual message to Congress was transmitted to both houses on Tuesday. As usual with such documents, it opens with a resume ot our relations with i foreign powers. All this is well known to ; the country, but has to be officially commu nicated to Congress. The government finances are next treated. The receipts and disbursements are given, and a surplus of more than fifty seven millions shown. This large surplus results, too. after the expenditure of many millions for bonds not yet due. The treasury was driven to this expediency, one of questionable propriety, as there was no other way to return the surplus to the people and let it find its course back to the channels of trade. The President says that we should not collect revenue for the purpose of anticipating our bonds, but there is no other use to put any unappropriated money. Had the recommendations of Pres ident Cleveland, as embodied in the Mills tariff bill, been carried out by Congress, there would not have been very much surplus. President Cleveland said “unnecessary taxa lion is unjust taxation." President Harrison says “the collection of moneys not needed for public uses imposes an unnecessary burden upon our people ” The former would have relieved the people of unjust burdens by en largement of the free list and a moderate re duction in the tariff. President Harrison approaches the subject with a timidity that betokens no settled convictions. He counsels against any change that will impair just and reasonable protection to our home industries, but recognizes that it is a matter of great delicacy to prepare a tariff schedule because of tbe wide divergence of opinion on the sub ject. The President thus recognizes that it will be difficult for his party in Congress to unite upon u tariff measure, but he either has no settled convictions on the subject himself, or lacks the courage to plainly state them. What a striking contrast is thus presented between President Cleveland and his succes- i sor. The one states the situation, points out the dangers, and shows the way to avoid dis aster. The other recognizes that tbe people are unjustly taxed, doubts the propriety of the present method of returning the surplus to the people, and is aware of the detriment to business interests by the withdrawal, by unjust taxation, of large sums annually from the channels of trade. But he has no remedy to propose, or lacks the nerve to stale it. An enlargement of the free list, and the abolition of the lax upon tobacco and spirits used in the arts and manufactures, is all be has to recommend. The whole subject to him is a theory, and he advances a theory. He does not discuss details like President Cleveland and point the way. but deals in generalities. When it was desired to “fry the fat" out of the manufacturers and monopolists for cam paign purposes last year, the Senate framed a bill to mit the interests of those to be fried. That bill represents the compact between those who furnished tbe means to purchase a Re publican victory and the Republican leaders. If the Republican majority fulfills its part of the contract, tbe Senate monstrosity will be pet through at the present session of Con gress. If not. those who were fried will not submit to a second heating. Since the election last year the people have become more enlighted upon the subject of taxation, and there ia strong demand for the removal of unnecessary burdens. The high wall of taxation, it it seen, is promolive of trusts and apprentice monopolies. 1 rusts and monopolies want high taxation continued. Tbe people want alt unjust burdens removed, and trusts and monopolies restrained. This accounts for the recognized divergence 8f views on tariff revision alluded to in the lues sage. If Congress passes the Senate bill, a large body of Republicans will revolt and join the Cleveland hosts. If it not, those who had the fist fried out last year will re volt, and the Republican party will nut have the means to purchase another victory on Dudley's "blocks of five” plan. The next subject of importance is the .race issue, and the President assumes that tbe negroes in the Sooth are deprived of free ex ercise of the ballot. Upon the subject he has only followed the lead of rampant Radicals, and in recommending federal control of c-i: gressional elections he is only endorsing measures already proposed. The country is tired of sectionalism. mid none hot back-number politicians indulge in sectional bostility. These soon will be voted out of power, and tbe people North and South, who arc now closely united by bus: ness interests, don't propose to have progress impeded to benefit partisanship at the expense of unity, fraternal feeling and business health and activity. The bringing forward of sc useless and un warranted a measure as federal control of elections, and one whose legality could only depend upon a strained constitutional con struction, is bound to precipitate a contest in which sectionalism will be brought up. It ts doubtful if such a measure could Ire passed by the Republican majority, and if it should be accomplished public opinion would sweep that majority from the halls of Congress. The next subject of importance is federal aid to public education, and the President gives an endorsement to the principles ol the Blair bill that has been discussed in Congress for a dozen years, and which is unconslitn tional. unnecessary, and a step to further centralize power. The other subjects of tbe message are of minor importance, such ss coast defence, new cruisers, merchant marine, inter state com ‘ merer laws, Ac. The message lacks vigorous expression and originality, and is commonplace. It is in keeping with the capacity of its author, who possesses little of the qualities of the states man. Tbe rather, he is more of the politi cian, tbe partisan, the spoilsman. It was not expected that the message would be striking in any particular, and it meets public expec tation. The Landlords' Protective Association of Baltimore have invited a number of persons I to address them on taxation, assessment, ground rents, Ac. Some of these have made valuable suggestions, and some have advanced astounding propositions. Here is an extract from the address of Col. Chas. J. Bonaparte, on Tuesday night last: “I will permit every owner of real properly to assess each piece annually himself, but oblige him to sell it at the price he fixed to anyone willing to buy within a reasonable time, with a right of pre-emption to the city. This is the most absurd proposition yet advanced. It ia well that the Maryland Leg islature and Governor are not Bonapartes. i —~ The Baltimore Sun appeared in an enlarged form on Monday, being now nine columns to the page. Ail in all there is no better news paper published in the country. It is free from sensationaiism, and its news is always reliable. One of its main features is its Wash ington correspondence, which is read brupsai of all parties with a feeling that only fads are given, not idle surmises and rumors. The I Stilt, daily and weekly, reaches nearly every household in Maryland and in parts ofDela ware. Virginia and Pennsylvania, and when j ever a Marylander locates in another State | “he can't keep house" without his old favorite. If tbe half that is said by tbe venders of | nostrums of I heir wonderful curealls w ere true, physicians and undertakers might close , up their shops. Col. Hood’s Explanation. The Advocate's article last week, in refer ence to the change of mails, has brought forth a reply from Col. Hood, President of the Western Maryland Railroad, which will be found in this issue. The mail facilities tor | this section, we repeat, are inadequate, though i there has been an improvement within the i past few days. The fast mail, whose scheduled j time to leave Westminster, going east, is 10.41, j is so uncertain as to be practically valueless, j both for mail and travel. No one here, and I it is probable the same at other points, thinks of going to the depot to take passage on it without first inquiring the nrobab'e time it will arrive. Last Friday it was late about forty minutes; on Saturday about six hours; on Tuesday about an hour behind. On Friday the mail messenger was taken from the 0.47 A. M. train and put on the 4.24 P. M. train. With the uncertainty of the fust mail, this left Westminster and every post i office on the line of the road to Hagerstown, j with no reliable morning mail communication 'to Baltimore and beyond. On Saturday, the fast mail being late, the first mail to Haiti more was by the 4.24 P. M. tram 100 late for delivery at business establishments until Monday. On Monday the Postoffice Depart ment authorized the dispatching of a lock pouch mail for Baltimore on tbe U. 47 train. , the one that was formerly away mail. This ; improvement is acknowledged, but it does not i meet the necessities of the community, as a way mail, as formerly, is desired, and the i evening mail is too soon for the banks at New I Windsor and Westminster, and on 1- ridays too soon for the palter at Union Bridge and the , papers at Westminster. As noted last week, that in order to reach subscribers in the lower part of Carroll on Saturdays, the papers must :be sent to Baltimore on Friday nights. 1 o get them ready lor the 4.24 (rain, they mnst be sent from the publication offices before 4 o'clock, necessitating going to press quite early :n the afternoon —100 early for a Satur i day papier. For the banks and the press the I old schedule of the fast mail was admirable. If it was an hour or two late, or even three. . it was unimportant, for it was only necessary for mail to reach Baltimore by 12 midnight in order to be carried on the early mail on the Baltimore A Ohio road to lower Carroll or : for the morning delivery in Baltimore. Col. Hood's explanation of why the 4.24 train docs not go down about 5 o'clock or later, sustains what the Advocate said last week —that “The Western Maryland railroad does not seem to care much for the conve nience of the towns along its line.'' By this, we meant its main line, and particularly the important points in Carroll. The explana I tion is. that trains from Williamsport and ; Shippensburg meet at Kdgemont. The travel | runs combined to Highfield, there to separate. one train going to Baltimore via Hanover and j the other via Westminster. There could be no reason for this, except to accommodate a few passengers, and very few most probably, from the Shippensburg line and points on tbe main stem west of Edgemont. who would want logo to local points on the Tape Worm road. Those going to Baltimore would un doubtedlv prefer to go down on the main line and the shorter route. To accomnuwlate these few. every bank and newspaper, and manv people who do not like to leave their business so soon in the afternoon to go to Baltimore, must be inconvenienced. In regard to the fast mail being ran east to make connection w ith the Cumberland I alley Road, and to accommodate Winchester and Martinsbarg. we accept Col. Hood * Mete ment that the connection followed the change and was not tbe cause of it. When the sched ~ ule of the fast mail train was changed the Bal timore papers laid great stress upon tbe | opening of this new line to Martinsbarg and . Winchester, and spoke of it as beneficial u> the interests of the Monumental City. From these press notices it p|>eared that the ex tension of the Cumberland Valley road was the cause of tbe change in the schedule of the . fast mail. Col. Hood's remark-- about the fast mail being put on to accommodate p. -ipb east of Hagerstown, do not change our views in the least. The fast mail scheme originated : in a desire of the Baltimore papers to reach - Hagerstown and polu.s beyond M M not to b ■ preceded by Northern dailies. That was the object—the supplying of local points between Baltimore and Hagerstown was the incident. But for the fact that it was desirable to have an early mail from Baltimore to Hagerstown and beyond, the first mail from Baltimore would probably now be coming along at the former hour, about 3.40, Tbe early service j is duly appreciated, and during lhe_ washout last June, when we were deprived of the fast mail, its loss was keenly felt. Butlheaccom modnlion we gel from the early mail is the incident—not the object. On this point Col. Hood says the unfavor able comment “has not worried us. as we ; have not been accustomed to receive evidence? of appreciation for anything done for your pomt- As far as the Advocate is concerned. Col. Hood and tbe Western Maryland Railroad have never received anything but kind words. Every publication that could benefit the road has been given, and it has endeavored to aid it in every possible way. When the Western Maryland wanted to lease the canal, ibe An vocatk supported it, and the Carroll repre sentatives in the l-egis'ature were favorable to his scheme. There has been much individual complaint here as to freight charges and insufficient pas senger accommodations, but the Advov ate has not voiced it. As remarked last week the people here have silently pul up with in conveniences because the road was in debt, but silence seoms to be taken for contentment. Col. Hood seems to be quite sensitive over any allusions to these subjects, and in spite of his intention to be amiable, a little feeling crops out. As to receiving evidences of appreciation for “anything done for your point,” wc would like to ask Col. Hood what his road has ever { done specially for Westminster, except of a i temporary character, such as on occasion; of large gatherings here? Has there ever been a train put on to accommodate this place? So far as we can now recall, all the benefits in i the way of travel have been incidental. The Blue Mountain express was put on the road 1 to accommodate guests at the Blue Mountain House. That teas the object. It was sched- i uled to stop at Westminster as a matter of business. And so with the fast mail. As to our depot criticism, we were aware | | of the purchase of a site for a new depot, and j that, not being undertaken before the disas- ' j trous washouts, the building had to be de- I I ferred. And we were also aware that during ! the past few years insignificant stations have j ; been supplied with handsome depots, while j Westminster, New Windsor and other points ;in Carroll have been neglected. We were aware, too, that the Company has been talk ing of a new depot here for some years, and ! that it had possession of the site for one here two months—the time when building opera ! lions are usually begun —before the disastrous ■ washouts. , Col. Hood makes the remarkable assertion that it is not so much Westminster that makes this point a good station, as the country tributary. He certainly could not have meant to say this, as nine tenths of the freight ! and travel is drawn from the town population, j As to the new line to Baltimore that may j possibly be built, and leave Westminster with a diminished train service, before that day arrives Westminster will have the bsttis j burg and Washington road, with a branch to [ Baltimore, or will have a branch to the Bal timore A Ohio, which has been already con ' sidered. In regard to the proposed Gettysburg and , Washington road, Col. Hood does not think j that the enterprise would be a paying one, i and remarks that railroads of today are rarely ever built or materially aided by local sub scription, but by capitalists, who find it profitable to go into such enterprises. Our observation is just the reverse of this. 1 lie Valley Branch of the Baltimore A Ohio was built mainly by local subscriptions and Balti more city. The Shenandoah \ alley road was very materially aided by local subscrip tions. The Drum Point road is now being built by local subscriptions. The Baltimore and Eastern Shore Railroad is being built bv local subscriptions, and the survey o( the proposed Gettysburg and Washington road, via Westminster, is being made by Westminster subscriptions. As to the amount Westminster would save on coal and lumber by the building of the Gettysburg and Washington road, the Auto cate is unprepared to say. It is believed that freight charges would be less by the new mad, and it is certain that coal can be bought for less at Harrisburg than in Baltimore, by as mueli as sixty cents a ton. It is also cer tain that one-third of the coal and lumber trade Westminster is entitled to goes to Taneytown and Littleslown, because prices ; are cheaper, wagoning included. 1 rade 1 in these commodities goes from this town to j those points. With the proposed road, this trade would be saved to Westminster, and a i considerable trade from the upper and lower parts of Carroll would be brought here that i we do not now enjoy, and there would also be a considerable amount of local travel. Our milk and market men could also open a paying business in Washington, and the roa.l would have considerable local travel to and from the county town, and through travel ' • between the capital of the countiy and historic Gettysburg. Westminster is not unreasonable. It can wail a year or two for a new depot, and it ean. jpil of consideration for the financial difficulties of the Maryland railroad, do without first class tram service. But the i people do want a passenger train to Haiti- | more in the morning about o'clock; a faster ; train up in the evening; away mail at 3.4. A. M. and the 4.24 P. M. train changed to about i SP. M, It'such a service had been supplied | and freight charges been a little more modi r j ate. the people of this city and vicinity would not have interested themselves about t.,hcr ’ lines. Experience shows that competition ; works great changes, and our people have 1 concluded that only competition will secure i for Westminster such mail and travel taciii- j lies as are required. Westminster's impor- ■ lance as a source of freight and jiassengi-r | traffic may be “unduly magnified,” but then j ' it may not. Annual Report of the School Board. The annual report of the School Commis- j sioners seems to have made clear, to ail who , were disposed to criticise.tbe fact that economy ' and sound financial ability have been excr- | vised in administering school affairs. Adverse criticisms generally proceeded troro lack of information. The Board cannot report but j once a year, bal those desiring information 1 can at all times readily gam it by inquiry at ! the office of the Commissioners. In cnticis mg official management, no one should take : hearsay evidence, or go upon surmises, or be i guided by personal feeling. Particularly <• in the case of the management of public schools. The school system .* very near to the people, and criticism of its management at once arouses public attention. The report covers tbe work of the Board for the past six years—ever since the present Commissioners and Examiner have been in : office, and in ail respects is a satisfactory | showing. The present Board were hamt>ered with a : debt at the beginning of thetr management. ■ It was the accumulation of previous years. The interest on this debt about equals the in- ; i crease of Ibe obligations during the pat • x years. Had there been no debt when tftey went into office, there would Uaee been none now. although a considerable number of new school hqsite* base been erected in various parts Ol' the county, others repaired, and much old furniture replaced by new. Freed of debt, and with an additional tloo a year, new school booses could be pul up | where required, the school property kept in j repair, and the school system extended and improved as necessity arises. Meeting of Congress The Fifty First Congress met on Monday last. In the Senate the proceeding? were tame. but on the House side much interest was mamtested, on account of a changr of j political power, and the galleries and corn dors acre tfaroii/*-d. Mr. Reed, of Maine, as tbe Ann*- ATE predicted. WAS chosen Speaker, and the next best place, that of Doorkeeper, was secured by Okas S. Adams, of Hag-re town, through the activity and mffaence of Mr. McUomas. All the Republican caucus nominees were chosen, except for Chaplain. When the House came to elect a Chaplain, several Republicans bolted tbe caucus muni nee and supported Rev. Mr. Milburn, the I democrat, who sas Chaplain of the last House. The boiling Republicans and Deni ocrals elected Mr. Miibam. much to the dis gust of the Republican nominee. On Tuesday but little was done in either house except the reception and reading ol the Prnaident’s message. A great many bills have been intro doced in tbe Senate and House. In the Senate there was a number of bills aimed at trusts and monopolies, and Senator Sherman ; presented his bill for federal control of con gressional elections. But little can be done until after the holiday recess. Speeker Reed will require some lime to arrange tbe House committee*, and they will not probably bv announced until after : tbe recess, which will likely begin on the 21st. Mr. Httrrtson, Attontiou. Tbe Carrolltonian remarks that Carroll i "from its creation to the present Inn has | never been honored with a general appoint j ment by any President," and then proceeds j to remark to tbe Harrison Administration, i that if it is alleged that there are no Repubii i cans in this portion of the stale who are qual | ified, no one whose services to the |>arty are I not entitled to consideration. Republicans, while bolding the contrary opinion, /any sub mit to being again ignored and possibly trill ' patiently wait and go on supporting the I party.” The italics are those of the Carroll j lonian contributor. The article in substance, I says that if some Republican of Carroll dou t | get a general appointment from the Harrison , Administration, it is doubtful whether the I Republicans of Carroll will continue to sup : port the party. If President Harrison's eye | ever sees this, he will doubtless make haste ) to do something for the long suffering and patient aspirant the contributor had in view. He is probably not aware that the Republi cans of Carroll have been polling tor twenty years from two to three hundred votes less than enough to win, and at the last election were only four hundred short of winning. Such a record is unsurpassed, and needs recognition. Let Carroll have a general ap pointment. A learned scientist assures the rest ot mankind that the present rainy season is ow ing to the spots on the sun being reduced to the minimum number, and that humidity of the atmosphere always prevails when such is the case. We trust that the number of those spots will soon be increased, so that we may enjoy a little dry weather again. If the CarroUtonian will confine itself to j the work of making its own columns a little | more readable and interesting to the public, it may, in time, perhaps, swell its circulation j to half that of the Advocate, and may defer its own mortuary record, for a time.

Gentlemen: —1 have just noted the article in your last issue under the beading “Change of Mail Schedule,” and believing that it would not have been written, had there been a better understanding of the causes which led to the change of schedule referred to. 1 have thought it advisable to ask you i to give room to the following explanation ; The change referred to is. I assure you, one of the most objectionable ever forced upon this company. In going West, the Fast Mail is required to leave this city at the earliest hour at which complete editions of the daily papers can be issued. This has been fixed at 4.10 a. m. Coming Hast, it is compelled to leave Hagerstown immediately upon arrival of the Postal Car from the South. During the summer, this has been arriving nl 4.l** P- m. and , the Fast Mail has been leaving for Baltimore at i 4.2*. Recently, we received notice that on the fol- j lowing Monday. 25th ult. the >.

H. minimum rule, i which repreaeuta actual coat of train service, it is j not clear to me how a much biller service w ith In | creased mail facilities can be maintained by the two j lines than is now combined upon the one. • Sometime since, it was announced that the build* ! mg of such a road would cheapen the freight* on I lumber and coal t • Westminster from f.U'UJ to ! year. I believe one of out Directors In j iormed you at the lime that this could not be. as the i entire amount received by this company for traits* ! porting such commodities was only tS.'M.'.is lor I IBS. While for the fiscal year ending September 50. j lb®9, it was still less. Your statement that the W. M. K K. Go. does not 1 care for the convenience of the tow ns upon its Hue Is incorrect, and if you had said that its course so j indicated, that likewise would be incorrect. To af- I ford Carroll county points a thoroughly satisfactory i train service at all seasons is a difficult problem. In summer, the additional A. M. Accomodation | train, and the Blue Moomain Express, should I | pretty well fill the requirements, but In the w inter. | j there is not sufficient business to justify running the ! two Accommodation train.", ami to give the one ! j time for the milk and market work, makes the ! schedule very slow. ..... 1 This arrangement, however, suits your milk ship- j 1 pers better at this season than to run an additional ' train at an curlier hour for the milk business, us it I is only by so doing that the lime of the second can I be quickened. All things considered, ami every- j ! thing has been carefully considered, the present ar- - ! rangemeiit is the best that can be done with the | present light business, j I must apologize lor such a lengthy trespass, ill would have been shorter, had you ilea It more j I briefly and justly. I if you will only afford us an opportunity to give our reasons for our course before going into a j I wholesale denunciation, when our policy does not , ' accord with vour views, we will either satisly you I ! that we are right, or bow sumissively while you j j iMiurout vour vials.
