The inonstnnis character of that treaty la made more manliest when It is seen that a foreign Oovorninent, and thnt, tisi, by eou si'iit of the United HWlU-s, may ilo wtiat no State In the Union can do. The Constitu tion of the Unitisl Stiilee, iu Article XIV., section 1, declares : H All SirtSSS SSfB Sf SSSSTSSSSS in Uir t'lulrj suia. sisl MSjMI lo III jiirlMtirlli.il lliertof, Air sMSVSfl " U'' tfalsal HsM saS sf ttir sui.. h irsls msyisMs s.i MnU' .Iul. mfc ur r n . r Ally IAm w melt liall al.n.lli Us.. rtvUtSSI ur imiauiulM: . ciUMiia iu tuna I SlAtca. ' The prtetMJMI and immunities thus guar nnssed to all MBBi and which no State e in abridge, are not onlv entirely aban donisl h the treaty, but thetli'rninn Oov cinmcnt has gone much further than the obnoxious treaty allows, and actually de prived a native-born citizen of his liberty by conscription, without a word of remon strance. Nay, more than that; Iu the ease of young Htkinkaui.kii, born iu St. Louis of MttunUbsSd parents, who was seized snd treated as a German subject ami soosorlpted into the army, Ohant'h Administration Jus tllled the outrage through the Department of State, and upheld It by an opinion from Attoruoy-Oeiioral I'lF.iutKrosT. Thatoplnlon deserves lo brandisl as an official infamy without a parallel In American history. Since the foiindatlou of the Oovernment, Mr. Kvaiits Is the first to annouure that adopted citizens of (ivrmaii birth will not reis'lvn prob- .1 an a matter of right and duty from the SMSSrtrfS ilenartment, hut If they hy any accident eicissl tho limit of two years' sojourn, their eases will bo made M dopeOttMl upon sfssdal isinsldera tlons." Though his prodcoetisor, and his faithless Minister at Berlin, and the whole crew that formed the OnAMT shoddy court at Washington, did their best to degrade Herman citizens by a gross Inequality, and joined with IIihmaR' K ill stamping inferi ority on their pnsepotte, thoy never ven tured to mnke public proclamation, SI Mr F.VARTK has done, that these citizens have no rights which the (ioverumcnt lb bound to recognize or to respect. Congress is now regularly organized, and it is hardly possible, after these exposures, that there will be any delny In passing the Joint resolution Hint was Introduced yesterday, requiring notice to be given Im mediately for terminating the IlANmop-r treaty, and restoring (Senium-American citi zens to their rightful pMlttOII, This Is a public duty not to Isi neglected Aside frohl that duty, there are a number of BSMbnmOl the House who hold their seats hy the voles of these valuable citizens. They, at leant, should exhibit some concern for const Itu ents who may be exposed any day to a repe tition of similar indignities. UUIlsIni Prisoners. Massachusetts, with her comparatively barren and I in ky soil iiiui her harsh climate, Is one ol the richest commonwenlihs iu the whole world. llow has her wonderful wealth been acquired ' Hy rigid economy, com bined with industry - by turning everything to account. When she sentences some of her citizens to prison, the "hard labor "which accom panies the conlliienient Is I'ogardisl as equally salutary to the prisoner and Hie Stall'. ThoSS who ure too depraved to be trusted at large, are compelled to turn an honest penny Into the coffers of Ihu State by an enforced Industry within tho prison walls. On a late weasion two ol ihe most noto rious pifsoiicrs In Massachusetts were brought into uourt as witnesses. They were allowed to put off their stripes ami don citizens' drnee for the occasion. It must have been a relief lo 1 hem. It enabled them to sen many of their old friends onoo more, although under distressing circumstance ; and at tho same time thoy did tho Htutv some service by helping to unravel cerlnlu crimes In which they hail I n parlrea. These two men were Cm MB and HATHAWAY, t wo of thn convlefcd Fall BlMT swindlers.

'I he quest u0 suggest s Itself whether thcfie prisoners ronld not lie made useful on a bom extended IwM m teaobsre or prsnch era. They are among the well educated men of Massachusetts. Their fall shows that so far ns murals are MBJM'IMRi, the educational nystein of MMMOhUMtte is WofuUy defective, The pupils Id the public schools then! ncisi some kind of Instruction some kind of aarning to make them holiest, which they do not have.

Mr Tai.maub should Is. Idly an nounce the statistics of clergymen con victed of a certain class of offences. If he should II ii I the percentage much larger than i hat ot club men, s i kiss fiserlosely say so.

Tin y st iioghtway lend their ministers Into Irpfdstlhlo temptStloO, so that the fall oi many IsT Inevitable, This thing ought not so to be, and iierhaps it lies in the power of Mr. Tai.maui: to do something to rem. sly it, and to make all clergymen llketb.s.e holy men win e praises are In the heart as well as In the mouth ol all who know them.

BesldsS, the ohlightions nf penes and friendship were I herein expressed to be mutual 1 and though Dost Mo hammkp K111H, for himself and his b sirs, agreed to " r.spe. t tim territories of the Honorable Reel India Company," this MBe company "on gaged . n their part in fsspsct ths tarrltorlsc ol Alfghnnistan now In his RlghneSS'l noSCCSSloo, and never to Interfere therein." Accordingly It would appear that IggM Ai l has a case of broken Ireuly against Ihn Anglo Indian QoT OMBMl, State Prosecutor COWIXBOVnt took n bold stsiiii in tim circuit court of Middlesex County, N.

Th" hour has come, therefor', for II. " honest BOJCOt of IhC I.'iiio"ri'tie parly to look the ficts ln the fii"C and a"t upon them. That tho Democracy wm sold by its present I seders, nnd Hayes pel in ami kept InoAecIn penusneeofn barguiu.tiin trsssectlon on it htoc p roe la I ins, No sale of mcrehuu tiso t s ever more eiearly est n hi i shed by th" pro .fs noW before the public, An IntcrvtoW betWCCn Mr. Hayes and Col. Roberto, who was ItflurtMrd en- di mod by the Chalgsnan of the Democratic sau ns. was published SboUl tholotofD mbcr, 1H"(1. Iu thnt Interview Hayes declared that ho should regard Mr. I.r.mar. t)OV, HsmptOII, and men ol Ibolr obunp, so the representative men ot th" South, ami non Id Invite them to seats In his Cabinet, This statement, Which showed that d egotist Ions bad been opened, was not contradicted. Nor was tin. Mttcment, pub Itched in the Washington tTnlon shortly sftcr ward, that the Chairman of the Democratic ail 'lis bad declared that the President of ths Senate had tho right lo count the vot". contra dicted al the time. Tills was pretty good evl denCS that negotiations had MM con bided. Jir. Hewitt has since decMred thai he had bCMtoMofn similar dCCMrStll n by thn Chairman of tho caucus, nml by another h ading Bonthera member of the Honoc Ths teeoMi which Mr. Bm Hill admits to hnve heel formed early iu the session by him ami enough of the Southern niemls-rs to control the Mouse, was un'iucstlounbly formed to sustain the pre rogative claimed for the President ol the Sen ate. Thctc con, therefore, M no doubt that tim prerogative w.uild hnve been lOStalnsd by the Ilousn, and that Mr. Hayes would have been Installed by Its assertion, but thnt Mr. Cnkllng and other RopuMICM Senators, who had com mitted themselves nt the previous session against It. refused to disgrace themselves by asserting a power for their rreshlent which they had so r htly and UttMUlMOOJty denied, To avoid conflict with his pnrty. Mr. Conkllng suggested tho Electoral bin. smi the Democratic maniigcrs MtTted it through on the protCOOO thst it wns the only way p. avoid war. as they lied Previously Intended to carry through the other programme, well knowing nt tho tlnm that Conk ling was opinmciI to the prerogative claimed for the President of th. gonstOI thst two-thirds of tho llepublican Senators were publicly committed sgnlnsi it ; and that there was every reason to bollCVC that enough of them to defeat It had resolved to SO) with Conk ling. They altcrward reciniX"d the fact that this war cry was i fnl" prOtenCS, by refusing o allow the House to ratify the action ot the Com mission ant i Messrs. Qerttsld, wnnlcy Mat thew".

Mr. John foe eg Brawn ase since puhiieiy on noun. e.l. what (he a. 'Hon of Ihe DoBOCMHC m lungers Itself siiflbiently demon strut's to be true, that they would not have showed Hayes lo Im counted In. even after Ihu doOBlon ol tim Conini salon, from any (ear of war. lis.

And Mr Hayes has paid the consideration agreed up..n with tho Southern Democrats Who SOOnlVCd at his Instaliuient, by surrendering to them the government of the Mates and turn ing . ut th norprt hoggsrs who bsd lbs same elnlB to their offloca that Im had to the Prccl. den 'v, and hy put'iug ono of these nn n iu his Cabinet.
