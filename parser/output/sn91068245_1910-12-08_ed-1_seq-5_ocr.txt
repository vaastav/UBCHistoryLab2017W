The President sent the following message to Congress to-day : To the Senate and House of Repre sentatives: During the past year the foreign relations of the United States have continued upon a basis of friend ship and good understanding. The year has been notable as wit nessing the pacific settlement of two important international controver skb before the permanent court of The Hague. The arbitration of the fisheries HUmite between the United States ,nH fireat Britain, which has been the source of nearly continuous dip lomatic correspondence since the fisheries convention of 1818, has giv en an award which is satisfactory to both parties. I'eace Commission. Appreciating these enlightened tendencies of modern times, the Con gress at its last session passed a law providing for the appointment of a commission of five members "to be appointed by the President of the United States to consider the expedi ency of utilizing existing interna tional agencies for the purpose of limiting the armaments of the na- the American Sag to its ancient place!

At the instance of Colonel Goe- thals, the army engineer officer la charge of the work on the Panama Canal, I have Just made a visit to the Isthmus to inspect the work done and to consult with tiim on the ground as to certain problems which are likely to arise In the near future. The progress of the work Is most satisfactory. If no unexpected ob stacle presents itself the canal will be completed well within the time which this canal was eoastructed to secure.

Tariff Negotiations. The new tariff law in Section 2 respecting the maximum and mini mum tariffs of the United States, which provisions came into effect on April 1, 1910,. imposed upon the President the responsibility of de termining prior to that date wheth er or not any undue discrimination January l, 1915 and within the es timate of cost, $375,000,000. Among questions arlsiag for pres ent solution is the decision whether the canal shall be fortified.

Oae of the great difficulties in the prompt organization aad mobiliza tion of militia and volunteer is the absence of competent offices of the rank of captain to teach the new army, by the unit of the com pany, the business of being soldiers and of taking care of themselves so In determining what the tolls in the canal should be we certainly ought not to insist that for a good many years to come they should amount to enough to pay the inter est on the investment of $400,000, 000 which the United tates has made in the construction of the canal. We ought not to do this, first, because the benefits to be derived by the United States from this expenditure are not to be measured solely by a return upon the Investment. My own impression is that the tolls ought not to exceed $1 per aet toa. I can not close this reference to the canal without suggesting as a wise ameadmeat to the interstate commerce law a provision prohibit ing interstate commerce railroads from owning or controlling ships en gaged in the trade through the Pan ama canal. I believe such a provis ion may be needed to save to the peo ple of the United States the benefits of the competition In trade betweea the eastern aad western seaboards coavlctioas uader the aati-trust law and prosecutions under interstate commerce law.
