DEC. 8. 1892. TWELVE PAGES THE TREASURY REPORT. The Secretary of the Treasury's report, which appears elsewhere, makes out a better showing as between revenues and expenditures than was to be expected. For the past fiscal year a surplus is figured out. This was secured by the entirely proper cours of ihe administration in keepinc expenditures far inside the lavish appropriations for that year; while the swelling of the surplus by adding the na tional bank redemption fund is, as The Dispatch has heretofore .pointed out, a questionable method of accounting, even thouch legalized by Congress. The esti mates for the present fiscal year show even a narrower mirgin; and that margin is only obtained by estimating an increase in the revenues of $33,000,000. The rate at which Congress has been going in the line of excessive appropriations is indi cated by the fact that this narrow escape from a deficiency in revenue is caused by leaving $44,000,000 of appropriations un expended and whole, neglecting the 48, 000,000 annual requirement for the sinking lumi. After expressing the inability to esti mate the effects on the revenue of the coming tariff changes which in view of ignorance as to the nature of those changes is undisputable Secretary Foster pro ceeds to recommend a change in the sink ing fund act, and an increase in the Treasury reserve. The increased revenue required for the latter and other purposes it is intimated might be secured by an in creased tax on whisky, the result of which would be about as doubtful as that of the tariff changes. Upon the subject of regulating immigra tionthe report is positive. It takes the judicious ground that the proper character of immigration can only be secured by examination at the point of departure. But this strong and correct statement is somewhat neutralized by recommending instead of provisions for such an examina tion the imposition of a head tax on im migrants, the effects of which would be wholly remote from those of effective examination into their character at their former homes. , The recommendations of the Comptrol ler of Currency looking toward an exten-j f-ion of national bank circulation are indorsed, but the trouble with, these rec ommendations is that they do not go far enough. The only effectual way to enlarge that ciass of circulation is to designate new and more abundant secur ities on what national bank circulation can be founded. Until the national finan ciers develop the boldness to originate that proposition the disposition to find a substitute, and an inferior one, for the national banking system will have no effectiva counter-proposition. A very timely recommendation for a national quarantine completes the import ant propositions made by the report. The document, of course, deals largely with routine matters. Except for the indirect avowal of the action of the administration in keeping expenditures much below the appropriations it has not very positive character. That feature is also the most creditable characteristic of an otherwise mediocre Treasury administration. MR, 

ADAMS' PLAN. . The recent conferences between the management of the .New York Central Railway aud its employes, accompanied by hints of further trouble, have revived interest in the plan of Mr. Charles Francis Adams, written in 1886, for the purpose of organizing railway forces on a scale that will do away with the necessity or practicability of strikes. Mr. Adams' plan is founded on study from all sides of the question, and gains the corroboration of practical expenment in some of the features put iu operation on the Union, Pacific Railway when he was its President, and were attended with the best results. The idea on which the scheme is based is that employers, employed and the pub lic are equally interested in organizing the railway service in all its branches so as o combine stability of tenure with reliabil ity and efficiency of the services rendered. For this purpose he would divide railway employes into temporary and permanent classes, the latter to be attainable by em ployes only after trial in the former: Af ter a man has reached the permanent grade he'is entitled to a! stable-' tenure of office, unless forfeited by misconduct or voluntary resignation, to a chance for nro motion and to increase of pay in propor tion to length of service. Beyond this he proposes that the relations of employ ers and employed should be regulated on each railway by a tribunal composed of representatives of bothlsides. This is presented as being the most rad ical feature of the proposition, and Involv ing the surrender on the part of the men of the right to enforce claims by strikes, and of the employers to maintain their position by summary dismissal. But whether it would really' do,so on issues such as the scale of wages, where each side would be fully set against each other, would depend on the tribunal. If( as would be naturally expected, each side were equally represented on the tribunal, the result on a disputed scale would be a deadlock, and a strike would be likely to follow as a means of breaking it It is true that a deadlock might be provided asainst by agreeing to an impartial referee to give the casting vote. But as thus would be arbitration, why not recog nize in the first place that arbitration is the one resort under the present system that will obviate industrial warfare? Mr. Adams' plan Is an excellent one for establishing a permanent service and set tling questions of discipline and minor disputes. But, so long as the system arrays the interests of employers and employed against each other on wages scales,!, voluntary arbitration Is the last alternative to the wasteful and dangerous method of strikes. A 

HISTORICAL DOCUMENT. The address of Monsignor SatoUi on the public school question, given to the public this morning, is of the utmost importance. J f confirms, on the authority of the Papal delegate, and with the sanction of the Council of Archbishops, the previous Inti mation that the Roman Catholic Church has adopted the liberal departure repre sented by Archbishop Ireland, and here tofore, so far as the world was informed, treated by the Papal authority with littlo more than guarded toleration. Indeed, when the full significance of the concessions and recommendations of the address are considered, it goes'beyond any definite proposition yet made by the progressive Archbishop of theWest. In doing so it marks a turning point in the policy and career of the Catholic Ghurcl in America. It is true that the conces sions are surrounded by cireful qualifica tions, which may be taken as expressing at once the care with which the subject is studied by the ecclesiastic authorities and the conservative forces which remain at work. But beyond and above these is the pivotal fact that while the address starts upon the abstract proposition that, with religious education otherwise provided, the education of tho young in State schools is not objectionable, it closes with three plans by which the public schools can be attended by Catholic children where schools of equal merit cannot well be maintained by the church. The immediate effect of this address, which is an authoritative deliverance on the subject, is to leave to the Bishop of each diocese the determination of the question. That discretion, however, we take to be much qualified by the fact that the pastor is not to show disfavor to the children that attend the public schools, but it is on the contrary to make them the special objects of loving solicitude. But beyond this reference of the immediate de cision to (he bishops, the utterance has a much broader and deeper influence. It declares unmistakably the liberal and even democratic spirit which animates the Catholic hierarchy under its present head, and points the way in which on one of the most difficult questions its sympathy and harmony with American institutions can be demonstrated and maintained. Such a document is a historical one. It places the present papacy in the most ad vanced position which it has yet assumed, and puts the Catholic Church of this country in an attitude where its already great influence can be infinitely broad ened and deepened. THE 

NECESSARY PRECAUTIONS. Dr. Shakespeare, Port Physician of Philadelphia, in a recent paper before the Board of Health of that city repeated tho warning that the precautions against cholera must be maintained. He points out that all former epidemics have been brought to this country by immigrants and that trie cholera Is still living in many parts of Europe whence immigrants are coming. He forcibly comes to the conclu sion that the only safe course lies in the rigid enforcement of the President's proc lamation and the strict disinfection of- all immigrants and their effects, as long as there is any cholera in Europe. This is not only good sense, but it is the class of good sense which cannot be neglected with impunity. Tet the diffi culty of obtaining support "to this policy of plain and Imperative precautions is Il lustrated by the fact that when there was a disposition to enforce the President's proclamation against a 6teamer arriving at Philadelphia only a few days ago al most the, entire Quaker City press set up a chorus of protest against the "unneces sary interference with commerce." The quarantine precautions against cholera should be enforced rigidly so long as the disease exists in Europe; and the sanitary precautions begun in the fall should be maintained without relaxation until the end of summer. Beyond that the Legislature of Pennsylvania should not perpetuate the violent, anomaly of giving less money for the protection of the people from epidemics than is gratui tously bestowed every year on various favored depositories of State funds. 

ENGLAND'S FAR3IERS. The proceedings at yesterday's National Agricultural Conference in London, as outlined elsewhere, were highly significant of the dissatisfaction now prevalent among the farmers of the British Isles. The five hundred delegates, representing some two hundred and fifty farmers' so cieties, differed somewhat as to the best means for improving upon present condi tions, but were emphatically unanimous in demanding that something be done. The two most popular remedies suggested were some form of protective tariff for home farm products, and an international agreement to remonetize silver by the adoption of a bi-metallic standard. The agriculturalists of the British Isles are undoubtedly in a most unenviable position. Tiiey cannot compete with any hope of success with foreign corn growers and cattle raisers. And their incompe tence in that direction is rapidly increas ing. But the vast majority of the popula tion of the United kingdom not being engaged in agricultural pursuits will never for a moment consent to the adoption of any measure calculated to raise the price of its food. And such action, if taken, would be the height of folly. Unless England is.prepared to relinquish its com mercial character, the farmers must more and more be driven to other occupations, except where their environments are such as to encourage truck farming. From a political standpoint Britain's growing de pendence upon foreign food supplies is a grave danger, but its' Government must choose between that evil and tho rdpid decadence of its manufacturing industries. This being so, it would seem that there is little left for the British farmer to do but to grin and bear it or find seme more profitable occupation. That the establish ment of bi-metall.c monetary standards would defer the evil day for the fanners to some extent is no doubt true. But it could achieve nothing but a postpone ment of his fate without a radical change in the characteristics of England. On the other band, the condition of the farmers is so pitiable that their demand can hardly be disregarded. And the granting of bi metallism at their request, while only for their temporary advantage, would be per manently beneficial to other branches of British trade, as well as to these United States and the world at large. The literary labor of the Department of Safety and the Mayor, apropos or tne sup pression of disorderly nouses, continue from day to day with unabated fervor. Yes terday brought out two fresh State papers upon tne engrossing subject. If there is anything In the lair of ethics, or law, or pol itics, or morals -of the situation that the genoral public have not nowboen told about, It Is not ' the fault of the City Hall controversialists. Meanwhile the fact is noticeable that ifio practical situation is not altered much frjm what it was -when the discussion begun. Chier of Safety Brown insists that there is no mandatory ordinance for raids and decltnes moving unless specially instructed bythe'Mayor; while the Mayor declares that he is not called upon to name a date or outline details of procedure. So far the movement is mostly distinzuishod for its abundant literature. , Alabama's Legislature has under its consideration two hills to discourage cigar, ette smoking. The liable no doubt has Its evils, hut they are small compared to those derived from legislation so paternal as to in terfere in matters so peculiarly dependent upon individual tastes. When Pittsburgers awaken to the ad vantages to be derived from the cultivation of a municipal spirit they will wonder that the revelation has been so long in coming. Among the othor features of that happy era will be the dlvotce of mayoralty nomina tions and elections from partisan political organizations. If the citizens would get together and formulate a municipal plat; form, the uiatterof selecting suitable candi dates would be greatly simplified. Failing that, tho self appointed or party-nominated candidates should construct such platforms for themselves, that voters'may at least be given the chance to judge between their respective merits. One of the iamous 'Siemens brothers died in Beilin yesterday. Probably the owners of no other name have done more to Influence tho industries of Allegheny county than have the Siemens brothers. Capital can do a great deal, but it owes much to invention. The extreme notoriety of the Cooley gang some survivors of which aret now undergoing trial is due, not to the magni tude, but the multitude of the'erimes with which they are charged. The system of terrorism by which they eluded such efforts as were made to arrest them could only have been used by cowards iu a scattered community. Between the criminals now on trial and tho officers who permitted them to nourish lor so long there is a good deal les to choose than there should be in a well ordered county. When hats are dolled by ladies at the theater and donned by gentlemen at the grave side, the convenience and health of the majority will have been consulted in a common sense manner. These reiorms'aro samples of the little things that go a long way. The Western Penitentiary has now 676 inmates, a grea'ter number thnn ever before. This is an indication of the growth or popu lation which is a- matter for crave regret. That only 23 of the convicts should he women is matter for congratulation. But theso figures are evidence of the growth of crime which demands a careful considera tion. The home is the nursery of the na tion, and upon careful home training de pends the proportion of criminality in the Commonwealth. The International Monetary Conference was not expected to do anything but talk, aud it is talking. Whatever the tangible results of the proposals and discussions may be, the meeting cannot fail to be valua ble as an educative medium. Br Inviting American retaliatory legisla tion and throwing out of office Government employes with annexationist opinions, the Canadian Government is doing all it can to encourage the growing feeling among Can adians in favor of union with these United States. Individuals are crossing the border southward in increasing numbers, and the stay at homes are rapttlly becoming con vinced by the irrelutable logic of adverse clrcumstanoes. Chicago may have more smoke than Pittsburg. Dut it is trying harder-to get rid of it. When Pittsburg has more of Chicago's united enterprise, Pittsburg will more rap Idly achieve u. properly prominent position. Ant attempt, to limit Mr. Cleveland's choice ot office-holders according to their religious affiliations Would be worse than an out and out advocacy of the spoils sys tem. There is a certain amount of illogical connection between a political victory and a distribution of political affairs. But there is absolutely no room in this country lor considering religions opinions in making political appointments. A beneft association is a good'deal like a municipality, in that the welfare of the whole depends upon the care of the indi vidual in selecting officers to conduot its affairs. ' The bitter comments of the British press on the President's message aie filled with the old-fashioned English spleen and con tempt for ail that is un-English. General Harrison may congratulate hlmselr that an unfavorable criticism from that quarter is not the least valuable of the indorsements he has received. The Census Bureau is never failing as a subject for Congressional investigation, whatever may be its shortcomings as a manufactory for tollable statistics. If the emptiness of the' National Treas ury results in making the last session of tho Fifty-second Congress more economical than its predecessors, the nation will be truly thanktul for the scarcity of funds. Any effective hindrance to log-rolling and incentive to reiorm is welcome in whatever lorm it comes. F0J,K

"How do you find-the feeling as to the future among our business mon?" 1 asked n leading real estate operator yesterday. "Well, things look so well that unless there is a panio ot some sort I befieve we will have a busy and money-making year before us," was his reply. "I will say frankly that for two weeks after the election it was much like a holiday with us. The mon who have large sums at their disposal seemed inclined to keep their money in bank. For ten days past there has been a radical change. I. can sav without any qualification that there are as many real estate operations on foot as I have ever known in Pittsburg, both as to in dividual importance and aggregate size What enoourages me particularly is the con fidence shown by men who are in a position to Know just how tho great leaders of both political parties feel as to the effect or the Cleveland administration. These men are buying every week, taking more and more property in bulk into their hands and plac ing themselves in such shape that hard times or a serious falling off In business would cause them a heavy loss. The growth of the city and the strictly bnsiness portion of the city is confidently looked for by the shrewdest and. most conservative of our capitalists. The time will 'soon come when the Fifth avenue hill will cease to be the boundary of downtown activity. "This," he continued, "is shown by the constant creeping or the great establish ments toward the summit of the hill. From Smithfield to Grant street nsed to be ten years ago a place of very small things. Now it promises well to grow rapidly. I am told that when Mrs. Thomas Carnegie's building Is completed it will be largely oc cupied by the Carnegie Steel Company and the Frick Coke Company for offices. Al ready there is serious thought of selling the present Cathedral site for a business block. It is true.as The Dispatch lias said, that about $1,500,070 has been offered for tho Ca thedral property. This in itself is a suf ficient gnarantoe of what Is thought' of the hill question. People who can pay a mil lion and a half for property do not offer it unless they consider the ruture of the prop; erty is most promising. Besides this, there is sure to be a widening of Diamond street sooner or later, in spite of the foolish pro tests against it. Another outlet in that por tion of the city is ahsolutely-necosavy, and a few years will see it accomplished." "They say that in the way of housebuild ing Pittsburg has overdone the thing in the eastern wards," said my companion warmly. "It is all rot. Thei o is not a real estate man in 'the city who will not tell you honestly that the demand for houses in good loca tions at lair prioes, either for rental or for investment, is greater than the supply. This is borne out by the line of action of the large property owners. I know one man who is building nearly 70 houses, another who is contracting for 10, still another who has signed for 35, and theso three men are among the shrewdest and best informed men in the city. There will be some kind of tariff squabble, no doubt, but I feel that our strength in Pittsburg is so groat that we will continue -to grow, continue to prosper and continue to make large returns from landed investments." AVrrAT does the weather man expect to do for us next? To inject such a night as that of Tuesday and such a day as that of yesterday into December is not fair. De cember is not fair to those who have gone in lor furs and overcoats. "Does anybody skate In and around Pittsburg nowadayst" I asked a dealer. "Oh, yes, we have sold some skates this year and we sold moro last winter than for years. I don't know exactly where they expeot to use the skates, but people are certainly get ting ready for a freeze." Those good people who had such a scare on the steamer Spree the other day are sin cerely to be commiserated. It is no fun be ing in midocean with five or six hundred people when a serious accident occurs to the steamer. I shall never forget my small experience of that nature. At five o'clock one gloomy September morning, as I lay asleep in my berth on the main deck, I was suddenly lifted "and tied in festoons around the pipes and beams on the ceiling of the stateroom. I awoke with a stomach full of salt water and a feeling of astonish ment. The cabin had eight feet of ocean slopping about and there was a fine lot or clothes brushes, hats, gloves, umbrellas and Other sundries afloat. With characteristic presence or mind I permitted a bag full of clean linen and a bat box or cigars to float by and promptly rescued and hauled into the top berth a bnndle or new umbrellas. Through the open door I caught a glimpse of a stormy sky where there had been a stout deck. Then there was a sickening, horrible quiver through the big boat and women wailed and men ci led out. "We're sinking." For an instant it did feel as ir we were going in the wrong direction, but with a sudden lurch the steamer righted, rolled and then rocked in the trough of the sea In a way which nnder ordinary circumstances would have made everybody deadly sick, but which just then was charmingly reassuring. We had struck a tidal wave, the sailors said, and the for ward deck railing and much detailed rig gtiiz had gone afemasb. Thick brass and iron rods wore tied np lu grotesque lovers' knots, and teak rails were splintered like matches. We had tons of water aboard, some of which I could answer for myself as fi eight. The machinery was not seriously hurt, bnt It was hours belore we got off again. The catholic nature of our country was shown by the fact that six or seven dis tinct kinds of prayer meetings were in, progress at once before breakfast. It was a nasty, close shave, and I do not want any more of in mine, thank you. A most comical personage, very stout, very dilapidated and very intoxicated held himself up by a lamp post on Fifth avenue yesterday morning near tho old postofflce and persisted in issuing a challenge to any man of his weight in the country to ride on cablo or electric cars any distance for a purse of $503. He ultimately changed his motive power to a hurry-up police wagon to the amusement of the crowd. In a short time I understand the plans will be completed for the entire reconstruc tion and realignment of the Pittsburg and Western Railroad by the Baltimore and Ohio. Presidents Meyers and Oliver, Vice President Kinc and several othergentlemen have jnst returned from the most complete inspection of tho Pittsburg and Western and the lines of the Baltimore and Ohio as far as St. Louis, that tbey have ever been known to give these roads. Gangs of engi neers have beon at work for months making calculations for new grades, shortening curves, preparing for cuts and straighten ing tracks along the Pittsburg and Western and the result of their labors will shortly bo laid before the directors of the Baltimore and Ohio for action, it is safe to say that much or this work will be done before the World's Falr,travel sets in toward Chicago.

NO MONEY IN AN OFFICE. Ohio's Fx-Governors Never Leave Colum bns With More Than They Can Carry. Columbus, O., Dec 7. ISptciai. It was a neat bit of sympathetic expression and good will which attended the departure of ex-Governor Campbell for his temporary home in New York last evening. He had abandoned the Kelly mansion on Broad street, tho leading residence thoroughfare of the city, and had taken. rooms at the Neil House pending his departure. While tho exact time at which the ex-Gftvernor would leave for thn East was not generally known, yet It wns certain that he would go in a few days, and this was sufficient for a round of pilvate dinners, club gatherings and social events In his honor. It is doubtful if any former official in the State ever met with so many kind words and well wishes on the eve of his departure as were showered upon Mr. Campbell. Party lines did not pierce the generous ex pressions which cheered the distinguished gentleman, but Republicans were equally as prominent as Democrats in their efforts to extend honor and goodwill. That Governor Campbell would leave for New York with his family in the evening became quite well known by midday, and from that time on there was a continuous reception at his rooms. Cards announced tho coming of the guests In the afternoon And toward evening the pressure became so great that formalities were abandoned nd the peoplo proceeded direct to the quarters on the second floor. The most piominent profes sional and business men of the city were to be found in line and the expressions which were heard were certainly sufficient to indi cate to the ex-Governor that he had made a favorable impression noon the people, not only officially but in a social way. VV lion the time arrived for Mr. Campbell and his family to meet their train they were still surrounded by Irionds, and were accom panied to their- parriages by a large number of people. Many a man who could have no other-reason than iriendship expressed the wish that the ex-Governor would become one of the most wealthy men in the country. They seemed to appreciate the motive tvhtch led him to announce he would not accept a Cabinet position shonld it be offered, and that he could not under any circumstances be a candidate for Governor of Ohio again. Those wuo know Mr. Campbell best are in formed of the tact that he is in a considera ble manner embarrassed financially, and the aim of Ills Immediate future is to secure re lief from the embarrassments in which poli tics have placed him. Tho story of Governor Campbell in this re gard is not materially different from that which has attended the retirement of many other Governors or the State. Hoadlv was a financial wreefcwhen he went out: Foraker was embariassed to the point or economy In the necessities of lifo; Campbell suffered humiliation by extravagant reports or his condition, and it Is now whispered that Gov ernor Mc Kin ley is not easy and unmindful of the luture. It is embarrassing to be an honest Governor. FINAHCIEBS ALL AT SEA As to Whether or Not the Monetary Con ference Will Do Anything. Brussels, Dec. 7. E. Benjamin Andrew, of the American delegation, and J. M. Bolsse vain, or the Netherlands, will speak in favor of the American plan when it is discussed to-morrow. Signor Simonnlli said: "It is still Impossible to predict the upshot of the conference. You see what unexpected things are happening at our meetings." President Levi lias received a communica tion from Mr. Allan, member of the Insti tute of Civil Engineers, who has had much experience in India, suggesting that the silver-producing countries agree each to im pose a fiscal duty on all silver exported, ex cept on their silver coins. The proposal, it is expected, will be discussed by the com mittee, but It is doubtful if it will be seriously entertained. It is the opinion of many of the delegates that the Frencu Government does not de sire the conference to decide anything., M. Leon Sav, the well-known French financier, thinks the attitude of both tho English and American delegates is a deplorable one, es pecially that of the Americans, who appear to be without any definite proposals. In re gard to the de Rothschild proposals, M. Say declared they solved nothing, and he thinks the deliberations of the conference will end in nothing. 

W0ESE THAN SHEBHAH'-S MAECH. A Southern Railroad President Inveighs Against a Commission BUI. Columbia, S. C, Dec. 7. President V. E. McBee, of the Richmond Terminal system, made a sensational speech to-night before the Senate Committee on Railroads regard ing the proposed railroad commission bill now before the General Assembly. The bill proposes to give the commission power to fix' all freight, and passenger rates, to regu late joint rates, supervise all contracts and agreement, to direct and control the build ing of all depots and warehouses and to ar range schedules. Ballrcads are denied the right to appeal from the decisions of the commission. Mr. McBee described it as a scheme of confiscation nnder forms of law. He said it violated the State's contract to give corpor ations a chance to live expiessed in tne charters granted them, and that It went be yond the idea of communism, which is to seize private property to be divided among the people, to nnaichy, which means wanton destruction or values without purpose or benefit to anybody. Colonel McBee de clared that the operation or such a law might destroy the railroads as completely by our own people as if General Sherman were again at work.

Ladles FindOnt Why Theater-Going Men Complain A Season Prolific In Fairs and Weddings A Young Woman Gives a Lesson in Politeness. The principal point brought out by Hrs. Edmund Russell's lecture at the Concordia Club Theater yesterday afternoon was tho fact that the ladles in attendance had an opportunity of appreciating the complaints of men about big hats at the theater. It may be said that five out or six of the ladies in the audience at the Concordia Club wore, not only big bats, but gigantic sleeves. Such a dodging and a peeping as there was to get a glimpse of tho stnge around, over and under these obstructions. No one conld say very mucli about her neighbor, because the sin of wearing this awful headgear and high sleeves was committed by such a large proportion or the assemblage. Mrs. Russell's gestures and performances are a very inter esting part of her lectures, and those who go to hear her enjoy the entertainment a great deal more when they have an opportunitv of seeing ber. The Concordia Clnb Theater has a flat floor, and the biz hats and high sleeves stopped all the people in the rear ol the hall from obtain ing more than an occasional hasty glimpse of tho speaker. The lecture was virtually the same as that given at the residence of Mr.'and Mrs. C. L. Mngee -a lew weeks ago. Tho sta'.'O was handsomely decorated' with palms and cut flotrers, and the curtains daintily draped around a parlor scene made a very pretty sotting for tho esthetic figure, enrobed in white, of the fair lecturer. The frequent applause of the listeners proved their appreciation of the entertainment. Some ofrthe hints given by Mrs. Russell wero particularly enjoyed, among thom one to the effect that if ladies woulduse hygienic means to make their necks full, tbey could dispense with jewels and thus save money. The XT. P. "Woman's Association will open its fair to-day at the old postofflce building. Dinner will be served at regular hours, and then the visitor witli leisure can spend an hour or two in exnmining and pur chasing the fancy articles offered at the bazaars in the other apartments. The asso ciation is a large one, and if only all the friends or the ladies go to the entertain ment, a good ronnd sum will be raised from them. Since tho object of the affair is a worthy one, however, it is reasonable to expect that there will be plenty or patron age from others outside or the Immediate circle of acquaintanceship of the associa tion. The season is prolific of fairs. There is one in progress on Mt. Washington, in con nection with Grace Episcopal Church. It opened yesterday, and will be continued over to-day and Friday.

The house was prettily decorated and the ladies were in elegant reception costumes that made a very charming ensemble. The hostess was assisted In re ceiving by Mrs. George MnrshcII, Mrs. John I. Shaw, Mrs. William Hamilton, Miss Lily Palmer, Miss Birdie Marshell. Miss McClnre and Miss Bonnev, a sister of Mrs. Boggs, and who is her guest at present.

A quiet but effective lesson in common courtesy was given to several young men in a traction car on one or the city lines yester day, that afforded infinite satisfaction to half a dozen persons who witnessed it. Tho car was crowded, as traction cars generally are in Pittsburg, when it stopped to allow a a fat old colored woman to get on. She rolled Into the car and looked around her questloningly. Every seat wa3 occupied. Three young men sat Immediately in front of her, but they all wore a vacant expression on their facesand could not see the old lady, although she must have weighed 200 pounds or thereabouts. For an Instant tne old col ored woman stood thore, and then a bright, rosy-cheeked, well-dresed young iirl sprang to her feet and save her seat to thn auntie. This was too much for the three young men, and they were upon their feet at once, offering their seats to tho young lady. She shot a glance, halt of amusement, half of contempt, at the youths, and then, in a freezingly polite tone, said: "Thank you. I will stand. Yon sit down. I dare say you are tired." At the next corner there were three vacant setts in the car, and three young men were sneaking down a side street, while the young girl smiled, as ir enjoying a thought of something humor ous.
