REVENUE In his report Secretary Gage says The tariff act of July 21 1897 has not been in force long enough to determine fully its merits but it is confidently believed that when in full operation it will afford ample revenue for the ordi nary needs of the government while adequately protecting our manufactur ing and agricultural interests That statement is a splendid speci men of American optimism but noth ing more Why is it confidently be loved that the tariff act of July 24 1897 will when in full operation af ford ample revenue for the ordinary needs of the government The basis of that belief is that importations under the Wilson law during the last two months of its life were so heavy owing to the anticipated increase of duties that the country was stocked up with foreign goods and that tIle stock so I laid in will not be exhausted in less time than a year It ie assumed that when exhausted foreign imports will begin again and be as large as ever and that the increased duties will fur nish adequate revenue That is the basis of Secretary Gages belief it may be well founded or it may be ill founded time alone can tell I If the duties under the Dingley law are sufficiently high to materially re duce the volume of imports the reve nue derived from them will be corres pondingly reduced A tax tariff or other can easily be made so high that it will practically kill the industry that has to bear it By way of illustration the case of the tax on oleomargarine may be cited There is some truth in what the secretary says about the present tariff act not having been in I force long enough to determine fully its merits but it has been in force long enough to raise grave doubts in the minds of many even its friends whe ther it will prove a success as a reve nue producer Discussing the debt statement issued on the 1st inst the Philadelphia Led ger of Friday last said in part It is nevertheless a fact that the Dingley tariff bill is inadequate as a revenue producer Government offi I cers of course express the hope that in the spring there will be larger im ports and that the revenue may be in creased but it is quite evident al ready that the bill has failed of its chief purpose that of producing reve nue Nor is it surprising that it should have failed in this resnect for some of the most i important schedules w re framed not in the interest of the na tion but for the benefit and at the dic tation of the Sugar trust the Cattle trust and organizations representing the wool growers and the manufactur ers of woollens the lumber dealers and various other combinations of interest ed parties whose sole purpose was to promote their private interests The debt statement issued on Wed nesday although on its face somewhat favorable shows by its details that the revenue from customs has fallen far short of expectations The treasury is in good condition having a balance on November 30 including the gold re serve of 221000000 The net gold re serve is about 157000000 This excel lent condition of the treasury is due in part to large receipts from the pur chasers of the Union Pacific railroad The detailed statement of ordinary re ceipts and expenditures shows the weakness of the Dingley tariff act The deficit for the month was almost 8000 000 7977012 and for five months of the fiscal year 45986023 The receipts from customs seem to have reached a fixed point 6000000 below Senator Al lisons estimate of the average monthly receipts The receipts for October amounted to 9713494 and for Novem ber to 9830025 The receipts for No vember 1896 were 9930386 Some al lowance should yet be made for the large importations which anticipated the passage of the new tariff act but it is quite evident that the tariff act will not meet expectations and that there will be a very large deficit at the I end of the fiscal year The receipts from customs for five months of 1897 I amounted to only 51164232 against 37012289 for the corresponding months of 1S96 At the same time the receipts from internal revenue were increased by rather more than the deficit from customs so that the revenue from the two sources for the first five months of the present fiscal year exceeded that for the corresponding months of 1896 by about 754000 This rate of in crease will not go very far however towards meeting the annual deficit of I 50000000 or more Congress will have to economize and should also make provision for an increase of revenue There is no use tinkering with the tar iff Bad as it is it had better be let alone but there is no good reason why I the receipts from internal revenue should not be increased by the imposi I I tion of additional taxes on tobacco beer and whisky I This administration should not re I peat the error of the previous adminis tration which continued to the end to make estimates of revenues that were never realized It would be much better to confess that the Dingley tariff act however acceptable it may be to the trusts that framed its more im portant schedules is as a revenue pro ducer a failure It would be better I also to make provision for sufficient revenue to meet the wants of a gov I ernment economically administered and leave a sufficient yearly sur plus to provide against contingen cies than to attempt to cut down expenses to meet insufficient revenue The economics instituted for such a purpose generally take the form of a suspension of public work ac tually needed and are unwise and harmful Real economy is always in order but along with real economy there should be a manly acknowledg ment of the facts of the situation lead ing to such legislation as will provide I sufficient revenue with the least possi ble disturbance of business That is a simple statement of the facts in the case Currency is the most prominent question of the hour but the urgent need of the hour is more revenue It should be provided forth with and the easiet wav to nrnvirio it n is from internal revenue sources Tl is is waiting for tomorrow and tomorrow in the expectation of more revenue is not business like it is nothing but fatuity 

HAYTI GSBSEA2TY AND THE STONEOE DOCTRINE The differences between Germany and Hayti over the Lueders incident have been composed the latter coun try complying with the formers de mands This is a happy termination of an affair that has been prominent for several weeks past The stories told by the Haytien authorities and by the German representative of Herr Lue ders arrest have differed so materially and radically that it has been impossi ble to form any definite opinion as to the real merits of the case with i the result that people have had to he guided by their sympathies not always a safe guide The incident caused much to be said about the Monroe doctrine but Ger many never had any intention for a single moment of annexing the island though some of the Haytiens appeared to think she had and even some people in this country entertained the same idea The Monroe doctrine is firmly es tablished as a fundamental principle of i I American foreign policy and whatever party may be in power at Washington will maintain it as such there need never be any doubt as to that There are many governments on this hemi sphere and in the very nature of things they will at times have disagreements with European governments It is not the province of the United States to champion their quarrels though some of them will undoubtedly try to have this country do so by falsely invoking the Monroe doctrine There are many people in our owncountry who see in every dispute between any of the American governments and any of those of Europe a menace to the Mon roe doctrine what it is that causes them to see this menace their fears or something else it is hard to say In disputes between governments as well as between individuals there are two sides to the story It is not to be pre I sumed that the governments on this hemisphere Are always right and that I they have their quarrel just those are matters to be determined according to the facts in the case There is another important thing that must always be borne in mind when the Monroe doctrine is to be invoked which is that being a doctrine that had its birth and development in the United States and having been promulgated by this government it is the peculiar province of this government to say when it is being infringed and if it does not declare there an infringement or threatened infringement of it it should be accepted by all who are in terested in its maintenance that there is none To cry out that the Monroe doctrine is threatened with infringe ment every time a petty dispute arises is to make it ridiculous If It ever shall be actually infringed the consequences will be so grave that all the world will know it and something other than the cry of the alarmist will herald the fact THE PUBLIC BUILDING Already Representative King has ap peared before the house committee on appropriations to urge an appropriation of 500000 for a public building for Salt Lake City but the matter will not be formally taken up until after the holi days Representative King did well to take up the matter so early as it will give the matter precedence over many other things that will be certain to come before the committee at a very early day a But what are the chances for favor able action after the holidays It can not be said that they are firstclass Utah is not in favor with the powers that be at Washington because of her electoral vote of last year which was against the administration That fact alone would cause any proposition f or an appropriation for this state ta be received with anything but enthusiasm Then there is this important fact that will likely militate against an appro priation for a public building for this cityand that is that the president in his message asks congress not to in crease expenses if it cannot reduce them If the committee on appropria tions is so minded here is a splendid reason for not giving Salt Lake City a public building This reason would ap pear so plausible and would be so hard to answer no matter how insincerely it might be urged It may be that the committee will look with favor upon the proposition to give half a million for the erection of a public building in this city and it certainly is to be hoped that it will At all events it is certain that the Utah delegation will do all in its power to 1 secure it un 

SALVATION ARMY COLONIES The experiment to be undertaken by the Salvation Army of establishing colonies will be watched with much in terest The army has succeeded in getting closer to what are usually termed the submerged classes than any other denomination or association The secret of the armys success and it has had a very good success seems to be the result of direct personal sym pathy Thus far its efforts have been confined to the larger cities the propo sition to establish colonies is an en tirely new departure It is altogether likely that it will be successful because those in charge will carry into the enterprise the same zeal and ardor that have marked their efforts in other directions The social democracy scheme of Debs was a chimerical af fair He had never shown any capacity for what may be termed constructive work though his capacity for organ ization for agitation cannot be denied agitation is one thing but building up is quite another An inherent defect in the Debs plan was that it was founded on discontent and was in the nature of a protest against society as constituted This is largely the case I with all new social movements but where it is the main idea it means the I encouragement of antagonism to the I detriment of the essentials of success the zeal exhausted in antagonism I i leaves little or none for anything else I The Salvation Army plan is not a I protest against society as organized Its purpose is to save and make suc cessful a class that has failed in it I i I there is no room for antagonism to society as it is The army finds that society has not successfully solved some problems and its proposed colo nies are an attempt to solve them Its plan may not meet its expectations but it promises some success in any event it should be given every encour agement I OREGON AGAINST CALIFORNIA I The protest of the Oregon bench and i bar against the appointment of Attor neyGeneral McKenna as exAssociate 1 Justice Fields successor is attracting I j a good deal of attention The New York Commercial Advertiser a stanch I Republican paper commenting on the protest savs The objection to Judge McKenna does not rest upon his religion or his char acter or his relation to corporations or anything to his moral discredit or social disadvantage He is a very worthy person but a very ordinary lawyer and the supreme court is a place for great lawyers This is well understood on the Pacific cbast and the bar of the whole country understands if better since March 4 Californians are clan nish and sense of local loyalty keeps them silent The bench and bar of Ore gon which are of sound quality more in touch with the rest of the country and less hampered by provincial sentiment have spoken out under strong sense of duty and responsibility This ought to be heeded A cabinet appointment is for four years only a supreme court appointment is for life The president chose Judge MeKenna for one place and now chooses him for the other be cause he likes the man Doubtless the man ifs likeable but the lawyer is not > admirable Men responsible for filling high public place should not indulge their personal likings to excess William E Curtis the Washington correspondent of the Chicago Record says that if the protest had been pre sented to the president in a quiet dig nified way with evidence to sustain it he would have been compelled to have given it careful attention but being blazoned out in the papers even before it was mailed to him gives it all the I symptoms of a malicious attempt to I defame Judge McKenna and the presi dent is consequently very indignant at I an attack made in such a man ner upon a member of his official family And what is most shocking in the opinion of < > members of the bench and the bai in Washingtqn he says is that Judge Gilbert of the United States circuit court and Judge Bel I linger of the district court should be guilty of such undignified and unju dicial conduct as to utter a protest I against the leading law officer of the I and government in a public manner furnish the newspapers a copy of their communication to the president before it was even mailed to him The at tack has injured the persons who signed it more than the man at whom it was directed It is very evident that there will be considerable scrapping over the pro test and the appointment if Judge Mc Kennas name is sent to the senate Some of the protestants may go to Washington to present the very evi dence that now seems lacking The protest astonished most people Wheth er there is any ground for it we do not know that there is some jealousy in the case is not improbable One of our prominent sheep men seems to take a pessimistic view of the sheep industry in Utah says the Lehi Banner He says that in five years there will be less sheep in Utah than any western state Sheep are being sent out of the state in large numbers now Many are shipped to eastern markets and many flock masters are moving their herds from the state be cause of the adverse laws in force here This has been an important industry in this state and to kill it means a bad blow to our industrial progress He must be very pessimistic indeed There are no laws in Utah that are ad verse to the sheep industry In five years there will be just as many sheep in the state as in any other state relatively This prominent sheep man should take something for his liver The law prohibiting the screening of coal before it is weighed for the pay ment of the miners received a black eye in the courts sterday from the opinion of Judge Frazer holding it to be unconstitutional says the Pitts burg Dispatch It would be pretty hard for coal to receive anything but a black eye if it is to receive any kind of an eye 

SOME EDITORIAL COMMENTS Chicago Record It is all right for Mr Boutell to stir up congress on the sub ject of the Chicago river but he will kindly refrain from stirring up the Chi caro river on the subject of congress or any other subject Denver News As a shrewd politician Mr McKinley recognizes that a radical declaration for the gold standard would alienate many who voted for him at the j I last election and he proposes to keep up 1 the can international game as long as he St Louis GlobeDemocrat The govern ment bulletin undertaking to show the difference between edible and poisonoUs fungi wrestles bravely with a comnli cated subject It is a pity the necessary I precautions can not be condensed into a couplet that everybody could remember Denver Republican The presidents I references to the Wolcott commission will I have a tendency to rile the advocates of I the single gold standard and it certainly is very absurd for him to profess to de sire the rehabilitation of silver In that part of his message while in the portion devoted to currency reform at home he professes to think that the gold basis af fords the only assurance of national safety Baltimore American A candidate in I the Virginia legislature was described as the vestal virgin standing in the tem I ple the incarnation of purity As he I was promptly defeated it seems evident I I that politics in Virginia are just about I as usual I I I Kansas City Times General Blancos assurance that he could conquer Cuba if he had 4000000 pesetas mon a month I recalls the story of war prices in the south when a soldier could have sold a pair of boots for Siooif he had only had I tho boots
