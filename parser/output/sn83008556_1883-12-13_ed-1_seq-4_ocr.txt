The new swird of State recently cyxmpleted for his royal nibs, the King of S:ani, is double-edged, spear-shapeil and fifteen inches Kxng. Tow aid the hilt it is inlaid xvith gold of varying tints, wrought in different devices, the figure of Buddha being prominent on each side.

He says that recreation does not consist, as many persons wrongly imagine, in idleness, but rather in diversion, and in the em ployment of different sets of mental faculties from those which are used in the ordinary business of life. James Paget analyzed true recreation as consisting to a greater or 'ess degree of the elements of uncertainty, won der and the exercise of unwonted or unusual skilL In his recently published book on "Farm Fences," Professor Scott esti mates that five dollars is invested in fences for every acre of inclosed land in Great Britain and Ireland, and that the annual maintenance of fences costs about seventy-five cents an acre. The total capital thus invested in the United Kingdom must be, at this rate, nearly $250,000,000, and the annual outlay about $32,000,000. Professor Scott be lieves that a great deal of fencing might be dispensed with to the posi tive advantage of agriculture, and that the general introduction of wire in stead of wood would effect a great ad ditional saving. Standard of Education. According to Buskin, an educated man ought to know these things: hirst, where he is—that is to say, what sort of a world he has got into ; how large it is, what kind of creatures live in it, and how ; what it is marie of, and what may be made of it. Secondly, where he ingoing—that is to say, what chan ces or reports there are of any other world beside this ; what seems to be the nature of that other world. Third ly, what he had best do under the cir cumstances —that is to say, what kind of faculties he possesses; what are the present state and wants of mankind ; what is his place in society ; and what are the readiest means in his power of attaining happiness and diffusing it- The marl who knows these things, and who has his will so subdued in the learning of them that he is ready to do what he knows he ought, is an ed - ucated man ; and the man who knows them not is nrneducated, though he would talk all the tongues of BabeL
