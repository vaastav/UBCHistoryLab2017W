The case of Wiley Morgan, charged with the murder of John Duncan, was called. Much Interest was manifested in this case'and a'number of witnesses were present, but an important witness on each side was absent. An agree ment between opposing counsel was reached that the case be continued for the term. It was stated by counsel (hat had the case been brought to tr'al on Monday, as the case was at first set, the trial coald have proceeded to a conclu sion, but during the continuance from day to day, in consequence ot the pro longed trial of the Copper Queen tax case, the two witnesses referred to had absented themselves. Morgan has been out under ball of 810,000 for some months. He was here yesterday, ac companied by his wife and four young children, one still an infant. The fam ily have the appearance of well-to-do ranchers. Morgan is said to have been In comfortable circumstances at the time of the killing of Duncan, but to hae become well nigh impoverished by the expense attending his attempt to tecure acquittal of the charge still pending against him. The cases of J. S. Williams et al. vs. Martin O'Hare, and Martin O'Hare vs. C. A. Overlook were continued for the term. The suit for divorce of George E. Talcott vs. Mary F. Talcott was dis missed on motion of plaintiff's attor ney. Case of Johnson A. Harrington vs. George Quinn was dismissed, defend ant paying accrued costs. Sidney Johnson, charged with rob bery, was placed on trial. O. Gibson having been appointed by the court to defend the alleged culprit. But little difficulty was experienced in securing a jury, which was an exceptionally in telligent one. Among them will be noticed several of our Bisbee friends. The list of the twelve men "good and true" is: Lewis Hunt, Charles H. Holtz, J. J. Brown,- R. I- Armstrong, Jesse Jackson. H. E. Gardner, C C. Finlayson, J. Jolly, W. E. Bailey. C. L. Blackburn, William Allison, James A. Lamb. Johnson is a mere boy in ap pearance. He claims to be but sixteen years of age, but looks older. He is by no means intelligent looking and was dressed poorly and far from neatly. He is charged with having been Impli cated in the hold-up of the Big Adobe saloon in Naco on the night of Jul 23d. He escaped at the time, as did the actual perpetrator of the bold-up. The latter has not yet been captured, but Johnson was rrested by Sheriff Parks of Graham county a few weeks ago. The boy was taKen to .naco ana made a written confession of his par ticipation in the hold-up, this confes sion being witnessed by Sheriff Lewis and Deputy Ells of Naco. W. A. White testified that on the night of the 23d of July last a masked man entered his saloon just as he was about to place the "bank" of themoote game into the safe. The money waa In a sack and placed temporarily on the railing near the safe while he was open ing the safe. The masked man had a pistol In bis right hand. Reaching out bis left band he grabbed the sack say ing, "111 take this." He then fired his pistol and backed out of the front door. O. L. Armstrong testified that in July he was employed on Ben. Franks' ranch, a few miles from Bisbee; that on or about the 24th of July last John ton came to the ranch in the evening and wanted to buy a saddle. Tbe'de- fendant bargained with one of the other men in the employ .of Franks for hi saddle, but did not take it then. The following morning Johnson re turned to the ranch and wanted he saddle he bad bargained for, bnt the owner then declined to sell. After, ward the prisoner bouitht say saddle and paid me one hundred adobe dollar for It a&u rode off. For the defease Mr. Glbtoa pat Johnson on the stand to testify on his own behalf. He tolcLbis story clearly and coherently with apparent truth fulness. He stated that his age was sixteen years; that he had been travel ing with a man in Mexico; that be had accompanied him to Naco; that he was a stranger In the country and looking for work; that he had ridden into Naco on the evening of the hold-up and had tied his horse to a wagon standing not far from the "Big Adobe" saloon; that late in the night he was look'ing for his traveling companion and meeting a Mexican be inquired of him as to the posaible whereabouts of his erstwhile companion. The Mexican replied that he had gone up to the big adobe saloon to "hold it up." Believing this proba ble I went after my horse fearing that my late companion would ride him off. Just as I had mounted my horse I heard shots audjmmediately after the robber came :ip with the bag of money in his hand. He mounted the horse behind me and ordered me under threats of bodily injury to "pull out across the line and to be quick about It " I did "pull out," and after trav eling about a mile and a half we stop ped and the robber gave me three hun dred adobe dollars as he said to pay for his ride and my Winchester rifle which he appropriated. Then we seperated and 1 have never seen him since. Be ing an utter stranger 'and having been for a time the companion of the robber I was afraid to stay in or immediately near rtaco, therefore I started for Clifton, and bought a. caddie for one hundred adobe dollars. When I was taken to Naco under arrest I was as sured of immunity from Imprisonment if I would confess. This assurance was given me by Officer Ells. The evi dence being closed Mr.Land addressed the jury briefly being evidently of the impression that the case was so plainly established that uo argument was nec essary. Mr. Gibson followed with a lengthy argument for the defendant and made out from the boy's own story a very strong plea for his acquittal. The jury retired under the charge of Bailiff James M. Johnson, and were out all night. FRIDAY'S PROCEEDINGS. The court was convened at 9.30 a. m. and the prisoners arraigned yesterday to plead to indictments were again ar raigned and pleas entered.
