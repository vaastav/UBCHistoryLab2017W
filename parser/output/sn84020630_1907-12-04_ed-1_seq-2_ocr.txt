The President's message read to Congress yesterday Is a state docu ment without frills. President Roose velt has grown beyond the rhetorical stage of his areer and while he has always managed to get to the heart of conditions he does so today much more directly than ho did in his earlier years. Maturity of judgment comes only through experience and this furnishes an unanswerable argument for giving so important an official as the President of the United States a longer 'tenure of office and why it would be well for the nation if Presi dent Rooevelt wore t" consent to serve another four years, even at a personal cacr fice. The financial situation being upper most in the minds of the people, the President naturally speaks of it first in his message. He lays clown the prop osition: "In no nation are the funda mental business conditions sounder than In ours at this very moment; and it is foolish, when such is the case, for people to hoard money instead of keep ing it In sound banks." This is langu age to restore confidence. However, the President does net abate one jot or tittle- from his announced policy of using the government machinery to prosecute the successfully dishonest and in this connection places the blame indiree'ly for the financial dis turbances upon the shoulders of this class. The message also points out the defects, and especially the insuffic iency, of the present currency system but urges no deflrit) system of reform except to state that greater elasticity is needed .that au emergency currency system should le provided, and that trust companies should have the same supervision as national banks. One gratifying condition is tho excellent condition of the National Treasury. The income of the nation during the paRt six years reached the enormous sum of $3,465,000,000, exceeding the expenditures by $190,000,000. For this reason, says the President, it will be unwise to make sweeping changes in the tariff. Despite often repeated reports to the contrary, Pres ident Roosevelt is sound on the Re publican tariff doctrine. He says: "This country is definitely committed (o the protective system and any ef fort to root it up could not but cause widespread Industrial disaster. There must always be as a minimum a tar iff which will not only allow for the collection of an ample revenue but which at least make good the differ ence in cost of production here and abroad; that is the difference in the labor cost here and abroad, for the well be ing of the wage-worker must ever be a cardinal point of American policy." That is a good platform upon which to go before the people next November. However, the President Is not averse to making such changes of obsolete schedules as will best serve the pur poses outlined above and he favors the removal of the tariff on wood pulp, in order to protect the American for ests which are being devastated In order to furnish material for paper making. Considerable space is devoted to a recommendation for the federal invest igation of railroad accidents, the con servation of our natural resources and the use of our inland waterways. On reclamation he says, that "Irrigation should be far more extensively devel oped than at present" and "the Feder al government should seriously de vote Itself to this task." He declares that the public land system "has large ly broken down when .applied to the dryer regions, of the Great Plains, the mountains, and much of the Pacific slope, where a farm of 1C0 acres is in adequate for self-support. The laws themselves are defective." Of special interest to New Mexico is the recom mendation of a leasing system to ap ply to the public range so as to permit fencing. He says: "Fencing is the only way by which to keep In check the owners of nomad flocks which roam hither and thither, utterly destroying the pastures and leaving a waste be hind so that their presence la Incom patible with the presence of homemak- ers. The existing fences are all Illegal those that are hurtful as well as those that are beneficial and must come down. But it is an outrage that the law should necessitate such action on the part of the administration." nation. The advice to preserve the forests is followed with a recommenda tion that the nation should also take care of Its fuel supply, especially the coal, oil and gas fields. The President urges the passage of laws to establish a postal banks sys tem and of an adequate parcels post system. In discussing postal affairs he also recommends that fourth class postmasters be placed under the civil service. Congress is urged to create a Bureau of Mining. In concluding, the Presi dent advises legislation to meet the needs of both Navy and Army. Upon the subject of statehood for New Mexico and Arizona, the message is silent, as had been foreshadowed. But, as the President has pledged him self to support New Mexico In its ef forts to attain statehood and has per mitted this pledge to bo made public, there was no necessity of incorporat ing such a recommendation in the message although to us In New Mexico it i3 not clear what harm would have been done, if the President, after speaking of the admission of Oklaho ma, had embodied a sentence advising that this Territory be made a state. While the Daily New Mexican, and undoubtedly many people In the South, west, will not say "Yea and Amen," to every word of the message, which covers C3 closely printed pages of book-size, especially when the Presi dent speaks of grazing, forestry and other essentially western topics, yet all in all, there is much to praise and much to support in the document and it is in every respect safe and sane and bound to inspire confidence not only at home, but also abroad. 

CURSE OF YELLOW JOURNALISM. Mistakes will happen in the best regulated families and very often in newspaper offices. Errors and mis tatements in the news are liable to occur and if commltteed unwittingly or because of mis-information, scarcity of facts or for similar reasons they should be condoned by the reading public. Otherwise this should not be the case. In yesterday's Issue of the Albuquerque Journal appeared a dis patch giving the news of the brutal murder of Miss Jennie Tcmpleton at Velarde Saturday last. The simple facts are atrocious and brutal and needed no coloring. Unfortunately the first news was very meager, and a mistake was made by this newspaper and others in good faith by designating the murdered woman as a Baptist mis sionary upon information received in a dispatch from Taos. This was not the case. The man who committed the foul crime claimed to have been drunk and made a full confession. Unfortunately for the good name of reasons they have for connecting him with the crime. "Suspicion points to Mexicans, as the murderers, for the reason that they have always opposed Christianizing or the Indians In that region. "Miss Templeton was working und er the direction of the Baptist mission ary board of New York City. "Her predecessor at the mission, Phoebe How:.rd, wa8 killed In a sim ilar manner at Embudo several years ago, and her slayers were never cap-tured." , A falsehood especially when couch ed in such sensational and high flown language is hard to catch and while 'the truthful version of the unfortunate and horrible affair when read by the people will convince them that the crime was one of those awful occur rences that happen too often for. the good of the country In large cities and for that matter in the country sections, yet the dissemination of dispatches like the above quoted 'from the Albu querque Journal', everi if i afterwards followed by the truth must and will count against New Mexico and its people as there are and always will be people who are more prone to believe evil than good and swallow fake stories easily and comfortably. Too much yellow journalism Is a curse, a great drawback In every re spect and subversive of good govern ment and against public policy. There are many correspondents and .newspa pers that will stretch out any news, especially criminal, of the muck-raking kind, of a scandalous character or that contains vicious, venomous and untruthful assaults upon public men, for the sake of the pay that the corre spondents receive or to increase circu lation of tho papers, or to make polit ical capital, or to get even for the low est and dirtiest motives. Part of this very bad and unsatisfactory condition in the matter of the publication of yel low sheets and yellow news must be placed upon the readers of these sheets who varaciously and gluttonous ly -devour anything and everything black on white that describes crime and criminals in red and flaring headlines, that brings to the surface the depravi ty and immorality of human nature, that assails and destroys the charact ers and' reputations unjustly and un fairly of men and women, and that reaks 'with fiendish tales of outrages, of murder, of burglary, of political dis honesty or corruption, and of heinous violations of the law and of the moral code. Legitimate and proper news of all occurrences is one thing and the publication of fakes, of lies, of libels, of prevarications of misstatements in yellow sheets is another thing. It is really indeed a great pity that these days there is too much of the lattei and that some of this nefarious faking is done at home and is wallowed In by a few dally and weekly yellow 'sheets in Albuquerque, in Roswell, in Santa Fe and in a few other small towns.
