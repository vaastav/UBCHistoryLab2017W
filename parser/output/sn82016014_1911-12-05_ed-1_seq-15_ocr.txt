Governor Stubbs was asked point blank today if he would call a special session of the lecismture nnrl bo r. i plied that he had not yet made up his I mind in the matter. He was informed that it had been reported that he had decided to issue the call for the special session about December 15. His reply! was characteristic. "This is the first I have heard of it," he said. But it is the general opinion that a I special session will be called this win ter. The idea is to pass a presidential primary law in the hope of taking the state away from Taft. The progres sives, many or mem, view the move with doubt and distrust. But, strange to relate, the regulars, who are sup posed to be for Taft and therefore I against a special session, are delighted with the idea. Regular members of the legislature look and act like men who carried spades and were making! ready to dig a grave. One of these is getting ready to come clear back here from California to help at the last obsequies. They promise a forty- day session, lots of fighting and more expense and little done and then the failing of a political star. "It would be worth all the trouble and expense, said a member of the legislature today. HE BEAT HIMSELF. Hyde's Lawyers Oppose Introduction of His Former Testimony. Kansas City, Mo., Dec. 5. Whether Dr. B. Clarke Hyde, charged with mur dering Colonel Thomas H. Swope, will take the stand in his own behalf at this trial of the case was the absorbing topic of comment at the hearing to day. A vigorous protest of the defense yesterday against the introduction of testimony given by the physician at the former trial brought up the discussion. Attorneys for Dr. Hyde refuse to say w hether he will stand by his constitu tional rights and refuse to testify. It is said on good authority that Dr. Hyue testified at his first trial against the wishes of his counsel. He was not permitted to take the stand until after his attorneys had tried -in vain in a conference that lasted practically throughout one night to dissuade him from his course. Jurors said after the former hearing that the accused phy sician convicted himself by his de meanor on the stand. He was very nervous and it was generally thought he failed in his effort to explain his cyanide purchases. Miss Elizabeth Gordon, a nurse, was on the stand when court convened to day. She occupied the chair practi cally all day. NOW IT'S MALT CREEK. Four Carloads of Beer Poured Into Cow Creek Today. Pittsburg, Kan., Dec. 5. Under the direction of W. E.
