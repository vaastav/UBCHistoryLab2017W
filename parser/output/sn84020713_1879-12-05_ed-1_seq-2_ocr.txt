The Democrat. CHAKLOTTE. N. C. DECEMBER 5, 18 7 9 Col. Johnston's Address. Below we make some extracts from an Agricul tural Address delivered at Wadesboro on the 20th of November, 1879, before the Dixie Agricultural Society, by Col. Win. Johnston of Charlotte : In the early historic periods of the world the prin cipal portion of its inhabitants were shepherds. They led a pastoral life. The population was then sparse, the earth yielded abundantly the grasses, and t his was the easiest mode of comfortable bubsistence. A pastoral vocation was the first elevation of our race from a savage condition, in which hunting and fishing were their chief occupations. Aa they pro gressed in pastoral pursuits, agriculture as a higher step in civilization soon came in vogue. Long be fore Cincinnatus that noblest old Roman farmer was called twice from the plow to the Dictator ship of the Empire to save hi country from inter nal strife and foreign enemies, agiiculture had be come the leading business of mankind. Its intro ductions was a great advance upwards in the pro gress of our race. It brought morals, culture and civilization with it. From nomadic and wander ing tribes it located mankind, organized societies, established government, made laws, encouraged education and advanced the civilization of the early ages. From the pristine days of our race, it ha3 contin ued to improve and develop the human family physically, morally and intellectually. It has be come the vocation of the civilized world. It is the Hinft (,ua non jf the aire, of organized society, of government, of civilization. To day it employs the physical and mental labor of more than half the civilized world. In the United States it gives labor and sustenance to two-thirds of all its population, and in North Carolina it eives labor and employ ment to probably more than three-fourths of all her people. It fells the forests, turns up the surface of the earth and makes it obedient to the wants and necessities of mankind. It is the only source of original production and wealth, except that of mininc? the metals and coals of the earth. It builds Towns. Cities. States and Governments, and main tiiins them in neace or war. It digs the Canalsand constructs the Kail roads. It plows the pathless waters with itsmenhantile ships and whitens every Sea and Ocean with their sails. Itbuilds the mighty naval armadas that lloat on the deep, and maintains Governments and Empires. Yet, with all its power and influence, it is the least aggressive of all the pursuits of mankind. It makes war upon no other legitimate calling, while it sustains all. From State or Government it has never asked undue protection, but is always moved bv conservative influences. In all aires and coun tries it has made the leading minds and great and oiiginal thinkers. On the quiet and secluded farm men are more tempted to read, think and reason than in the din of the shop or the hum and stir of the city. The latter may make more reidy, quick men, but not so profound. After becoming learned in art, science, philosophy or U tters, they generally remove from country to city life, where they can have greater access to books and apparatus than the farm affords. Hence a common, erroneous impres sion that irreat minds are generally born and raised in cities. The very reverse is true. Ths pursuit of agriculture not only tends to develop the physical iiml intellectual man, but to conserve and expand his moral and virtuous emotions more than that of any other vocation except that of the educator and the preacher of "Christ and Him crucified." Hence the more moral and religious communities are found in the rural districts. They are reared upon the farms, and there from early training and associa tions, led to study books and nature, and discipline their intellects to become the jrreat reasoners and thinkers of their age. Hut do not think I would underrate or depreciate the importance and value of other pursuits. Mm ing is the only ther original source of wealth. It brings from the surface and interior of the earth the coal. iron, jrold. silver, lead and other valuable min rials and metals, which in their crude and manu factured conditions enter into all the economica purposes of civilized society, and from them im mense values are created. l hen come the great manufacturing and mechanical pursuits. They take the original elements produced by the farmer and miner and give them immense values and add immeasurably to the wealth, comfort ond happi ness of mankind. 1 hen follows the great cominer rial interest, which gathers together the produc tions of the farmer, miner and manufacturer and distributes them throughout the civilized world and enables all to utalizc and enjoy them accord ing to their means and tastes. Then come the Min ister, the Educator, the Doctor, the Lawyer all in dispensahly necessary to constitute and maintain organized society and government in its purity i k-vaiing and enobling influences. Uut of all these great, vocalious of mankind, agriculture is not only the peir, but pre-eminent above all, as it virtually feeds, clothes and maintains all other?. It is, therefore, meet and proper that our farmers nhould have their Fairs and Festivals, compare views ami consult together for further improve ment and development, which always redounds to the public gcod. For the first six or eight j'ears s.f tcr the late war between the States, the high price of cotton, tobacco and naval stores absorbed the agricultural mind, energies and resources in the Southern Stales, the old methods were pursued and very little progress was made. After the decline in prices of these leading staples, a new departure had to be made, old nu t hods to a great degree had to be abandoned. 1 his has not been without its cones ponding benefits. Some compensation has been nalizcd. For in the la&t five years the opinion is entertained, that we have made more progress in TSorth Carolina than in anv ten years of our pre vious history. This is owing in some degree to deeper plowing, greatly improved agricultural lm plemeuts and supei ior breeds of horses, cows, sheep and hogs introduced into the country. In improved breeds oi cattle L abarrus county probably excel any portion of the State, while In all the stock of the farm Mecklenburg will vie with any county in the htate. in the successful culture of wheat Catawba leads any other county in North Carolina.- There are nearly two hundred Drills in the county, with these, alter thorough preparation of the soil, the wheat and fertilizers are applied in rows as regular ana systematically as in cotton planting. Expe nence has demonstrated that this mode of culture requires less of seed and manure, and produces more per acre than the old plan of sowing broad cast. ithm a few j'ears larger areas have been sown in the grass. The farmer fiirhts grass all Spring and Summer in his various crops, yet it is indispensible to the farm. By grass I include Clover, Pens, Orchard, Herds and other cultivated grasses useu ior siock. ah nesh is grass said the wise man of old. Philosophically it is true. All flesh comes from vegetable matter. In all the clay formations it is the basis of all successful farming. What is soil, that which imparts fertility to the land? It is the grass and other vegetable matter that grows on your fields and forests, shades them, retains the moisture andammonia.and by decomposition.forms the vegetable loam which makes your crops. With out grass you cannot successfully raise horses, cows sneep, uog9 or poultry. It is the cheapest subsis tcuce for all the farm stock, whether in a green or cureu siaie, wueiuer you turn it under as a green crop, use it in the stables or compost it, it is the uesianu mosi valuable oi all the fertilizers. Noth ing so effectually absorbs and holds the liquid and solid droppings of the stable and barn-yard. With out grass or vegetable matter you cannot maintain your lands in a high state of cultivation. The highest priced lands in our country are those where me grasses are cultivated with most care, and grow With mOSt luxuriance, as in Vironnin nn1 KVnhiAbr It is admitted that our lauds will not vie with these limestone regions. But you say our climate is too hot, will not grow grasses. This is a mistake. The l ea, L.ucerne, Orchard and other grasses flourish will in warm latitudes. But tic soil must be well prepared and plowed deep. In all middle North Carolina the grasses flourish under proper treat ment, and will yield more per acre, with the same culture than in New York, Pennsylvania and New England with their more barren soil, rocks, short Summers and cold long Winters. A wise Philoso pher has Slid that he was a benefactor to his race who caused two blades of grass to grow where only one grew before. It is also true, that with the same preparation and culture of the cereals, Middle and Western North Carolina will produce per acre of corn, wheat a mt other grains as much or more than Pennsylva- nia. New York, New Jersey, or any of the New J i England States. But we must prepare our news and fertilize them aa they do in the Eastern States, and our earth will yield forth abundantly. The sneaker went on to show that the culture of cotton, tobacco, and the products of the pine tree. was more profitable in me esuinauu ui me mmm than the cultivation of the grasses, grains, beef, perk, butter and cheese. The Nortli could not raise Southern staples ; while we could produce them, and nearly everything grown in tue isortu. Ours was a work of choice, theirs of necessity. If we had large populations and crowded cities, with their home markets, our prluctiens would be more varied and profitable. ; He then spoke of the importance ei more ni mu facturing establishments especially in cotton, iron and all agricultural implements and of diversified ndustries. The wonderful em cis ine manuiaciuru of tobacco has had m budding up in a lew years Winston, Durham and Retdsville; that Uichmonci, Dan villend Lynchburg owea ineir prosperny very largely to the manufacture of tobacco cities make markets forhe farmer ; mere labor was cheap ami abundant with us. But few races or people, if any. could successfully compete with it so well adapted to the cultivation of Southern crops, uur greater want was capital, and that within the reach or honest working men. The importance of education to every race and condition of life especially the farmer was demonstrated. The speaker then paid a tribute to our Constitu tion and Union, if they could be carried out as de signed by the framers. That sectionalism is bane ful "the policy ot hate is tue poncy oi uisumuii. That the South, rent and desolated by war, required above all things peace, law and order, to revive her great industries and restore thrift and prosper ity to all interests, impart value to property aim increase the wages of the laboring man. The coun try is fast recovering from its great depression. This lias been effected by the energy, industry and economy of its laboring classes producing and sell ing more than they buy tuus onnging g-.iu m me country, giving value to property anu increases wages to labor. Suppress sectionalism, stay un hand of further contraction of the currency, and the future appears to be auspicious to the "good old North State." . -b.b The Internal Revenue Service. The annual report of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue predicts that the re ceipts from internal revenue taxes will, dur ing the present fiscal year, reach the sum of 11 5,000,000. The great maionty of the tax-payers are reported as having observed the laws, and faithfully paid their taxes, and it is be lieved that in the greater portions of the cour.try violations of the internal revenue laws are as infrequent as can reasonably be expected. And in those districts where the laws have been for years openly vio lated, and the officers set at defiance, there is a returning sense of a majority of the people to the duty of tax-payers to observe the laws, and of the officers of the govern ment to enforce them. Tables embodied in the report show that during the last three years and four months 3,117 illicit distilleries have been seized, G,3G3 persons arrested for illicit distilling, and 27 officers and employes killed and 48 wounded while engaged in enforcing the in ternal revenue laws. These fact", coupled with others of a similar character, showing that nearly all seizures, arrests and resistance of authority are confined to the districts long infested with these troubles, the Commissioner says, "indicates unmistakably that much remains to be done to place the service upon a satis factory footing. This can only be done by constant, vigorous and courageous efforts of repression with such a force of deputies, armed when necessary, as will demonstrate the ability and determination of the tov eminent to collect its revenue and enforce its laws. And I deem it my duty to again call your attention to the fact that the ap propriations have been, and now are made quate to the proper enforcement of the laws." An appropriation of $100,000 as a deficiency is recommended for the present fiscal year for this service. During the year ending June 30, 1879 $113,449,621 of internal revenue taxes were colled ed and raid into the treasury. The quantity of spirits (71,892,621 gallons) pro duced and deposited in distillery ware houses during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1879, was greater than the quantity produced during any other year. ' Ine re ceiDts from distilled snirits amounted to $52,570,284.69, an increase of $2,149,468.89 over the preceding year. lhe total re ceints from fermented liquors amounted to $10,739,320.08, an increase over the pre ceding year ot $792,268.30. The increase of production of manufactured tobacco dur ing the last fiscal year was 12,026,821 pounds: of the number of cigars and ciga rettes 194.177.719. The total amount of collections from tobacco in all its forms, in eluding the internal revenue tax upon im ported tobacco, snuff and cigars, and the special taxes paid to manufacturers of and dealers in leaf and manufactured tobacco, for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1879, was $40,135,002.65. As compared with the total receipts from the same source for the preceding fiscal year, this shows an increase of $43,247.98. The total amount realized by the tax on the capital and deposits of banks and bank era during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1878, was $3,490,913, and for the fiscal year 1879 was $3,184,979, showing a decrease ol $305,934. A statement of the capital and deposits of savings banks and bankers other than national banks, shows an aggregate ol $195,290,513 invested in government bonds, against $158,882,800 reported last year. The total value of property seized during the year for violation of internal revenue laws was $524,146. The cost of collecting the Internal Reve nue is not in the abstract report, but it must be equal at least to one-halt the re ceipts. II proper economy was practiced the Government could dispense with taxes on home products like liquors and tobacco. SS? The Philadelphia Record, viewing the Presidential field, says: in re- "The attempt ot the Washington Post to get up a Seymour feeling has not been very sue cessful. All the Democrats entertain the highest possible regard for Mr Seymour. and would be exceedingly glad to support nun. ii ne was ten years younger than he is, and was willing to be a candidate, there would be little doubt of his nomination but, inasmuch as he absolutely declines to be a candidate, and inasmuch as it is well known that his health is so, feeble that he has been absolutely ordered by his physi cian to avoid excitement, and inasmuch as the attempt to force him to run without his consent would most probably result in end ing his life, sensible Democrats look upon the attempt to nominate him as merely a piece oi campaign talk, and hardly worth serious consideration." The President's Messasre. 0 7 Synojisis of President ILiya? Message de livered to Conrress on Monday; Dec. st 1879. The President, in his annual Message, says that the circumstances under which Congress assembles the large measure of prosperity which the country enjoys call for mutual congratulation and grateful ac knowledgement to the Giver of all .good. Qongresg is congratulated on the su-cesjful accomplishment of resumption. The de mand upou the treasury for -gold and silver in exchange for notes has been small ind the voluntary deposit of gold and bullion for these has been large. The excess of metals deposited for no. e.- ovt r the amount of these redeemed is about $40,000,000. The revival in buitiess is ascribed to re sumption, and the amount of the balance of trade in our favor July 1st to November 15th n. placed at $59,O00,0CO. lhe public credit has improved, tht 4 per Ctnt bonds tave been sold at and above par, raising a fund sufficient to pay off all the rsational debt redeemable under present laws. The amount of interest saved annually by the refunding process since March I, 1877, is $14,297,177. The amount of the National lebt which matures within less than two years is $792,12 1,700, of which $500,000,000 bear interest at the rate of five per cent, and t he balance is in bonds bearing six per cent interest. It is b.lieved that this part of the public debt can be refunded by tha issue of four per cent bonds, and, by the re duction of interest which will thus be ef fected, about eleven millions of dollars can be annually saved to the treasury. To se cure this important reduction of interest to be paid by the United States, further legis- ation is i- quired, which, it is hoped, will be provided by Congress during its ptestnt session. rhe coinage of gold by the mints of the United States, during the last fiscal year, was $40,986,912. The coinage of siher dollars, s-ince the passage of the act for that purpose, up to xSov. 1, 1S79, was $45,000,- 850, of w hich $12,700,344 have been issued from the Treasury and are now in circu lation, and $32,300,506 are still in the ros- e?sion of the Government. Further experiments with the coinage, it s advised, had best be postponed until after the meeting of the Monetary Con gress, but the suspeiwon of the coinage of tiie silver dollar upon the present legal ratio is advised. Coined without limit, side by side, silver, it is maintained, will soon become the only standard of value, on the principle that the market value of sil ver is uniformly below that of gold. What is wanted is a currency of gold and silver, each of equal value. The President takes the ground that as it is only in time of war or other pressing emergency that the issue of notes, the worth of which is fixed wholly by the Government, is authorized, and that as no such emergency now exists, the cir- dilating notes, i e., the greenbacks, should now De retired in some manner wisely cai . . . . . . . . ciliated to forefend any disturbance of the present financial equilibrium. He also ar gues that, as it has been the policy of the Government ever since the adoption of the Constitution to nay off all debts as Foon after they are incurred as possible, a sink ing fund should now be provided or the existing laws relating to t hat fund amended so as to fix a limit specified and distinct within which the present public debt shall be paid. He then recommends that if the revenues of the government shall not be sufficient to provide necessary funds to meet the demand of such a policy, a tariff should be placed on tea and coliee, as that tax could be conveniently levied, and would be less felt by the people than any other. The continued practice of polygamy in Utah, the President urges, demands atten tion at the hands of every department ol the Government. Those practicing poly gamy should be prosecuted and punished. This Territory has now sufficient popula tion to entitle it to representation as State, but this change of its condition can not be allowed until its citizens abandon a practice which civilized communities recog nize as criminal. The plea that polygamy is a right guaranteed under the law grant ing religious liberty to all people, no longer holds good in the lace of the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States that the regulation of the system of marriage which now obtains in Utah is within the legislative power of Congress. The law which has been for seventeen years a dead letter, but which, under this recent decision, is made alive, should be vigorously en forced, and if necessary the enjoyment of the rights of citizenship should be withheld from the polygamists who continue to vio late the law of the United States making the practice of their peculiar doctrines criminal. The recent elections have shown to th President the purpose of the people to see all sections secure in the enjoyment of their personal and political rights, and he be heves that "the power ot public opinion will override all political prejudices, and all sectional and State attachments, in de manding that all over our wide territory the name and character of citizens of the United States shall mean one and the same thing, and carry with them unchallenged security and respect. He believes that when the public mind is set at rest upon the subject of popular rights, pacification o the whole country will come. Considerable space is devoted to civi service reform, and the President dwells upon the evils and perils of the partisan spoils system of appointment to office, He maintains that political considerations should not enter into appointments; that the capacity of men and regard for the public interest should alone control, and a system which would change public officers with every election, only on politica grounds, is nighty miscinevous. i ne sys tern of assessing office-holders is also de nounced. It is maintained that office-holders should feel at perfect liberty to give or not to give to political campaign funds He is opposed to any system of appoint ment or tenure which would make the office holder a mere servant of the party which gave him office, and discourages the idea of these giving unduly of their time to parti san politics. In discussing this subject the President recommends to Congress the re vival of the Civil Service Commission, which was in existence several years ago for the purpose of examining and enquiring into the capacity of applicants for offices within the gift of the Government. Our relations with foreign countries, it is observed, have continued peaceful. Refer ence is made to the unsettled condition of the questions at issue between America and Great Britain with reference to the fisheries, but no congressional action is suggested in the premises. It is suggested that an appropriation be made to have .the Uuited States , ivpre-. sented at the exhibition at Melbourn, Aus tralia, next year. Questions of difference with Spain have been settled. The East Florida claims are again in dispute. A treaty with the Neth erlands has been signed and ratified. Ques tions of difference with Switzerland in re lation to pauper and convict emigrants, are in process of settlement. The government of China has signified its willingness to consider the question the emigration ot its subjects to the United States with a dispassionate fairness, and to co-operate in such measures as may tend to prevept injurious consequences to the Uni ted stales, lhe negotiations are still pro ceeding, and will be pressed with diligence. Mexican raids and depredations have greatly decreased. The third instalment of the award against Mexico has been paid. rso other facts of interest in regard to rela tions between this and other countries are mentioned, but it is regarded as a fit sub ject for congratulation, that there isagrati ying increase of trade with nearly all li.u roDean and American countries. Referring to the condition of affairs in Alaska, he alludes to the fortuitous appear ance and interference of the British vessel Osprey at Sitka, during the troubles in that vicinity last Spring, and then recom menus the immediate establishment oi a territorial judiciary in Alaska. The rea sons advanced to support this suggestior are, in effect, that the interests of economy will be served by prompt trials of offenders against the laws ot the United States, in the Territory where the crimes may be committed. Under the present system prisoners and witnesses are transported at great expense to Oregon and California, where such trials are now held. 1 he l' resident directs an en i ion to the which shows, among other things, that the ordinary revenues from all sources for the fiscal year ended June 30, IS 9, were $273, 827,184.46: the ordinary expenditures for llm Knmo iuiMrl u-uro &Ofift OJ. 7 QOQ SQ . leaving a surplus revenue for the year of $6,879,300.93. The receipts for the present fiscal year ending June 30th, 1880, actual and estimated, are $288,000,000: exnendi lures, actual ana estimated, ior the same ' m ' M. period, $278,01)7,304.39, leaving a surplus oi $y,uo,byo.ui. ine arrearages oi pen sions for the last and current year, amount ing to $21,747,249.60, have been substan tially paid, and it is believed that, this drain having been stopped, the sinking fund can henceforth be maintained without any change of the existing law. The Presi dent traces the reports of the Secretaries of the Treasury, of War, of the Navy of the Interior, of the Postmaster-General and of the Commisioner of Indian Affairs, con curring in the main in their recommenda tions to Congress. As a member of the Washington Monument commission he ad vises tne appropriation ot a surncient sum and the change ot existing laws to permit the completion of the monument at an early date, Referring to the deficiency which exists in the appropriation for the Department of Justice, he points out the necessity of an immediate appropriation for the payment of accrued dues and fees of United States Marshals arising from the failure of Con gress to provide at the late extra session for their payment under the usual proces Referring to the fact that the business of the Supreme Court is now largely in arrears, and that there is no prospect of the Jus tices getting even with their work, the President recommends the establishment of an intermediate Court of errors and ap peals, to the end that accumulated business may be taken on the dockets of the Su preme Court. Regarding the Indians, the President, while deploring the recent outbreaks, is sat isfied that the general good behavior of the tribes sustains the opinions of those who believe that humane treatment will j'et in duce them to abandon their savage modes of life. He recommends the enactment of a law enabling the Government to give the Indians a title in fee, inalienable for 25 years, to the farm lands assigned to them by assortment. He says the Indian schools in v irgmia ana x ennsyivania nave neen productive of good results, and the success of these has led to arrangements for the ! . .1 y TT esiaousnment oi anoiner in Oregon, ne discourages a renewal of the discussions re' garding the transfer of the Indian bureau to the War Department, as that discussion always serves to hamper the officials of the Indian bureau in pending operations and negotiations, and produces no correspond ing good. The discussion of the question of depre dations upon the timber lands is not of general public concern. He commends highly the objects of the Agricultural Department, and recommends that its facilities be enlarged. He says the omission to render such aid is not wise economy; but, on the contrary, undoubted' ly results in losses of immense sums an nually that might be saved through well directed efforts by the Government to pro mote this vital interest. The President is gratified to know ot ihe extent to which educational privileges throughout the United States have ad vanced during the year, and commends to the consideration of Congress the whole question of popular education. Considerable attention is paid to the af fairs of the District of Columbia. It is re commended that Congress look more closely to the care of its streets, to the educational wants of the District, and that the flats in front of the city of Washington be filled ; not only that this will add to the adjacent parks and lands, but to . the end that the permanent improvement of the river for purposes of navigation may be secured. The above comprises the main points of the message, which is longer (or more wordy) than any of the previous messages of Mr Hayes.
