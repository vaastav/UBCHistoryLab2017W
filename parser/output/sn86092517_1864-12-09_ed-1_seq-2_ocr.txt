Tbe Mcssiige. - If the President's messago has no other in erit, it ha9 that of brevity. It is en* braced io fewer newspaper columns than any mes^ag" of any of the later Presidents. The President demonstrates, to his own satisfaction, that, so little have the ro sources of tbe country, in men and money, been affected by the war, the contest can be continued indefinitely. He consequently adheres to politics by which the contest will be indefinite. It is a profound principle in political economy, announced by tbe President, that "men readily perceive that they cannot be much oppressed by a debt which they owe [to] themselves." Such a debt is tbe re* source upen which tbe President relies to continue the war indefinitely. Tue President is speeions in his state ment of the terms of peacA. "The insur gents can," he says, ' at My moment have peace simply by laying down their arms and submitting to the nationalauthority, unyer the constitution." But, he adds, ''ifquea tions ahoold remain, we wnul4 adjust them by the pacific means of legislation, oonfei> cnce, courts and votes, operating only in constitutional and lawful channels." It is precisely these questions which would re., main that are the obstacles to the Uying down of their arms by the insurgents. The emancipation proclamation remfrinsj the President avows his determination to ad* | here to it, and be recommend^ an amend ment of the constitution which would make that proclamation effective as a civil meas ure Confiscation remains, end how can the insurgents know, l?fore laying down their arms, how much of it will be adhered to and how much abandoned? A radical raajoiity in Congress remains, whose avowed j policy is, in any event, to permit the in* surgent states to return only upon pre. scribed conditions other than those of aim ply laying down their arms and submitting k i to the national authority. All these and all the other radical abolition policies re? main, to b5 settled, as the President says, "by legislation, conference, courts and v>tes," in all of which the South would.be powerless. As things stand, submission by tue South to what the President calls tbe natioual authority would bo simp.y sub mission to the power of radical abolition f ism. T We are disappointed in tbe message, al. though perhaps wo ought not to be. We had hoped that the Piesident would provide a way, so far as in bim lies, by which the Southern people could be detacoed from lli? rebel leaders. We had hoped that he would open a door through which thu Southern peoplo would dare to paM, in tbe belief that within it tbey would hnd the Uuion "as it was," and not, as the aboli tion fanatics say, " as it ought to be.1' We had hoped, at th? very least, that there would be some perceptible relaxation of those policies which have united the South- j cm people as ona desperate man in the 1'iaintenance of the rebellion, and which have made readjustment by peaceful mean* impossible. The war, then, is to go on indefinitely Mr Lincoln brieves in the power of tbe north to carry it on indefinitelv. and every sens>^ ble man knows that it will be indefinite nn der the abolition policies. Under these pol? wies, th* destruction of the rebel armies would not close the war. The federal gov ernment would still hold and exercise ju?. risdicticn over just so much territory as its armies should actually occupy, and no mere ; and its armies of occupation would have to be quite as large as its armies of invasion have been. Witness, in demon stration, Missouri, Arkans?s, Tennessee and Louisiana to-day. \\ e arise from the perusal ot this mcs srge with intense pain. It is as defective iu its views of th't relations of tinartce to the war, and of the general principles of po litical economy, as it is mistaken in its treatment of the rebellion, and, under tbe weight of all this load of err.r, the coun* try must rapidly sink to tbat condition ol Financial and social disorder the occurrence of which is only a question of time. Radicalism Jubilant. The Cincinnati Gazette's Washington City special, under date of the 6th inst , stated that "Radicalism at the Capitol is jubilant.5' The cause for this jubriarjt feeling was the appointment of Chase as Chief Justice of ibe United States, and the decided true of the President's message. When Radical i. mbas cause for rejoicing, Conservatism ? narTgfMffeme mortificaitoa AaTj?j? iotmeot 4fed thia message wf% * nu tted ly cause J itt.

AN uiost from the c^menceaaent of this un ft Slbuate war, the policy adopted, from tftnfe to time, and 'now maintained by the Administration, baa been to unite the South more closely io their determination to proa* ecute the rebellion until such time as they ahall^fetefetleir independence. Chase's appointment as Chief i Justice, and the President's renewed determination to pros* ecute the war until slavery shall have been abolished, give strength and solidity to the rebellion, and because do this, conser* | vative people have oause for poignant tnor* tification. " Rebel News. (From "Druids" Letwr to the N Y. World*) 

EARLY BSD MORE TR60PS THAN HE REQUIRED. It requires the exercise of great general ship, on the part of th^ir nrlitary leaders, to accomplish the results which they seek to bring about, with the really, compara tively, small armies that they bave in the field. They Lave, in a word, no troops to spare. The rebel leaders bave certain de signs which they wish General Early to accomplish in tha valley; and on the line of the upper Potomac this winter, 18,000 troops are not required to accomplish these results. They can be accomplished, the rebel leaders think, with even less than 15.000, The recent capture of the strongly I fortifled-positions of New Creek and Pied j mont, and the destruction of the forts, re doubts, outworks, and pablic property | there* was accomplished by a force of not i over 1,500 men. although they were so dis posed that there seemeu to be 3.000. Now in the light of this affair at Piedmont, let I aoy reasonable man say what a force of 3,000. cavalry, supported by 6,000 infantry , with a few batteries of light artillery, is capable of doing. , \ , , TEN THOUSAND TROOPS ENOUGH FOR 1 HE VALLEY. | They could reach the Potomac at some i point near Cumberland, and be in Pennsyl | vauia before the movement could be stop I ped; perhaps before it could be discovered. The rebels who capttffed New Creek were certainly there before it was known that they had left their camp; and they had done their work and vanished, before aoy pursuit was organized to head them off.? - Once in Pennsylvania, or even In Maryland, a foree of this kind could create as much alarm and consternation as Early did last July, when he laid seige to Washington.? Is it doubted tbat such a movement could be made as a surprise? Wby then, was Rosser's late movement t? New Greek net discovered in time to be checked? Rosser's cavalry left Early's camp for New Creek, iu broad day light, although under the cov er of a fog. This movement could be com me need uader cever of a dark nigh^. I TEN THOUSAND MORE OF EARLY'S TROOPS SENT TO RICHMOND. I do not know whether these considera tions bave presented themselves to the minds of the rebel leaders, or not. What I do know is, that since the 25 tb of No* veraber, nearly, if not quite, ten thousand more of Early's troops, in regimental or* ganizations, bave arrived at Richmond from the valley; so that all the troops Early has now left in the Valley is About eight thou sand, or possibly ten thousand man, of whom tbree thousand or four thousand are cavalry. Where did I got this information? From the rebel sympathisers In Baltimore, tho American would say. But would the rebel sympathisers in Baltimore tell me what would be of direct injury to their cause? WojU they tell me, for nothing, what the War Department- ought to be williug to pay a good round sum to learn, and what, I will veuture to say, General Sheridan does not know now? Be that aa it may, the facts are as I have stated. The 10,000 troops last sent away were not wanted in the valley. They xotrt wanted at Richmond. What General Early is exj pected to do with his 8,000 or 9,000 troops, 1 do not know. I know that New Creek and Piedmont were captured by a part of them; and that expedition, daring and sue* cessful as it was, was probably undertaken in order to convey the idea that Early's force was still 15,000 strong. EARLY WILL CONTINUE TO HOLD THE VAL LEY. I .^in tell, however, what Early will not do. He will not leave the valley, and Lynchburg will Dot be left uncovered. He will continue to cover Lynchburg and Gor donsville; he will continue to hold the val ley; he will oontinue to threaten at least tho Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and the line of the upper Potomac. H?? may do more; these things ho will certaioly do. ? The rebel leaders seem to think that 8,000 of 9,000 troops are enough for these pur pose*, but if more are required, more will be sent to him. HOW THE RKBELS ARE EVACUATING RICH MOND. Your readers, of course, will not believe for a nroment the reports that are preva leut here, and tbat may reach Now York, that the rebels are making active prepara tions to evacuate Petersburg and Richmond that they are preparing to abandon the \vlu>le of Viirgfu'a; indeed, that they have already begun to evacuate Richmond. The foundation upoK 'which all these reports are bosed is the simple fact that a large number of rebel troops are known to bave left Richmond for the west. That fact is undoubted. But they were sent away for ? the same reason that the lastlO.GOO troops ! were brought away from the Valley, They : were not needed on the lines of Petersburg j and Richmond? they were needed in Geor i cia, and to Georgia they have been sent, i as regards the number so sent there is , It's* certainty. My information places it at 15,000 or 20 000. and among them some : b igaden lrom Ewoll's corps, and some I from that of General Hill. Your readers will remember that Qcn. Lee received a | very strong accessi -a to hia army during j the months of September an October, in 1 tbe shape of some 25.000 new recruits, and : that he has been joined since the 18th ult. 1 i by i 5 000 troops from tbe valley. This would mane his whole fnrco at Petersburg and Richmond 95,000 atroDg; and if ho baa sent ?0,000 meo to Georgia, he ?till j lias for the defense of the two oitiee 75, 0U> troops. There is not an intelligent oft ftoqr in General Grant's army who believes tSathe has lass than that, * TBLK SALTATION OF RICHMOYD DCPCNM ON TKK DEFEAT OF 9HKBM AN. _ My information in regard to what the confederate leaders ezpe t of General Ofant'a army is this: They expect an at tack on Richmond, bnt that it will not be made till General Shermpa is ll a position to co-operate with Grant; and not at all, unless Sherman's army, in an effisetive con dition, does resch some point where it can co-operate with Grant. Everything, now. therefore, according to their view of the subject, depends upon General Sherman. If tbey can defeat him, or cripple bie army beforo he reaches the sea, they feel sure that no general ssssult upon their lines at Richmond will be made by General Grant. To defeat General Sherman, therefore, ?r to cripple bis army, is the great work which the confederate leader^ are striving to ao? accomplish. The papers of this morning state that General Grant has mada a re connoissance to Stoney creek station, to ascertain whether General Lee wss send> ing off troops on the Weldon railroad ? There mnst be some mistake about the ob ject of that reconnoiaaance. The troops were sent to Georgia from Richmond, on the Danville railroad, by way of Burke9 Til le; and even if any were sent direct from Petersburg, tbey would go thence on the Lynchburg railroad to Burkmille, and thence to Danville and Columbia. Druid. Latest from Brazil, The Seizure of the Florida ? The Ports of the Empire Closed against the Wachuselt ? Reports of the Brazillian Commander at Bahia. By the brig Balma we have dates from Pornambuco up to the 29th of October. There it nothing new from Rio in regard to the capture of the Florid*, and the Per^ nambuco papers only contain copies of the order issued by government, that all the ports of the country be shut against the Wachusett for the violation, by its captain, of the neutral laws of Bahia. The papers also contiin copies of the reports made by Captain Mancebo, the officer who was in command of the Brazil.* ian naval force at Bahia, at the time of the capture, and of Lieutenant Yarella, who was sent by him in a boai to order Captain Collins to desist from acts of hostility. In the reports both these officers declare that Captain Collins gave his word that be would "do nothing more." THE WAR STEAMER IROQUOIS IN PERNAMSUCO. The Journal de Recifo of Octobcr 21 states that yesterday the United States steamer Iroquois, commander Rodgers, came into port. It anchored in the Lama ramo, and fired a salute, which was return ed by Fort Brum. The crew of this vessel were not aware of what had already taken place lately at Bahia, and appeared to be grieved wl.cn th sf heard of the unworthy conduct of their companions in arm*, a conduct that they were unanimous in disapproving, not so much on account of the poltroon ry of the act as for the disrespect to our power. ? ? ^ The Cabinet.

A London letter says that the Rebel Gov emment has concluded a contract with an eminent English firm for tbe immediate supply of two hundred and fifty thousand Enfield rifles for the use of the rebel arm/. Each gun is to be paid for with a fixed quan tity of cotton, valued at a stipulated price, averaged on a gold basis. The English tra ders are to uudertake the cost and risk of I transportation and delivery, and hope to re ceive a sum equal to ten million dollars in gold, which they think will leave an ample | margin of profits.
