Little Hut Routine liilne Looked For Before tho llolltlay The Hnvision or tbe Rules tho Subject of Muin Importance The Committees, Flo. Washington, Dee. 12. Only routino work, of minor importance, is likely to be done in Congress this weak. When the House convenes at noon to-duy, somo more propositions on the subject of rules are expected, as almost every member has a suggestion in this line, but no act ual business can be done. Spenker Carlisle, in all probability, will announce the standing committee on rules, and the House will adjourn ovor to about Thurs day, to give the committee opportunity to take into consideration tho multitude of suggestion there have already been made on the .subject of the permanent rules. Tbe committee in tho Inst Congress consisted of . the Speakor and Messrs. Randall, Morrison, Reed and Hiscock. As Messrs. Morrison and Hiscock a Democrat and Repub lican have dropped out of tho House, nt least two new members will be named ou the committee. Mr. Mills, of Texas, will in all probability bo chosen to succeed Mr. Morrison, and eithor Mr. Brown, of In diaua, or Mr. Cannon, of Illinois, will, it is thought, succeed Mr. Hiscock. It is be lieved tbe committee on rules will be ready to report back to the House by Thursday, and that the dobntj upon the report may occupy tho remainder of the week, as the question is, in all its bear ings, one of the most far-reaching that will come beforo the House. If wisdom Is shown in the formation of tho rules, much more may be dono than will bo possible where laxity in the work is displayed. rie proposition to compel the committee on appropriations to report all of its bills within sixty days after the committee is announced meets the approval of the great majority of the IIouso, but will bo fought by members of the committea as long as possible, as the latitude as well as the power of tho committoe in controling legislation has heretofore been almost un limited. Tbe Speaker Is not expected to announce tbe full list of standing committees before Tuesday or Wednesday of noxt week, if at all before the holidays. The holiday adjournment will probably be taken about Wednesday or Thursday of next week, December 21 or 22, and if tho com mittees are to be announced before the holidays thov may be made known in time for a call of tbe States and Territories for the Introduction of bills. This work would take more than a day. In tho Senate the standing committees are to be announced to-day, und timu and opportunity given for the Introduction of bills. There will be several secret ses sions this week for the reference ot nomi nations to committees. It is ntit believed that action will be taken upon the nomi nations of Messrs. Lamar, Dickinson, and Vilas this week. As announced Inst week by Chairman Hoar, the committee on privileges and elections will go at once to work upon the Lucas-Faulkner contested election case from AV'est Virginia, and there are those who believe that a report will be made by the middle of the week, and that some time will bo taken up in discuss'ng it. The real work in Congress will begin early in January, when it re convenes after the holiday recess. FRANCE'S LATEST. The Attempted Assassination ot M. Jules Ferry His Assallunt An Unheeded Warning; M. Ferry' Condition. London, Dec. 12. From information re ceived from Paris yesterday it appears that Aubertin, alias Porckheim, the as sailant of Jules Ferry, has long borne the reputation of being a dissoluto fellow whose innate depravity rendered bun capable of almost any reprehensible act. He has lately lived with a young woman named ,Crangier, and it is learned that just previous to his attempt to kill M. Ferry he wrote to her stating his inten tion and advising her, in the event of his successful accomplishment of his murder ous purpose, to leave Franco and take refuge with certain of her friends residing in England where he would join her. Aubertin maintains a doggod demeanor, refusing to answer questions and mani festing no desire to ask any. His assault upon M. Ferry has had the effect to com pletely open the breech between the Rad icals and tbe Conservatives which was already painfully noticeable. The Con servatives are extremely bitter against the Radicals, and ascribe Saturday's scene m the lobby of the Cbnmbef of Deputies to tho daily exhibi tion of venom on tho part of the Intvan sigeant and tbe Cri du rcvple, which has gradually inflamed the passions of the Reds until weak-minded and!irresponsiblo persons have been transformed from harmless imbeciles into murderers. One thing U absolutely certain, and that is that tho combination of Republican groups which elected M. Carnot to the presidency and for a few days promised to endure, at least until tho new govern ment should get a good statt, is hope lessly disintegrated, and tho chances are that mere serious trouble than has yet oc curred will ensue. Paris, Dec. 12. An usher warned M. Ferry not tg see Aubertin. not liking tbe man's appearance, but M. Ferry, w ho was conversing with friend, did not heed the warning- He was shot while reading a letter under seal. Tho card. sent in to M. Ferry by Aubertin contained a favorable recommendation of Aubertin toM. Ferry's attention, and the name of Edouard Ilerel Harve. M. Herve is very indignant at tbe use of bis name. Aubertin is inipe cunioun and bad been endeavoring to borrow money with which to go to Versailles during the sitting of Congress, intending to shoot M. Ferry if he were elected President. Aubertin lived iu a garret in the Palais Royal with au elderly weman who bad sunk her fortune iu try ing to carry out schemes ot his. His father committed suicide owing to busi ness troubles. He has bewi regarded as a dangerous lunatic by those who knew him. Paris, Dec. 12. At midnight the condi tion of M. Ferry was los favorable than it bad beu throughout the day and even ing, owing in a great measure to ths fatigue and excitement of tho dav inci dent to receiving a large number of callers, etc. His febrile symptoms ;hav Try much increased.
