Washington, Dec. 3. The president In his annual message to congress says: The congress assembles this year un der the shadow of a great calamity. On the Uth of September President Mo Klnley was shot by an anarchist while attending the Pan-American exposi tion at Ituffalo and died lu that city on the 1 ItU of that month. Of the last seven elected presidents he Is the third who has been murdered, nnd the bare recital of this fact Is FuhVicnt to Justify grave alarm among all loyal American citizens. Moreover, the circumstances of this, the third as sassination of an American president, have a peculiarly sinister significance. Both President Lincoln and President Garfield were killed by assassins of types unfortunately not uncommon In history, President Lincoln falling a victim to the terrible passions aroused by four years of civil war and Presi dent Garfield to the revengeful vanity of a disappointed office seeker. Presi dent McKinley was killed by an utter ly depraved criminal belonging to that body of criminals who object to all governments, good and bad ulike, who are against any form of popular lib erty if It Is guaranteed by even the most just nnd liberal laws and who are as hostile to the upright exponent of a free people's sober will as to the tyrannical and Irresponsible despot. Anarchy nnd Annrrhlata. The president continues with a eulosy of Mr. McKinley. then turns to the subject of anarchy, denouncing Its doctrines and preachers. He says: I earnestly recommend to thecongress that In tke exercise of its wise discre tion It should take Into consideration the coming to this country of anarch ists or persons professing principles hostile to all government and justify ing the murder of those placed iu au thority. Such Individuals ns those who not long ago gathered In open meeting to glorify the murder of King Hum bert of Italy penetrate a crime, and the law should insure their rigorous punishment. They and those like them should be kept out of this country, and If found here they should be promptly deported to the country whence they came, nnd farreaeulng provision should be made for the punishment of those who stay. No matter calls more urgently for the wisest thought of the congress. A Subject For Federal Conrta. The federal courts should be given Jurisdiction over any man who kills or attempts to kill the president or any man who by the constitution or by law Is in lino of succession for the presidency, while the punishment for an unsuccessful attempt should be pro portioned to the enormity of the of fense against our institutions. Anarchy Is a crime against the whole fcuman race, and all mankind should band against the anarchist. The president next considers busi ness conditions, which he finds highly satisfactory. lie continues: Tte tremendous and highly complex industrial development which went on with ever accelerated rapidity during the latter half of the nineteenth cen tury brings us face to face at the be ginning of the twentieth with very ecrious social problems. The old laws and the old customs which had almost the binding force of law were once quite sufficient to regulate th ac cumulation and distribution of wealth Since the Industrial changes which have so enormously Increased the pro ductive power of mankind they are no longer sufficient. Trade Combinations. The growth of cities has gone on be yond comparison faster thun tb growth of the country, and the up-! building of the great industrial centers has meant a startling increase not merely In the aggregate of wealth, but in the number of very large individual and especially of very large corporate fortunes. The creation of these great corporate fortunes has not been due to the tariff nor to any other govern- mental actlou, but to natural causea in the business world, operating in oth- ar countries as In our own. The process has aroused much an- tagonlsm, a great part of which Is wholly without warrant. It Is not true that as the rich have grown richer the poor have grown poorer. On the con- trtu-y, never before has the average man, the wageworucr, the farmer, the small trader, been so well off as In this country and at the present time. There have been abuses connected with the accumulation of wealth, yet It retnalni true that u fortune accumulated in l?!tinintp tmslnpM run ! ncrunuilnt eil liy the pj-on pociall.v liotipfitod only on cinulitlnn of rimfi-rritiK im nifiiso InrlJpntfll bonpfits upon oth- Sucn'SMfiil onttTprisp of tlio typ m ti t nil inn tk inl can only io 4militln ilro suoli ns tc offrr LTcat prizes as the rewards of

The fumlanieiital rule In our national life the rule which un derlie nil others- Is that, on the whole and in the lotii; run, we tdiull go up or down together. The mechanism of modern business Is o delicate that extreme enre must he taken not to interfere with it ill a spirit of rashness or lutior.ince. In dealing with business Interests, for the government to undertake by crude and 1!1 considered legislation to do what may turn out to be bad. would te to Incur the risk of mich fan-each- Ins national disaster that It would be prefer-iblo to undertake nothing r.t nil. The men who demand tlio Impossible or the undesirable serve ns the ullies of the forces with which they nre nom inally nt war. for they hamper those who would endeavor to tind out in ra tional fashion what the wrongs really ure and to what extent and In what manner it is practicable to upp'.y reme dies. How to Correct th F.vlla. All this Is true, nnd yet it Is also true that there are real nnd grave evils, one of the chief lH-ing ovcrcapitalii tlon became of its many baleful con seipieiices. and a resolute nnd practical effort must be made to correct these evils. It Is r.o limitation upon property rights or freedom of contract to re quite that when men receive from gov ernment the privilege of doing busi ness under corporate form, which frees theu from individual responsibility and enables them to call into their en terprises the capital of the public, they shall do so upon absolutely truthful representations as to the value of the property lu which the capital Is to be Invested. Corporations engaged iu In terstate commerce should be regulated if they nre found to exercise a license working to the public Injury. It should be as much the aim of those who seek for social betterment to rid the busi ness world of crimes of cunning ns to rid the entire body politic of crimes of violence. Great corporations exist only because they are created and safe guarded by our Institutions, and It Is therefore our right and our duty to see that they work In harmony with these institutions. rnhllcltr the Firat Kaarnllal. The first essential lu determining how to deal with the great industrial combinations Is knowledge of the facts publicity. In the Interest of the pub lie the government should have the right to Inspect and examine the work ings of the great corporations engaged In Interstate business. 1'ublicity is the only sure remedy which we enn now invoke. What further remedies are needed in the way of governmental regulation or taxation enn only be de termined after publicity ha,s been ob tained by process of law and In the course of administration. The first requisite is knowledge, full and com pleteknowledge which may be made public to the world. Artificial bodies, such as corporations and Joint stock or other associations, depending upon any statutory law for their existence or privileges should be subject to proper governmental super vision, and full nnd accurate informa tion as to their operations should be made public regularly at reasonable Intervals. The large corporations, commonly called trusts, though organized iu one state, always do business In many states, often doing very little business in the state where they nre incorpo rated. There is utter lack of uniform ity iu the state laws about them, and, as no state has any exclusive interest In or power over their acts. It has In practice proved impossible to get ade quate regulation through state action. Therefore, In the Interest of the whole people, the nation should, without In terferinsr with the power of the states in the matter itself, also assume power of srpervision and regulation over all corporations doing an interstate busi ness. Auicud Constitution if ei-earf. When the constitution was adopted, at the end of the eighteenth century, no human wisdom could foretell the sweeping changes, alike In Industrial and political conditions, which were to take place by the beginning of the twentieth century At that time It w-as accepted as a matter of course that the several states were the proper authorities to regulate, so far as was then necessary, the comparatively In- significant and strictly localized cor- porate bodies of the day. The condl- tlons are now wholly different, and wholly different action Is called for. I believe that a law can be framed which will enable the national govern- ment to exercise control along the lines above Indicated, profiting by the expe- rlence gained through the passage and administration of the interstate com- merce act, If, however, the Judgment of the congress is that It lacks the con- stltutlonal power to pass such an act, then a constitutional amendment should be submitted to confer the power. There should be created a cabinet of ficer, to be known as secretary ol commerce and industries, as provided In the bill Introduced at the Inst ses sion of the congress. It should be his province to deal with commerce In its broadest sene. Including among many other things whatever concerns la!wr nnd nil matters affecting the great business corporations nnd our tner chant marine. Labor. The president declares that he re gards It necessary to re-enact the Chi nese exclusion law. In regard to labor he says that the government should provide in Its contracts Hint all work should be done under "fair" conditions and that all night work should bo for bidden for women and children as well as excessive overtime. He continues: Very great good has been and will be accomplished by associations or unions of wnaewotkers when in nun god with forethought and when they combine In sistence upon their own rights with Inw abiding respect for the rights of others. The display of these qualities in such bodies Is a duty to the nation no less than to the associations them selves. Finally, there must nlso In many cases be notion by the govern ment In order to safeguard the rights nnd Interests of all. Under our consti tution there Is much more scox for such net inn by the state nnd the munic ipality than by the tintlou. Put on points such ns those touched on above the national government can act. He asserts that the Immigration laws are unsatisfactory ami that a law should bo enacted to keep out not only anarchists, but persons of n low moral tendency or of unsavory reputation nnd those who are below a certain standard of economic fitness to enter our industrial field as competitors with Americnn labor. The Tariff and Reciprocity. The president declares that nothing could be more unwise than to disturb the business Interests of the country by any general tariff change at this time. He adds: Yet It Is not only possible, but emi nently desirable, to combine with the stability of our economic system a sup plementary system of reciprocal bene fit and obligation with other nations. Such reciprocity is an incident and re sult of the firm establishment and preservation of our present economic policy. It was specially provided for in the present tariff law. Reciprocity must be treated as the hnndmaiden of protection. Our first duty is to see that the protection grant ed by the tariff In every case where It Is needed Is maintained, and that reci procity be sought for so far as It can safely be done without Injury to our home Industries. Just how far this is must be determined according to the individual case, remembering always that every application of our tariff pol icy to meet our shifting national needs must be conditioned upon the cardinal fact that the duties must never be reduced below the ioint that will cover the difference between the labor cost here and abroad. The well being of the wageworkcr is a prime considera tion of our entire pDlicy of economic legislation. Seed For Wider Market. Subject to this proviso of the proper protection necessary to our industrial well being at home, the principle of reciprocity must command our hearty support The phenomenal growth of our export trade emphasizes the ur gency of the need for wider markets and for a liberal policy lu dealing with foreign nations. Whatever Is merely petty and vexatious In the way of trade restrictions should be avoided. The customers to whom we dispose of our surplus products lu the long run, directly or Indirectly, purchase those surplus products by giving us some thing lu return. Their ability to pur chase our products should ns far as possible be secured by so urranging our tariff as to enable us to take from them those products which we cau use without harm to our own industries and labor or the use of which will be of marked .benefit to us. Jt Is most Important that we should maintain the high level of our present prosperity. We have now reached the point In the development of our In terests where we are not only able to supply our own murkets, but to pro duce u constantly growing surplus for which we must find markets abroad. To secure these markets we can util ize existing duties In any case where they are no longer needed for the pur-' pose of protection, or In any case where the article is not produced here and the duty is no longer necessary for revenue, as giving us something to offer lu exchange for what we ask. The cordial relations with other na tions which nre so desirable will nat urally be promoted by the course thus required by our own Interests. The natural line of development for a policy of reciprocity will be In connec tion with those of our productions which no longer require nil of the sup port once needed to establish them upon a sound-basis and with those oth ers where cither because of natural or of economic causes we nre beyond the reach of successful competition. I usk the attention of the senate to the reciprocity treaties laid before It by my predecessor. The Merchant Marine. The condition of the American mer chant marine is such as to call for im mediate remedial action by the con gress. It Is discreditable to us as a nation that our merchant marine should be utterly Insignificant in com parison to that of other nations which we overtop In other forms of business. We should not longer submit to condi tions under which only a trilling por tion of our great commerce la carried in our own ships. To remedy this state of things would not merely serve to build up our shipping Interests, but It would also result In benefit to all who are Interested In the permanent estab lishment of a wider market for Amer ican products and would provide an auxiliary force for the navy. Ships work for their own countries Jnt as railroads work for their termlnnl Hiinls. Slipping lines, if established to the principal countries with wtiii-h we have dealings, would be of political as weil hs eoinniereinl benefit. From ev ery standpoint It Is unwise for the I" tilted States to continue to rely upon the ships of competing nations for the distribution of our goods. It should be made ndvnntageous to carry American goods in American built ships. At present American shipping Is un der certain grent disadvantages when put In competition with the shipping of foreign countries. Many of the fast foreign steamships, at a speed of four teen knots or above, are subsidized, nnd all our ships, sailing vessels and steamers alike, cargo carriers of slow speed and mall cnrrlers of high speed, have to meet the fact that the original cost of building Americnn ships Is creator than Is the case abroad: that the waaes paid American officers and sea men nre very much higher than those paid the officers nnd seamen of foreign competing countries, and thnt the standard of living on our ships Is far superior to the standard of living on the ships of our commercial rivals. Our government should take such action as will rcmidy these Inequalities. The American nierchnnt marine should be restored to the ocean. Financial. Tho passage of the act establishing gold a the standard money has. It is declared, beeu shown to be timely and Judicious. Tho president adds: Iu many respects the national bank ing law furnishes sufficient liberty for the proper exercise of the banking function, but tlure seems to lo need of better safeguards against tho de ranging Influence of commercial crises anil financial panics. Moreover, tho currency of the country should bo made responsive to the demands of our domestic trade nnd commerce. Economy In expenditures Is urged. Amendment of the interstate commerce act Is advised to Insure the cardinal provisions of thnt net. Tho work car ried on by the department of agricul ture is next considered and prnlsod highly. The president then turns to fon-st preservation and Irrigation of arid lands, saying that both are highly necessary. He would put all the work In connection with the forest reserves lu charge of the bureau of forestry. Irrigation. Tho president continues by tracing the connection between the forest re serves and the water supply. He says: The forests are natuml reservoirs. By restraining the streams In flood anil replenishing them lu drought they make possible the use of waters other wise wasted. They prevent the soil from washing and so protect the stor age reservoirs from filling up with silt. Forest conservation is, therefore, an essential condition of water conser vation. The forests alone cannot however, fully regulate and conserve the waters of the arid region. Great storage works are necessary to equalize the flow of streams and to save the flood waters. Their construction has been conclu sively shown to be nn undertaking too vast for private effort. Nor can It be best accomplished by the Individual states acttnlr nione.
