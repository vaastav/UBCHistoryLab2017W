The Rebel Government Living from hand to Moi tii The Grenada .Ippeal, of the 21st, publishes the proceedings of a manufactures' convention at Angttsta, Ga., on the 2th, at fcliieli owing to th high prices of the articles i!ed in manufactures, it was not thought ad visible to contract with tho Governmental BxKi prices for more than one month. 1: is rvident that the rebels themselves' have so Ut ile conllden'-c iu the perpetuity of their Gov ernment, that they are unwilling to trust it lotigi-r thaa a month at a time. "The incomprehensible and pl"mv forebo dings hinted at in lhe Chicago Platform have at length pioduced something real and practi cal, and withal, easily understood, and may be inii);ed tip as follows : Desolation Taxation Starvation Disunion and Plunder.' (Vci'r jithi Republican. That's so! And is especially the case with jour 'sotiihern oroihets," who are in open rehciiioti agair.st the government a result, that can only hi attributed to the teachings r the leaders ol the so-called Democratic putty. Verily, "they have their reward." Gen. Banks' Expedition. Of this expedi tion, the Boston Traveler learns upon goid authority that the vessels will touch at For tress Monroe, where a large addition to the torce will immediately join it, the whole ma king one of the most powerful armadas which tas left for the South since the war com nit ticeJ. The total number ol troops with Bitiks is estimated at over 40,000, while nei ther at Port Royal or in North Carolina did tbc military force exceed 20,000 men. THE 

COLORED SOLDIERS IS ACTIOS. A correspondent of the X. Y. Times, tiffs from Port Koyal, South Carolina, as follows: "The organlz tion of a regiment of blaok soldiers, under the direction of Brig. Geu. Saxton, 1 am told is progressing finely. I have often expressed my strong conviction that fhd negroes would show themselves oour geous and worthy of their freedom, if over the opportunity was tiered them to fight. and recent events have fully justified this opinion. loa have already received an account of a Miccessful expedition of ona of the tugboats i'a a company of armed bltokt to Sapelo Ktvur and other places on tho Georgia coa-t, he re they were for the first time under fire, and acquitted themselves bravely in an en gagement with their former masters, protec l'"Kttbe flight of a large number of their race who sought to escape the horrors of bondage. That success led to the projection of another tnterpriso, which, in brillianoy and practical a!ue surpasses the first. Three companies of be South Carolina Volunteers, Capts Trowbridge, Janes and Randolph's, under tho command of Lieut. Col. Beard, provost-Mar-hal under Geo. Saxton, left Beaufort on the 13th iost., iu tba steamers Ben. Dtford and Arlington, going to Doboy Sound, Georgia, remaining there a week, returning with to hundred thousand feet of the best Geor P pine lumber, sawed' and ready for use. TMs wm taken from Hawkin's, Todd's and Blue's mills on the mainland, directly in face - ta rebels, who gvth black soldiers an opportunity to test their pluck on shore as j they had previously on a lug boat, whre they j fought with the advantage of a partial barri- cade. While most of the negroes were en gaged in loading the steamers with lumber, the company of Capt. Janes advanced on a j recounoisisance, and were opened upon with musketry by tho reocls, from a position iu ambush. The negroes deliberately returned the fire, 1 and, drawn up la line of battle, kept up a fu silade, maintaining their ground, until by the aid of the guns of the steamers and those of their convoy, the gunboU Nadgie, the enemy una H ial..st " T, ,.f - .!...., 1 a,.l,lw.r ! were wounded, one so seriously that his arm must lie amputated. The officers of these men express the greatest confidence in their fighting qualities, and after these practical tests of the courage, even of raw recruits, as were those composing this expedition, it is about as well that we should hear uo more narrow minded expressions of their incapa bility to defend their liberties." An intelligent "trapper," from one of the western counties of Minnesota, states that a secret society has been orgauized. having its ramifications all through the western half of the State, whose avowed objects are to hang or shoot every Indian suspected of having had any hand in tba recent murders. Should those Indians who have been convicted be suf fered to go unhung by the Government, then this combination is to mete out punishment whenever it can be done. The iron-clad gunboat Ozark, building at Mound City, is approaching completion. The boilers are in armor. She will have tour pro pellers, a turret for two guns, and iu appear ance will lie somewhat like the Monitor. En gineer Whittaker. of the United States Navy, is making an examination, with a view to ap ply his new invention for the destruction ol similar boats belonging to the enemy.

These symptoms are often the prelude to serious illness. Sooie fit of sickness is creeping upon you, and should be averted by a timely use of tho right remedy. Take Ayer's Fills,, and cleanse out the disordered humors purity tho blood, and 1ft thn fluids move on unobstructed in health again. They stimulate the functions of the body into vig orous activity, purity the system from the obstructions which make disease. A cold set tles somewhere in the body, and obstructs its natural functions. These if not relieved, react upon themselves and the surrounding urging, producing general aggravation, surlering and disease- While in this condition, oppressed by the derangements, take Ayer's Fills, and see how directly tliey restore the nitur il action of Jiealth again. What is true and so apparent In this trivial and common complaint, is also in many of t e deep-seated and dangerous distempers. The same purgative effect expels them. Caused by similar obstructions and derangements of the natural functions of the body, they are rapidly and many ot tbera surely, cor. d by the same means.

TAL MONTHLY There are periods n the world s history marked by extraordinary and violent erises. sudden as the breaking forth of a volcano, or the bursting of a storm on the ocean. These erises weep away in a moment the landmarks ot generations. I her call out tresh talent, knd give to the old new direction. It is then that new ideas are born, new theories devel oped. Such periods demand fresh exponents, and new men for expounders. This Continent has latel- been convulsed by an uoheaving so sudden and terrible that the re lations ofal- men and all ci.issit.-s to each other aro violently disturbed, and people look about for the elements witn which to sway the storm and di rect the whirlwind. Just at present, wo do not know what all this is to bring tortn ; but we do know that great results must dow from such ex traordinary commotions. At a juncture so solemn and so important, there is a special need that the intellectual force of the eountry should be active and efficient. It is a time for great minds to speak their thoughts bold ly, and to take position as the advance guard. To this end, there is a special want unsupplied. It is that of an Independent Magazine, which shall be open to the first intellects t the land, anu htch shall treat the issue presented, and tube presented to the country. in atone no way tempered by par tizanship. or influenced by fear, favor or the hope of reward , which shall seize and grapple with the momentous subjects that the present disturbed state of affairs heave to the surface, and which can not be laid aside or neglected. To meet this want, the undersigned have com menced, under the editorial charge of Charles G. Leland, the publication of a new Magazine, devot ed to literature and National Policy. In Politics it will advocate, with all the force at Its command, measures best adapted to preserve the oneness and intcgrit. of these United States.

In this department, some of the most eminent statesmen of tii4 time will con tribute regularly to its pages. In Literature, it will be sustained by the best writers and ablest thinkers of this eountry.

A series of articles by the author of 'Through the Cotton Slates," containing the re sult of an extended tour in the seashore Slave States, just prior to the breaking out of the war, and presenting astartling and truthful picture of the real condition of that region. No pains will be spared to render the literary attractions of the Continental both brilliant and substantial The lyrical or descriptive talents of the most eminent literati have been promised to its pages ; and nothing will be admitted which will not be dis tinguished by marked energy, originality, and solid strength. Avoiding every influence or as sociation partaking of clique or coterie, it will be open to all contributions of real merit, even from writers differing materially in their views ; the only limitations required being that of devotion to the Union, and tbe only standard of acceptance that of intrinsic excellence. The Editorial Department will embrace, in ad dition to vigorous and fearless comments on the events of the times, genial gossip with the reader on all current topics, and also devote abundant space to those racy specimens of American wit and humor, without which there can be po perfect ex position of our national character Among those who will contribute regularly to this department may be mentioned the name of Charles F.
