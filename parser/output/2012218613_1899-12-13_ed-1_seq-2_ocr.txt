Wednesday, December 13, 1899 THE PRESIDENT s Mr. McKinley's message to Congress has nothing particularly interesting in it. Hi* strongest p ?i*.t is in the rerv first part of t'ao mes-a^e. He alludes to the "condition of unusual prosperity," and bis administration i* fortunate that this is the true condition of the country. Individuals may not feel that there is a oy unusual pros- I perity, 'oat taking tbe country as a whole it is .true that we have struck a tidal wave of prosperity. Bat tbe President does not even undertake to I show that the Republican party has had anything to do with the present condition. The receipts of the Government from all source* for the fiscal year ending Jane 30, 1S99, iuclndlng $11, 798,314.14, part payment of the Central Pacific railroad indebtedness, amounted to $610,982,004.35, ami the expenditures to $700,093,56 i.Q2 This is really noi a bad showing when tbe ?ora iol-on in I Yi Ckl 

CAJ/C1JOVO HIV luav ? , bat it must not be forgotteu that the people are sii'l paying war taxes, and it is pretty certain that they will have to pay for revenuo stamps for a good while longer, and besides pensions on account of the Spanish war and the war in the Philippines will begin at a lively rate in a shert while. The treasury has pleuty of gold, but the President thinks this a good j time, when "the conditions ot confi- j deace which prevail throughout the haTro Viprmuht crnlr? infn more I Wuuu; v. general use and customs are now almost entirely paid in tbat coin," to giro "the secretary of the treasury ad- j ditional power to sell United States bonds" for the purpose of maintaining tbe gold standard. g|^_l Tne President admits thai the national banking act i3 inadequate to supply needful additions to the circulation. but he really suggests no remedy. He ?throw3 it all on Congress. We hope that Congress will conclude that a repeal of the tar oa State banks of issue will aff>rd a relief. Mr. McKinley had a goad chance to say so, bat ho didn't. Like a'l Republicans, the President favors boantie*, aad Ra/gjsts that Congress adopt the policy of aid to our merchant marine. He touches on trusts in a general way. Trusts "to control the conditions of trade among oar oitjzenSj^to w*-*--? and determine tVe prices of products used an 3 onsumed by the people, are justly provoking puouc discussion, and should early claim the attention of Congress." All of which is very I? true, bat the people may expect noth| . ing from a Republican Congress to coirect this evil. JL large part of the Republican campaign fand is furnished i by the' trusts. It is not surprising, ? therefore, that th9 President is very general in what he says about trusts. The President states that our rcia* I t.ion? with foreign governments ere ' satisfactory, though in this very message it appear* that we have over 60,900 troopsj engaged in a foreign war. 4tTbi? nation has assumed before tbe world a grave responsibility for the jSnrf future good of the government of Cuba" and tbe President recognizes that the United States must in honor give these people self-government. II Tbe President takes it as settled that the Philippine* are our9. ? a T?f>r r iiAVorr 

VU>VAA1/AJA Consul Charles E. Macrum, United States consn! at Pretoria, has disgraced K? . his country. Mr. McKtnley is especially responsible for his appoint? meet to this post of duty. The consul is a glass manufacturer from Ei6t Liverpoel, Ohio, tfhich we believe is in ths Presidents old congressional district, and tha appointment was rna.le upon the recommendation of Senators Hauna and Foraker and B Representative Taylor. During the Spanish war, the inte e - !? _< (Jiofoo I rests oi cuizeus ui iuc uui^u in Cuha>nd Manilla were entrusted to British consuls, and this country sounded the praise* of the British for their care and this evidence of good faith and kindly feeling. When Great Bri'ain becama engaged in war in South Africa, it was natural that the Ucited States would seek to reciprocate tbe kind office* of Gre*t Britain. L ' ... ? 4 i A.IH- ffU'il LL1 Uii. VJTiyat Ul u?iu ini?a of our consular system now? Macrum, the consul at Pretoria, at the very Ep time when bit services are most needed, has actoaiiy deserted hie post, and it is said that ho deserted because he H was scared his charge was entrusted the interests of citizens of the United States and those ol British residents, and he has deserted He Imade several applications for leave of absence, at least two, since the war begau,&nd bis applications were flatly refused. Taking matters in bis own bauds, bo skipped, leaving his office in the hands of a minor. Uow unlike Fizhugh Lee in Cuba when he was there as she represen'ative of thi* eounrry standing bravely at iii-.

He ooght to be given ?everal good dackines on Lis way -c home to tone up his nerves. j This disgrace to our Government i3 doubtless due to our .miserable system t( of political rewards for services. No Cj doubt the President or some of his friends owed this glass man a politi- ^ cal debt, and he sought to pay it by sending him to Soath Africa to fill a a place ordinarily involving no greit ability to discharge its denies and re- j $ eponsibilitv, but the war in South j Africa comes along acd a man is j - onnnArfpi*. and I u -vrantea, not a ou^w^., ? y the man is not there. Sach is the ( logical result of the ioiquitou3 practice of tho policy, "to the victor be- tl Iong the spoils." j.MOKE 

TAXES. ? mt- - in his ' ' ine rivsxucui ? ? message "aid to our merchant marine" u and a {-hip subsidy bil! has been prc-!"Ot]y introdaced in Congress, r Not fcatisf 1 with having enriched a z few manufacturer? by levying h?avy j tribute on the people, Senaf r Hanna J has prepared a bil! which has been j i introduced into the llou^e f Re pro- { sentatives <o aid the ship builders and r owners O'^hips. A bounty will be: r paid tbe owners of American tbips, and it is provided toat tne ooauucs shall not exceed $9,000,000, that is, an { amount eqaal to about $1 pr r bale for : 1 tbe average cotton crop, and the peo- j , p'.e of course, will bavr- :he bounty t-:s ! < pay. Afire g'ft, miscalled in the 1 i bill "a compensation," of one ar.d a 1 half cent* oer grofs ton per 100 miles ! ? covered by vessels going a: (1 oming j up to 1,500 miles each way will be j < allowed, and one percent per jiross; ton for t sch ICO additional mi!e=. j Extra bonaly will be given faf-t ships,! \ regulaitd according to speed. Why j should tbi? bill pass? What right has i 1 Congress to tax the people of this j j country bv tsking their mor.ey from 11 the Dublic treasury and givir-g it to j1 the owners of ships? Why should i' Congress not, with jusr as muchaa-jj thority, give a bounty to farmers for I! every mule they raise, or erory hog, i or every iSpound of tobacco, or every . bale of cotton? In the case of the farmer, it would be wirh more justice, j: for he ha?' been taxed many weary { years "to protect and foster the infant j industries" ol the North until the j manufactn-er has grown rich ar^tbe ' farmer's ard all consumer's cipense. : The bill will very probably p^s and j become a iaw, and the question i^ will I the people allow it to stand. We say the bill will pa^s, because both houses of Congress ar9 Republican aid a Republican President is in the White House, who has been the great apostle of doctrinc of taxing one c'uss at the expense of 3notbr.r, The bill does not differ in principle from ihe tariff iawe, and if the people shall allow tbis bill to stand, it will be a repetition of the j unjust tariflVlaws over again?heavier j aiid heavier tribute eaen year 10 aia i our merchant marine.

He also preached a very j nteresting sermon last Saturday night it the residence of Mr Edward Co!ei nan. Mr Henry Crowder and family have j ecently moved into the house for- j aerly occupied by Mr J W GibeoD tnd family. Mr Samuel Carlisle ha3 moved to he Jackson Creek community. Mr Jamess W Crowder is building a ieat dwelling on his store lot on the uain public road leading from Shelton o Woodward. The Chester Reporter is mistaken ibout Mr H F McLane, who died ecently in Chester, being a brother >f the late J Hendrix McLane, who ivas once a candidate for Governor of South Carolina. H F McLane was a irst cousin of J Hendrix McLane. J Hendrix McLane was, perhaps the list man in South Carolina, and prob hiv one of the first in the Southern States, to advocate the free coinage of :-olh gold and silver and the issue of a :reen back currcncy redeemable in both coins. I think subsequent events ind present conditions justifies the >->urss persued by Mr McLane. Many of our people believed at that lime ihat the principles advocated by bim would prove detrimental to the best interest of our people. Many of those who thongbt the principles ad rotated by Mr McLane were too risionary and impractical to he-made " L " L--:- -n.ii f-i r>al nr. biiU UilfciS KJJl ci pui Uiauguv W^anization, arc now the most strenuous advocates of the practical application Df those principles. The truth about the tauiter was, that we had men in high official positions to whom we ?ave credit for bei-ig leaders of public opinion that did not merit the bOLOr. Hendrin McLaue was misunderstood by the people. At the time? he commenced the agitation tor financial reform the people of our j Sra'e aud many other States were not ready for a chaoge. It is sometimes ! very difficult lor anyone to make a;? j event. It more oftou happens tiat the event make? the man. Ben Till- i mm cwuld not have been elected in 188S a:d lit k:ievv if. bat ibe event wan more opportune i;? 1890 'Jould J lienc-rix McLine have lived until 1896 and witnessed that mos: lemmkable canvas made bv W J Br\?n it would !;ave been some consolation to him to have realized that the issues :hat he JieJped 10 agitate had be,j!J crvitalized in a platform with a Cindida'e running thereon that received *>5: millions ot votes. That was ttie mo.-t remir^aoie cwyass hi the his:ory of American politics, and tiie :?;an pat forth as the exponent of the i rifie'ples embodied iu that platform will ever shine as a star of the first magnitude in that brilliant galaxy great speech in^l893 on the money question I read it and remarked that it was but a rei'Ci ation of ibe principles advocated by Weaver, of Iowa, j Hendrix McLane, of South Carolina, and other leaders of the greenback movement. I also remarked that that speech and others that Bryan might make would pave i ij. way to the presidency of the United State*. Whilst I d-> not m^an to be egotistical I hazard little in saying that I believe my prophecy will yet be verified. But it will take the combined efforts of the o 1:~? ? - :t t>?.s,,k': ? n/4 i. iicv; &uvsi nc^uun^nr auu i the Democrats to elect a Democratic ' President. In rav opinion it is the only plan to be adopted by which we can succeed in the approaching contest. Bat I am a Democrat and I always write the word witb a capital letter for I believe in its principles and would rather be a Democrat in defeat than to be a Republican in ci<-tory. I will go farther than some \A our strong free silver advocates. I ( will vote for any Democrat who will u-e the |inflnence of the President's ; office to impede the progress of the r?t,?r?rr? msrph Af (Viio imnorisvliHm. / uDilltaryism, republicanism, and last { and worst of all, Hannaism, with all jf its monopolistic tendencies. I ; think there are too many isms in the 1 Republican party for any good Demo- ; ;rat. Genuine democracy is pure and ] unadulterated and there is no isms in it. The Catholics poll about twelve j md a half per cent of the vote of the United States and it will be polled i argely for Bryan on account of his opposition to imperialism. The in- < labitaats of the Phillipine Islaads I mostly belong to the Catholic church ind it is not reasonable to s*ppose tbat rtany of that denomination ia America ;vould vote for a party that is engaged n a relentless war with the members )t its church in any locality however emt^e from our country. , Witb best wishes for all aDd success for democracy, I am yours truly, Dec 8,'99.
