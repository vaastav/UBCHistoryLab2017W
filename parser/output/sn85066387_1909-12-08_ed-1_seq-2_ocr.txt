2 AID PLEDGED FOR PANAMA CANAL FIESTA Plans for Great Celebration When "Big Ditch" Is Opened Already Under Way Businessmen Enthusiastically Indorse Project at Mer« chants' Exchange Meeting M. 11. dc Young. Charles de Young, T. C. Fri<*dlander, Srate Senator E. I. Wolfe. Milton Esberg and J. A. Filcher, : California's recent commissioner to the Alaska-Yukon-PaciHc exposition at Se attle. Homer S. King, president of the Pa cific Ocean exposition company, called The mass meeting on the floor of the Merchants' exchange to order at 3:30 o'clock. He sketched briefly the pur poses of the organizers of the company and declared that the Idea had not been dropped, but only allowed to 6molder until a propitious time was reached for. active work. King, introduced C. C.J Moore, San Francisco's late Portola festival commissioner, as chairman of the afternoon. City's Right to Big Fair • Moore declared that the object of the meeting was not to consider Whether San Francisco should hold a world's fair, but whether San Francisco should act upon or renounce the rights to hold such an exposition secured through its declaration of intention nearly six years ago. The meeting, he said, was more a compliment to the wisdom of the men who had secured and protected those rights than a conference to de cide whether a fair should be held. He asserted that Boston was anxious to hold the Panama exposition, but ac knowledged San Francisco's prior right, though doubting its ability to handle th« project within five years. "New Orleans. Galveston, Mobile and pome of the steady and sturdy little cities on this coast also want the honor of holding the fair," continued Moore, "but no city has the right to claim it until our citizens in mass meeting as sembled decide that San Francisco does not want IC The work has been going on here quietly for a long while, but what we have to do Is get on or. off pretty quick. We can't be dogs In the manger. We must decide today, before we leave this building." M. H. de Young:, director general of the midwinter fafr of 1894. discussed briefly the building of that exposition within five months and the great bene fits to the city that were derived from it. San Francisco, he said, should rank with Paris as one of the great play cities and amusement centers of the world, but could only do so by making great plans for the future, among which a world's exposition should stand pre-eminent at this time. Henry T. Scott declared that San Francisco was the logical city for such an exposition because of its geographic and climatic location. Its eminence as the metropolis of the we6t and .the fact that no other city would' receive such benefits from the opening of the great $500,000,000 waterway. Fair as Aid to City Benjamin F. Schleslnger, assistant general manager of the Emporium, who was one of the active directors of the Columbian exposition in 1893, told of how that fair carried Chicago tri umphant through a panic year. It was that, he said, which gave some of the greatest Chicago commercial houses their first impetus and which inaugu rated enterprises that are flourishing today. San Francisco, he said, was far ahead of Chicago In hotel accommoda tions and had natural wonders in addi tion to Its fair to entertain its \lsitor3, while Chicago had nothing except the fair itself to attract the people of the world. Gavin McNab spoke of the deep con cern San Francisco had in the opening of the canal and compared the great labor of digging it with the great work accomplished in the rebuilding of San Francisco. R. B. Hale extended the re grets of Governor Gillett that he was unable to be present at the meeting, and said that he was authorized to say for the chief executive of .the state that he was heartily in favor of the San Francisco project. Mayor Taylor called for the enthusiastic support and energetic efforts of all San Franciscans to make the fair a great success, and asserted that no other city could chal lenge Sa n Francisco's right to cele brate such a world event in a -world way. The vote ratifying and confirming the action of those who have carried out the preliminary exposition plans was taken, resolutions of indorsement and greeting from the Rotary club were re ceived and the meeting broke up with three lusty cheers for the success of the Panama-Pacific exposition.

HOUSE President** message is read and re ferred to committee. Representative Hitchcock Introduce;* resolution calling: for valuation of hold ing* of telegraph companies. House adjourns until Friday. WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.— -Havin&r as- v sembled and received the president's annual message, congress today found itself literally "out- of work," and, in consequence,' both houses adjourned un til Fridaj', when, if some of the various committees fail to provide something to do, adjournment will be taken until Monday. The formality of reading the message aloud consumed an hour and, a half in each house. When its conclusion -was reached the house immediately ad journed, but the senate went into ex ecutive session. Little fault was found with the mes sage among republicans, who seemed to agree that it was as satisfactory a document as the president .could pre pare and remain consistent with the party's campaign pledges. 

DEMOCRATS APPROVE ECONOMY The democrats approved the presi dent's effort to economize, but depre cated his suggestion that- the Monroe doctrine had practically become obso lete. "The message is written in the presi dent's customary terse, vigorous style," commented Representative Payne, ma jority leader in the house, while Rep resentative Clark,, minority leader, thought about all that .could be said about the message was that it was comparatively brief,- "as, discussion of almost all important matters is rele gated to special messages." In both houses the message was s,ub jectto most careful, scrutiny;'-.''^ Following the custom, 'the' message was referred, to ".the. committee 'of the whole to be .prepared for "vivisection" by the. various committees whose.busi ness it is to; deal with ..subjects dis cussed by the president in his message. 

SENATE PAYS TRIBUTE The senate adjourned at 2:30 o'clock out of respect to the memory of Rep resentative de Afmond- of Missouri and of Representative -Lassiter of Virginia.' The house adjourned at 1:45 o'clock. In his message President Taft made known to the world his wishes regard ing legislation and his opinion respect- Ing many questions of public interest. The message had been anxiously antici pated and general interest was mani fested in its reading in the two bodies. The portions which attracted most attention \u25a0were those relating to the complication with Nicaragua, the dimi nution of public, expenditures, the cus tom house frauds and the tariff act. The one- phrase' most discussed -was found in connection with the president's treatment of the Zelaya incident, of which he spoke "as the sad tale of un speakable barbarities." For More Army Officers 

WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.— Secretary of War Dickinson today received little encouragement in regard to his recom mendation for an increase In the num ber of officers for the army. With the view of Impressing upon congress - his Ideas on this . subject as embodied in his annual report he had a conference with Chairman Hull of the house com mittee on military affairs today. ; Mr. Hull was not sanguine over the out come of the attempt. "Why, as late as 1901 we gave them as many officers as they said they would need for an army of 100,000 men," said Mr. Hull as he left the secretary's' office. "Now ; . they want about 700 more. How long : will these be sufficient?'' . He admitted some branches of .the service should be increased; among them the signal corps. \The chairman of the military affairs committee continues to urge, the abolishment^ of the marine corps as an independent organization. "Why could we . not have sent • the infantry to Nicaragua as well as the marines?" • he inquired. "The advent of the big battleship, to my mind, signifies the passing-of the marines." ' Domestic Science Bill WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.— "There; Is just as much need that a woman should be taught how-; to cook and : sew, make her own hats 'and darnher husband's socks, if she has a husband, or expects to get one, as, there is that a man be taught how. to farm," said Senator Smoot "today.

' Root Acts Too Promptly ./\u25a0 \u25a0WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.— Senator -Root of New York, presiding in the senate today, in the absence of Vice President Sherman, created consternation among newspapermen. Copies .of the annual report of the 'secretary of the treasury were in i the \u25a0\u25a0 hands .of. newspapers throughout! the countryVand Europe to be held in confidence for. publication tomorrow afternoon: / The report itself is still unsigned 'on the desk "of Secre tary MacVeagh in \u25a0 the treasury bulldlng. ; V \ . ./r'/i .By. some means as yet uncertain two printed copies of the report found their way to the desk of the president of the senate.

V : It is ibelieved, however, that Manuel Bonilla, former '> president of Honduras, who was; deposed by President Davilla through; the help of Zelaya, may be taking .advantage of " the situation -in Nicaragua to • seek revenge. "i ..For. some time it "has: been expected among Central Americans that Davila was^in sympathy with Zelaya -in his efforts'to crush, the revolution \ under} Estrada, and it is thought that'B6nilla's:threat ened invasion of Honduras at this time would serve, the double purppse of 'pre venting;: any aid r; being < given ; Zelaya and ''at the same time render possible the overthrow, of the" Davila govern ment.
