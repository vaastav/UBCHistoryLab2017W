LINCOLN Delivered, December 9th, 1863. Fellow citizen of the Senate and 1ouie of Representative : Another year of health, and of sufficiently abundant harvest, has passed. For these, and especially for the improved condition of our National ailairs our renewed and profound gratitude to God is due. We remain in peace and friendship with foreign powers. The efforts of disloyal citi zen! ot the United States, to involve us in for eign wars, to aid in inexcusable insurrection have been unavailing. Her Britanic Majes ty's Government, as was justly expected, have exercised their authority to prevent the de parture of new hostile expeditions from Brit ish ports. The Emperor ot France lias, by a like proceeding, promptly vindicated the neu trality which he proclaimed at the beginning ol the contest. Questions ot great intricacy and impor tance have arisen out of the blockade, and other beligerent operations between the Gov ernment and several of the maritime powers ; but they have been discussed, and as far as now possible, accommodated in a spirit of frankness, justice and mutual good will. It is especially gratifying that our prize courts, by the impartiality of their adjudica tion, have commanded the respect and confi dence ot maritime powers. The eupplimeotal treaty bet ween the United States and Great Britain for the suppression of the African Slave Trade, made on the 17th day of February last, has been duly ratified and carried into execution. It is believed that so far as American ports and American citizens aVe concerned, that inhuman and odi oils trtitlic has been brought to an end. 1 shall submit, for the consideration of the Senate, a convention for the adjustment of post.ess.ory cuirus in it ashington Territory arising out ot the treaty of the 15tb of June 184b, between the United States and Great Britain, and which have been the source of disquiet among the citizens of that now rap- miy improving part or tue country. A novel and important question involving the extent ot the maritime jurisdiction of Spain on the waters which surround the Island of Cuba, has been debated without reaching an agreement, and it ia proposed in an amica ble spirit to submit it to the arbitrament of a friendly power. A convention for that pur pose will be suomittea to the Senate. 1 have thought it proper, subject to the ap proval of the Senate, to concur with the in terested commercial powers in an arrange merit for the liquidation ot the Scheldt dues upon the principles which have been hereto fore adopted in regard to tbe imposts upon navigation in the waters of Denmark. The long pending controversy between this Government and that of Chili, touching the seizure at Sitania, in Peru, by Chilian officers ot a large amount in treasure belonging to citizens ot the L mteu States, has been brought to a close by the award ol hia Majesty, tbe Ring of the Belgians, to whose arbitration the question was referred by tbe parties. The subject was thoroughly and patiently examin ed by that justly tespected magistrate, aud although tbe sum awarded to the claimants m iv not have been as large as they expected, there is no reason to distrust the wisdom of nis Jiajesty decision, l Mat decision was promptly complied with by Chili when intel lieuce in regard to it reached that country. The joint commission, under the act of the last session, for carrying into effect the con vention with Peru on the subject of claims, has been organized at Lima, and is engaged in the business intrusted to it. Difficulties concerning the inter-oceanic transit through Nicarauga, are in course of amicable adjustment. In couformity with the principles set forth in my lubt annual message, I have received a representative from the United States of Co lumbia, and have credited a minister to that Republic. Incidents occurring in the progress of our civil war have forc.-d upon my attention the uncertain state of international questions touching the rights of foreigners in this coun try, and ot h nited States citizens abroad. In regard to some governments, these rights are at least partially defined by treaties. In no instance, however, it is expressly stipu lated that in the event of civil war a foreign er residing in this country within the lines of the insurgents is to be exempted from the rule which classes him as a beligerent, in whose be half tbe government ot hia country cannot ex pect any privileges or immunities distinct froai that character. I regret to say, howev er, that such claims Lave been put forward, and in some ins ances in behalf of foreigners who have lived in tbe United States a greater part of their lives. There is reason to believe that many persons born in foreign countries, who have declared their intention to become citizens, or who have been fully naturalized, have evaded the military duty required of them by denying the fact, and thereby throw ing upon the government tbe burden of proof. It has been found difficult, or impracticable, to obtain this proof for want ot guides to tbe proper sources of information. These might be supplied by requiring the clerks of courta where declarations ot intention may be made, or naturalizations effected, to send periodical ly a list of tbe names of the persons natural ized or declaring their intention to become citizens, to the Secretary of the Interior, in whose department these names might be ar ranged and printed for general information. There ia also reason to believe that foreigners frequently become citizens of the United States for the sole purpose of evading duties imposed by the laws of their native countries to which, on becoming naturalized here, they at once repair, and though never returning to tbe United States they still claim tbe interpo sition of this government as citizens. Many altercations of great prejudice have hereto fore arisen out of that abuse. It is there fore submitted to your serious consideration. It might be advisable to fix a limit beyond which no citizen of tbe United States resid ing abroad may claim tbe interposition of bia government. - The right of suffrage has often been assum ed and exercised by aliens, under pretences of naturalization, which they have disavowed when drafied into the military service. . I sub mit the expediency of such an amendment of tbe iawaa will make tbe fact of voting an es toppel against any plea of exemption from military service or other civil obligation on tbe ground of alienage. " Iti common with other Western Powers, our relations with Japan have been brought into serious jeopardy tmougb the perverse opposi tion oi me Hereditary aristocracy of the em pire to the enlightened and liberal Dolicy of tbe Tycoon, designed to bring the country in to tbe society of nations. It ia hoped, al though not m uh entire confidence, that these difficulties may be peacefully overcome. I ass your attention to the claim of the minis ter residing there for tbe damages he sustain ed in the destruction by fire, of tbe residence of the Legation at Yeddo. Satisfactory arrangements have been made with the Emperor of Russia, which it is be lieved wilt result in effecting a continuous line of telegraph through that Empire from our Pacific coast. I recommend to yur favora ble consideration the subject of an interna tional telegraph across the Atlantic Ocean, and also a telegraph between tbe Capital and tbe National forts along tbe Atlantic seaboard and Gulf of Mexico. Such communications, established w ith any reasonable outlay, would be an economical as well as effective aid to tbe diplomatic, military and naval service. The consular system of the United States, under the enactment of the last Congress, be gins to be self-sustaining, and there is reason to hope that it may become entirely so with j an increase of trade, which will ensue when ever peace is restored Our ministers abroad have been faithful defending American rights. In protecting com tucicia! interests, our consuls have cecessa rily bad to encounter increased labors and re sponsi bill ties growing out of tbe war.. These they have, for tbe most part, met and dis charged with Zealand efficiency. Tbisacbnowl edgment justly includes those consuls who residing in Morocco, tgypt, 1 urkey, Japan China ana other oriental countries, are charged wttii complex functions and extraordi nary powers. The condition of the several organized Ter ritones Is generally satisfactory, although In dian disturbances iu New Mexico have not been entirely) suppressed. The mineral re sources of Colorado, Nevada, Idahoe, New Mexico and Arizona are proving far richer than has been heretofore understood. I lay oeiore you a communication on this subject from the Governor of New Mexico. I again submit to your consideration the expediency of establishing a system for the encouragement ot emigration. Although this source of national wealth and strength is again flowing with greater freedom than for several years before the insurrection occur red, there is still a great deficiency of labor ers in every Held of industry, especially in ag riculture ana in our mines, as well of iron and coal aa of the precious metals. While tbe demand for labor is thus increased here, tens of thousands ot persons destitute of remuner ative occupation, are thronging our foreign consulatea and offering to emigrate to the United States, if essential but very cheap as sistance can be afforded them. It is easy to see that under tbe sharp disciplines of civil war, the nation is beginning a new life. This noble effort demands the aid and ought to re ceive the attention and support of tbe Gov ernment. Injuries, nnforseen by the government and unintended, may in some cases have been in flicted upon aubjects or citizens of foreign countries, both at sea and oo land, by persons in the service of the United States. As this Government expects redress from other pow ers when 8itm lar injuries are inflicted by per sons in their service upon citizens of the U- nited States, we must be prepared to do jus tice to foreigners. If theaexisting judicial trl bunals are inadequate to this purpose, a 6pe cial court may be authorized with power to hear and decide such claims of the character referred to as may have arisen under treaties and tbe public law. Conventions for adjust ing tbe claimsby joint commissions, have been proposed to some governments, but no defin ite answer to tbe proposition has been receiv ed from any. In the course of tbe session I shall proba bly have occasion to request you to provide indemnification to claimants where decrees of restitution have been rendered and damages awarded by Admiralty Courts, and in other cases where this Goverenment may be ac knowledged to be liable in principle, and where the amount of that liability has been ascertained by an informal arbitration. The proper officers of the Treasury have deemed themselves reqired by the law of the United States upon the subject to demand a tax upon tbe incomes of foreign consuls in this conntry. While such a demand may not, in strictriess, be in derrogation of public law, or perhaps of any existing treaty betweenlthe United States and a foreign country, the ex pediency of so far modifying the act as to ex empt from tax tbe incomes of such consuls aa are not citizens of the United States, derived from the emoluments of their office, or from property not situated in the Unitad States, is submitted to your serious consideration. I make thia suggestion upon the ground that a comity which ought to be reciprocated ex empts our consuls in all other counties from tax ation, to the extent thus indicated. The Uni ted States, I think, ought not to be exception ally illiberal to international trade ahd com merce. The operations of the Treasury during the last year have been successfully conducted. Tbe enactment by Congress of a National Bank ing Law, baa proved a valuable support of tbe public credit.and tbe general legislation in ra tion to loans has folly answered tbe expec tation of its favorers. Some amendments may be required to perfect existing laws, but do change on their principles or general scope is believed to be seeded. Since these measures have been in opera tion, all demands on the Treasury, including the pay of the army and navy, have been promptly met and fully satisfied. No consid erable body ot troops, it is believed, were ev er more amply provided and more liberally and punctually paid, and it may be added, that by no people were the burdens incidental to a great war ever more cheerfully borne. I ho receipts during tbe year from all sources, in cluding loans and the balance in the Treasury at its commencement, were $901,125,674 86, and the aggregate disbursements, $895,796,-. 630 6-5, leaving a balance on the 1st of July, 1863, of $5,329,044 21. Of tbe receipts, there were derived trom customs, 5ba,Ui'J,b4 u i from internal revenue, $37,640,787 95; from direct tax, $1,485,103 61 ; from lands, $167, 617 17 ; from miscellaneous sources, $3,046, 615 35 ; and from loans, $776,682,861 57, making the aggregate $901,125,674 86. Of tba disbursements there were : For the cirll service, $23,253,922 08; for pensions and In dians, $4,216,526 59 ; for interest on public debt, $24,729,846 51 ; for the War Denart- ment,S599.298,600 83 ; for the Navy Depart ment, $63,211,105 27 ; for payment of funded aua temporary debt, $181,086,635 07 ; making the aggregate $895,796,630 65 ; and leaving the balance of $5,329,044 21. But the pay ment of funded and temporary debt having been made from moneys borrowed during the year, must be regarded as merely nominal payments, and the moneys borrowed to make them as merely nominal receipts. Their a raount, $181,086,635 07, should therefore be deducted both from the receipts and disburse ments. This being done, there remains as actual receipts, $720,039,039 79. and th .t. ual disbursements, $714,709,995 58, leaving iuo uaiance as aireauy stated. the actual receipts and disbursements for me nrst quarter, and the estimated receipts and disbursements for tbe remaining three quarters of the current fiscal year, 1864. will be shown in detail by the report ol the Secre tary ot the lreasury, to which I invite vour attention. It is sufficient to sav hera that it is not Delieved that actual results will exhibit a state of the finances less favorable to tbe country than tbe estimates of that officer here tofore submitted, while it is confidently ex pectea mat at the close of the year both dis bursements and debt will be found pretty con- aiueraoiy less man has been anticipated Xhe report of tbe Secretary of War is a doc ument of great interest. It consists of First, ne military operations ot the year detailed in the report of the General-in-Chief. Srcond, The organization of colored persons into the war service. Third, The exchange of prison ers, fully set forth in the letter of Gen. Hitch cock. Fourth,The operations under the "Act tor enrolling and Calling Out the National Forces," detailed in the report of the Provost Marshal General. Fifth, The organization of the invalid Corps; and Sixth, The operations ot the several Departments ot the Quartermas ter General, Commissary General, Paymaster General, Chief of Lngineers, Chief of Ord nance, and Surgeon General. It has appear ed impossible to make a valuablesnmmary of this report, except such as would be too ex tended for this place ; and hence I content myself by asking your careful attentiou to the report itself. The duties devolving on the naval branch of the service during the year, and throughout tbe whole of this unhappy contest, have been discharged with fidelity and eminent success. Tbe extensive blockade has been constantly increasing in efficacy as the navy has been ex panded. Yet on so long a line, it has so far been impossible to entirely suppress illicit trade. From returns received at tbe Navy Department, it appears that more than 1,000 vessels have been captured since tbe blockade was instituted, and that the value of prizes al ready sent in for adjudication amounts to over $13,000,000. he naval force of the United States con sists, at this time, ot 588 vessels, completed and in the course of completion, and of these io are iron-clad or armored steamers. The events of the war give an increased intcrost and importance to the uavy which will proba bly extend beyond the war itself. Tbe ar mored vessels in our Navy, completed and in service, or which are under contract and ap proaching completion, are believed to exceed in number those of any other power. But while these may be relied upon for harbor de leuce and coast service, others of greater strength and capacity will be necessary for cruising purposes and to maintain our right rui position on tne ocean. The change that has taken place in naval vessels and naval warfare since tbe introduc tion of steam as a motive power for ships of war, aemanaa eitner a corresponding change in some of our existing Navy Yards, or tbe establishment ot new ones for the construe tion and necessary repair of modern naval vessels. No inconsiderable embarrassment. delay and public injury have been experi enced from a want of such sovernmental es tablishments. The necessity of such a Navy Yard, so furnished, at some suitable place upon the Atlantic sea-board, has, upon repeated occasions, been brought to the attention of Congress by the Navy Department, and is again presented in the report of the Secreta ry, which accompanies this communication. I think it my duty to invite your special attention to this subject, and also to that of establishing a yard and depot for naval purpo ses, upon one of the western rivers. A naval force has been created on those interior waters. and under many disadvantages, within little more than two years, exceeding in numbers the wbole naval force of the country at the commencement of tbe present administra tion. Satisfactory and important as have been the performances of the heroic men ot the navy at this interesting period, thev are scarcely more wonderful than the success of our mechanics and artizans in the production of war vessels, which, has created a new form of naval power. Our country baa advantages superior to any other nation in our resources of iron and timber, with inexhaustible quanti- les ot fuel in the Immediate vicinity of both. and available and in close proximity to navi gable waters. Without tbe advantage of pub lic work-8,tbe resources of the nation have been governed, developed, and its power dis played in tbe construction of a navy of such magnitude, which has, at the very period of its creation, rendered signal service to the Union. Tbe increase of the number of seamen in the public service, from 7.500 men in the spring of 1861, to about 34,000 at the present ime, bas been accomplished .without special legislation, or extraordinary bounties to pro mote that increase. It has been found, how ever, that the operation of the draft, with the high bounties paid for army recruits, is begin- mg to arrect mjnnousiy tne naval service, nd will, if not corrected, be likelv to impair ts efficiency by detaching seamen from their proper calling, and inducing them to enter the rmy. 1 therefore respectfully suggest that Congress might aid both tbe army and naval services by a definite provision on tbe subject, which would at the same time be equitable to tne pommumtiea more especially interested. l commend to your consideration tbe sug gestion of tbe Secretary of the Navy in regard to tne policy of fostering and training seaman. and also the education of officers and engin eers tor naval aervice. . The Naval Academy is rendering , signal aervice in . preparing mid shipmen for . the highly responsible duties which, in afterlife, they will be' reqnierd to perform. In order that tbe conntry. shonld pot be deprived of the proper quota of educa ted officers, for which legal provisions bas been made at tbe naval schools, the vacancies caused by the neglect or ommission ,to make nominations irora .me states in insurection, nave oeen nued by the Secretary of the Navy x ne school is now more full and complete man at any rormer period, and in every respect emitted to toe favorable consideration of Congress. During the past fiscal year the financial condition ot the Post Office Department bas been one of increasing prosperity, and I am gratified in being able to state that the actual postal revenue has nearly equaled tbe entire expenditures, the latter amounting to $11,314, 9flA RA arA lw. m til 1C9 Ton en leaving a denciency of but $150,417,25. In I860, the year immediately preceding the rebellion, the deficiency amounted to $5,- ooo,iuo,4, the postal receipts of tbat year be ing z,o4o,iZ,iy, less than those of 1863. lbe decrease in 1860 in the actual amount of transportation bas been only about 25. per cent., but tbe annual expenditure on account or tbe same has been reduced 35 per cent It is manifest, therefore, that tbe Post Office Department may become self-sustaining in a few years, even with tbe restoration of the whole service. The international conference of Postal Del egates from tbe principal countries of Europe ana America, w hich was called at tbe sugges tion ot tbe Postmaster General, met at P arts on tbe 11th of May last, and concluded its delib erations on the 8th of June. Tbe principle established by tbe conference as best adapted to lacuitate postal intercourse between na tions,and as the basis ot future postal conven tions, inaugurate a general system f uniform international charges at reduced rates ' of postage, and cannot fail to produce beneficial results. I refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Interior, which is herewith laid before you, for useful and varied information in re lation to tbe public lands, Indian affairs, pat ents, pensions, and otber matters of public concern pertaining to bis department. The quantity of land disposed of during the last and the nrst quarter of tbe present fiscal years was three millions eight hundred and forty-one thousand, five hundred and forty nine acres, ot wbicn lbl,911 acres weie sold for cash, l,456,ol4 acres were taken up under the homestead law, and tbe residue disposed of under laws granting lands for military boun ties, for railroad and other purposes. It also appears tbat tbe sale of the public lands is largely on tbe increase. It has long been a cherished opinion ot some of our wisest states men tbat the people of tbe United States had a higher and more enduring interest in the early settlment and substantial cultivation of tbe public lands, than in the amount of direct revenue to be derived from tbe sale of tbem This opinion bas bad a controlling influence in shaping legislation upon tbe subject of our national domain. I may cite as evidence of this the liberal measures adopted in reference to actual settlers, the grant to the States of the overflowed lands within their limits, Is order to their being reclaimed and rendered fit for cultivation, the grant to Railroad Com panies of alternate sections of land upon the completed, will largely multiply tbe facilities for reaching our distant possessions. This policy has received its most signal and benefi cent illustration in tbe recent enactment grant ing homesteads to actual settlers. Since tbe first of January last the before mentioned quantity of one million four hundred and titty six thousand five hundred aud fourteen acres of land have been taken up under its provis ions. This fact and the amount of sales furn ish gratifying evidence of increasing settle ment upon the public lands, notwithstanding the great struggle in which the energies of the Nation have been engaged and which has re quired so large a withdrawal of our citizens from their accustomed pursuits. I cordially concur in the recommendation of the Secreta ry of the Interior, suggesting a modification of the act in favor of those engaged in tbe military and naval service of the United States. I doubt not tbat Congress will cheerfully a dopt such measures as will, without essential ly changing the general features of the system, secure to tbe greatest practicable extent tbe benefits to those who have left their homes iu tbe defeuce of the country in bis arduous crisis. I invite your attention to the views of the Secretary as to the propriety of raising by ap propriate legislation a revenue from the mineral lands of the United States. . The measures provided, at your last session, for the removal of certain Indian tribes, have been carried into effect. Sundry treaties have been negotiated which will, in due time, be submitted for the constitutional action of the Senate. They contain stipulations for extinguishing the possessory rights of the In dians, to large aud valuable tracts of land. It is hoped tbat the effects of these treaties v ill result in the establishment of a permanent friendly relations with such of these tribes as have been brought into frequent and bloody collisions with our outlying settlements and emigrants. Sonnd policy and our imperative duty to these wards of the Government, de mand our auxious and constant attention, to their material well being, to their progress in tbe arts ot civilization, and, above all, to that moral training, which, under the blessing of divine rrovidence, will confer npon them the elevated and sanctifying influence, the hope and consolation of tbe Christain faitb. I sug gested, in my last annual message, tbe pro priety of remodeling our Indian system. But aubsequentevents have satisfied me of its necessity. The details set forth in the report of tbe Secretary will evince tbe urgent need lor immediate legislative action. . I commend tbe benevolent institutions es tablished or patronized by tbe Government in this District to your generous and fostering care. . The attention of Congress during tbe last session was . engaged to some extent with a proposition for enlarging tbe water communi cations between the Mississippi river and the Northeastern seaboard, which proposition, however, failed for tbe time. Since then up on a call of the greatest respectability a Con vention has been held at Chicago npon tbe same subject a summary of those views is con tained m a memorial addressed to the Presi dent and Congress, and which 1 now have tbe honor to lay before you. Tbat this Interest is one which ere long will force its own way I do dot entertain a doubt,' while it is submit ted entirely to your wisdom aa to what can be done now. Augmented Interest is given to the subjeet by the actual commencement of work upon the Pacific Railroad, under au spices so favorable to its rapid progress and completion. Enlarged navigation becomes a palpable need to the great road. I transmit tbe second annual report of the Commissioner of tbe Department of Agriculture, asking your attention to the developments in tbat vi tal interest of the nation. When Congress assembled a year ago the war had already lasted nearly twenty months, and there bad been many conflicts on both land and sea. With varying results, tbe re bellion had been pressed hack into reduced limits, yet the tone of public feeling and o pinion at home and abroad, was not satisfac tory. . With other signs, the popular elections, then just passed, indicated uneasiness among ourselves; while, amid much that was cold and menacing, the kindest words coming from Europe were uttered in accents of pity that we v ere too blind to surrender. Our com merce was suffering greatly by a few armed vessels built upon and furnished from foreign shores, and we were threatened with such ad ditions from the same quarter as would sweep our trade from the sea and raise our blockade. He bad failed to elicit from tbe European governments anything hopeful upon this sub- ject. The pelimtnary emancipation proclamation issued in September, was runninc its assfirnd period to the beginning of the new year. A month later the final proclamation came. In cluding, the announcement that colored men of suitable condition would be received into the war aervice. The policy of emancipation and of employing black soldiers gave to the imurutuew aspect, about which boDe and fear and doubt contended in uncertain conflict. Accoiding to our political system, as a matter ot civil administration, the general gov ernment had no lawful power to effect emanci pation m any Mates, and for a long time it had been hoped tbat tbe rebellion could be suppressed without resorting to it as a military measure. It was all the while deemed nosai- ble that tbe necessitv for it might come, and that if it should, the crisis of tbe contest would then be presented. It came, and aa was intended, it was followed bv dark and doubtful days. hleven months having now passed, we are permitted to take another review. Tbe rebel borders are pressed still further back, and by tbe complete opening of the Missisaippi river, tbe country dominated over by the rebellion is divided into distant parts, ith do practical communication between them. Tennessee and Arkansas have been substantially cleared oi insurgent control and influence, and tbe citizens in each, owners of slaves and advo cates of slavery at the beginning of tbe rebel lion, now declare openly lor Emancipation in their respective States. Of these States not included in the Emancipation Proclamation, Maryland and Missouri, neither of which. three years ago, would tolerate any restraint upon the extension of slavery Into the new territories, only dispute now as to tbe best mode of removing it within their own limits. Ot those who were slaves at tbe beginning of the rebellion, foil one hundred thousand are now in the United States millitary service, about one-halt ot which number actually bear arms in the ranks thus giving tbe double advan tage ol takiug so much labor from tbe insur gent catiso, and supplying tbe places, which otherwise must be tilled with so manv white men. So far as tested it is difficult to say that they are not as good soldiers aa any. No servile insurrection or tendency to violence or cruelty bas marked tbe measures of emanci pation and arming. Tbe blacks these measures have been much discusscd in.foreign countries. Contemporary with such discussion tbe tone of public sentiment there is mnch improved. At home the lame measures have been fullv disccussed, siipported,critisized, and denounc ed ; and tbe annual elections following are highly encouraging to those whose official duty it is to bear tbe conntry through this great trial. Thus we have the new reckoning. The crisis which threatened to divide th friends of tbe Union is past. Looking now to tbe present and future, and with reference to a resumption ot the nation al authority within the States wherein' tbat authority bas been suspended, I have thought fit to Issue a proclamation, a copy of which Is tierewitn transmitted. On examination of this proclamation it will appear as is believed that nothing is attempted beyond what is am ply justified by the Constitution. True, tbe form of an oatb is given, but no man la rn. erced to take it. A man is only promised a pardon in case be voluntarily takes tbe oath. The constitution authorizes the Executive to grant or withhold the pardon at his own ab solute discretion, and this includes tbe power to grant on terms as is fully established by judicial and other authorities. It is also proffered that if In any of the. States named. a State Government shall be in . the mode prescribed set np, such government ' shall be recognized and guarantied by the . United States, and tbat under it the Stat ' shall, on the constitutional conditions.be pro tected against invasion and domestic violence' The Constitutional obligation of the United ' States to guarantee to every State in tbe ' Union a republican form of government and ( to protect the State in tbe cases stated, is ex plicit and full. But why tender tbe. benefits of this provision only to a State Government set up in this particular way 1 This section of the Constitution contemplates a case where in tbe element within a State favorable to a Republican Government In tbe Union, may ' be too feeble for an opposite and hostile ele-' : ment, external to and even within tbe State ;' and such are thefcases with which we are now dealing. An attempt to guarantee and4pro-' tect a revised State Government constructed, in wboie or in preponderating part from the '. very element against whose hostility and vlo- ' lence it is to be protected, is simnlv absurd. '.' There must be a test by which to seperate the opposing elements so as to build only from tbe sound and that test is a sufficient liberal ' one, which accepts as sonnd, whoever will make a sworn recantation of his former un- ' soundness.1 " ' But if it be proper to require as a test ot ad- 1 mission to the political body an oath of alle- ' ziance to the Constitution of th TTnit " : States, and to the Union nnder it, why also to tne laws ana proclamations In tezard to sla- very 7 ".; ' ' " ' ' ' Those laws and proclamations were cut forth ' for tbe pnrpose ot aiding In' the suppression v tug uguimuui iu xive mem me imieaa. effect there bad to be a pledge for their main- . tainance.
