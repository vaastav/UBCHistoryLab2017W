(By the Associated Press) The effort to find an acceptable substitute for the Anglo-Japanese alliance has so diverted attention of many arms delegates as to throw even the auestion of the na val ratio temporarily Into the back ground. Both the Japanese and the British have shown a desire to Include the United States in any entente that may replace the alliance and a tentative treaty draft under consideration by some governments concerned woujd provide a quadruple arrangement, al so including France. - What may have been the attitude of the American delegations in the behind-the-scenes developments, re mains a mystery. Taking the position that no entente suggestion is "formal ly" before them, the Americans refuse pa ion In a Far Eastern agreement. In the absence of a formal indica tion of the American viewpoint, the impression is gained by the other del egates that the Americans are feeling their way cautiously as they seek to ascertain what course would be in Re cord with American opinion.

These considerations are being weighed carefully by the foreign del egates who desire to have the United States a party to the next Far East ern concert of nations. Meantime, some clue to help solve the riddle may be given by the senate Speculation as to what course the ne gotiations may take Is growing among senators and several have indicated they might seek in a senate debate to bring the question of an entente more conspicuously before the house. Naval ratio negotiations still are at. a standstill while the Japanese dele gates await word from Tokio.

IRE GOLQRADD MINES SUSPEND Court DEMOCRATS IN HOUSE ATTACK HARDING TALK President Flayed For Scant Attention to Legislation To Reward Soldiers G.O.P. DEFENDS LEADER Mondell Declares President's Message Pledges Co-Oper-ation With Congress WASHINGTON, Dec. 6. Quick re action to President Harding's message was evidenced in the house during an afternoon of rambling debate. Urging prompt passage of soldier bonus legislation, Representative Gal livan, Democrat, Massachusetts,, de clared the men who won the war re ceived but "scant attention" In the message. Representative Huddleston, Demo crat, Alabama, asserted that the pres ident, in his attitude toward labor, had "learned nothing from the past," but "proposes to hold on to the old system, the old struggle between the employer and the man who works for him." Representative Mondell, Republican leader, was quick to reply asserting that he had never heard so many "ex travagant and misleading statements." Mondell charged that the Alabama member had misrepresented the pres ident's position and had made it ap pear that Harding had gone out of his way to express"' views .unfavorable to labor.' '- ' , ''' - V. ji-.x -.v Lauding;'5th- message' generally, as one of "conviction ana full of frank ness and candor," Mondell said tnat throughout it ran a spirit of cordial co-partnership and co-operation with congress." While Representative Garrett, Ten nessee acting Democratic leader, did not discuss the message on the floor, j in a format Btatemeni ne aeciarea u was "wholly lacking In force" and that there was nothing of leadership or in the nature of an appealing call in it. "The president's attitude upon the question of giving the notice as to abrogation of commercial treaties re quired by the Jones shipping act, is at once commendable and laughable," he said. "As a senator, he twice voted for these provisions. As a candidate for president ,he did not hesitate to make insinuating criticism against Mr. Wilson because the latter stated he would not give the notice. As pres ident, he acknowledges he was wrong in his action as senator and is content to toe the mark of Mr. Wilson's . tracks." j
