THE WILMINGTON MESSENGER, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 12. 190o 2 Site M mtmtr. COMMENTS OX THE MESSAGE I n order to show how the president's message struck tlie democratic mind we give below some extracts from the editorial of the leading state demo cratic papers on the message. : To show that the president's position on the question of federal controi of interstate freight rates is good ucino tratie doctrine we take the following from the Italeigh News and Observer; Failure to enact such legislation as Is demanded In the democratic nation al platform and in the president's mes sage would be failure to do the press ins dutv of the hour. Then comes that sterling democratic paper, the Charlotte News, which is al ways ready to battle for the rights of the people against the encroachment of the big -oriKrations and the mem bers of plutocracy. That paper has this to say of the message: There are many thiners of vital In-tf-rest to the south embodied in the message. In fact bv far too many to receive special notice in oar editorial space. Wt heartily approve of the presi dent's views on the attention that should be paid confederate veterans who died under northern skies. Much money has been spent in comraomor atinjr the deeds of federal soldiers and vast amounts have been uaid out in pensions to federal soldiers, while it has always been apparent that con federate veterans have been somewhat slighted. So we hail with delfsrht the president's iniunction to congress in this respect. , Another part of the message that is of particular interest to the vouth is his attitude on the immigration Ques tion. Mr. Roosevelt is right ?n his warning to the imprecautious admis sion of immigrants who are unfit for citizenship. He is also right in his statement that we are seriously in need of immigrants of the right kind. In his message, the president point ed out the need the south has today for the better class of immigrants who will settle in, her midst and aid in the development of our country. We wel come the best and most industrious clashes of immigrants to our borders. The entire message is of vital inter est and should be read carefully. Then we find the following comment mi the message in that sound demo cratic paper the Charlotte Chronicle: President Roosevelt's message to the present congress is perhaps the longest document ever sent to that fcody. yet it will be more generally read, perhaps, than anv previous mes sasre. on account of the importance of th. ouestion.s discussed and the gen eral interest of the people to learn the president's views on them. The Ques tion of rate legislation heads the list and is the feature of the message. The president, it will be observed, consid ers this one of the gravest perils of the country and urges congress to take notion on it. The tariff he side tracks until after the railroad rate matter is disposed of. which indicates a hope on part of the republicans that the tariff Question may not bother them much, after all. No doubt hi'1, vvc the t'.nie wo could find in many it!;?r democratic papers of the stale equally as commendatory comments on tlu message. Tin .-e conimendations of the message to congress of a republican president appearing in the democratic papers of the south show a change as wonderful as it is cjinmendable in the sentiments of the people of the souih toward the republican party. It shows that1 our people have at last come to look upon the issues which divide the partiesas political and not sectional or personal; that when the opposing party ad vances any theory or principle which has merit in it our people can recog nize that merit and give that party credit for its good intentions; that the day has passed when party fealty -demands that all democrats hall look upon every proposition advanced by the republicans as wrong and pernici ous just because it is a republican measure and that the south feels that it is false to its traditions whenever it admits that any good to the country can come from any other source than the headquarters of the democratic party. ' We do not endorse all of Mr. Roose velt s message. 'Hi ere are many things in it of which we do not approve; still we arc glad to see that southern dem--ocratic papers do not reject it in toto just because it is the declaration of a president who is the leader of the re publican party. Tins shows that we are getting back on the old political lines where difference of opinion as to government policy and not geographi cal lines divided the jeople politically.

BUILD RACE TRACK Party of Gentlemen Subscribe Stock for Half 3tlle Track to be Built on Mr. Jacob F. Parrott's Farm. It is now practically certain that Kinston will soon have a race track. Sufficient money has, been subscribed uv a number of gentlemen interest ed in good horse flesh to assure the early buildinsr of a track beyond the river on Mr. Jacob F. Parrott's farm, and Sir. Parrott has signified hi3 wil lingness for the track to. he built there- Mr. P. S. B. Harper has en gaged to build the track and there Is nothing1 in the way now. so far as known, to interfere with the consum mation of .the plan. The track will be an oblong or oval track. -a' half mile circuit, and graded properly. It will have the effect to encourage the bringing into this sec tion good horses. There are some few prett-g-ood horses in this section now, which with the advantages of race " track training" would develop good speed.- Kinston Free Press. TJIE GREENSBORO TRAGEDY. As announced in The Messenger the mayor of Greensboro, who presii at the preliminary trial of Dr. Mat thews, charged with the murder oi his wife, bound the defendant ove to the superior court without the priv ilege of baiL The superior court ol that county convenes next Monday and we suppose this case will be trico during that term. There is notalus In the way of both sides being prepar ed for trial. There are only a few witnesses. There can hardly be any delay because of the absence of wit.-. nesses. There is no question as to the cause of the death of the unfortunate! woman. The indications are that the defen dant will admit the killing in the. manner charged by the state and wilt base his defense an the plea off insani ty. This insanity, it is said, has been caused by the excessive use of liquor, drugs and tobacco. Generally in this state it is as easy for a man, charged with murder to get off on the plea of insanity as on that of self-defense. What the mental conditions of this man now are or were at the time ot the homicide we do not know. If he was really insane at the time of com mitting the deed he should not suffer the legal penalty for murder. We dc not wish to prejudice the case. He should have a fair and impartial trial But we do think that the plea ol insanity is allowed too great latitude! in our courts. The question in estab lishing a man's guilt or innocence when charged with such a crime should be whether he had mina enough to knew that what he did was wrong or not. Too many men are allowed to go unpunished for their crimes because it is established that they are of unsound mind un sound in some particulars. There are many persons vho are insane on some subjects, but perfectly sane on others persons who on some subjects are' lunatics but who know as well asj persons of the healthiest mind that L is wrong to take the life of a fellow being. When such person commits murder he should be held to the same accountability as any one whose mndj is sound and unclouded on all suh-i jects. A man who knows what thej word murder means and who knows! that it is wrong to take the life a! fellow being should not be allowed to' escape the penalty of such a deed just because he is mentally unsound on some other subjects. Our law isr en tirely too lax in this respect. IrJ its sympathy for the accused it for gets the victim and overlooks the possibility of repetition of the crime. As it is. we have more men in the navy today than in the entire army in 1S98. It if time for this craze to be checked and for a return to the good old American idea that our navy is for defense and police purposes only. Mr Bonaparte will be entitled to the thanks of the nation if he can block the waste of money op battleships. New York Evening Post. That's somewhat the kind of navy we had when the war with Spain be gan, and there was uneasiness all along our Atlantic coast from Mainej to Florida. Every seacoast city feared that a Spanish squadron would sho-v up any day. We do not want any more like that in our's. We say gives us a navy that will protect American shipping and American seaports. We are indebted to the Ennis Pub lishing Company, of Raleigh, for a copy of Turner's North Carolina Al manac for the year 190G. This is the sixty-ninth year that this old reliable has been sent out to the people of this state. We do not see how the people of North Carolina could get along without this almanac, which has been such a familiar and useful article in so many households for nearly three quarters of a century- it has become a standard book of reference to thou sands of our people. It is issued by the Ennis Publishing Company of Ra leigh and the price is only ten cents aj copy. What would the American people think if the whole caoinet officers and all the high officials under them would send in their resignations in on batch? There would be an immediate and universal cry for increase of ca pacity of our lunatic asylums. The Industrial News and The Tar Heel have made a good start. Tho Greensboro, Record says: We congratulate The Industrial News and The Tar Heel. The latter has already had judgment recorded! against it in a court of justice and the lormer has four libel suits on hand. Senator Depew resigns his seat cn! the directorate of the Equitable In- suranee Company, but we do not heart anything about his following this up with retirement from the senate though the former most probably was the more lucrative position. Wonder if Congressman Brownlows bill providing for the establishment of q. home for negroes- in Washington is in consequence of Ex-Reverend Thomas i Dixon's demand that the ne groes of the south shall be coloured Our republican friends still .insist that ex-Governor Aycock shall tackle Senator Simmons for the seat In the senate in 1909. When all the negroes of the south are moved to Washington we suppose the seat of government will be 'trans ferred to some other point.
