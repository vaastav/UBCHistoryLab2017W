In the vote of the Hartford church to sustain Its anarchist pastor, twenty men and twenty-nine women voted to retain Mr. Kimball as pastor, while thirty men and nine women voted to dismiss him. If only tho men had voted Mr. Kimball would have been dismissed by a three lilths vote. As voters the Hartford ladles CO for men before, principles. Conventions of all sorts are tho proper thine jst now. One of the latest called is the national pure food convention which will meet in Washington in January. It principal object will be to Induce Congress to take measures to prevent tho adulter ation of foods and medicines. The mis sion is a praiseworthy one for the evil which the society seeks to correct is wide spread. A majority of the 0000 bills Introduced; at the last session of Cungress were pri vate bills, and less than six per cent were finally disposed of. (Many of these will be reintroduced, and reinforced by as many more, during the coming session. The time may vry likely come when it will be found advisable to devise some method for relieving Congress from tho burden of considering purely private bills. Kveryoueof tho larger cities in the country is trying to becuro one or more of the national conventions next year, but the members of the national committees nre as a rule very reticent about express ing their preferences. New York is not likely to get the democratic convention because a New York man will be nom inated. Should indications point to some Western man as the nominee of the re publicans, as now seems possible, what place id the Kast oilers better advantages than Saratoga ? The most easily moved man in Vermont is Robert G, Richardson, who has just sold his tarm in Bollsford and moved for the 30th time In 35 years Philadelphia Ledger, Of course any man who owns a form in bucli a visionary town as "Bollsford" has to be continually on the move to llnd it. Some papers are still discussing the need of u universal uniform decimal cur rency and decimal system of time measure ment. This is illustrated In a new clock which has been put up at Wiesbaden. This clock divides the day into ten hours, the hour into ten decades, the decade into ten minutes, the minute into ten seconds, .uid Becond into ten rays. Similar units take the place of the usual degrees, min utes and seconds in the division ot the circle. As long as the metric system of weights and measuresand thetwetity-lour o'clock idea do not meet with more popu lar approval it is useless to push further Innovations in this line.

Atlantic. Tlie national Legislature of France, consisting of Senate and Cham ber of Deputies, has the power to change the constitution, to abolish the republic, to e3tabli-,li monarchy, to 1111 the presi dential ollice or to abolish it altogether. There are no limits to its powers and uo bounds to its possible action. The men who meet in its session may bo wild to hold in their hands the tato of the nation. It would not be easy to persuade the American people to entrust such a power to a body of borne (W0 men. A Concord despatch to the Boiton Ad vcrtUer says that tho Northern New Hampshire lirailroad is practically leased to the Boston and Maine, and the latter will within a few months make a trallic arrangement with tho Concord. The Central Vermont is committed to some bort of an arrangement with tho Boston and Maine, and it is piedicted that within hlx months the latter will control the two lineH to Montreal via the Passumpslc and the Ceutral Vermont. "Tlio sale of the Huthind to tho Delaware and Hud son," says the despatch, "was with the knowledge and consent of tho Boston and Mane, which has uo use for it."

The annua) report of tho comptroller ot the currency does not seem to Indicate much fear that the national banking sys tern wllj all go to pieces when tho govern ment bonds shall have all beou caned in.

Of the new banks, (lvo were organized in New Kugland and New Kngland is responsible for but one of the lit) failures. The net Increase of capital for tho year is $30,572,325. but on the other hand there is a net decrease of SCO, 495,500 in the circulation rep resented by bonds. The most Important of the chauges recommended by Comptrol ler Trenholm Is that tlio minimum amount ot bonds to be deposited as secur ity for circulation shall be ten per cent of the capital ot banks of not over 250,000, and seven per cent for banks of which the capital exceeds $250,000 ; also that the semi-annual duty on circulation be here atter charged only on the amount Issued upon bonds deposited in excess of the minimum amount as above. He also recommends that national bank notes should be counted as part of the lawful reserve of bauks. A Just Itelmke. A peculiar kind of snobbery that has for sometime prevailed in soma circles of fashionable American society, paiticu larly In and near the larger cities, has met with a very mortifying rebuke. A young man who had been for months palming himself oft on the good people of Newark, N. .1., as Lord Courtenay was, the other day, discovered to bo an imposter and dead-beat who had worked his game in Baltimore and New York until lie was detected and driven away from those cit ies. Arriving lu Newark, with bonie good clothes and some forged letters of intro duction he was at once taken into the circle of the "upper ten" there dined and wined and made a social lion generally. In return for these favors he broke many fair hearts ; borrowed money right and left from his gullible admirers, and, when exposed, very quietly disap peared: He was not uccivtd and petted because he was especially bright or well educated or intellectual, or a model young mony lu any way. These fashionable people in three cities made much of him because he was believed to be connected with the British aristocracy. They have found out their mistake in a very hu militatiug way and, his creditors, at least, have bought their experience at serious cost. The episode ought to serve as a lesson to American Anglo-maniacs; UNU DOLIiAll will now buy tlie "Weekly Free Press one your. Tell your friends. The President's Message. Mr. Cleveland bus done wisely in com plying with the advice which some of the papers gave him awhile ago to omit the customary rehash of tho department reports, and go straight at the matters concerning which he had any recommen dations to make. It was hardly necessary for him to argue so elaborately the need of a a re duction ol the revenue and of tho .surplus. Republicans and democrats, wltli a lew individual exception,, are agreed r hat the surplus should be reduced and that it is not wise to continue to raise so much more money than is needed for the sup port of the government. Almost all, also, are agreed that there miut ne a readjust meut of tlio tariff and a reduction of some of the dtitle". The practical question is whether the reductions shall be made from the point of view and according to the methods of tne free trader, or fr-im the point of view and according to methods which commend themselves to the friends of protection of Ameican Industry. Mr. Cleveland's attitude on the sub ject, is in the main that of the free trade democracy. He would admit fiee nearly all the raw materials uied in manufac tures. His arguiueut on the subject of free wool will not commend itself to the fanners. Ho embodies iu It the oft-exploded assertion that the duty is iu all cases added to the cost of tho manufac tured article and paid by the consumer. On the contrary, as has been so often shown, the effect of free trade is often to raise the prices of the manufactured ar tide. Ia the long run, tills is tho way it works. When the duty Is taken off the foreign manufacturer employing chesp labor is able to undersell the American manufacturer. The latter oes out"' tho business. Having thus got control of the American market the foreign nianutact urer puts up the prices of his goods and tho consumer must pay more for them than he did before the duty was taken oir. Yet tho American manufacturer dare not start his mill again , lor ho would bo again broken down by the process which proved effectual before. On the other hand protection, by stimulating homo in dustry, secures a healthy homo compe tition, and coupled with the Inveuiive genius of our people in tlio introduction of improved machinery, often results in a heavy reduction of prices to consumers. If there are American manufactures bo firmly established that they are beyond fear of disaster from foreign competition and tho pauper labor of the old world, let the duties which have fostered them ho reduced ; but let the reduction bo shaped by the true friends of American industry. The Cuhiiicl Changes havo been so fully forestalled that tho announcementof them creates no surprise and but languid Interest. The worst tiling about them, no doubt, Is the elevation of Mr. Lamar to tlio bench ot tlio Supremo Court. Tills cannot bo culled a lit ap pointment, for a Judge of the Supremo Court should bo pre-eminently a lawyer. .Mr. Lutnar, according to tho testimony of eminent lawyers, knows no law. Hu has been described as "a lawyer who never had a case, a soldier who never fought a battle, a professor who never was gradu ated from n college, a diplomatist who never was successful, and a senator whose own Statu renucsted him to rc'slgtl his high representative ollice." Tho fact that ho silenced a witness by threats and a murderous assault In a Southern court room, sotno years ago, docs not indi cate a judicial temperament, and his ago is rccagnized as a tcrlous objection, though hi to this there Is u curious uncer tainty. He, It la reported, says he Is sixty three years old. Lanniau's Dictionary of Congress, in its earlier editions, says he was bom In 18211. Tho Washington cor respondent of the Boston Transcript says "tho records of tho time of Ills congres sional servine before the rebellion indicate that ho Is sixty-eight." If It shall be made to appear that tho Dictionary of Congress or the Tramcrlpt correspondent Is right, his confirmation will rub hard. It other wise lit, it would not be good polley to place on the bench a man who will iu two years reach the ago of retirement.

Did you ever fall down stairs Iu dream ? If you have, you must have observed that It is a much more terrible experience than falling down stairs when you are awake except that you dou't have the bruises .to nurse afterward. But tlio mental experience of falling down stairs in a dream is some thing awful. Coasting down cellar on a bar of soap Is nothing compared with it. Then there is another curious thing about dreams. They repeat themselves. like h'story. Tho same old dream pos sibly lu a slightly diirerent form keeps coming around once iu so often. Perhaps you dou't recognize it at llrst, but after It has sat ou your bosom for a while, or, If a nightmare has given you a familiar kick or two, you begin to think that yon havo seen It before. fter a person gets to be about 20 years old there is nothing new under the bun (or mooiu In dreams. They aro all chestnuts, and those that follow mince pio are all horse chestnuts. Some of them come around ofteuer than others, and you get really attached to them. If you don't dream them about once a mouth you be gin to get low.splrlted and think that there Is something the matter with your diges Hon. And now this disquisition must be closed with a pointer, viz.: There is nothing like judicious abuse of the stom ach for the man who enjoys real exciting dreams with some plot to them. I
