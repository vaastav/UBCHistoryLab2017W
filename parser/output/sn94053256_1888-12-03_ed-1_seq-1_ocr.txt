VOL. 1. NO. 308. WATEEBURYy CONN., MONDAY, DEC 3, 1888. PRICE . TWO CENTS. THE NATIONAL SOLONS. The Fiftieth Congress Near ing the End. SOME ENTERTAINING REPORTS. A Republican Majority In the Next House. - Secretary Endicott Urge Increased De fense Our Postal System the Best In the World The National Coinage. "Washington, Dec. 3. The Washington Post, which for a long time claimed a major ity in the next house for the Democratic 'party now "admits that the Republicans will have the disputed Tennessee district and at least one of the four districts in "West Vir ginia, and that the roll of the house will bear the names of 166 Republicans and 159 Demo crats a Republican majority of 7. The Fiftieth congress met to-day at noon to begin its second and final session. It is expected that this will .be one of the busiest sessions in the history of congress. "When congress agreed to a recess less than two months ago there was untouched on the calendars of both houses much important legislation. It is not possible that all of this will be disposed of, as the discussion of the annual appropriation bills will occupy much of the time of the house and senate between Dec. 3 and March 4. . It is not expected that much progress will be made during the coming week withthe busi ness of the session. In the senate, the unfin ished business is the finance committee's sub stitute for the Mills tariff bill. "When congress adjourned, Senator Allison, who was in charge of the bill, gave notice that when congress should again assemble he would insist on the senate devoting its time to the tariff ques tion, to the exclusion of all other business, until it had been disposed of. It was even understood that there would be no recess at Christmas .time if the bill had not been disposed of. Conditions have changed since congress adjourned, and although no policy has been formally discussed by the members of the ruling party in the senate, it is con sidered possible that the tariff measure will be laid aside after a further discussion to ive the senate opportunity to consider other business. ; To-day, of course, will be devoted to the president's message. The house is prevented by its own rules from taking up any of the unfinished busi ness of last session for six days after its first meeting, with the exception of such as may have been made a special order for a particu lar day. There is no special order for the ' coming week. Besides the tariff question, which is the most important bit of unfinished business on the calendars of congress, there are to be ' considered bills for the admission of Dakota, ': "Washington and other of the territories; the Blair educational bill, which sleeps in the room of the house educational committee; several pension bills, and a large number of : measures of interest to certain localities or sections will be urged for consideration. ; 

SECRETARY ENDICOTT'S ANNUAL REPORT. Secretary Endicott, in his annual report, alludes feelingly to the death of Gen. Sheri dan, which he says deprived the army of a chief pre-eminently fitted for such command, whose wide experience, ready resources, and personal qualities - made him a tower of Btrength in council and action. The secre tary again invites the attention of congress to the defenseless condition of our sea coast and lake fronts. For the construction of needed defenses in which to place the new guns, for which appropriations have already been made, an appropriation of $2,840,000 is - asked for. Torpedoes and submarine mines, " the secretary says, are now acknowledged by all nations to be absolutely necessary to the efficient defense of harbors and seaports, and for the purchase of these and the necessary appliances for operating them and for ex perimenting to ascertain the best of the many torpedo inventions an appropriation ; of $1,890,000 is recommended. rV Secretary Endicott renews the recommen dation made in previous reports for the ap pointment of au assistant secretary of war. Such an officer is imperatively needed, he says, for the proper and efficient adminis tration of the war department. a rr,i . , .j j k . . i ine seureuLTY m estimates oi appropriations to the war department for the year ending June 30, 1890, calls for $44,632,507. This in cludes $25,293,372 for the military establish ment and $13,785,234 for public works and river and harbor improvements. The appro priations for the last fiscal year amounted to $41,165,107, and for the current year, $59, 679.934. SECRETARY VILAS' REPORT. In his report of the department of the ia ' terior, Secretary Vilas makes the ; general recommendations that the secretary of the department be relieved of his present em barrassing complexity of duties by legisla tion permitting the further delegation of his . work to his assistants. :'- The report shows that over 8,500,000 acres , was the aggregate quantity of land for which title was passed during the year, over 800,000 acres of which were for railroad purposes. The receipts from the disposal of public lands were the largest since 1836. The report of the land office shows that over 85,000,000 acres of land have been re . stored to the public domains during the present administration, and recommends the restoration of over 65,000,000 more. Over a third of the entire report of the department is devoted to the subject of Indian affairs. It states that the general condition of the Indian people and of the department of the government directed to their, care has been satisfactory. On the subject of pensions the report pre sents a summary, showing that the amount paid for pensions during the year was nearly $79,000,000 an increase over the previous' year of $5,000,000. The incomplete report for the past year of the operations of the labor bureau shows that in the period from 1881 to 1886 the number of persons involved- in successful strikes was only 33.19 per cent, of the whole number of strikers. It is computed that, for the same period of six years, the loss to strikers was $51,814,723, and the loss to em ployes through lock out $8,157,717, or a total y . wage loss to employes of $59,972,440.

POSTAL SERVICE. ' I " Postmaster General Dickinson's annual re port presents concisely the condition and history of every branch of the postal service 1 for the fiscal rear ended June 30. 1888. with j many comparisons with previous - years, I showing a remarkable expansion of business 1 and a larg increase in expenditure. The : gross revenue for the year was $52,695,176, while the expenditures amounted to $56,885,? j 4403. The estimated deficiency is therefore $4,190,227. The deficiency for the fiscal year nded June 30, 1885, was $6,973,944; for 1886 t it was $7,166,594, and for 1887 the cash de- Hficieneies were $4,297,338. The revenue for j.$ the current .fiscal year is estimated at $62, ; 03,658, and the expenditures for . the year 5 are estimated at $65,812,073, with a probable deficiency this year of about $3,500,000. . During the past year 12,288 postmasters i were appointed 6,521 upon resignations and f commissions expired, 344 upon removals, ?. (59 to fill vacancies by death and 8,864 on es I tablishmont of new postofflces. The rail wry mail service shows an increase of 12,000 miles and a decrease of 72 per cent in the rate of cost per mile traveled. The volume of business in the money order divi sion was upward of $143,000,000, and is self sustaining, with a net profit to the govern ment of $50,000. The volume of ordinary mail matter has largely increased, and it is estimated that the revenue during the past year would have been, without reductions of postage, upwards of $70,000,000. Carefully prepared statistics are submitted in every branch of the service demonstrating in the opinion of the postmaster general increased efficiency over previous years. Carefully prepared statistics are submitted contrasting our service with that of Great Britain, Germany and France, demonstrat ing that in cheapness of postage, gross reve nue and expenditures, number of postofflces, extent of mail routes, mileage of mail service and volume of mail matter . transmitted the postal system of the United States is the leading one of the world. Among the recommendations submitted are: The ownership by the government of postoffice buildings; allowance for rent for third class postoffices; a revision of the frank ing privilege law, and that at the termina tion of existing contracts for the manufact ure of postage stamps, postal cards and stamped envelopes the government take the work into its own hands.

She Doctors the ISooks in Approved Style, Speculates, and Departs. Harrisburg, Pa., Dec. 3. The defalca tion of Miss Boletta Hoge, a clerk in the office of the collector of internal revenue in this city, is the talk of the town. She lost about $6,500 in stock speculation, and the appointment of a new collector last week alarmed her. Three bondsmen have made good the shortage in her accounts. Miss Hogo has been head clerk in the office of. the collector of internal revenue for some years. Her brother received a letter, post marked Philadelphia, in which his sister said that she was a defaulter, and had left town to avoid exposure. Miss Hoge stated in a business like way that she had taken some $6,500 during the past year, and had lost most of it in speculations. An examination of the books showed that her method was to retain some of the cash paid into the office each day, and then "doctor" the books. iv. lew aays ago jyiiss noge miormea a friend that it was her intention to take a trip to Europe, and there is an impression that she is now on the ocean. Miss Hoge has not enjoyed an enviable reputation in this city. She spent money lavishly. In the letter to her brother, from Philadelphia, she stated that the amount of the defalca tion snouia oe conectea irom a iriena, a lady wi'h whom she associated and who has a fortune by inheritance. Robertsd ale's Mine Still Flooded. Huntingdon, Pa., Dec. 3. The bitumin ous coal mines at Robertsdale, which were flooded by the sudden flow of back water, covering iorty acres', wui not again be in condition for working for some time, owing to the undermining of the tramways and other damage incident to the washout The course of the water was changed from the mines by digging an artificial bed and run ning the current in an opposite direction; but in spite of this, though effecting the re lease of the colliers, a steady flow of water is still running through the mines. Two Worthington pumps, weighing 5,000 and 7,300 pounds, have been in constant service night and day, but the water still comes pouring in. The forced Idleness of the miners will entail a very serious loss to them at this season. The company's loss to property can not be ascertained. Another Lunatic Loose, New Bedford, Mass., Dec 3. For two weeks past an unknown man has frequented the center of the city after dark, and .as saulted ladies who have been on the streets without an escort, striking them with soffl- cient force to prostrate them. On Thursday evening he knocked Mrs. John Robbing down twice, and she has since been confined to her bed with nervous -prostration. Saturday evening Mrs. Annie T. Soule was seized by the man, butshe struck him in the face, and screamed so louaiy tnac tne- leuow was frightened away. The police have not been able to get on the track of the scoundrel, and a reign of terror prevails among the ladies. Disinfecting Jacksonville. Jacksonville, Fla., Dec. 3. For twenty four hours two new cases of yellow fever are reported and no deaths. Total cases to date. 4,699; deaths, 410. The work of disinfection began this morning. For bed clothing, blankets and wearing apparel three large cylindrical vats have been, prepared, where the infected articles will be thoroughly puri fied with boiling water. The preparations for the disinfection of all articles which can possibly contain germs of the fever are very thorough, and the work is being performed in the most careful manner under the super vision of the United States Maritime hopital service officers. Favorable for Winter Wheat. Washington Dec 8. The weather crop bulletin issued announces that the weather has been especially -favorable for winter wheat, during November the deficiency in moisture having been replaced by abundant rains. . DROVE OFF WHITE CAPS. An Ohio Farmer Who Would Not be Terrorized." THE WARNING AND THE REPLY. Suvronnded by Armed ' Farmer Drives Them 'Reformers," .the Off A Relative Bound and Guarded During the Attempt to Capture the Defender of His Home. Chicago, Dec 8. Eddison Vance, of Rut land, Vt, is visiting friends in Washington boulevard. For nearly three weeks he had been staying at the home of his uncle, Aaron Vance, who lives near Sardinia, O., at present the scene of "White Cap" out rages. Mr. Vance says he had a thrilling experience with the ruffians, and was handled roughly by them. The story in his own words is as follows: I arrived at Sardinia the night of Nov. My uncle,- whose farm is about three miles from the town, met me at the depot with a horse and buggy. We started for his home shortly after 9 o'clock. The road was lonesome. The greater part of the way lay through a valley; and the hills are heavily timbered. A.bout a mile from the town a man on horseback passed us. His head was enveloped with a white cloth, and he was riding at a terrific pace. My uncle said: 'There goes one of those cursed white Caps. Somebody will get whipped to-night.' Our conversation naturally continued on this subject, and my uncle asserted that he proposed to put a stop to their outrages if it cost him every dollar he possessed. He talked loudly and bitterly against the White Caps, and it is likely that his words were over heard, for on opening the door the next morning I saw, fixed to the handle on a sharp pointed knife, a rough drawing of a human heart, the weapon stuck through its center. In the left hand upper corner were the skull and cross bones, and in the opposite corner the picture of a coffin. Below .was an in scription which read : " 'Aaron Vance, you'd better be careful as to what you says and dose. This is a warnin'. If you try to do us harm you will get the worst of It. 

WHITE UAPS. On the steps was a bundle of beeoh switches, and attached to the cord that held them together was a tag, on which was written: 'Weapons of Reform.' I woke my uncle and showed the warning and the bundle of whips. "After breakfast he announced his inten tion of going into town and purchasing fire arms. He returned in the afternoon with two shotguns, three revolvers and a quantity of ammunition. Then he pasted a notice on the fence facing the road that he did not fear all the White Caps in Christendom, and would never rest until he had hung a few of them. The next morning another notice was stuck on the front door, which read : " 'We will call on you within ten days.' "My uncle engaged the services of a man named Harwick to watch the premises. On the fourth night he called us and said the White Caps were surrounding the house. We arose and dressed hurriedly. Arming ourselves we went to the front window. I should judge there were thirty masked horse men in the yard or near it. 'Who are you, and what do you want?' asked my uncle. The foremost horseman replied: 'We want vou, and we are going to have you.' " 'All right,' replied the old man ; 'come on.' ""With that he raised his shotgun and fired into the middle of the group. There was a yell, and a man fell from his horse. They picked him up, and all turned and gal loped away. In about two hours we heard them returning. We were ready for them. We had loaded the guns with small bird shot, and as they dashed into the yard we did not hesitate to fire at them. The volley seemed to rattle -- them. Again they went away. We heard nothing for three days. I supposed they had got enough and would let us alone. The third night about lu o'ciock we neara a noise in the barn, and Harwick and I went to see what was the matter. I never thought of White Caps. We left my uncle with an old woman servant alone in the house. We had hardly left the house before I was struck down, and three men, their faces covered with masks, were on top of me. At my side Harwick was suffering the same violence. They bound us with cords and half carried and half led us to the barn. One of them said to us: " 'We moan you no harm if you keep still. We're going to teach Aaron a Tesson to keep his tongue tied." "Then all but one went away. The man left with us took a seat about ten feet away and never took his eye from us. In a short time we heard the report of a gun and then followed a perfect fusilade. Shot after shot was fired, and I remember wondering how my uncle managed to load and fire so rapidly. A few minutes later a man opened the barn door and beckoned to our guard. He imme diately left us, and we did not see him again. It was broad daylight when my uncle opened the barn door and cut the ropes that bound us. He explained that he did not dare to come out of the house before. I was so stiff that it was some time before I could move my limbs. - My uncle told the story of the assault and how, by the aid of the old servant, who loaded the guns, he had been able to fire so rapidly. Two days before I left my uncle got a letter, which saia mat tne vvnite japs wouia have re venge if it took all winter. I tried to induce him to go away until the gang had been brought to justice, but the old man said he would fight the battle out from his own castle While I was at my uncle's some neighbors were whipped, though innocent of any disregard of public morals." A Murderous Infantile Mimic Harlan, la., Dec S. A farmer named Coffin an was butchering hogs, and his two sons, aged 5 and 3, watched him with great interest. The elder asked the younger to come out and he would show him how hogs were butchered. He struck the little fellow a blow on the head with a hammer and then stuck a long piece of glass in his throat, in flicting a wound from which he died. Brutally Murdered. New York, Dec 3. Patrick Kelly, gar dener on the estate of J. C. Lott, at Park yille, L. L, was murdered and robbed Satur day night and his body left on the railroad track. It is supposed that the murder was committed by tramps. The murder was a most brutal one. The skull was mashed to pieces, and blood spattered for twelve feet about the scene. . lie Is Not Tascott. Louisville, Dec 3. A careful effort to identify Dickerson, who is in jail at French burg, charged with being Tascott, found that he did not have the scars given in the de scriptiaa of the Chicago murderer. Dickerson admits being a criminal. He Was Tired of Life. . Scrakton, Pa., Dec. 8. Olney P. Pratt, aged 79. a peddler of patent medicine, com mitted suicide by shooting. He was tired of life. CAMPBELL SPEAKS POSITIVELY. He Asserts That Mr. Allison Has Been, Offered a- Cabinet Position. Lima, O., Dec 8. F. . T. Campbell, who was elected state railroad commissioner of Iowa by the handsome majority of 60,000, Is visiting in the city, and being a bosom and confidential friend of Senator Allison was interviewed last evening as to Mr. Allison's recent visit to Gen. Harrison. Mr. Campbell said: "It can be put down - for a certainty that Senator Allison -has been invited to President Harrison's cabinet, and that the portfolio offered to him is that of secretary of the treasury. ILs accession would be ea, pecially gratifying to the great west, where he is universally popular. It would be a new departure on financial questions, as Wall street has dictated the financial policy of the nation ever since the war. . The single standard policy of the present administra tion, the efforts of both the President and the secretary of the treasury to destroy silver as circulating med.. i, coupled with Mr. Manning's recommendation against the issue of greenbacks coming into the treasury, waa distasteful to the double standard advocates all over the country, and was the direct cause of the defeat of Weaver, Anderson and other Independent congressmen ' in the west, who favored Cleveland's election, and resulted ia the return of the scattering remnant of the greenback party in the west to the Repub lican party. 'In the cabinet Mr. Allison would be one of the president's most confidential and trusty advisers. Of large experience in gov ernment affairs, he is recognized as one of the foremost financiers of the nation, not even excepting Sherman. In the senate his advice and counsel have beenj universally sough and accepted as the highest author ity. That he will accept the treasury port folio is probably true, but no other place would tempt him. As chairman of the sen ate committee on appropriation he occupies a most exalted position, more lnnuentiai than a cabinet position, and with the rap idly developing condition of the west Mr. Allison will come to the front with a formid able following as a presidential candidate to succeed Mr. Harrison." A 

DANGEROUS QUESTION. This Is What Senator Ingalls Says of the Race Problem in the South Disfran chisement an Impossibility. Atlanta, Ga., Dec. 3. The Constitution's Washington correspondent asked Senator Ingalls what effect the election would have upon the southern question. "The race question at the south remains as it has always been and, for the next genera tion, at least, will continue, to be, the most important and formidable in our politics. The change from slavery to freedom, from subordination to legal equality, has com plicated, instead of simplified, the situation. So far from solvmg the fatal problem, it has added ne elements of difficulty and danger,'' "Is any immediate adjustment probable?" "Unless history is a false teacher it is not possible for two distinct races not homogene ous that is, which cannot assimilate by in termarriage and the mingling of blood to exist upon terms of practical political equal ity under the same government. One or the other must go to the wall." . - "Do you consider the two races homogene ous?" "Whether the Anglo-Saxon and the negro races are homogeneous l ao not pretenq to say, but the evidence is clear that the mu lattoes are disappearing in the south. The blacks are growing blacker, the whites are growing whiter. This shows that the con nection between races while the blacks were enslaved was not voluntary on their part and is ceasing with their freedom. The pretext upon which suffrage is denied the blacks in the south is that the race is not capable of self government, and that its supremacy would result in the degradation and destruction of society and the state. I don't distrust the sincerity or candor of the southern whites. They probably believe what they affirm, but I have no doubt they have deliberately determined to eliminate the negro from their politics, and upon the ground, they reason, of their superior intelli gence, wealth and morality. "What is the feeling at the north?" "There is no malevolence or hatred towards the south in northern people so far as I have heard or known on account of the war. If that sentiment ever existed it has disappeared. There is no disposition to interfere in local or state government in the south, but they made the mistake of attempting to force by the same methods a hostile policv upon a people whose interests were vitally involved, and that are, in some respects, not wholly in accord with their own." "What will probably be the course of President Harrison?" "I have no information whatever about the policy of the new administration toward the south. I am as radical and aggressive as the average Republican and have been the subject of some picturesque criticism from our southern friends for venturing to protest against their methods, but I should not favor any vindictive, intolerant or prescriptive legislation. No race has ever been deprived of rights and prerogatives once solemnly conferred. The experiment has gone too far to be recalled. If the two races are hetero genous and can never become assimilated, their education, the acquisition of property and mental development intensify instead of diminish the dangers." 

CONGRESSMAN KILGORE'S OPINION. "We Must Accept the Enfranchised Negro and Make the Best ot Him." "Washington, Dec 3. Representative Kilgore, of Texas, arrived here yesterday. Speaking of the result of the election, he said: "Mr. Harrison- is going to give us a conservative, business-like, administration. I do not expect any harsh measures toward the south to be proposed; by him. I do not think he wants to do it, and I do not think he would dare do so if he did want to. The great business interests of the country will not tolerate any renewal of old time disturbances in the south. The negro ques tion is a very serious one. There is no doubt about that. Especially is it so in states like Alabama,Mississippi and Louisiana, In Texas I do no think we are so deeply concerned about it. In some counties where there is a large negro vote an agreement has been made to divide up the offices between the whites and the blacks the whites taking all the offices in any way connected with finance, the blacks in some cases going to the legis lature." "Then you would not disfranchise the negro, if you could?" "I certainly would not now propose that as a remedy for the condition of affairs in the south. We might as well accept the en franchised negro and make the best of him," he concluded Valuable Relic Burned. Philadelphia, Dec 3. A fire broke out in the room of Cavalry Post No. 85, G. A. R., and the contents, consisting of a large collection of old battle flags, relics of the battle field and portraits of eminent military men, were entirely destroyed. The post room was rated the best furnished quarters in the state, and the most valued relics can not be replaced. The fire originated from, a defective flue, PARIS IS DISAPPOINTING. A Great Demonstration With 1 out Hostilities. A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE March In a Quiet and Orderly Manner to the Tomb of Charles Han. .in A Signlfi cant Event in the History of the Third Republic Paris, Dec 8. -'The Baudin demonstration has passed off peaceably, and the government and M Floquet will claim tiiat they have won a victory because cf the good behavior the people, which only .hows their growing good sense One hundred thousand persons were in the procession which started- from the Hotel de Ville at 1.15 p.m. Tho processionists were representative of every shale of Republican, xtadical and Socialistic opinion, bus every body bore with everybody else's political creed with harmless banter and easv erood nature. The first portiaa of the procession was composed or ixambctta i-tepubiicans, who marched to the tune of the Marseillaise" and cheered the republic to the echo. The latter part was disorganized, owing to the pressure of the crowds following, which consisted mainly of the rabble, and which sang the "Marseillaise" and the "Carmagnole." A number of women joined the ranks in the heart of the city. This detracted from the serious appearance of the procession, and the crowd was afterwards inclined to make the demonstration a matter for jest, laughing and jeering at the delegates. The spectators were mostly sightseers, mak ing no display of political feeling. At the corner of the Boulevard St. Denis the students' delegation, which was greeted with cries of "Vive la Republique !" responded with "A bas Boulanger !" The appearance of a group composed of persons proscribed in the coup d'etat of 1851, or wounded in the revolution of 184s, everywhere elicited fer vent cheers. The police stopped all carriage traffic alone: the line of the procession an hour before the start was made. Nothing occurred that im peded the march of the parade. On passing the .Northern railway station there were cries of "Vive la Republique'." mingled with hissing. On the Boulevard Magenta a man who tried to break through the line of paraders was arrested. At the tomb Republican wreaths wen.- placed side by side with Communists' flowers. Delegates from the Deputies Union of the Left and the Republican Union and from the Republican Left of the senate, not wishing to take part in the municipal procession, arrived in separate groups and placed wreaths at the foot of the monument. All Frenchmen seemed to be brothers, and the result may be characterised as a distinct suc cess for the lovers of law and order and a revelation of the strength of the third re public The oration at the tomb was delivered by M. Dariot, president of the municipal coun cil. He said that the object of the demon stration was to commemorate Baudin's in trepid defense of the republic's rights against Csesarism,- and to honor those who had been proscribed or had fallen at the time of the coup d'etat. After a vigorous attack upon Boulangism, he said: "The democracy, ac quiring renewed strength in the example of the glorious dead, is prepared to face Csesar ism. which is again daring to rise its head Comforted by the noble memories of the past, let us unite with confidence." The procession filed past the monument and then returned, singing the "Marseillaise." In the evening the city resumed its normal aspect. The absolute abstentation of the Boulan gists is the subject of animated discussion, and the people draw from it conclusions which are very strongly colored with party prejudice and personal bias. To those accustomed to the tumultuous scenes of Parisian political life the tranquil ity, one might say the apathy, of the specta tors was the subject of astonished comment, and furnished a riddle which will find many opposite solutions. . On the return of the procession to the Quartier Latin a crowd of students attacked two omnibuses filled with Bouangists. The horse3 became frightened and .one vehicle waa backed into a shop in the Quai Voltaire. A serious scuffle followed and the police were compelled to interfere Death of State Senator Low. New York, Dec. 3. State Senator Henry K. Low. who was the chairman of the rail road committee of the senate that unearthed the secrets of the Broadway railroad scandal, in 1880, is dead. He died on Saturday in Dr. E. P. Miller's sanitarium, at 41 West Twenty sixth street, where he had been under treat ment for several months for a complication of kidney and bladder troubles. Mr. Low was born at Fallsburg, Sullivan county, in 183G. His great-grandfather of the same name was a hero of the revolution, and the first assemblyman from the county.

I recall many meetings of the benevolent society in contrast with this. It was formerly the habit to hold these anni versary meetings on the evening of Thanks giving day. Many of them in the earlier years of my recollection were but sparsely attended. Perhaps this was the result of the lethargy of overfeeding on Thanks giving day, for notwithstanding the sparse attendance which sometimes reward the invitation of the society to its anniversary. there has always been, 1 believe, a very wide spread and deep interest in the work of this benevolent organization. I congratulate the city of Indianapolis upon this magnificent demonstration of the fact that its people are not absorbed simply m trade, that their hearts are not wholly given to things that pertain to selfishness, but liberality and benevolence's friendly disposition to help the unfortunate is as characteristic of our city as its interprise in the lines of trade."
