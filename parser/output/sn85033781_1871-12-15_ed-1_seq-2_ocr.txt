In tho Senate, on the 5th inst., tho business was of no general importance ; various bills were introduced and referred, and a number of resolutions ollered and adopted. The bill declaring the meaning of the eight-hour law came up, but beforo action was taken the Senate adjourned. In the House, on the 5th, there was a con siderable amount of business done.

Correspondence of tho New York World. Tho mysteries of Paris aro endless. If any day you go to Pero la Chaise and quit boulevard Voltairo (ex Boulevard du Princo Kugeno) for Hue liampon you will see a mansion which was probably built in the eighteenth century for tho retreat of some wealthy farmer-general of tho taxes while enjoying the honey moon of his last amour beforo custom had staled her novelty. There was moro than a court, 'twas a garden in front of it, and a larger garden stood behind it. There are still a great many market gardens in this north-eastern quarter of Paris, which is farther from the heart and brain of this capital than Versailles or St. (Jermain, or even Mantes, the farthest of our suburban homes. Solitary as this mansion was it ap peared still more solitary from its want of animation. The door never opened. The shutters remained closed ; tho gar dens were overrun by weeds. All these things would have atti acted little atten tion. There is many a deserted houso in Paris whose very sight at summer's noontide would freeze your marrow, so dark aro tho walls, so moss-grown aro tho doors and shutters, so desolate, so mournful, is tho look of everything about it. . You might disbelieve in ghosts and still be unable to shake oil" belief that there ghosts (old masters and the guests of auld lang syne) re vived departed hours, holding revel from midnight to cockcrow, and witches kept unhallowed saturnalia. There aro so many of these deserted, haunted houses in Paris, the f ombre cloud which rested on the house in Hue liampon had remained unnoticed, except for the change which came over it at night and if this change had been well ascer tained, eertain it would have remained unchallenged ; but some people swore lights had been seen Hashing through the interstices of the shutters, sparks had been seen Hying out of the chim neys, and the roar of subdued voices (noisy despite every precaution, because they were numerous) had been heard. Then watch was set, and neither sight nor sounds met watchers' eyes or ears. Again people saw and heard all those things. Women crossed themselves whenever the unhallowed house was thought on; men talked of it with bated breath and looked at it only ask ance. Some said it was La Tour de Nesies. Girls were decoyed into it, rav ished, and murdered when lust cooled. Others were sure a gang of counterfeit ers pre ared there fae similes of bank notes. These surmises in time reached tho ears of the police. Investigation was made in the cautious tentative method always adopted in doubtful cir cumstances. The police has good rea son to be cautious ; for it is not enough to detect crime, criminals should bo ar rested. To give notice of investigations on foot would be to give a warning which would put to flight all the birds of prey. The enigma seemed insolvable. The expertest policemen were ordered to examine the premises. Nothing could be discovered. Tho neighboring bowses were examined from top to bottom. Nothing. Walls were sounded, still nothing. Nevertheless occasionally a gleam of light flashed through some crevice in a shutter, a spark Hew up wards from a chimney, revealing lite within the bleak house. The police were reinforced. The house was sur rounded, skirmishers were thrown out beyond this circle of policemen. At last a skirmisher, thrown out some two hun dred and fifty yards from the house, reported that he had seen people who moved cautiously and rapidly about midnight, disappear in a blind alley as if the earth had swallowed them. This alky was examined. In it the police discovered a subterranean passage. They entered it. It was so low they could advance only in single fib4 and bent double. They were obliged at some places to go on all-fours. After going m this way two hundred and fifty yards they found further pro gress checked by a stalwart wrought iron door, which jeered all their ellbrts. They returned. Kntered a house whose blank walls had a small window on tin. fourth story which overlooked the gar den ol the bleak house. J fie police procured a rope, entered this house and after securing the rope inside the house and tossing the other end into the gar den, they crept down the rope one by one. Their investigation of the house showed every door and window plated with wrou!ht-iron. J tie commissioner of Police remembered one of his police men was oncea blacksmith. lie ordered this brawny fellow to get the largest sledge-hammer he could procure. When he returned he swung the immense hammer over his head and brought it on the door with a force which splin tered the wood, started the bolts and broke tho locks. Bang! bang! came two other blows, loud as thunderclaps. The door was open. The police swarmed in. 'Twas a great gambling-house. Many gamblers, terrified at the sounds of the hammer, lay fainting on the floor. Specific for Diphtheria. The Italian journals publish a letter from Dr. Giovanni Calligara, describing the remarkable success which has at tended his treatment of diphtheria with phenic acid. He relates tho losses he formerly experienced among his patients when treating them with emollients, solvents, and cauterization with hydro chloric acid, and observes that this cauterization can no moro eradicate the morbid principle than tearing the leaves off a plant will destroy the root. lie now simply uses a gargle of phenic acid and distilled water, with external appli cations of now flannel: the food and drink to be taken cold. After the adoption of this treatment, Dr. Calligari lost but one patient out of fifty-eight. Ho requested tho Italian journals to publish this discovery. Phenic acid is the agent which is now being used in this country as a remedy for cancer, and seems likely to elfcct an immense saving of lives formerly hopelessly sac rificed to that disease. An atndicant for the nosition of do- , ii i - mestic in a Danburv fainilv was asked if she knew how to use kerosene. " Use it, is it?" sho exclaimed in a tone of reproachful resignation, "give mo a can of karyosane and I'd never ask for the lift of a shavin." She was not engaged. A panhv on shore is discustinir. but a swell of the sea is sickening. A Fatal Hunt. Another instance of the pitcher going once too often to the well has occurred in India. Captain Doig, an infantry ollicer, had become renowned as a tiger hunter, and the fame of his exploits had even reached Europe. He was sup posed to bo invincible, had performed almost fabulous feats, and was held by tho natives to bear a charmed life. The 1oor gentleman was notwithstanding, tilled by a tiger early in September. Ho went out one day and had a brilliant success, slaying a fine tiger single-handed. Tour or live days after news canitt that another tiger was lurk ing in the same place, about six miles from the cantonment. Tho new arri val at once began to distinguish himself by slaughtering bullock-1, and Captain Doig resolved to bring his sport to an end. Unaccompanied save by his own " Shikaries," the hunter repaired to the spot. The savage beast was soon found, and Captain Doig got rather a long shot at him, and felt sure that ho had hit him in tho head. His impression, how ever, was that the tiger had got off into tho jungle not much hurt, and that he must beat again for him in a fresh quar ter. While preparing to do this, Cap tain Doig being at the moment alone, the enraged animal leaped from cover, and in an instant seized his foe and bore him to the earth. Captain Doig afterward said that the onset was to swift that he never even saw the beast until he himself was on the ground, and being, as he expressed it, " calmly eaten." A horrible strugglo ensued, tho "Shikaries" sprang to the rescue, and the interpid hunter actually fought himself out of the tiger's clutches, and not only that but managed to destroy him. The encounter was nevertheless fatal. Captain Doig had the pluck to ride back to the cantonment, being lifted to tho saddle for that purpose. But he never recovered from tho shock and the frightful laceration he received, and five days after breathed his last. For men who get celebrated for this kind of achievement its pursuit seems to have irresistiblo fascination, and the sad case of Captain Doig has many precedents. A (ierinan Fable. A raven was crossing a field and saw a cuckoo preparing a soft bed behind a shady bush. That seemed very odd to him ; so he crept nearer and asked the cuckoo what he was making there? " A bed, as you see," the cuckoo an swered shortly. u A bed, what for?" the raven kept on inquiring, " You are not going to lie on the ground? As far as I know, you usually rest in. a hollow tree." " It is not for myself," replied tho cuckoo, "but for that poor sick hen there, you see behind the bushes. See that poor creature," he continued weep ing, "she fills my soul with pity; she has not been well for a long tiine." " Really an odd kind of neighborly love. 1 could never in the least have expected that of you," the raven cried in an ecstasy ; and the bright tears floated down his raven cheeks, at the thought of this noble deed. "Yes," tho cuckoo continued in a whining tone, " this good hen laid me early every day, an egg; upon that I have hithertoo lived when I could get at nothing else, and how miserable I should be if she should die ! I must perish. Yes, must starve in these famine times." "Aha, so! It is not precisely for the poor sick hen, but for the eggs you make the nest," croaked the raven, as quickly drying her tears she flew away. Ice-Cnivu Pork. The Cincinnati Price Current, under the heading of " Provision Trade lie volution," gives some interesting in formation concerning the growth of a new industry the ice-curing of pork in the summer which it says is making " great breaches" in the packing trade. According to this trade journal, it may almost be said that it is not longer ne cessary to pack and lay aside meal in winter at all, any more than at any other season; there being, however, a few weeks in the heated term of sum mer when it is not necessary nor desir able to handle or use much meat. Swine are fattened more conveniently and more economically in fall weather, and then transportation can be done twenty per cent, cheaper. Fresh ice cured meat is brighter, sweeter, and sells higher for several of the leading qualities than the dry, highly salted winter-cured. Ice-hou.es have been constructed at many Western points, where packing continues constantly and safely all summer. The extra cost of cold air from ice is being rapidly re duced, and is already counting less than the expense of holding meat over from winter to summer. This state of affairs has completely upset the old business by which the wealth of the pork-packing business has been acquired. And the article concludes with the remark that "the last winter's packing stock has lately been selling at a loss of some forty per cent." Well Informed Ladies. How much moro intelligent and fascinating the majority of young ladies would be were they to give a littlo more attention to newspaper reading. We do not mean the flash papers of tho day which are filled with matter which, if it does no harm, can certainly do no good, but to newspar ers those which make us familiar with present character and improvements of tho age. It is well enough to know something of the world's history, but it is with the pros ent wo have mainly to deal, and we know of no more engaging trait in a lady's character than a fair acquain tance with passing events. Every young lady should have an intelligent opinion on tho moral, mental, political and religious subjects of tho times, and the best and indeed tho only way to find this, is to read good newspapers diligently. Detection of Flsil Oil. Tho exis tence Of fusil oil in nleobnlin 1 can, it is said, bo readily recognized by placing a portion in a class tube, nml shaking up in it a piece of iodide of potassium, siiould thero be even one fifth of one hundred Per cent, of fnil oil contained in the liquid, a distinct ngnt yenow color will be developed, tho change taking place with still grea ter rapidity if tho tube be heated. , Farm and (.anion. Hepair and Cure ff Implements. As soon as plowing is over for tho season, it is advisable not to leave the plow in tho furrow or lyin looo on the head land, but to bring it home and house it as carefully as though it were alive, and would sutler from the inclemencies of the winter weather. In fact it will sutler, and so will tho farmer's pocket, if it is exposed to tho rains and frosts. Before it is stowed away in a dry place, it should be washed and scoured, and, when dry, coated with hot boiled linseed oil. This will penetrate the pores not only of the wood but the iron, and pre serve the one fiom dry-rot and "powder-post" (borers which destroy dry wood), uud the other from rust. If rakes, forks, scythesnaths, cradles, etc., aro thus treated, their elasticity is pre served and their durability increased. Cost of liaising Calves. There are many operations on tho farm that are unprofitable in themselves directly, but we can not avoid them, we must credit them with a share of the profit they in dividually produce. Take, for example, raising calves. Mre viust raise them, and yet no' farmer expects to realize tho cost of a yearling if sold as such ; but when the yearling becomes a cow the profit comes in. Nor is it necessary to feed ten quarts of new milk to a calf daily for 100 days, at a cost of fifty dollars. A farmer who does so (if there are any such) is simply no farmer. He may be an amateur or a fancy stock man, who counts no cost. We never fed a calf new milk for longer than a week, after which skimmed milk, warmed at first, with a little linseed meal, was successfully substituted. The Cost of Weals. If there is one thing moro than another to which a farmer should feel a strong antipathy, it is a weed. Not only do weeds injure tho appearance of his farm, but their production costs an enormous amount of money. There is no doubt at all but that our crops would bo doubled in amount if we could keep down the weeds. They thus cost the country in two years an amount equal to the whole of our national debt. An experiment made by a knoted English farmer gave as the result ot a crop of barley on good soil, well manured, thirteen bush els on unweeded land, and twenty-eight bushels where the crop was weeded. Were similar experiments made on our farms, who can doubt that similar re sults would happen ? Florida Agriculture. The agriculture of this State seems to be in a bad way. It is stated that the sorghum raised there is of the poorest kind, the plant not reaching a height of more than three feet. And now complaints are made of the yield of cotton. So de generated has the crop become that it requires seven pounds of seed cotton to make one lint. Some of the bolls are entirely barren of lint, producing only seed. And the farmers of the " Flowery State" cry for better seed. In States not so flowery, when farmers know they want better seed they get it, and our Florida brothers must learn to do the same. Seed which has continuously occupied tho same ground degenerates, whether of cotton or of grain. Warm Cellars. A correspondent writes: i If any of our readers wish to keep their cellars warm not warm enough to eat and sleep in, but warm enough to preserve their stores of roots from frost they can find no better way of doing it than by pasting four or five thicknesses of brown paper, or old newspaper, against the walls, and across the joists of the floor above. All cracks and openings in the windows should also bo carefully pasted up. It will not be found an easy thing to fasten paper to stone walls, but it plenty of good, strong paste is used, and the walls are well swept down previously, it can be done, and the difficulty will only be with the first thickness. Paper, and old paper in particular, has never had its proper degree of credit, and if we knew how valuable it was we would seldom kindle our fires with it if any thing else was to be had. It is an ex cellent non-conductor of heat, and when well made and of average thick ness it is among those substances which air finds it very difficult to penetrate. Whenever, then, we wish to keep in heat and keep out air, our old papers will come admirably into play. Many a poor man has shivered through a cold winter night, when in his room there were old newspapers enough, if spread beneath his miserable covering, to have kept him warm and comfortable." How to Get Good Eggs. There is a vast difference in the flavor of eggs, liens fed on clean, sound grain, and kept on a clean grass run, give much finer flavored eggs than hens do that have access to stables and manure heaps and eat all kinds of filthy food. liens feeding on fish and onions flavor their eggs accordingly tho same as cows eat ing onions, or cabbage, or drinking ollensive water imparts a bad taste to milk and butter. Tho richer the food the higher the color of the eggs. Wheat and corn give the best color, whilo feeding them on buckwheat cakes makes the eggs colorless, rendering them unfit for some confectionery pur poses. Seed Corn. Ears of corn that have been selected for seed should be hung up in a dry, cool place. Taken promis cuously from the crib in tho spring, it is more than likely that the majority of the grains will havo become injured and unfit for seed, and then the white grubs, cut-worms, and crows will be accused of destroying the young shoots, which really never existed. Thero is no bet ter place to hang up the seed-ears than in tho top of tho crib, where rats or mice cannot reach them, and where a constant current of air is passing. If we would improve our corn, we must select tho seed as well as give it good cultivation. Charcoal or Earth for Hogs. Hogs that aro put up to fatten, as well as store hogs, should have some charcoal or earth given them occasionally. We havo found it a good plan to dig a few sods from tho fence corners for them, which they will consume with much relish. In a state of nature, tho hog, which roots for his living, must neces sarily take into his Momach a largo quantity of earth. It is advisablo to allow him to do this when penned up. Economy in Fattening Animals. It has been proved by experiment that tho more rapidly an animal is fattened the less quantity of food is necessary to sustain its mere vitality. Thus, an ani mal can bo more cheaply fattened by consuming ten bushels of corn in two months than if four months were oecu pied in tho process. Liberal and abun dant feeding is tho most economical, and a saving of time in producing the same result is a gain in the profit. llural Life. Statistics teach us that farmers live longer lives than any other class who perform labor of a mechanical kind, ami that they are excelled in longevity only by those who work with the brain occasionally, as preachers, orators, and public speaker-'. And the probability is that considering tho healthfulness of their employment and the general freedom from annoying cares and anxieties which they enjoy, their, lives might become relatively the most enduring, did they exercise more care in choosing their diet and in pre serving themselves from sudden chills during tho most trying season of their labor, that of harvest. It is then that most farmers contract diseases which aro sooner or later fatal to them. Spreading Manure. We think it a wrong practice, when hauling out ma nure in the fall or winter, to place it in heaps. It is better to spread it at once. In tho first place, labor is saved. But most important of all is the fact that much of the 'manure ii waited when placed in heaps. If spread at once, it is more equally divided than it can be afterwards. Wo once hauled out ma nure on to a field, leaving it in heaps until the hauling was completed. Dur ing this timo some showers fell. The land was sown to oats next spring, and on the spots where the heaps had been the grain lodged and was spoiled. The following crop was wheat, and on those spots the wheat rusted and yielded nothing; whilo tho growth of straw was remarkable. We have never since re peated the practice. Simple Cure for Hurns. A varnisher of metals, in Paris, one day got his hand badly burned, and in his agony thrust it into a pot of varnish at his side. To his astonishment the pain at once ceased, and the wound rapidly healed.
